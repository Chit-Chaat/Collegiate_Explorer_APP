Sophomore,5,My overall experience with Tyler Junior College over the past 6 years has been fulfilling. I have enjoyed the professors and my peers. The classes really challenge my mind.  I am going for my nursing degree.
Sophomore,5,I have taking about 10 classes online. The classes are easy to follow along with online. The professors are always available to make sure that have everything I need and they always answer my questions promptly
Sophomore,5,"When I came down to Tyler, Texas. I was looking to go to school and the first school that popped up was Tyler Junior College. The cost of attendence is fairly acceptable and is able to paid off easier. Going to a community college save you a lot of money when it comes to getting a degree. Although they too provide a two year schooling and you can transfer to a university to your liking. This is also a great way to save money and pursue a better opportunity. I would say that the professors there, they gave their best to help students achieve and become successful. It was a blessing to save a lot of money when I went to Tyler Junior College. It gave me a true experience of what college should be like."
Sophomore,5,"When taking online classes during the semesters, there is a lot of work, but the professors give you almost a month to work on it. It really depends on your schedule.  Most of the assignments I believe can be done within a week if you give your best effort reading the syllabus and what your professor expects you to do. You have to also take account of other classes too and could easily procastinate. There are some professors that give you the benefit of taking exams at home and help you prepare for tests by reading powerpoints and textbooks. The online learning experience is very simple and can be easily navigated. There are techincal supports or the professors that can help you find or how to use the school's online website."
Freshman,5,Tyler Junior is a great 2-year school . It’s big enough if you want to meet new people and have that college lifestyle but also small enough to have that 1on1 with your professor.  Tyler Junior College is a great opportunity for people who are new to college and don’t want to be so overwhelmed. It’s the best place to be heard and be great
Sophomore,5,I loved everything from the lay out of the campus and it being small enough for walking distance to everything. The food is amazing and the professors are great. I highly recommend this college to my siblings and cousins!!

When I started to attend there, I have no idea where I need to go because I moved from Mississippi back in 2017 until I had some help to get around the place. The college itself was filled with so much student pride and seeing that made me feel like I'm one of them."
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at Tyler Junior College. The cost is by far the most attractive thing about the school. I have found my classes to be very engaging in the professors knowledgeable and interesting. I feel like this is a great transition for me before I go onto it for your college. There are many extracurricular activities to be involved in and some of the top athletic and fine art programs exist here.
Niche User,5,TJC offers high school students the ability to take courses while in high school.  I have been to the campus several times to take tests and I find the campus very helpful

Students there will make you feel at home and less nervous if this is your first time attending college.  The Cafe is nice and there is even a little gift shop and book renting place on campus.  There is even a Subway and Chik-fil-A on campus. The food is good here.
Freshman,5,I took on semester here to raise my GPA in order to be considered for transfer to Texas A&M. I had a good experience with his school. Classes were good and most of my professors were good. I got accepted to A&M and all of my classes transferred without a problem.
Freshman,5,The campus is well maintained and the staff is always helpful. The professor are engaged with students and supportive.
Freshman,5,"It would be easier if tuition was cheaper, I'm struggling to pay for it on my own. 400 dollar payments so close together is hard to come up with when the deadlines are so close."
Sophomore,5,"Tyler Junior College is a great place to further your education. I love the quality education and the affordability. The cost of tuition is 1/3 of a university. Also, with sports, clubs, and events it is extremely easy for students to get involved."

Freshman,5,My experience thus far has been great. I'm really impressed with the college. It's a beautiful campus.

Junior,5,"I have loved my experience here at TJC, specifically because of my professors here making it such a great place. One thing I would enjoy seeing become better would be some of the older buildings being taken care of better and maybe rebuilt. Another thing I would like is that the ITP program becomes one of their 4 year courses."
Niche User,5,"I have toured it many times and it seems like the perfect place to start my future at. The campus is beautiful and very welcoming; especially for incoming freshman. Most of all, the people around the area and the college are overly nice and make sure that you are well-cared for at all times. Everyone around campus cares about your education but most of all, your health."
Alum,5,My experience at TJC was a very good one. The students there were a no problem. The environment overall was well. The professors there were extremely nice and wanted us to succeed. TJC has the best programs there is to offer. The nursing and the dentistry program you should really take a good look at. The programs are awesome. Very extraordinary.
Niche User,5,"Wonderful student life, wonderful teachers and opportunities. There are countless ways for students to stay involved and healthy. The facilities are always clean and well cared for."
Sophomore,5,Enjoy my time at Tyler Junior College. The class sizes are not too large. The instructors take time in class as well as office hours to assist you if you need more information to understand your assignments. The college also offers free tutoring. The only thing I would change is more tutoring availability and more parking.
Sophomore,5,TJC has everything I have been looking for to prepare me for a future in the I.T. world. I started at a local college and did finish up a few courses but found a better curriculum here. The instuctors and staf have been very helpful to guide me through the paper work nightmare and make sure i have everything taken care of as soon as possible.
Freshman,5,Everyone was very friendly and very esthetic to help me around the campus. Very clean and well put together. Didn’t have to worry about getting lost or late to class everyone was so very helpful.
Freshman,5,TJC is a very good college. You don’t have to worry about to much. One phone call or email and you are in. If you’re not prepared they will help you. They have many majors you can choose from. TJC is just a all around great college.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student at Tyler Junior College, and it is a wonderful school and campus. I grew up in the Tyler area, so I was very familiar with the area and campus. My love for Tyler Junior College only grew when I finally became a student, resident, and Apache Belle. The professors are excellent, and will help you achieve your academic success."
Sophomore,5,"TJC is a very diverse college. Schools nationwide are starting to see the potential in TJC, not only sports wise but also academically. TJC has been around for about 90 years and with every passing year, they continue to improve buildings, educational materials, advisors, and opportunities. People tend to come back to TJC if they need to take a class like physics, chemistry, algebra, anatomy & physiology, and many other classes. TJC makes transferring very easy and not only that but they prepare you for bigger universities and advise you in your benefit, not what would benefit the schools. There are also many many clubs to join and get involved. There are many activities that happen on the campus all through fall and spring terms like sitting on the lawn and watch a movie, football games, dances, karaoke, and many more. The possibilities are endless at TJC."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, it is well kept and blooms beautifully during summer and spring. Also the professors there try their best to make sure all of their students excel in their classes."
Sophomore,5,My experience with Tyler Junior College has been amazing! I am a sophomore there and I recommend everyone going into college start here. I love how they are very spiritual about the legacy of the Apaches. They have great people there and everyone loves to help you with anything that you need. I consider Tyler Junior College my home and others will see that while attending.
Sophomore,5,I have actually enjoyed my first year at TJC. I thought it would be overwhelming with getting class times and work schedule sorted out but it was great everything went smoothly. With the advisor's help and having great lecture and lab professors I was able to focus and come out of finals feeling confident in what I'd spent months learning.
Sophomore,5,I love the historic look of the campus. It is absolutely beautiful! I love all the staff and people. Easy to find your way and make friends.
Niche User,5,everything is good  and good safety academics and everything teachers are so good teaching that what people  said I don't know if is true but I guess this is good college for me and people that wan't go to college.
Freshman,5,I like that you can get college experience without having to pay for a big price tag. It also still has a lot of the things that bug university’s have. It’s not as big so there isn’t as much stress on you. All the teachers and advisiors are very helpful in your college life. The classes are a average size so you still get the attention you need without your professor being all over the place with 100 other students in your class and your assignments get graded faster this way as well.
Freshman,5,Tyler Junior College is a very good first starter school if you are not ready to go off to a big time university. The professors are nice and they actually sit down and make sure you understand what they are teaching so you can get a good understanding. The students at Tyler Junior College are very nice to you and we never have any safety issues on campus because the campus police is always keeping a good on the campus. The campus really don’t need any changes because I feel like the campus is pretty good. They give you multiple opportunities to sign up for classes.
Freshman,5,"This college is really worth attending due to its; affordable tuition, small class sizes, lunch, and community. The tuition is ridiculously affordable, therefore proves that the saying of college is too expensive to be false. Moreover, Financial Aid and Scholarships can be used to pay off your tuition."
Freshman,5,"Although this is my first year enrolled at Tyler Junior college, and although I am only taking online courses this year, I feel already I am being given the preparation I need to follow my dream career and break into my area of interest. The campus itself has a beautifully manicured and great feats of architecture. My professors are always ready to answer any questions I may have. It resides in Tyler, Texas, which is itself a moderate town that has quite a few entertainment venues where a student can go to relax after a stressful day."
Freshman,5,Tyler Junior College is a wonderful college to attend! All the professors care about their students and want each one of them to succeed. You could not find a better Junior College than TJC.
Alum,5,My experience was great! There is nothing that I would like to change about it.  This school offers me the opportunity to take classes and still have the opportunity to work full time.
Freshman,5,"Such a wonderful environment and multiple places to go study, whether its by yourself or a group of people."
Freshman,4,"I am a very new student, so I'm still learning the system. I'd have to say though, if there were one thing I could change it would be making it easier to get ahold of someone in the admissions office. They don't typically answer the phone."
Freshman,4,"Online class is something I chose, it was not something I was forced into. I don't love the way it's set up, but then again, I don't love college."
Freshman,4,After walking around campus and seeing how pristine the campus is I became thrilled when I received my acceptance letter.
Freshman,4,"I have not yet had the opportunity to take online classes, but during this pandemic I can expect the education to be just as good as the welcoming staff."
Sophomore,4,"This is my first year in college and this college is good. Every Teacher have there own way of teaching and what I learned from this I can enable myself to study on a higher heights of my education. Most students in this college are really determined and pursue their career goals. This atmosphere is quite astonishing of how many people attend here and the landscape of the campus. Almost I forgot most programs are really amazing, put forth into studying and the results will be accomplished your journey. Overall, I would recommend this college it have many benefits such as the tuition, programs, atmosphere, diversity, and determination of many people."
Junior,4,Great college. Good professors. I lived on campus my first year and the dorms are nice.  They have a lot of events and organizations to get involved in! I enjoyed the experience and the atmosphere now I have graduated and moving on to a University. It was a good choice.
Junior,4,I took some classes online and had a good experience with the online professors. Taking some classes online allowed me to work part time while going to college. Online made it easy to stay in touch with the professors  and do all of my assignments through canvas. If it's your first time taking online you can take canvas orientation training.
Freshman,4,My online experience was because of covid-19 . It kind of threw everybody for a loop. But all my professor along with my peers made the transition very convenient for me and everyone else.
Sophomore,4,"Amazing junior college. Affordable classes, great professors, plenty of resources and you get a full college experience at only half the price. College life is well, the school is located in a great area and is a great adjustment if you do not feel comfortable immediately going to a big four year university."
Sophomore,4,"For online courses, depending on the professors, they want to help you succeed. If you are having issues in a certain area or subject, there are resources that will help you. However, choose your professors carefully especially if you go the online route. I recommend going on to Rate My Professor before choosing your professors in specific classes."
Freshman,4,My experience in my first semester of junior college was great.  I met a lot of new people  that became good friends.  I missed my family but my friends made me feel like family.  My professors and advisors  helped me a lot during this pandemic.  I will be continuing my education this fall.
Freshman,4,"I’ve been taking online classes, and so far,  they’ve made everything easier for me to understand.  I only rate this a 4 star because I haven’t actually been in campus due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  But It is a great school so far.  I do plan on transferring, but I’m going here because it was too much trouble to get into the other college."
Graduate Student,4,I want to start by saying the campus is beautiful with plenty of activities for students to do. The staff is awesome especially the advisors they guide you along the way.
Freshman,4,The campus is very beautiful. One of the largest junior colleges in the nation. Parking is very limited. Most classes are still small so you can get a more personal education. Many students are going for healthcare careers.
Sophomore,4,"Tyler Junior College is big and small, being in the honors program and having to take their classes has made some classes easier by being a small classroom size. It’s diverse and it’s overall fun because of the people around."
Sophomore,4,"When I attended Tyler Junior College my freshman year, the current students greeted everyone nicely and they frequently have events that are tons of fun. Every now and then they would rent out some bounce houses and hold special events and even gave away craw fish all for free! For the most part, the professors are extraordinary and I really felt like I learned something that I would actually use and not forget. Like all campuses, there are some downsides. The cafe food is not that good, but there aren't really any other food options. Also when it rains, it floods. I am currently in my last semester here and I have loved it and built lasting relationships with my professors and new friends I've made along the way."
Sophomore,4,Tyler Junior College has very good faculty and staff that want to see their students succeed. TJC also has lots of clubs and organizations that make it easy to get involved on campus and meet new people. One of the only flaws of Tyler Junior College is the IT department. It can be very difficult at times to get hold of someone on the phone when students need help navigating TJC's website or are having network issues.
Freshman,4,TJC is a good little college to go when you want to stay close to home. They are a big college that is spread across the city of Tyler. There isn’t anything I would change.
Sophomore,4,"With success comes challenges. Tyler Jr College is a community college, but they do challenge you when working towards your degree plan. The amount of homework can be overwhelming, but there's light at the end of the semester. Great Professors & their understanding as well. I took English 1301 & General Psychology as well. I hope this review help you decide on what community college is a great fit for you. Note: You can use rate my professor as a way to review your instructor as well, before you decide. Which in fact helped me out greatly."
Alum,4,It is a very big campus for it to be a junior college. It always has events going on and campus life so you will enjoy it.
Freshman,4,My overall experience have been a challenging adjustment from high school to college life. I did find there is alot of great support if you are willing to be open to new experiences. I was glad to be able to be a part of the athletic team with the winning soccer team.
Alum,4,Tyler junior college is average size. This school has some really great professors like Larry Pilgrim. This school also has a few professors that don’t seem to care. This school has a crazy problem with drugs and safety. This school can prepare you for transferring to a 4 year university if you take your college classes serious. I felt the classes where pretty easy and that the professors where there to really teach the students. If you choose to commit yourself to doing well in class you will. This can be a great place to kick your GPA up a few points.
Freshman,4,"My experience with Tyler Junior College so far has been great. I do classes online, but the few times I have been at the campus has been good. The campus it's self is gorgeous and everyone is so friendly and helpful. Even over the phone."
Freshman,4,"Freshman on campus, honors program is amazing, professors are fun with dedication to their materials."
Freshman,4,"As i'm only a freshman, i'm not sure about a lot of things but it looks good so far.
The campus looks good, the local area is nice, and what i've seen from the dorms they're pretty nice."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school to start college at! It's quite affordable and it has a lot of organizations and activities. However, safety is not the best and they have an open carry policy. Most of the professors I have taken are absolutely wonderful! Diversity at the school seems lower than usual, it kind of feels like a PWI at times. Athletics are amazing, especially their Tennis team! Dorms are affordable, but there are issues with housing staff. Overall, very good college!"
Niche User,4,"Everyone is nice, supportive and very economic. As a high school student, I have been applying for scholarships, and have been taking my TSI and all the professors and staff are very concerned and help student that they never seen before, but still enjoy helping with kindness and passion towards the students attending in Tyler Junior College."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful. Everyone there is out going and friendly. They make sure to make your college experience worth it.
Sophomore,4,"I think TJC is a very down-to-earth campus, that really feels more like a home than anything else. The longer you are there, the more cozy it becomes."
Junior,4,"I like the personalized attention the instructor provides the student. I have been fortunate to have instructors who are willing to work with you if there is an emergency or illness. Additionally, I feel I learned a great deal with regard to the subject matter I will be working with. Mrs. Deborah Welch, my accounting teacher, is very informative and concise with her discourse in class."
Sophomore,4,Tyler Junior College has given me a very pleasant experience with college and the staff is always very accommodating to a person's personal life should something come up.
Sophomore,4,"I just started attending TJC this past summer. I have liked all of my teachers so far. I like the campus, but the buildings are very outdated. I've like everything so far about them except the financial aid. It took them forever to do my paperwork. I finished my FAFSA in February and I didn't receive my financial aid until the end of June. They don't give you your financial aid until you pay for your class, and I don't like that. If we were able to pay for our classes, we wouldn't be applying for financial aid in the first place."
Junior,4,Tyler Junior College/TJC is a great place to receive an associate degree. TJC has over 120 degree/certificate options from nursing to veterinary technician. I really learned a lot as a student there and I would encourage anyone to browse their website for further information.
Sophomore,4,Tyler Junior College was a great start to my education and overall journey as an up and coming adult.
Alum,4,"Personally, i really liked Tyler Junior College. I didn't get involved much with school activities or organizations but some of the professors were extremely helpful. The advisers were patient and understood what I needed. I did have one precalculus professor that was extremely rude and made it clear that she believes shes better than you. Other than that one professor at TJC, my experience there was great."
Graduate Student,4,"Tyler Junior College was a wonderful way to transition from high school to college. The professors are great, and the atmosphere there is pretty relaxed and friendly. However, if there is something you have to go through admissions for, or anything like that, they're really slow. Their website is easy to navigate, and well put together, but their wifi needs some serious work!"
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience with TJC is a good one. It's my first semester so I can't say much, but so far my professors are great and teach the content well. There's been plenty of activities this month because an arts festival has been going on. I've made plenty of friends here and this campus is pretty diverse in people."
Niche User,4,"I like that the campus is very big and has food places on it! I also have my family that goes to the school and met some other people that is going there or already there. I feel at home when i walk on campus and look around at everything, and when i met the teachers i felt like i could connect with them on alot of levels."
Freshman,4,"For the most part I enjoyed attending TJC. My first semester was a breeze, the advisors were great, and the teachers were well educated. I did have some issues with the school during my second semester when they made a major mistake with my financial aid. However, they did resolve the issue."
Sophomore,4,"TJC is honestly a great place. I think it is one of the top junior colleges in the nation. I came to TJC because I was offered an academic scholarship. It was not my first choice but it was free so I decided to pursue it. Wrapping up my last semester here at TJC, I am very thankful that I chose to come here. TJC  is an excellent stepping stone for students straight out of high school. It is a great place to get acclimated to the college lifestyle. The professors, especially the honors professors, are top notch. They are very concerned with the success of each student and do their best to make sure they are successful."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year but I honestly really enjoy it. I live off campus and have been in this town for years so I know and understand that Tyler has a rep for being kind of boring and for good reason but Tyler Junior College is a great community college. The students are involved and there is always a lot going on if you are into that. There is so much diversity which to me is always a bonus and the academics are good. With most classes it's challenging enough to make you learn but it's still reachable. The professors are helpful and engaging, they are always open to you and there are a lot of resources on campus for all kinds of needs."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the fact that the specific degree I wanted to purse was offered here and locally, none of that ""This is the closest we have to that"" nonsense."
Sophomore,4,"Great school as as starting ground or launching pad for your career, small and easy access. The administration people that work there are not very helpful at all whatsoever though."
Sophomore,4,"Tyler junior college is an affordability college where every individual has a chance to learn and grow. Professors are willing to help in every way to help us succeed in our careers. If you want to achieve your goals and dreams, I belie TJC is the best place for you to start with."
Graduate Student,4,"Tyler Junior College is an affordable college with a quality education in many fields of study. I have used this institution to jump-start my career, I think it is the best introduction to a student as far as college."
Freshman,4,"So far, my college experience at Tyler Junior College has been great. The professors are great and the students are great as well. The campus is always busy with things to do, and there is always someone willing to help you if need be. I am a medical major and plan on going into the nursing field. TJC has been a huge help with getting me ready and teaching me all the things I am going to need to know. Would more than likely recommend TJC to other people as a go to first time college. TJC has plenty to be involved with, from academics-sports-all the way to things that are just fun. I'd say if you are ready to start your college career and want to have fun to then come to TJC and get signed up for classes."
Sophomore,4,I’ve had a great experience at Tyler junior college. All the professors are great and nice. All the employees on campus are eager to help you. The only problem I have had is I don’t always get the professor I sign up for.
Freshman,4,Everyone is super nice and very helpful. The campus is big but its not so big that is it overwhelming.
Freshman,4,Has great professors that are willing to help if your struggling. Great small little campus. The tuition is low and affordable
Sophomore,4,"Tyler Junior College is a very good school. You wouldn't even know that you weren't attending a university if it hadn't been for the name. The student life is thriving and there's so many different ways you can get involved and make the most of your college experience. If I could change anything, it would be giving better knowledge to the academic advisers about the more major-specific classes. I've been steered wrong a time or two from them but thankfully, I was able to figure it out myself."
Niche User,4,The tour was amazing. I went with my schools HOSA club. The department heads were very informative and nice.
Freshman,4,"Tyler Junior College seems great so far. It's even better when you visit the campus. They have wonderful school traditions and the Apache Chiefs are very helpful. On another note, they make sure you take care of your work and keep you updated with campus life. Only thing that needs to change is it to be a university. It's big enough to be on!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Tyler Junior College was better than I had expected. My first time attending the school was for their new student orientation over the summer. I was nervous but the staff were very welcoming and had fun activities for the students to interact with each other. When the semester started, the staff kept a positive environment in and outside of the classroom. I liked the activities they organized throughout the year for students to participate in before and after class. My professors were nice, understanding when it comes to unexpected situations, and taught well. I would like to see change in their cafeteria food, their oldest dorm halls to at least have the ability to control the thermostat, and lower bookstore prices."
Sophomore,4,Last year was my freshman year. I am returning this semester as a sophomore. I enjoyed my time in Tyler and TJC is a great school too start at.
Junior,4,"I love TJC! The professors are amazing, however if you are using Financial Aud it's a little confusing."
Alum,4,I loved all of my classes and most of my professors. The administration office is a complete joke though. Definitely set aside a day if you ever have any financial aid questions.
Junior,4,I love the new nursing and health science building they have built for students. It is very modern and great for learning. I wish they would increase the safety of the students.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently about to start my second semester at TJC and I don't have anything bad to say about it. It is not a big school, so if that is what you're looking for, you should go there. Everyone is willing to help and is very nice too."
Sophomore,4,The classes are overall Great. the campus is beauitful. student like is hands down amaizng but when it comes to the Financial aid office they are the are worse
Freshman,4,"My experience at Tyler Junior College has been an unexpectedly wonderful one. At first I was hesitant to attend a junior school in my hometown since I had my sights on attending a four year university far from home. However, life pushed me towards Tyler Junior College. Living on this campus has exposed me to different types of people from surprisingly all over the world. I also made relationships with very inspirational professors and I became active in the Baptist Student Ministry on campus. If I hadn't made the decision to attend this school, I would have never had the experiences I received at Tyler Junior College."
Freshman,2,It’s hard to get motivation when classes are online. Physically going to classes and listening to the teacher is easier to learn.
Freshman,2,Although yes TJC can be affordable and easy to get into sometimes they are the best option. I wish they had payment plans for previous semester balances.
Freshman,2,For my first year of college it was great! One thing I would say to look out for is the unreasonable fees. The food was for the most part decent but not worth the money.
College Junior,2,I didn't get near the amount I should have.
College Junior,2,Its bad if you dont stay in tyler
College Sophomore,2,"Being able to connect your laptop to the wifi doesn't work at all. You will be ""connected"", but being able to get on the internet doesn't work or is too slow to work at all times."
College Sophomore,2,The financial Aid office wasn't friendly or helpful at all. They just give general answers to any questions you have that usually don't help at all.
College Senior,2,"I am not a fan of online classes. It might be amazing to someone else, but as a student I need the classroom environment to learn. It is hard for me to stay focused to a computer screen rather than a teacher."
College Junior,2,The Wifi is horrible. There is none in most of the dorms and even the wifi in the library isn't reliable  
College Junior,2,They need more efficient people or more prepared to answer your quiestions because they don't make the process
Recent Alumnus,2,The hardest thing to do is meet with an advisor. You have to wait at least an hour for them to give you the WRONG information. They told me to take half of the wrong classes for my major that now won't transfer to my University.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not helpful at all...they don't seem to care.
College Senior,2,"The only two complaints that I realy have about the tuition and fees is:
1) I live about 10-15 miles outside of the TJC school district yet I have (and still do) work within the TJC school district yet I continue to have to pay out of district school fees which are a lot more then in district.
2) I also take more online classes then campus class - like this semester I'm not going to campus with exception of test however I still have to pay the extra security fee, the on campus fee, the health fee (even though I pay for health insurance through my work) plus I pay an additional online fee - these fees add up which prevent me from adding another course to my schedule this semester.  

With financial aid, now that I have taken more classes then they allow, they say I don't qualify for loans either.  I think that the campus should be more helpful, I have circumstances that require me to work full time and take care of a disabled husband and special needs child _ I have had to take school one step at a time which has prevented me from finishing my schooling on there approved scheduled."
College Junior,2,The financial aid process at this school is the worst I have had compared to any other college. They work extremely slow and if you plan on paying for tuition with your financial aid then I suggest you apply very early in the year. I applied on time and met all deadlines and I barely received my financial aid on time. Very aggravating experience with this school.
College Sophomore,2,"Career services is  very helpful however, there are usually always so many people waiting in line that sometimes I am waiting for hours just to talk to a counsulor for twenty minutes."
College Sophomore,2,"School has been a challenge for me however, I do enjoy it because with each challenge I am becomming a stronger and wiser person. TJC has helped and is still helping me to prepare for the University lifestyle. I can truely say that TJC was the best choice to start out my college year because now I know what to expect and how I need to manage my time, money, and life."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very Bad Communication – The administration does not communicate within offices. For instance the Financial Aid office required things to be submitted but they had already been submitted to the Registrar's office.
College Senior,2,"Network Reliability – The internet access often looses connection around campus and in the dorm rooms. The teachers are very understanding when the internet is not accessible , so mostly I do rely more upon the on campus library for the best internet and printing."
College Junior,2,"Only Few Had Big Workload – Curriculum was boring and similar to high school, barely opened books to certain courses, and did little homework in others."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Value of Education – though TJC offers quality education, i still believe that their still tuition fees are a  bit on the high side"
Niche User,1,I honestly would not recommend this school. Very rude people. I’ve been on the HOLD since 3:00 and it’s 4:50. They hung up in my face several times. Absolutely rude.
College Junior,1,Took almost one Full semester to receive financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"Living Out of State – I attend a out of state community college. it had took me a month and a half for me to receive my finanical aid. which caused me to be bad up in my classes because i needed my books. They never called or email me about the things i missed or need inorder to receive fafsa. i called them many times about what i needed, but they really gave me a good answer besides, ""there still looking at."" comes to find out they never looked over my paper work until i called the person that was over them.later i receive my aid. and i used it for good use. books, supplies, food etc... I dont think my tuition should not have been that much, because of there extra development classes, that you do not get credit for. but if you fail the class you can get your fafsa tookin away. Overall try to be patient and call in check up on your money (fafsa)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Selection Policy – sometimes i would like to say that am disappointed in the way students are selected for program. it may seems free and fair, but i still have a doubt that student are selected over other non educational requirements which are not highlighted in the application process. thereby putting some students at a great disadvantage always."

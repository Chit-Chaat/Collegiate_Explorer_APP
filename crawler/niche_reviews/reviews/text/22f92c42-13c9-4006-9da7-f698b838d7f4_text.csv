Freshman,5,The smaller size of the college makes it easy to connect with professors and other students. I previously attended a large state university and I like the atmosphere of Mercy much better.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the times of day that I have class.  Due to their evening classes, I am still able to work full time."
Freshman,5,The ABSN program lasts only 12-months and is extremely affordable. I have yet to find a better price. The return on investment right now in Nursing is insane and the school does a great job preparing you for the real world. There have been many negative reviews in the past but the program has been taken over by new staff within the past two years and is much better than it used to be!
Freshman,5,"My experience at MCHS was superb! I transferred 2 years' worth of credits into my cardiac sonographer associate's degree program and had little to no hassles at all. My academic advisors, Adrienne St. Clair and Erin Moon, was always very helpful and knowledgeable and I will forever remember all of the positive experiences I had with each of my professors. This school was not easy and definitely pushes you to your limits. It is challenging and not meant for those that give up easily. I personally loved the challenge and the fact that the curriculum was rigorous to prepare me for my career in healthcare. If it were easy, the value of the education would be severely diminished. If you're looking for an easier route, I would advise you to seek a for-profit college education."
Freshman,5,I like how all the staff is willing and ready to help you with all of your possible needs.. There are conventions. and get togethers for when your stressed... or need somone to talk to .. there are tutors readily available. Its just all around a great hands on school. Classes are not huge so your professors knows you by name and will help always
Niche User,5,Excellent school of health sciences. The Administrators personnels and Instructors are wonderful. My personal experience with Mercy college of health science has shown that they care about their student and always on top of their jobs.
Freshman,5,"I am a non traditional student returning to further my nursing career. I was very nervous about the process of enrollment and registration. The staff was very friendly, and very helpful. If it wasn't for them, I probably wouldn't be returning to school."
College Student,5,Access to labs and dissections
College Student,5,I love the school. A few teachers only read bullet points off of the board but I love the actual content and knowledge taught
College Sophomore,5,"They were very accepting of transferring in all of the credits I had. I really appreciated this because the college is very expensive. Because of how small the college is, flexibiliy is limited but my counselor worked with me so I only have class twice a week so I can work other days."
College Sophomore,5,Job prospects are incredibly high because of networking done during clinicals.
College Sophomore,5,The college is directly affiliated with several hospitals and placement is very high.
College Sophomore,5,Definitely one of the most thorough nursing programs available in the Midwest.
College Junior,5,"I have had no issues with scheduling classes or getting into a class that I needed at the time or day that I needed it. I have heard from other students that if you do have a conflict, you can speak with your academic advisor and they will do everything they can to make sure that you get into the class time or section that you need so that you can work around your work or home schedule and complete your degree in the amount of time expected."
College Junior,5,"A nursing major at Mercy College of Health Sciences is a challenging and busy degree to complete, especially the Bachelor's program. I am currently in the BSN program and am required to have a minimum GPA, I am held to higher standards outside of school, and I am required to attend class and be punctual. All of these things are easy for me because of the type of person that I am but it is still good to be held accountable now so that when we are in the real world of nursing, we already know and have experience. The clinical facilities are great and have awesome professors and instructors to help us. We also have a unique opportunity since we are partnered with Mercy Hospital of Des Moines so it is likely that we will be able to get a job their upon graduation or somewhere within the CHI Health system."
College Junior,5,This school has been challenging but does a very good job at finding and hiring dedicated and experienced professionals as professors. They are there to support the students through their schooling and will go above and beyond to make sure you succeed. I was a transfer student here after my sophomore year of college and I couldn't have asked for a better school to transfer to! The small class sizes really help make the experience that much better.
College Junior,5,"Mercy college of health science is connect to mercy hospital, literally the college is two blocks away from the hospital. Most of the professors have been nurses before, so they can teach it the correct way and explain it in a hospital setting better."
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy the friendly atmosphere. The teachers are welcoming and help each and every student out with what they need. I can get the one-on-one support I need if I'm having troubles. The class sizes are small so it makes the one-on-one help a lot easier if needed. The school is easy to find and in a great area. I feel safe and wanted at this school. Everyone seems to be friendly and wants to help me.
College Junior,5,I am in the Physical Therapist Assistant program. The class size is very small which really helps with learning. We have a fun class experience and the teachers are so awesome. They make every class period fun and involve us in hands on activity. There is never a dull moment in the class! The class work is also very appropriate and does not consume all of your time but teaches you the main aspects you need to know.
College Junior,5,Everyone on the campus is super nice and all the professors are extremely passionate in what they are teaching. All the staff are encouraging and helpful no matter what your background is. The classes force you to work hard and the academic standard is high. They really take pride in making sure all students are doing the best they can.
Freshman,4,"The college was able to adapt to all online learning during COVID19 very easily. I do miss attending actual classes, but the quality of classes hasn't gone down with the introduction of online learning."
Senior,4,"I personally love MCHS. It is not like a large university so for those looking for something similar to the University of Iowa or University of Minnesota, this college isn't for you. It is smaller than Drake University and Drake is a small school. As someone who has obtained one degree already from MCHS and working on a second one, it's exciting to be back and see all of the new renovations made for the students. The lab spaces are phenomenal, the teachers are more than willing to go the extra mile for you, and the small class sizes are wonderful for learning. I do wish they had the large school amenities like the team spirit, frequent events of a large school, etc but it's nice to be able to focus on school and the quality of my education instead."
Freshman,4,The campus is very small which I like because it is easier to navagait. The dorms are recently renovated and look very nice.
Graduate Student,4,I am continuing my education at Mercy College of Healh Sciences after finishing my bachelors degree at another college. I am receiving great support in my education and enjoy the teachers and friends that I have met.
College Student,4,Some work to help you. Some don't care about you.
College Sophomore,4,The class size is very small and the professors are actually nurses and nurse practitioners.
College Sophomore,4,An expensive school but definitely a much higher quality education than pursuing a nursing degree at a place like Kaplan or a community college.
College Junior,4,"The professors that teach online classes make themselves very available whether it is through e-mail, phone calls, texting, meeting in person, or video chatting. They are there to support you through the class and want to make it as user-friendly and easy to know what is going on so that you have an understanding and can learn the material to pass the class. They want you to pass and will talk you through anything that you do not understand."
College Junior,4,"The career center and job prospects through this school are great. They are very friendly, helpful, and come in and talk to us before we need to actually know what to use them for so we have a reference for the future. It is an important part of this school and it would be silly if someone did not utilize it's services."
College Junior,4,"The value of a degree from this school is very high because it is a health sciences college. The health sciences field, especially nursing, needs more people to come onto the workforce. A bachelor's degree in nursing is becoming the more preferred and sometimes required degree for employers and getting one from Mercy College of Health Sciences and using it, especially in the Des Moines area, will most likely warrant a good job for graduating students."
College Junior,4,"I have only had one poor instructor at this school. It has been a great experience so far in the nursing program though because that professor was in the general education class list. The courses, again, are challenging but very worthwhile if you want to go into nursing. The professors are experienced nurses and most have their PhD as well as their RN."
College Junior,4,"The class sizes vary, but never over a hundred. Professors are always willing to help you learn. Courses go at a fast pace because there is a lot of information professors need to go over"
College Junior,4,"The professors expect you to know the material, so lots of self teaching and studying. Which makes you understand the material more!"
College Junior,4,you basically promised a job after you graduate.
College Junior,4,"challenging, independent and the faculty give you resources to be able to succeed. sometimes the workload can get overwhelming but their are study centers and tutoring groups to help you along the way."
College Junior,4,the classes and work load challenge you.
College Sophomore,4,I like the fact that I go to a smaller school over a University and the smaller classes. It's also about 5 minutes from my house so I live at home to save money!
College Junior,4,you have to put the effort in to study and it is possible!
College Junior,4,it is school if you put the effort in you will understand
College Junior,4,yep its friendly and easy to navigate. simple campus
College Junior,4,Career goals are strait forward and reachable
College Junior,4,I like it here I was nervous at first but happy with my choice
College Junior,4,"I am enjoying my time at mercy college, It is exceptional education and will put me far in my career"
College Junior,4,The library and the available resources is great!
College Junior,4,"It gives a very ""real-life"" experience."
College Junior,4,"It is a difficult major to get into at my school. The workload and program is challenging, but they are very up front with the students on what to expect."
College Junior,4,"The students are asked to give their feedback on the professors, which is taken into account by the school."
College Junior,4,They help students become successful in looking for future careers.
College Junior,4,"Students are very well career oriented and focused on their goals. The programs aren't easy to get into, so the students take their acceptance very serious."
College Sophomore,4,The wirless internet is really fast and always reliable. I have had no trouble with the use of or acessibility of the substantial amount of computer labs scattered across the campus. 
College Sophomore,4,Financial aid is quick and easy at Mercy College. The employees are both knowledgable and helpful when it comes to answering any questions you may have.
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are small which allows for more personal attention from teachers. Classes are easy, but so much new information is learned."
College Junior,4,"Mercy is a very hands on school. You can't enjoy what the ""normal college"" experience. You have to put forth the effort into going to school everyday and the work that comes with it. Campus life is good. There a wide range of choices for food and a place to study. Our library is great. The let you eat and drink there. They also have study rooms for a group of people to study for 3 hours a time. "
College Junior,4,The resources are great for students. Since I am a nursing major I have all the technology needed for it. There are two big computer labs that are available for students to use and there are a quit place to study. The campus is small and easy to get too. 
College Junior,4,I am a Nursing major. All of my classes are what I expected it be and more. I haven't taken anything that is irrelevant to my major. I love clinical and I learn so much from it. I workload is extremely difficult. You need to know how to manage your time wisely. 
College Junior,4,My school is contained of all people who want to work in the health care field so it is not extremely diverse. Most students work and go to school and most do not live on campus so it is not much of an interacting school besides in the classroom. It is nice to have all the same people who are trying to reach the same goal though!
College Junior,4,It is good to take online class if you are a busy person and working while attending school. It allows you to do things at your own pace and time. I got an A because I was able to work at my own pace and did not have to attend a class which I would more than likely not pay attention in. You just have to make sure you are goal oriented and can stay on track and not get distracted by outside factors. Online classes are great and allow almost anyone to get an education.
College Senior,4,"The student body isn't as diverse as I'd like in terms of culture, etc, however, it is diverse in background and age. There is a large population of women compared to men, as well."
College Senior,4,I've been very happy with classes so far. The scheduling and availability of counselors has been great.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Computer labs were mostly taken by professors and their students. But students were allowed to use the labs when classes were done. Printing on campus was easy and there were plenty of printers available in the library. The network was reliable and easy to use. If students wanted to use their personal computers, they were allowed to do so, but they just had to log on to the wireless router anywhere in the school. There was no need to have a personal printer because there were plenty of printers located throughout the school."
College Sophomore,2,"My advisor is also the lab teacher, applied teacher, program chair, and not helpful at all....Or a good teacher......"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Above Average for a Paramedic Program – I was satisfied with the college.  In comparison to other Paramedic, the knowledge taught was above average.  However, in respect to teaching Pharmacology and Medications it left a lot to be desired.  Overall from the school, the Paramedic and EMT students are treated like second-class students.  And I still had a lot of standard technology to learn when I began working as a Paramedic."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really know of our post-grad help since I'm still in school.  However, we have many clinicals that will offer us a number of opportunities to make ties to help us with our job search."
Freshman,1,"The worst college I have ever attended, quality that the staff take with student is horrible and degrading. Thank good I only attended a semester."
Senior,1,"If I could give MCHS zero stars I would. This school is a complete joke. Every nursing class is ""self taught"" in a ""flipped classroom"" setting. I'm so disgusted with the lack of caring from instructors, the lack of communication between staff members, the lack of professionalism both from staff and from students. The tour and admissions is a complete lie. Everything they tell you from day one is a lie. The BSN program gets little hands on education and the turn over rate from clinical instructors is scary. If I could take back the 50K+ that I've spent here I would start the whole thing over and ANY OTHER SCHOOL. literally, the biggest waste of time and money. I encourage anyone considering going here to consider another career or being jobless because that sounds better to me than one more day at the subpar embarrassment of a ""school""."
College Senior,1,The highest degree is a bachelors
College Freshman,1,My parents seem to have high incomes when I have to pay for my own stuff with no money. I don't get a lot of financial aid I still have a balance and not able to register for my next semester classes because of the block on my account. Extremely stressful. All I want to do is go to my classes do whatever I have to do and move on. College has been realy bad for me because of the money that I don't have . I am not accepted for loans because of my parents credit.
College Sophomore,1,the professor was not a good teacher...i dont feel i learn anything and she was not a good teacher.

Senior,5,The media department is a blessing! The library and student lounge are both well maintained. Food options on campus are inclusive and decently priced.
Senior,5,"No one was really prepared before it started, but all teachers I had adapted well. The school itself allowed adapted grades to help students who suffered due to tech or any other reason."
Sophomore,5,"Staff is very friendly and helpful, no question is stupid. They answer phone calls and emails promptly and are always professional."
Alum,5,"My professors, academic advisors, and other faculty were always helpful and encouraging. I feel that I received an excellent education at this institution."
Senior,5,"It’s a small , friendly campus , and I feel comfortable on campus. I am a pharmacy student in the guaranteed seat program and I love it. I have two more years yet at Wilkes . I love the professors and I am glad I picked Wilkes for my education."
Sophomore,5,"Wilkes has a great mix of academic rigor and social life. Many of the courses are challenging, but the wonderful professors make sure you get through. There are dozens of student clubs of all different disciplines form music, to art, to science, to card games. There is a silent party scene, just know where to look. Get to know people and you will have a great time at Wilkes!! Go Colonels!!"
Freshman,5,It's a very beautiful campus. I was afraid at first but I love all my teachers they make learning fun.
Senior,5,"Wilkes is a great academic and social atmosphere. The professors of any major are more then willing to help. Given it is a smaller school, you're given the ability to have a better relationship with the professor, enabling better understanding of the subject. It allows you to be able to have the one on one time when you are struggling."
Junior,5,I love my school. At wilkes university you get a sense of a community while learning from professors that truly want you to be your best self!
Sophomore,5,"I liked that Wilkes offered me a tight knit community with smaller classes which would allow me to know my professors, enabling me to thrive as a student-athlete. I would like to see the school grow more, student wise and add more buildings on to campus while trying to keep class numbers down."
Niche User,5,"I was quite fond of the fact that Wilkes University is a small private college, but has the education level of an Ivy League school. Not only will it feel safe and comfortable for me to attend Wilkes, but it will be beneficial to my academic career, as I strive to do great things in the future."
Sophomore,5,"Through Wilkes University, students  are not only able to obtain an academic career but they also get an opportunity to develop and sharpen their real world skills. Numerous club organizations and working opportunities give students the knowledge of hard work,  and independence. It is a great place to obtain a career."
Graduate Student,5,"My overall experience has been awesome.  The counselors are very friendly and approachable.  They are easy to talk to, and the professors are helpful and open to answering any questions.  They want to see you succeed in the classroom and outside in the real-world."
Niche User,5,"I love the environment of Wilkes University.  The school is very warm and welcoming, as soon as I stepped foot on campus I was welcomed by many.  I love that it is a small school and that every one knows each other.  The professors are very welcoming and caring, I love that they take time to learn the name of every student and will check in on you if you miss class without reporting it to them.  The campus of Wilkes University is absolutely gorgeous and the overall atmosphere is fantastic.  I love Wilkes University!"
Sophomore,5,"When I first visited Wilkes University, it was not hard to make my decision. I felt like I was at home on campus, which is a very important feeling when it comes to college. Even better though, I was offered a tuition lower than a public 4 year school due to the academic scholarships they give out!"
Senior,5,The university has wonderful housing with so many options. The atmosphere is very welcoming and it is a small campus so you get to know almost everyone on campus expecially when you’re there with them for 4 years.
Freshman,5,Wilkes is such a homey feeling University! You have a family at that school! I highly recommend this school if you aren’t looking for a huge campus. Great teachers as well! 10/10 would recommend for any freshman or transfer students.
Freshman,5,"Wilkes university is much different from other universities. It’s a small university which means that the classroom size are smaller then larger universities . Also, at the same time have almost the benefits and qualities  that larger universities have. If this sound good to you Wilkes University is for you."
Freshman,5,"One thing that I like about the campus, is that it's small. The classes are small. This way I will learn more. The professor that I meet were very easy to talk to.
They just finished building new labs where I'll be doing my experiments. I can't wait to start."
Junior,5,Wilkes University brings students together in a great environment. The education I have received here is superior to other universities in the area. The faculty and staff are always willing to work with the students in order to ensure the very best outcomes for our futures.
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere of Wilkes University.  The faculty, staff and students are all very nice and welcoming.  That was a big part in deciding which school I wanted to attend, and I'm glad I chose Wilkes.  The professors are dedicated to helping you succeed.  There are fun events on campus pretty often, so it's not boring and you do not need to go home every weekend."
Graduate Student,5,I'm currently working through the graduate admissions process for Wilkes University. The staff has been immensely supportive in providing additional information in regards to financial aid and private scholarships/loans. They've done an amazing job personalizing the experience although I'm sure they have a myriad of applicants to their MBA program each year.
Niche User,5,I liked how the professors were very helpful when i went to the open house and they answered all my questions
Junior,5,"Wilkes offers a high class education with dedicated staff and faculty.  The professors are always available for outside of class help, and most of the professors try their best to make a relationship with each student.  The campus is beautiful and constantly undergoing new development and improvement.  Connecting with campus is seamless as each club and program is more than willing to accept new team members to help organize events and bring out the colonel spirit.   The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need."
Sophomore,5,I would like to see the quality of food change in the dining hall. I hate eating there and it doesn't help when you are trying to eat healthy. I wish their food service would change for the better.
Alum,5,"Wilkes offers educational opportunities that many other universities do not. Class sizes are smaller on average and there are more opportunities for hands-on experience. If you put effort in, your professors will know you by name and help you out in many ways, even outside of the standard curriculum. I received a lot of valuable insight and feedback that aided me greatly after I graduated. They may not have the level of equipment as larger universities, but, chances are, you'll get to use what they have and gain meaningful experience from it. My first two years were at a much larger university, but I credit my current career position to my experience at Wilkes in my junior and senior years."
Freshman,5,"My professors are really patient with their students and they offer help to those who need it. The campus is really nice, the students here are really friendly and the dorms are nice. I would recommend other to attend Wilkes"
Sophomore,5,Wilkes University has helped me extremely with putting my schedule together to financial aid always having an answer to my questions.
Sophomore,5,Wilkes is a great college ! It's small classes makes it very engaging . I have great professors and classmates. My favorite class at Wilkes is integrating technology in classrooms . This class is very exciting I love learning new ideas to bring into my classroom one day.
College Junior,5,lots if security on site
College Junior,5,"Its a great school, noce setting, great professors. COurses are a bit limited compared to bigger colleges."
College Sophomore,5,"One of my favorite things about Wilkes is all of the housing options that are available.  From typical dorms, to apartments to renovated nineteenth century mansions, the options are there.  Granted, much of the freshman housing is average unless you get in the Honors Program.  After that though, most people have no problem getting into University Towers which has pretty nice three-person apartments and a few quads.  For those who want something different, all of the mansion-style housing is different.  You could have a room to yourself or with three other people. All the layouts in the mansions are different compared to the cookie-cutter Towers' apartments.  Its just preference.  Although the best, if you're super lucky, or know someone already living there, is 40 West above the YMCA.  Those apartments are the nicest on campus, but its nearly impossible to get in as they are very limited."
College Sophomore,5,"Wilkes is a small school with the wide variety of majors and programs of a much larger university.  After my first year, I am still thrilled by my decision to come here.  Attending a small school is important for students looking for close relationships with their professors.  As a mechanical engineering major, having that bond and support from professors is really beneficial.  I think the most unique thing about the school is the housing.  From typical dorm buildings to apartments, to renovated nineteenth century mansions, living in the old Wilkes-Barre setting overlooking the Susquehanna River has been enjoyable."
College Junior,5,I love all of my professors. I was not happy with the size of my first biology class but once I had gotten through that everything just fit.
College Senior,5,We have monthly std testing service events but you can go in anytime. The On campus wellness center is always helpful. The counseling services are readily available.
College Senior,5,This is such a small school but has a good group of students. There is a lot of opportunities in the community. The mascot is the colonel which is the highest ranking volunteer officer in the army. Wilkes promotes volunteerism which is something I'm passionate about. The city of Wilkes-barre itself is a little dodgy. Many shootings happen in the surrounding areas but the campus itself feels safe.
College Sophomore,5,My professors are very willing to help me succeed along with my advisor. There is a lot of offered help for any situation and you feel comfortable addressing someone about it.
College Junior,5,The Writing MFA Program is top notch.
College Student,5,Administration is responsive. Facilities are great
College Freshman,5,First Choice and not regretting a thing
College Student,5,"Wilkes University is an amazing small university focused on academic excellence, technological advancements, community building, and campus revitalization.  I couldn't be happier at Wilkes University."
College Freshman,5,This school was my first choice and is amazing.
College Student,5,The Dorm i live in is Evans and its great here. As well as my other friends dorms all the dorms are pretty nice.
College Freshman,5,They are really sweet and try there best to help you. they also recommend medicine and stuff for you.
College Sophomore,5,Came here only for scholarships
College Student,5,wide variety and great pharmacy program
College Student,5,"there are a TON of places to eat near by campus. what ever kind of food you can imagine, we have i"
College Senior,5,Eating at rifkin cafe in the student union building is excellent. The staff is very friendly and knows everyone by name or food order. The amount of service and the quality of the food is better than eating at a 5 star restaurant.
College Freshman,5,I believe the campus is very diverse and very accepting of the diversity.
College Sophomore,5,"Yet to obtain an internship, but looking forward to the opportunity it can provide"
College Sophomore,5,"Very lucky to be in a school where students are the number one priority, smaller classes offer more individual attention."
College Student,5,"Definitely worth it so you're not paying back over $10,000 a year for dorming."
College Sophomore,5,Lots of bars/clubs on the downtown square
College Sophomore,5,"Wilkes has a very active nightlife. There is an 18 and under club near by that has Thursday nights as that designated night and there are parties at the football, wrestling, and soccer houses almost every night. Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays are great party nights were you can find a party/club to go to easily."
College Freshman,5,I have lived here all of my life and I love the resutaunts near us. There is alot of variety and somethng for everyone.
College Freshman,5,The old mansions that Wilkes University owns really makes our campus different than the traditional college campus.
College Freshman,5,The campus is very live for a small school. It has a lot to offer than most small schools would.
College Sophomore,5,"Unlike almost all other universities, Wilkes actually allows freshmen students to have a car on campus which is extremely convenient. The parking garage is close to campus as well, so the walk is never an issue. There is also additional parking available in Ralston Fields, which is just a parking lot across the bridge next to the football field, but it is inconvenient to access since it's about a mile off campus. However, they do have shuttles that transport students to and from the parking lot. There is also free parking anywhere on campus on weekends, which is great for visiting friends and family. Prices for Ralston Fields runs about $40 and the UCOM Parking Garage at about $120, which gets charged directly to your account, so there is no upfront charge. Apply for a space early though, because they do run out fast!"
College Student,5,"Honestly, I do not partake in drug use, and I never have. I do not know of any dealers on campus, nor do I care."
College Freshman,5,They say it is very cheap and affordable for students plus very close to campus.
Junior,4,"Wilkes Live, an online resource similar to Google Classroom, was used as the main platform. I have taken two online classes through Wilkes, Sociology 101, and History 101. I did well in both classes, and the overall quality of the lectures were high, communication by email was high, and the overall quality of the online class was high."
Junior,4,"Wilkes University is a very good school. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and also swim for the Men's Swim team here at Wilkes. I can safely say it is a great fit for me! The family-oriented aspect and environment that the University has to offer in every area of the school is one of the main things that I was drawn to upon visiting the campus for the first few times. Family is so important to me, and at Wilkes, everyone is so welcoming and the staff is so nice and very helpful and reassuring, especially for incoming Freshman. All in all, Wilkes University has a nice family feel, great geographic location, small and beautiful campus setting, and great residence life and academic programs."
Senior,4,Many of my professors were extremely accommodating when converting to online learning. They all thankfully are young enough to understand computers and were all communicating effectively! Maybe even too much!
Senior,4,Wilkes provides a very personal experience with small classes and a small campus. The professors are mostly great and others will change your life. Dorm living is clean and comfortable. The food is varied.
Senior,4,"This school is great. I really enjoyed my 4 years here. If you are pre-med, there are pros and cons. There is a small pre-med program here, so that means you have a lot of opportunity, but not much guidance. The best advice is to get involved! It is a small campus, so it is easy to meet so many different people and make your mark on the school."
Senior,4,"My professors were very accommodating during this time. I had no problems switching over, but I have taken online courses before."
Freshman,4,A very nice university  that provides plenty of opportunities.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful.
Graduate Student,4,"I think that wilkes professors really want to see their students excel. I might change having more housing options for graduate students, because the neighborhood is a little tough."
Senior,4,"The environment is very friendly between campus. The programs are fairly good, but some of them need a bit of organization and communication between departments."
Alum,4,"I was an athlete, having the opportunity to continue playing the sport the I love was a no brainer for sure. My academic career had so many ups and downs. I changed my major and my overall plan. Wilkes helped me adjust my plan and gave me all the knowledge I need to continue on to the chapter."
Freshman,4,love how tight knit the community is. i enjoy being in class and it is never boring. professors are always are willing to help during office hours. the athletic staff is very encouraging and willing to do anything to see you succeed.
Freshman,4,"It is very easy to make friends in this environment. Most everyone is very friendly and the adults on campus really are willing to help you. The campus is just the right size, not too big or small. Their are lots of different food/eating options on campus as well as many restaurants off campus. The class sizes are small enough so that your professors get to know you but large enough to get diverse opinions when needed. This was one of the best choices I have ever made."
Freshman,4,"Wilkes is growing rapidly, which has its own issues (limited parking/dorming). If you are looking to make friends fast & easily join the Honors Program b/c we do everything together, especially since most of us are science majors. The academics can be a bit rough at times b/c, as I have observed, the average course load is 15-18 credits/semester. Some professors are amazing & some are not--freshman science majors beware. Campus itself is easy to navigate & the food is fairly good if you're not too picky. The city is quite sketchy, but you should be fine during the day. To those who say there aren't parties: there are plenty each weekend, they're just off-campus. Overall, I really love it here b/c of the tight-knit community--but that could be b/c the dorm I live in seems to be the only one where residents all get to know each other very well (Waller North = boys & Waller South = girls, connected by a 3rd floor hallway). Just know that many of the mansions have wacky heating & no AC."
Freshman,4,Teachers are accessible and willing to help. Smaller classes. Good engineering resources. Dorms could use some updating.
Alum,4,"Wilkes University was a good choice for me as I was looking for something not too far from home, smaller class sizes for more personal attention and a major program that would feel fulfilling.  All of those qualifiers were met, and then some.  While the town is small and in a state of renewal it is easy to navigate, safe and now full of lots of fun places to visit.  It’s beautiful there and I am glad that it’s where I chose to go."
Sophomore,4,"Many unique and interesting students can be found on campus at Wilkes, and the vast majority of them are friendly and welcoming to others. The professors do their best to find new ways to make lessons fun to encourage learning and they are always open to help those who need it, even if their issue is not related to academics. However, the expenses can run a bit high. Also, while there are thousands of great people to meet, a handful of less-than-nice people can still be found, though usually you don't need to worry about them."
Freshman,4,Wilkes is an amazing science school that offers a lot of opportunities and experiences for students looking to go above and beyond. It is not the best for the average college experience as everyone here is pretty studious or an underachiever.
Sophomore,4,"Wilkes Barre has been a grand place to grow up and to start a family. There is an abundance of resources and things to do. Downtown has become really elegant, and the diversity is marvelous. It has a tendency to be cheap in real-estate, and sometimes lacks culture in population, but the commute of Wilkes Barre itself often makes up for that."
Freshman,4,A small school with a great sense of community. This school maybe small but also has big opportunities. The location is sometimes scary but only 2 hours from NYC and Philly.
Freshman,4,Absolutely love the campus as a whole. There needs to be improvements with advisors working with you but overall professors are great and the people are all very friendly.
Junior,4,"Wilkes University is very costly; however, I enjoy attending this small school with many highly qualified professors. Overall, I enjoy the university."
Niche User,4,"Wilkes university is a great college in the area, it is very close to home if you live near it and it is a great environment to study and desire a higher education."
Freshman,4,"The application process was very well explained, and whoever you call with questions are very helpful. The campus is very pretty and well kept, and there is always a new project going on to improve the campus."
Sophomore,4,"Wilkes is a small school but with big opportunities. The school may not be well known for being diverse, but I think it's slowly progressing to be there! The professors here (other than the chemistry professors) are willing to help you succeed in what ever you plan to do and I am glad that most of them know me by my name rather than the color of my tee shirt. What I also like about Wilkes is the amount of tutoring is available for a lot of the courses the school has to offer and their campus food isn't all that bad compared to other universities."
Freshman,4,"School isn't that bad, some areas outside of campus are sketchy. The parking is awful because there is never any spots. The cafeteria food almost always sucks. The professors are okay."
Freshman,4,Wilkes University offers many majors and minors and also as amazing faculty who are really there to help. The schools technology is up to date and the campus is very safe.
Sophomore,4,"Wilkes University is a great school. One thing I just would like to see is more teachers, a more diverse teaching staff. The same teachers teach the same classes. Adding more teachers will bring different styles that can be very helpful to learn and get new ideas from."
Junior,4,"Wilkes is a very welcoming place. You have both large and very small classes and get to know you professors well. Usually always willing to help and want to see you succeed! A lot of student activities with free food, shirts, etc."
Freshman,4,"Wilkes University is a great school. I am currently a freshman at Wilkes. I'm glad that even though I had a rough start at this school, they have helped me out to be able to pass this semester. I like the fact that this school is small and the teachers get to know you better. Some of them do worry about you and try to help as best as they can. I also like that most of my classes are close by and I can to them in a matter of minutes. One thing that I think this school and actually all schools can improve on is that they should lower the tuition a bit. Not everyone has the amount of resources that some kids do have. The financial aid office also needs some improving. Overall this school is good and I do recommend it to kids with good grades. I got a scholarship from this school based on my grades. But if your grades aren't that high, then good luck."
Sophomore,4,The faculty is amazing and almost everyone has the highest degree possible in their field. Professors are always willing to meet outside of both class AND office hours.
Senior,4,The school has a nice campus with a beautiful new science building.  Some of the on campus housing options are neat old homes.  I've been happy with my classes and the professors.  The food has improved in the years I've been there.  
College Junior,4,Very good local connections. Plenty of internships
Freshman,4,"My experience at Wilkes was great! I like how the campus is set up, the professors and students that I have met so far are all very nice. Everyone around campus is always happy to help. The diversity of the students and professors is really nice. I like that Wilkes has a Public Safety Office that will walk you around campus property if you don't feel safe. I'm not sure what I would change yet, but so far it would be to change the prices for the meal plans. I don't think the college understands that we already pay so much for tuition and dorm rooms, and you do not really get a lot of food for your money."
Sophomore,4,"Wilkes univeristy is a good smaller sized university. It has a good community of people, the dorms are great, it is a very safe campus, there is a lot to do outside of school. It is a good experience."
College Junior,4,"From my stand point, All students are accepted positivly"
College Junior,4,I feel somewhat safe on campus but I know my parents would prefer if I didn't walk alone at night.
College Junior,4,I live close by but I decided dorm life would be a better choice for studying since I have younger siblings. I live in a mansion turned into a dorm. My room is huge and my roommate is excellent. I wish the washer and dryer were a little more up to date but everything is great.
College Junior,4,I love their Science department that is why I chose Wilkes University. The head of the biology department spent 1 1/2 hours with my mother and I when we went to visit campus. I was highly impressed and the whole science department hasn't disappointed me yet!
College Senior,4,Class sizes are generally small. My largest lecture was 150 students but that rarely happens and is only with gen eds. For the most part professors are willing to help you no matter what.
College Senior,4,All majors have some sort of career class that they take. Students get matched with alumni and can spend time talking to them and networking
College Senior,4,I honestly am not really into the athletics.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of school events held during the week at the SUB. Even when there isn't, there is an opportunity to spend time with your friends and do something fun on or off campus."
College Sophomore,4,It is very diverse and differences are accepted so it is rare people feel left out unless they choose to be isolated.
College Sophomore,4,You do not have to feel obligated to do what others are doing and there is a good chance people are making the same decision you are.
College Sophomore,4,Work study is available to many students and is willing to have students to work if they sign up. I have used work study to my advantage during my first year and plan to use it during my second year.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoyed most of my professors. There is a couple that I believe do not focus on the class and the class as a whole usually does poorly. I think end of the semester evaluations should be highly considered in order to avoid these situations in the future and Wilkes can make classes more successful.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus often feels vary safe. Sometimes I am nervous to walk places alone during the night, but when a group I feel more comfortable. The alert buttons on campus are helpful and public safety is often around."
College Sophomore,4,"I made a lot of friends in my dorm. My floor wasn't as social as I may have liked, but there were many people I became friends with not only in my dorm, but closer dorms also."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a part of the soccer team. Usually depending on the sport, the amount of people to show will vary. It can also be determined by who the opponent is. I believe sports are becoming a bigger part of campus as more sports are added to the school. Other things such as marching band are also being added to get more students involved."
College Sophomore,4,"I was terrified to move away and go to my school. Once I was there for two weeks, I loved it so much I didn't want to come home. It is very easy to get involved and make long lasting friendships. It is also easy to be successful as long as you are willing to work for it."
College Junior,4,I only stay 2 weeks out of the year.
College Freshman,4,I think that the value of a degree from this school is absolutely huge.
College Freshman,4,All the housing building are beautiful!
College Freshman,4,I've really enjoyed this college so far.
College Junior,4,So far school has taught me a lot in my field of environmental engineering. It helped me gain knowledge on the current internship I have.
College Student,4,"the campus is very diverse regarding the courses, the professors, the students, and the options you can get when dining."
College Student,4,Wilkes University is a great school to graduate from and you will have plenty of oppurtunities after graduating.
College Student,4,"So far my experience has been great. I have met so many people and have learned so much about myself and others. It is a diverse university, which allows us all to learn different things about other cultures and see things first hand. The professors are there to help you and there are so many other places to go if you need help. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join and you will never be bored during your spare time."
College Freshman,4,"Its not a dry campus, underage drinking is fround upon, but security will leave you alone as long as youre being safe."
College Freshman,4,"Ive never personally had a problem with on campus savety, and usually run into a public saftey officer several times a day."
Freshman,2,"Staff is very hit and miss. Food is horrible. Honestly feel as though the whole place looks at each student a bag of cash waiting for the taking. For what you pay, the quality fails at every level"
College Freshman,2,If there is a problem public safety will listen. They are more concerned with issuing parking tickets
College Freshman,2,The only people attending my schools football games are the players parents. Small schools = small talents. We rarely win games.
College Sophomore,2,I do not enjoy my school. I believe that on my visit I was not told everything about my school to make my decision.
College Freshman,2,"The campus housing is nice, they have a lot of options. Evans hall is where most 1st year students are living in right now. It's very nice, the RA are are also great. They encourage you to participate in clubs and they also have little parties in the dorm with other students on the floor."
College Freshman,2,"The food is definitely edible, but the hours are terrible. Breakfast opens at 10:30 on Saturday and while this may work for many students, is I need to wake up to workout or something, I have no access to food.  Every tuesday and every weekend, the cafateria takes away the trays and makes the students eat without a tray.  If I went to a cafe anywhere else where there were options and some place served me food without a tray, I would absolutely not come back.  Wilkes does this weekly and uses rediculously small plates that only fit one item of food so you always end up making 5 trips to your table and back to the food lines."
College Freshman,2,"I like rifkin and gambinis, but the food in henry's just always leaves me at least a bit dissatisfied.  Even if I did like my meal. Staff is nice though."
College Sophomore,2,"Public safety and local police are seen during the day. However, they are not always around at night and are not very proactive with patroling.  Many assaults have occurred this year and they are not always prompt with taking action."
College Senior,2,Don't really have that much
College Junior,2,"Off-Campus housing at Wilkes University is limited, therefor can be very expensive. Most of the time you are not getting your money's worth, just settling for a place and unsafe place to live."
College Freshman,2,"In Wilkes-Barre it rains often. Which means you walk to classes in the rain, because their is no roofs on buildings. It can create an uncomfortable situation. It the Winter it's slippery with snow. In the summer it's very hot and a lot of the buildings don't have air conditioning."
College Freshman,2,Computers are often available when not near the end of the semester.  WiFi in the dorms can be terrible/non-existant at times and at certain places.  Even the wired connection will be slow or cut out a times.
College Sophomore,2,Very few students take part in this. Public safety does a good job on enforcing policies though
College Student,2,It is hard to get WiFi in the dorms but in the buildings you can.
College Student,2,Not the best place to play sports.
College Freshman,2,"We have options we can $40 to park a mile off campus and get a ride from the shuttle, or we can pay $120 to park in the garage which is still a good 600 yards from the dorms. It is very inconvenient to always have to take a shuttle to get to your car."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is in Wilkes Barre which has a very high crime rate, you have to walk with somebody because there are so many cases of people getting robbed."
College Freshman,2,"This university is good in many ways has plenty of resources, great library, friendly staff, but the atmosphere of this school is overwhelming. The town that is in, had a high crime rate and there are always sirens going off. You have to me careful walking off campus, I never knew it would be this frustrating."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is ridiculous, its hard to find a spot especially if your commuting and your class starts past 9am"
College Sophomore,2,I am pretty sure everybody does drugs
Graduate Student,1,"I attended here in the graduate creative writing department for a year. I was mostly miserable.  The teachers bark and humiliate the students.   I have never encountered a college where professors were so RUDE to students.  It is for that reason I walked. I became depressed by all the abuse there, despite my working hard and getting good grades. They want power over you. I don't learn with abuse. They don't respect students. They just want your money. No decent scholarships are offered or funding. You get what you pay for I guess."
College Freshman,1,There is little to none social activities such as parties. It's better for seniors because most are old enough for the bars.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is terrible. If I eat it a few days in a row I feel like I should see a doctor. The administration is not helpful, with the exception of a few people. Mostly it seems as though professors are here to get paid and couldn't care less if the students actually learn the material that they are ""teaching."" I chose a small school because of the personal relationship it offers between teacher and student. Class sizes are about the same as they were in high school and I have had multiple professors ask me to remind them of my name after visiting their office many times with questions. The worst part about the university is Public Safety. I do not feel same on/off/around campus. I have met one individual in the office of public safety that I felt as though cared about me as a student. To put things into perspective, at a university with around 2500 students I know four people personally whose safety was disregarded because officers were busting parties or writing parking tickets. These incidents include being robbed at gun point, being robbed with a knife, sexual assault, and unarmed robbery. The city is dangerous, and students are made aware of this when they visit the campus, but it wasn't apparent to me as an incoming student that public safety is so undeserving of their name. Housing is overpriced. The community is as strong as it is due to bonds made over mutual hatred for different aspects of the school. Do not waste your money."
College Freshman,1,"i had an awful experience at wilkes. the dorms are no good, the people are all the same, it is a very small school so there is a ton of drama, just did not have a good time here at all. the food was not the worst though"
College Freshman,1,"I have only been to 4 parties this year and I did not drink at any of them, but some of my friends did so I watched over them for the nights.  The parties are not good at all at Wilkes University.  There are only sports houses and on a good night, there might be two or three parties but almost never more than that.  The people who own the houses are not friendly people and always run out of alcohol early in the night.  These are all reasons, among others, that I have only been to 4 parties at Wilkes this year.  Other schools have much better parties."
College Freshman,1,"A barren wasteland of frigid cold and lifeless streets awaits you here.  Bring your bulletproof armor though, It's not scarce with crazy people."
College Freshman,1,"There is only one cafeteria that is free with the meal plan. They never have food prepared. And i mean NEVER. It's supposed to be a buffet style cafe, yet there is never any food out. I have to wait 10 minutes on average everytime for food to be prepared. I don't understand how you can never have food prepared in a college cafe. The food sucks too, by the way."
College Freshman,1,There are never enough computers.
College Freshman,1,It always rains and is very windy.
College Freshman,1,"If you like slutsor players, you might fit in. Don't expect to have a decent relationship at this college."
College Freshman,1,No heat. Buildings are falling apart.
College Freshman,1,"As i've mentioned before, the business school is terrible. They are moving the business school into a new building, which is a multi-million dollar project. But don't be fooled, the program will remain the same. It may look fancy, but the same staff and professors will provide you the same high school education as they do now."
College Freshman,1,"Compared to other schools, the list of majors offered is minute."
College Freshman,1,The transportation sucks. The shuttle runs to about four places on campus. You basically need a car if you want to get away from campus.
College Freshman,1,"I don't even party here and i'm aware at how bad the nightlife is. If you're looking to party, do not come here."
College Freshman,1,The common drugs are just around every corner. If you want hard core drugs i'm sure they can be found in the town square where all the homeless people are.
College Freshman,1,Ask anyone. The night life is in the dumps. Boring campus. Very plain with nothing to do.
College Freshman,1,"I would not recommend this school to anyone. The transfer rate is through the roof (regardless of what faculty or staff tell you). I honestly feel like i wasted a year of my life. This may not sound like it makes sense, but i'm pretty sure i lost some of my intelligence from attending this school for a year (i don't even want to imagine what four years would feel like)."
College Freshman,1,"The facilities are old and falling apart. The new science building is nice. Breiseth Hall is also not too bad. The mansions have minimal heat in the winter, and, you guessed it, no air conditioning in the spring or summer/beginning of fall. It gets extremely hot in almost every building."
College Freshman,1,"Overall, i would give Wilkes University a 3/10."

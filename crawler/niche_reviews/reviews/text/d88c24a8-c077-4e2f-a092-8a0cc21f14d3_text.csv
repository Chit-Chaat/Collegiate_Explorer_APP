Sophomore,5,"I am a commuter at Millikin University and I didn’t expect to even go to this school at first, but now that I’m here I wouldn’t have it any other way! The people at Millikin are the most inviting and kind group of individuals I’ve ever met. The community is so supportive and helpful for upcoming Freshmen and every step is taken to ensure a great first year. The campus is gorgeous and the perfect size to walk around, but not easily get lost. The faculty and staff are all fantastic and very knowledgeable and Millikin breeds the kindest, most well-rounded students I’ve known."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience was rather sudden and unexpected because of the COVID-19 pandemic and as such was a difficult time for both me as a student and all of my professors. As a performance major, the transition to online classes was confusing and hard, but the professors did everything that they could and more to make sure that each individual student was able to make the most of the time we were forced to work online. There was not a single professor that didn’t go out of their way to make our online experience as simple and helpful as possible and I honestly don’t know that I would have been able to complete the semester without the support and encouragement of the school."
Works Here,5,The staff and instructors at Millikin genuinely care about the students. The campus is beautiful and their programs are well respected.
Works Here,5,Millikin is a beautiful campus. The buildings are well-maintained and they take the safety of their students seriously. The faculty and staff have been understanding during COVID-19 and genuinely care for their students.
Junior,5,"With the COVID situation, my professor  switched to an online class, and he was very supportive of suggestions for improving the class. He allowed flexible office hours, and he responded to questions in email as soon as he could."
Junior,5,It was a great experience because all the students and professors were open to the new people in the school. Everybody was very helpful to others and was focused on the tasks.
Sophomore,5,"Millikin University has provided me with all the resources to succeed. The professors are constantly available to their students and work to provide a positive learning environment. My professors and advisor have also given me the materials and time to practice and hone my craft. As a music major, practice is extremely important. Being able to fulfill my practice hours and attend recitals at my campus has been truly amazing."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small teacher to student ratio. That allows students to actually connect and build a relationship with the students , which is very welcoming"
Alum,5,A private school that shares all the resources like a public institution. I loved this small campus as I got to know students and faculty well. It is well diverse and nationally recognized.
Niche User,5,I think it was a reasonable size place. I like how the buildings look. They have even more buildings coming so i see how important the art is to them. And they have a great teaching program and that is what i'm mostly looking forward to study.
Sophomore,5,"Millikin University is a spectacular college. They pride themselves on their fine arts education, which is fantastic, but all other academic fields are thoroughly represented. The dorms are clean and well taken care of. The food is great! The classes are challenging, yet save room for being fun and interesting. The majority of the professors on campus work hard to help you achieve success. And lastly, Millikin is filled with great people--students and faculty alike provide a great learning experience."
Freshman,5,"I love how all of the professors are truly here to support me. Coming to college for freshman year was absolutely terrifying, but knowing that when I'm in need that my professors will be there for me was crucial. There were several times that I've needed to meet and talk to certain professors about financial issues or academic concerns and they always find time in their schedule to meet and talk with me. No matter what class I'm in, I know that my professors are always rooting for me to succeed to the best of my ability."
Freshman,5,"Go away to college was the best idea. But the cost was so expensive that I couldn’t stay. But millikin university is great the  professors are great I was to communicate with all of my professors and financial aid people they where very welcomed, outstanding and I can’t wait to return"
Alum,5,"Millikin University has a saying, which you will hear campus President Dr. Patrick White say again and again, “Ah, there you are Millikin.” Going to Millikin is that same feeling of, “Ah, I’m home.” 

Allow me to tell you, what really makes Millikin is the professors. I graduated with a Biology Major. The professors I had over the last four years in the biology department were some of the best educators who I have ever had the privilege to work with. All the professors made such a profound impact on my growth academically, but also personally.  

Millikin isn’t your typical place for a biology major. You won’t be in the classroom in massive lecture halls. Typical class size was 12-18. Millikin is hands on. You won’t just “learn” about it. You experience it. 

You won’t be competing with 40-50 other students for the chance to assist in research. You will design, implement, and present your own research. 

I wouldn’t be who I am without my Millikin family."
Sophomore,5,I love how interactive the professors are with the students. and there is a lot of hands on learning. plus there is always something going on.
Freshman,5,"In just my first month being on campus, I have found my place here. I was encouraged to get involved and if I couldn't find something, then to create something which I did. I'm not scared to be myself and do what I love"
Graduate Student,5,"As an adult learner, Millikin University's CRNA program has been a great choice for my family and I.  class sizes are small, only accepting 14 students per year allowing a more focused one on one education.  This is clearly shown in the 2017 cohort  with 100% first time pass rate during boards. Secondly, the beauty of attending Millikin University is little to no distractions as there is limited amount of things to do outside of the University ensuring that all of my time is dedicated to the success of passing this program.   Lastly, Millikin University if a military friendly school accepting the Post 911 GI bill, Yellow Ribbon participant and accepts tuition assistance.  This is huge, especially because many graduate students have a families, mortgages and car payments.  Along with a  low cost of living, this makes Millikin University a realistic goal."
Sophomore,5,"Millikin is a beautiful campus, that is the perfect size to receive an amazing education. Class sizes are small and give you prime one on one experience with your professors. Millikin also offers many clubs and activities and the opportunity to create new ones. I love Millikin and all of the amazing people I have meet through Millikin. Go Big Blue"
Sophomore,5,"I am a current student at Millikin University. I have been at Millikin for one semester which was sprong 2018. So far I have enjoyed my time here at Millikin from the classes, to the sports, and to the people. It is a very welcoming experience and I plan on returning to the campus this fall if i win this scholarship money so I can return."
Sophomore,5,Millikin University is the best school to give students hands-on learning and the professors are always there to help their students. I liked the environment that everyone fits in and we all become one single family!
Junior,5,It’s a great school with faculty who care and programs that fit your schedule. Currently a student in the accelerated program and getting my bachelors while working full time
Alum,5,"I would not trade my 4 years at MU for anything! I absolutely loved it there even though Decatur can be a sketchy area, this campus is beautiful and old which makes it rich in history and tradition. The student body is decently diverse. The theatre program is amazing as well as the music program. The faculty truly cares for every student. The small campus gives you the close knit family vibe. The townies can be ratchet though. Another fun fact is that it is haunted! I have sooo many spooky experiences :) best food spots drunk or sober are Burrito Truck, First Wok, Donnie’s & University Dogs."
Freshman,5,I liked now kind everyone was to each other. The campus is kind of small but it’s called the “milli bubble” for a reason. Everyone on campus treats each other like we are all family. We look out for each other and help when we can.
Freshman,5,There aren't too many non-workstudy jobs on campus. Which makes it a little hard to pay for school. Also not a lot of things surround the school so if your without a car it may be hard to do things.
Sophomore,5,"I love Millikin so much. I feel like I’ve truly found my home away from home. The professors not only care about you as a student, but as a person."
Freshman,5,"My stay at Millikin university this semester was amazing. I met people from different places and learnt a lot from the diverse community. The people were loving, patient, social and ambitious. When it came to the professors, they were so helpful and it was easy to understand everything.  Millikin environment is like home away from home. Whether it is your first or last day at school, you will feel at home. The food is so delicious, clean and served in a very beautiful cafeteria. There are many healthy options to choose from, which makes it easier for students to eat a balanced diet. The only change that I would like to see in school would be to allow students to live on their own. This is because they pay so much money for residence yet they could pay less rent for offcampus private apartments."
Junior,5,Millikin has been incredible in my time there. Every faculty member I've encountered actually cares for me and wants me to succeed. I'm overwhelmed at the amazing level of instruction that embodies the Millikin experience.
Niche User,5,Millikin university is such a beautiful campus and has a overall good vibe! The surrounding area is cute. The class sizes are relatively small so you get to know your professors
Junior,5,Campus involvement is taken as a priority here. I absolutely love it! You are here for an education but you learn just as much outside of the classroom as you do inside the classroom.
Junior,5,"I could not be happier with Millikin! All of my professors and peers have been very sociable, very encouraging, and accepting."
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE my school! Just like every school, there are drawbacks, the food isn't always great, the local area doesn't have much to do, but the campus is beautiful (though some of the buildings are falling down). My professors care about me as an individual and want my educataion to be exactly what I want it to be. They are invested in my future and know me on a personal level. Millikin is my home and the students and faculty are truly my home away from home."
Freshman,5,Millikin has been wonderful. The professors are very helpful and they care for each student. There are many opportunities to get involved and I love my new school!
Sophomore,5,"The professors are great. They're always willing to assist you and provide countless resources you can use to help you in your classes. Being a student-athlete is made easy. My coach works to keep our team GPA above a 3.2 and offers study tables, and is in constant communication with our professors on what our travel schedule is. The professors are very understanding when it comes to traveling. They will do anything in their power to make sure you don't miss any material. Even the security at Millikin University is fantastic! They provide safe rides, they help keep campus clean, and they are super friendly! All the workers at Millikin are very nice and polite. One thing that I would change about MU is the wireless internet. Our wifi here doesn't have the best connection."
College Junior,5,Public safety does a great job making students feel safe.
College Junior,5,There is a high rate of students finding jobs in their field upon graduation.
College Junior,5,I enjoy going to school at Millikin University. I has been a great experience it's just so expensive and has drained my financial aid.
College Junior,5,I am so glad I joined greek life. I have made some of my best friends through my sorority. Tri Delta has helped me become a more independent person.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I'd pick Millikin a hundred times over. My supportive and invested faculty, amazing Greek experience, quality education, vast career and organization opportunities made my college experience nothing short of incredible. That's not to say I didn't think the caf food was gross sometimes, or policies were occasionally unfair, or that classes weren't difficult -- that's something that comes with most colleges -- but my overall experience was phenomenal and the great outweighs the occasional negative experience.

I especially love the small campus size; it was great to know nearly everyone on campus and have such expansive friend groups. It also made the opportunities for leadership, internships, and special opportunities more attainable since there is less people to compete among. Although a larger school might have a more recognizable name, lack of internship experiences and difficulty getting letters of recommendation (which is common in D1 size schools) will not help you move forward into graduate school or the profession of your dreams.

My Greek experience was phenomenal and left me with lifelong friendships, leadership experiences, networking opportunities, and truly allowed me to find myself as a person. I lived in the sorority house for just one year, but it was an absolute blast, incredibly supportive, and exactly what I needed to learn to come out of my shell and diversify my friend group. I never thought I'd join a sorority but now I'd recommend going Greek to anyone -- the worst that could happen is that you find out it's not for you. 

Safety is the only clear negative at Millikin. Generally speaking, you are very safe on campus, but Decatur is a bit of an armpit. I've found that this is actually very common in most college towns so you'll experience it no matter where you go. I never had bad experiences but I always walked in groups, carried mace, and took safe rides when needed. There's no shame in being safe.

5/5 stars, would recommend Millikin!"
College Freshman,5,"I love my school environment, professors, and classes."
College Junior,5,My school has been the perfect fit for me in every way.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Millikin University. The performance learning environment allowed me to experience real world situations right away as a freshman. I was afforded so many different opportunities ranging from choir, to Greek life, to a student run theatre company. My professors are amazing and are always there for students every step of the way. I have zero regrets when it comes to Millikin University because I know that it is preparing me for a successful future."
College Sophomore,5,"There may not be many options, but Greek life is very visible on campus. There are five social fraternities and six social sororities on campus. Of those, two fraternities and three sororities have official, university-recognized housing in their own chapter houses, while the rest have unofficial off-campus houses (as of May 2015). It is definitely worth going through recruitment to see if any of the fraternities/sororities are right for you!"
College Freshman,5,"I like the professor and the way they teach, because most of them realized that we just graduated high school so they ease us up to the college level. The varieties of styles of teaching  courses are so different. Some professors lecture the whole time, other get involve with the students, and some do both. I like how the class size is not to overwhelmingly large or small, the professors know your name."
College Freshman,5,Millikin works really well with you to get what you need.
College Freshman,5,"The theatre department at my school is highly respected and known throughout the country. They have alumni on and off Broadway and all over the world doing different projects. The program that I am in required an interview for acceptance rather than an audition, because my major is not performance based. I am a theatre administration major which is basically the business side of theatre. I love my program because the instructors are always rooting for you to succeed and will help you in any way possible. The department is constantly bringing in people to do masterclasses or finding opportunities for students to gain real life experience while still being in school. Advice that I would give to someone auditioning or interviewing is be confident and show them that you care and have potential to succeed and do great things."
College Sophomore,5,My course and professors are excellent! I get to experience lots of one-on-one with my professors did to the exceptionally small class time. They make me feel comfortable to approach with questions and the course material rocks!
College Freshman,5,"The program is challenging, but I'm happy with it!"
College Freshman,5,I'm having lots of fun here!
College Freshman,5,They hand out scholarships like candy
College Freshman,5,Awesome greek life (:  I'm in a sorority and I love it!
College Freshman,5,Cool houses at low prices
College Freshman,5,Girls and guys are all pretty cool and down to earth!
College Freshman,5,The music program is prestigious to get in to.
College Freshman,5,The workload for a music major is insane... haha
College Freshman,5,"UDogs, Head West, Cherry Berry, LSB, Subway, Jimmy John's... all in walking distance."
College Freshman,5,The people that do it are very responsible about it and it doesn't affect those who do not. You can have a great time with or without.
College Freshman,5,I don't think it is strict at all but not so much that crazy things happen. Students are pretty responsible here so there isn't any need to make unnecessary rules.
College Freshman,5,"Always willing to help students pay for school. If you speak to your admissions counselor, they will increase your financial aid as needed."
College Freshman,5,Amazing. Always willing to keep students safe even if it means going a little overboard at times.
College Freshman,5,"really great, I even got a little extra money to help with books and other expenses"
Junior,4,"Some courses not all courses are being offered online since Corvid19, which was a great idea. Teachers are still available, if you are having any issues, with the online courses"
Junior,4,"Millikin is a great school, they really care about their students and by all means if you are in need of help in any area, make sure to talk with your adviser, because they are willing to help however they can."
Junior,4,I have taken many classes on-line and for the most part it has went very well. If there are computer issues i have been able to reach out to my professors and they have given me the resources i needed to address the issue.
Junior,4,"My experience so far has been great. The Professors are very helpful , administration keeps students up to date on campus happenings, the campus is kept very clean, and if there are any issues they are addressed promptly."
Sophomore,4,"Millikin University is overall a pretty good school. It has very small class sizes which I love considering the teachers are able to stay more involved and your less likely to fall behind. They also offer many options to get help with most of them being free. As for sports they are a D3 so we are not the best and not the main focus of campus life. Most people on campus are involved with Theater or the arts considering it is a liberal arts school. This makes the school fall behind in most other areas since most of the funding goes to them, however they are able to provide students with other majors what they need. I think that Millikin is over priced for what they offer with housing and food options. The dorms are pretty average but the housing for upper classmen is way to expensive for what they offer. The cafeteria is barley edible and way over priced if you don't have a meal plan. As for campus life I would say that it is one of the best and very accepting to everyone."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I think I've had a good experience. There are many communities that students can join and those communities enhance the experience. The teachers and staff are generally supportive and care about forming meaningful, helpful relationships with students so that they can be successful. There are definitely things that can improve such as diversity and more support for the minority populations."
Freshman,4,"I love Millikin because of the staff. They are all super helpful and connect personally. As well as my coach at Millikin, they will get you what you need to be successful."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at Millikin thus far. The area around the university has gotten progressively more dangerous as the years go by. There have been lots of shootings around and at parties, my friends have attended. I see this as a campus problem as it can be a risk to the safety of every student. Although, the education I am receiving seems to be very advanced and personal. The school is very expensive which has created lots of stress for myself."
Freshman,4,"Millikin is a very nice school. Everyone is so friendly and engages you in conversation. The professors are always there when you need them as well. The food is not that great all the time, but it has some days when the food is absolutely amazing. Millikin is an overall great school."
Freshman,4,The small campus allows you to easily connect with fellow classmates. You will always have a feeling that you are welcomed at Millikin University.
Junior,4,"Millikin University is a very small school. A big benefit to this is the hands on learning. Small class sizes help one on one learning. It also helps being able to connect to not only the professors but as well as other classmates. They have tutoring for any class you request, as well as certain centers such as the math and writing center to help with work you need extra help with.  
The sports teams here are becoming more established such as the new softball and baseball fields. They keep improving the buildings to help enhance learning.
I do wish Millikin was in a better area. There is not much to do around and the area around the university isn't the safest or cleanest. On campus the university does a good job of keeping the students safe. 
Overall, Millikin is a very enriching campus with many academic advances that help to prepare you for your future. I am pleased with my experience at Millikin so far."
Junior,4,Millikin is a great school. I would like to see tuition prices go down. I would also like to see more students engaging with different race and culture of other students. The teachers I have encountered have been very knowledgeable of their profession and helpful for myself to learn the information needed to obtain my degree in International Business. I like that the campus is diverse which allows students and teachers to learn about places and people outside of Decatur's normal demographics.
Junior,4,I like the different cultural programs. And I really love that they have student ran organizations. The professors there are very helpful and understanding and are willing to work with students who are struggling in their class
Sophomore,4,"I like the small atmosphere and the easy to find classrooms. Students have an easy time finding classes and professors' offices. The relationships that the students have with their professors and academic advisors are good. The professors and the advisors are good at teaching and helping students from all disciplines. Millikin also has support systems built so that if anyone is struggling, then they can reach out for help."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small classes and professor to student ratio. The classes are not intimidating at all, which is great. However, I wish there were more scholarships offered by Millikin University. Scholarships are a very important part of college to me. Overall, I love how Millikin University is like one big family!"
Alum,4,"The small community and private setting allowed for more interaction one-on-one with professors.  This was extremely helpful in managing schedules, further discussion of topics, and creating a sense of community throughout the campus."
Junior,4,I love the small class size and the relationships built with professors. I also love the performance learning philosophy.
Junior,4,"Close to home. Just transferred to Millikin and the nursing program is great. Professors care for you as well. No party scene really, but that's okay with me. Decatur Illinois also kind of sucks."
Sophomore,4,"I love Millikin!  While there are some things I do not like, the school overall is great.  Yes the food might not be too good but its a college campus, what do you expect?  The one thing I really do not like about Millikin is the sophomore and junior housing requirements.  Millikin has a partnership with The Woods, an apartment complex, and requires sophomores and juniors to live there, in Greek housing, or petition for off campus living.  The Woods is separate from Millikin but nevertheless, it is overpriced and often charges students for bogus damages."
Junior,4,"I live from home and the campus is commuter friendly, and there are plenty opportunities to get involved whether or not you live on campus. The diversity on campus is excellent and the performance-learning aspect is suitable to my studying needs."
Sophomore,4,"Millikin is the reason why I have stayed in Decatur so long. I do not like the town, but the education I am getting at Millikin is amazing! I wouldn't trade it for the world."
Alum,4,"My overall experience at Millikin is hard to put into words.  I enjoyed the class sizes and how the teachers were there for you.  There are so many resources available for you to succeed to in your education.  The ability to maximize your learning and experience is all there, just have to ask for help."
Junior,4,"Millikin University is full of opportunities for all kinds of students, whether you're a theatre major or a nursing major. The faculty and staff are extremely knowledgeable in their fields and have real-life experience in what they are teaching. The small class sizes mean that you are able to get to know your professor on a better scale than if you went to a state school where you have class with 200 other people."
Freshman,4,I liked the professors and how they treated me with respect and helped me achieve my goals. I appreciated that the school knows that sexual harassment and assaults occur and they encourage addressing and pursuing the problem.
Freshman,4,"I love how the professors want to see their students succeed. I am pursing a degree in nursing and ever since I have met my advisor I have felt at home at Millikin. Since I am a commuter I drive to school every day and Public Safety is only one call away if I need help and there are also emergency buttons in the parking lots if I feel unsafe. The officers are on patrol at all times which makes students feel safe, including myself. There are plenty on resources on campus if I ever need help with homework or I need a quiet place to study. Professors encourage students to come to their office hours and this is allows a platonic relationship to form but also allows students to fell encouraged to ask for help about anything going on in the classroom. "
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the environment that the school offers. It's a very unique experience to be a millikin student. The school is small, but feels large because of the fact the you know so many people. The classes are a good enough size to know many of the people in your class as well as also knowing the proffesor."
College Junior,4,"Athletics is a big deal however, I don't have the time to participate in them."
College Junior,4,The school has great employment rate after graduation and is very helpful when students are trying to find internships and job opportunities.
College Junior,4,"I love the nursing program at Millikin because we get lots of one on one time with our professors since it is a very small school. This is very helpful, especially since we are nursing students. We also get alot of hands on experience which is also important being a nursing student."
College Freshman,4,I have been very pleased with everything I have taken thus far.
College Freshman,4,"Though I know I will struggle to get a job, simply because of the field, I feel that I will be very well prepared for what I will be up against."
College Freshman,4,"There are areas for improvement, but overall I am thrilled with my school!"
College Junior,4,I think most of the course are great. I really like the courses I have to take for my program.
College Junior,4,Career prospects are great here. Most students do internships before they graduate which helps get their name out for possible jobs after college.
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy my school and am glad that I chose to go here. Everyone is really nice and it's easy to make friends. Also, the teachers really care and want to help in any way."
College Junior,4,"Athletics are good at my school. There is quite a bit of support, especially from other teams within the school. All the athletes greatly support one another"
College Senior,4,The average class has about 15-20 students. Professors know each student by name.
College Senior,4,"Greek life is a fairly large part of the campus community. No one is treated differently based on which fraternity or sorority they choose, if they even choose at all."
Recent Alumnus,4,I've had a much better experience in the PACE program than I did as a traditional student. I believe that is both my own fault and a little bit of certain professors faults.
College Senior,4,I really enjoy my college. The faculty is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Some good options within walking distance, including Hardee's, Pizza Hut, The Winery (small dive bar famous for its burgers), Donnie's Homespun Pizza; Lock, Stock & Barrel (bar and grill, decent food, decent prices, also known as LSB), The Blue Spoon (Breakfast place open on weekends), Head West Subs, Cherry Berry frozen yogurt, University Dogs (hot dogs, burgers, Italian beef, and more; Chicago-area natives will feel at home), and Jimmy John's. Plenty of other options, including many fast-food and chain restaurants, are within a ten-minute drive. LSB and Donnie's also have live music and other acts frequently."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone says the cafeteria is bad, but I don't agree. They have a good variety of options every day, including special dietary needs (e.g. gluten free, vegetarian). Late night meal exchange at the Bistro is very convenient. Flex can be spent at the cafeteria, the Bistro, C3 Express (convenience shop) in Scovill Hall, Einstein Bros. Bagels in Shilling Hall, Domino's & Subway at Wood & Main (right next to The Woods main entrance), and at most vending machines on campus. Rumor has it flex can also be spent at McDonald's on Eldorado, but I can't confirm this to be true."
College Freshman,4,"When somebody got mugged, they sent out an email informing us what happen and telling us to be careful. Also they always send out emails when we our having iffy weather, letting us know what to expect and to be careful. I feel safe on the campus, you can always find a security walking around the campus or driving. Even though sometimes there are outsiders walking around campus asking for money, and trying to hit on you, you can always find someone walking around to help you."
College Freshman,4,"I went to one football game, and everyone had school spirit and was cheering, even though we lost. I am on the track team and I feel like we perform good, although sometimes are score does not prove it. I feel like our school athletics is great."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like our school policies are reasonable and is not affecting our academic lives, but for some it's affecting their social lives because they are use to drinking and doing drugs."
College Freshman,4,"To be honest, I do not have any tips because my mother did my financial aid."
College Freshman,4,"They are strict with the things that are logical (i.e. drugs, underage drinking) but for the most part, they hear the students out with what they want, or what they want to do. I've never personally had a problem with the administration for doing anything that seemed over the top."
College Freshman,4,"The dining hall is usually pretty okay! They always have a wide selection and try to cover everyone's tastes. There is constantly a fresh salad bar, which is wonderful."
College Freshman,4,"As a Dolson resident, I am happy with my housing experience. The biggest issue I've had is the issue with the laundry room. Most of the time, the washers and dryers don't function properly. Of the 6 washers we have down there, only two work, and only 3 dryers actually dry my clothes."
College Freshman,4,"I am not in Greek life right now, but I have a ton of friends who are. People in Greek life are so nice and really care about their different philanthropies. There are six houses on campus and they are all pretty nice, not run down but not extremely lavish and exquisite. There are non-Greeks who look down on Greek students but for the most part no one has a serious issue with Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,I feel as though everyone is friends with everyone. It's a very close community.
College Sophomore,4,There is a very active and involved career center with many ways to intern and search for jobs. Everything is easily accessible and helpful.
College Freshman,4,Could use a little renovating!  They still have lots of charm
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had one yet, but there are plenty of network options as to getting one!"
College Freshman,4,"The lottery system sucks... but other than that, all of the dorms are social and spacious.  You can get away with a lot too!"
College Freshman,4,Need to keep the townees from entering campus!  It's creepy to see them out of my back window!
College Freshman,4,"Small classes, more personal relationships with teachers"
College Freshman,4,I have no doubt I'll have a good chance of job placement after graduating
College Freshman,4,"A wide variety of people when considering race, ethnicity, And sexual orientation. Diverse, but a very accepting community"
College Freshman,4,The Financial Aid assistance here is wonderful. They are patient and understanding how slow this can be. I had to struggle to receive financial aid outside of Millikin and they understood what was going on. It was due to my high school was being a headache and slowing my process to apply.
Junior,2,"Here is my review on Millikin University.

https://millikinsucks.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-things-millikin-university-never.html"
College Sophomore,2,"I do not think people who are playing sports here does not take it seriously. Coaches ask for more than players can perform. Personally,I do not think professional athletes can keep up with that amount of practicing. Therefore, I had decide not to play here."
College Senior,2,Do not walk alone. Do not go to off campus house parties.
Recent Alumnus,2,I really don't like the route Millikin took for their students as in they absolutely have to live in The Woods apartments once they reach a certain grade level. I believe it's Sophomore or Junior. The Woods is high way robbery and I think they should provide more options to their students.
College Sophomore,2,We're a division III school. Not many people care about sports here.
College Sophomore,2,"It is almost impossible to get off-campus housing approved unless you are a senior, and if you live off campus without permission, you are charged a large fine equivalent to the cost of living in a residence hall. That said, good landlords and properties are abundant within a ten minute walk from campus, but may not be in the safest area."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not the type of person that like to eat fast food a lot. We have about seven restaurant that are walking distance, and out of the six the healthiest place to eat is subway. We do not get any type of discount that I know of, I always had to pay the full prices."
College Junior,2,"Other than Dolson, all of the dorms on campus are absolutely tiny. And to make matters worse, you have to live the Woods apartments from now on starting next year unless you are a freshman or living in a greek house."
College Sophomore,2,The registration process is horrible. There are so many steps and then the website is always crashing or moving extremely slow and this causes students to miss their chances of getting into a certain class for a specific time.
College Freshman,2,The wi-fi sucks... but lots of open labs available!
College Freshman,2,"For someone who comes from Chicago, a city, this place is dismal. Not only for its lacks the common things like a bus that isn't terrifying to ride anywhere because you're absolutely afraid you'll get lost but also because the places to go are so far and between. The museum is impossible to get to, sports aren't that interesting, and shopping is a pain to try and even get to."
College Freshman,2,The town is completely remote from the school. The people of Decatur really are not very similar to the students of Millikin. I like the town. I think it is pretty similar to my hometown but I don't go and do much off campus because almost everything I need is on campus. I do assistant coach at the local soccer club in Decatur and student interned at a local school. Those experiences were both very good. But Decatur and Millikin are very separate and almost two completely different communities/cities. 
College Sophomore,2,No one really wants to live around Millikin because of the feeling of insecurity. Decatur is not a very safe town and their housing selections are of poor quality and no one has really said anything good about their landlord.
College Sophomore,2,The area of town Millikin is in isn't very safe making Millikin no feel as safe. We have campus police but I'm not sure if they are the most enforcing or if they would be able to handle things if something really got out of hand. 
College Junior,2,the  network is very slow around finals. Also the printers hardly work
College Junior,2,there are only a few places on campus to eat
College Junior,2,it is such a long process and I don't have any help figuring it out
College Freshman,2,"Students here call it the ""Milli-Bubble."" Almost everything worth doing is either on campus or just off-campus."
College Freshman,2,"Millikin has an on-campus residency policy for underclassmen for a reason. Living off campus is only available as an option if you're a senior or you meet certain eligibility requirements (e.g. financial need) to live off-campus. Even so, housing immediately off-campus is shifty at best. The best option for off-campus apartments (which Millikin actually counts as on-campus for sophomores and juniors) is The Woods apartment complex. The Woods is grossly overpriced (Over $700 per month per person, does not include utilities), but features a couple of extra features like a pool, parking, and exercise center. "
College Senior,2,"I was involved in athletics. The facilities are not great, and need to be renovated in order to keep up with the conference schools. They are in the process of planning a renovation. There are few successful sports teams and a handful of unsuccessful ones as well. The new athletic director is striving to improve this."
Sophomore,1,"Whether it's the tuition or the cost of living, Millikin University is extremely expensive. The city itself is in a state of disrepair with very high crime rates but you're unable to take advantage of the low cost of living because the university forces students to live in the their $10K/year apartment complexes.
And due to the school's tiny campus and student body, combined with the taxing schedule of ""performance learning,"" if you're not a theatre major, athlete, or one of the ""sheeple"" members of a greek fraternity, social interactions are inhibited and restricted, which almost surely contributes to the consistently poor mental state of Millikin students.

The professors themselves are perhaps the ""silver lining"". The small class sizes and hands-on education are, no doubt, valuable. Unfortunately they don't outweigh the psychological cost of  the distressing environment and community (or lack thereof) and literal cost of going $120K in debt. Steer clear."
College Sophomore,1,I'm my own safety and security. Only really get them is by phone.
College Sophomore,1,Only options for sophomores and juniors without special circumstances are The Woods apartment complex (very expensive) or Greek chapter housing.
College Freshman,1,"If you want to go anywhere to buy clothes or do some shopping that isn't at a grocery store, you need a car."
College Freshman,1,Nothing but fast food. Eat on campus.
College Junior,1,my school is not in a college friendly town. so the locals are not very friendly.
College Sophomore,1,Drinking and drugs are very noticeable. 
College Senior,1,"I have changed my major 4 times. All around the exercise science field. Almost all the classes seem the same, with exception to a few classes in which I can actually say that I learned some things. Other than that, not a great place for the field."
College Senior,1,There are basically two places that students can eat. Very unhealthy food choices too.
College Senior,1,"They make it almost impossible to get an off campus house unless it is the apartment complex called the Woods. Lived in there for a year and it was a huge ripoff. They overcharged everyone and it wasn't worth the facilities. The off campus houses are usually pretty run down and aren't located in the nicest of areas, but the freedom is nice."
College Freshman,1,"There is a public bus service, but it only runs during the day. And the only food store in walking distance is Kroger. You need a car for Wal-Mart or Target"
College Senior,1,"attended a while ago, and definitely not as fun as a larger University."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Don't care, cheating on check-out, horrible landlords. First I must say that The Woods are a seperate entity from the University, and this comment does not reflect on Millikin. These apartments are owned by bunch of scamming landlords who cheat on your check-outs. I lived in the Senior Apartments, was present for all required check-out measures and presented a valid list of issues with the apartment. When I received my deposit back, I was also sent pictures of 'damages.' 
Apparently I left food in the fridge; false, my fridge was spotless, and in the photo, that isn't even my kitchen floor. I had white tile, not wood.
They showed 'papers in my couch;' yes. Papers SEWN to the cushion FROM the manufacturer. 
They also charged us for a 'missing microwave.' I have my original check-in papers from the beginning of the school year. We were NOT given a microwave. I had to go purchase my own when I was told one would be provided.
I would advise against renting at the Woods if at all possible. "
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to Do – Decatur is not exactly the place for nightlife.  There is one place on campus that most people go when it's time to go out, so it gets pretty boring. The college is also not in a very good neighborhood so most parties happen on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Millikin is not very conducive to commuter students. There is really only one good lot to park in and unless you have an 8am or 9am, good luck finding a parking spot. Also, the ticketing is positively awful. Most colleges charge maybe $10 for a parking ticket. Not Millikin. It's easily $25-$50 for just one violation."
College Sophomore,1,"There Are Only Buses – There are no train stations remotely close to campus. You either have to go to Champaign, Bloomington or Springfield which are each hour-long drives. Or you could get on the Greyhound bus which only picks people up from this gross motel 10 minutes away from campus. There is a public transit siystem but you don't really want to get on it to go anywhere. The best thing you can do is find a ride or get a car."
College Sophomore,1,Think Twice. Millikin requires students to remain on campus until they earn a senior standing. Exceptions are made by the school when a student petitions to live off campus for financial reasons or to commute to and from school. Dorm availability is reserved for freshman. Upperclassmen can only choose from a slim amount of dorms. Most sophomores and juniors are forced into the woods. The Woods apartments are low quality and expensive. The rent averages 600+ dollars per month and does not include utilities. Safety at The Woods is pathetic. Several burglaries have occurred in the complex this semester.
College Junior,1,"I lived their will never do it again. They are too expensive, inconsistent, and for what it's worth I would rather take the fees from living off campus without a petition. They are the worst living option ever. The fact is they are making so much money they don't need to do anything except create the environment they've created. And I will leave it at that. Idk who the person is that was giving them an A but they were not even able to live their at the time they gave the ranking. "
College Sophomore,1,millikin athletics are a joke. it is a D3 school. enough said.
College Freshman,1,"Smells Like Bull**** – Only able to petition off campus your senior year unless living with a family member? No problem -we'll push you to live in our Millikin-sponsored apartments at an upwards rate of $650 a month, not including utilities. What's that? You want to utilize your loan money on a dorm room? Sorry, we've reserved those for our freshman class. All of the dorms. All of them."

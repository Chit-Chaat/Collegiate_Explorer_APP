Freshman,5,I have absolutely loved my experience here. A lot of the professors have changed my life and I have learned so much! Although college is hard to adapt and get used to I definitely recommend attending.
Freshman,5,"Clark College's Nursing Program is one of Washington States most renowned, distinguished, and praised programs. Clark offers intense courses and even cadavers."
Freshman,5,"When Clark College suddenly had to move to remote learning, the professors handled it with grace and extreme attention to student needs."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken many classes online already at Clark. What I have learned is that is not for every teacher. Many have had problems with it, and you can tell would way rather talk in person. But many who know how to do everything and enjoy using it for people who can only take online. During the Covid times, it is gonna be extra hard time for some people. But I believe we can make it work and times will get better."
Sophomore,5,The staff is very knowledgeable and kind. I feel like all my professors care about my education and academic success. There is also plenty of resources available to help you be successful !
Alum,5,"Not only did I receive an associates degree from here but I finished their phlebotomy program as well. This campus is very diverse in many ways especially that of age. You have students starting at the age of 16 going well above the average age of a college student. It's a very inviting campus and makes everyone feel welcome regardless of age, gender, or race. There are amazing facilities and strangely enough they have a cadaver lab for a few classes. The medical programs are amazing and set you up to get a job right out of school. This school is dedicated to preparing students to be successful in what ever it is they plan to do and it really shows."
Alum,5,I only took two online classes but my teachers were always quick to respond and both used voice overs on their presentations so we could hear them talk about the notes.
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Clark, I never met a teacher I didn't like. What I would change though is parking. Parking at Clark is a nightmare, there is no chance of parking unless you get to your class 30 minutes early."
Freshman,5,"I started here in Winter 2020, so far the school seems to really care and be there for the students. Each teacher I have had is really nice and easy to communicate with it. I have had three other siblings that have gone to Clark and are greatly appreciated to have a close and affordable school. I also really love that they have a CTC location."
Sophomore,5,I've saved SO MUCH money going to school. some people hate it because it's not a big university. But they are just chasing unrealistic dreams. if you are on the fence. I would 100% go to Clark and save money.
Sophomore,5,"We use canvas. From what I have experienced, the teachers know what they are doing. I am writing this during the spring 2020 pandemic, and with all my classes switching to online. Its been great."
Junior,5,"This place has a beautiful campus, dedicated staff, and a great learning environment! I personally witnessed staff and students demonstrating together for better wages for union workers last year, and it was inspiring."
Junior,5,"I've used online courses and other colleges, and Clark's is really top-notch. In addition to the classes, the ability to zoom chat with the staff is a lifesaver who gets much more mileage out of face to face interaction that a string of email threads."
Senior,5,"I love this school so much and how professional it is. One of the quarters I was in, I had someone who was following me everywhere and I didn't feel safe but once I told the security team, they took it so seriously. All of Clark College took it so seriously too and made sure I felt safe at all times.  They fixed the situation and it was so nice to have people supporting me during that time.

The teachers are absolutely wonderful and so kind and helpful. I never felt judged or belittled if I didn't know something which was amazing to experience. I highly recommend people going to Clark College and their store is pretty cool too."
Senior,5,"The campus looks nice. The only problem with it is that their campus is long, and it takes a while to walk from one place to another if that's how far you have to go.
I honestly really like some of their food. Their pastries at their cafe are absolutely amazing, and are bought at a nice economical price.
The professors are great IF you use Ratemyprofessor.com. This website gives you a better chance of getting a good professor instead of a bad one, because I've already know and have heard of many bad professors in this college. But there are good ones too, so it seems to be in some sort of a balance for now."
Sophomore,5,"I love Clark and all the amazing teachers! I love the additional help that we receive. The instructors are very thoughtful and for the most part, want to see you succeed."
Freshman,5,"I like the community there. The professors are amazing, and the majority of them want you to succeed. I met my best friend there, and we created fun memories together. It was a great way to better myself as a person, and to obtain an education for less money. I found confidence in myself. You will meet so many people with different ethnicities, sexual orientation, ages etc. Every person that attends Clark is there to receive a higher education, and to create friendships along the way."
Alum,5,"I had a very pleasant experience at my time at Clark. The community there is very diverse and welcoming. The staff are very helpful, the students are friendly and the campus is beautiful. It was a great school for me to earn my AA at without being too overwhelmed with the college scene. There were always events to keep people involved outside of the classroom which was a good way to socialize without feeling pressured. It made it an easier transition from high school to living on my own."
Senior,5,I have loved going to Clark College. I have been here off and on for over 15 years and they are always willing to help you. Clark is the school I go to now and I am in the Nursing program. It is so competitive and I feel so proud to be going to a college of its quality.
Freshman,5,"Clark College is a great environment for learning. The professors truly care about educating the students and have their best interest in mind. They push each and every individual student to grow and reach their full potential the professor knows they have. The counselors are extremely cooperative in getting you in the best classes that fit for you. Everyone is exceptionally kind, understanding, and passionate. When I was struggling I was always able to recover by talking to a staff on campus. I am completely happy with my choice to attend Clark College."
Freshman,5,Its a great community college for people who do not have a lot of money on hand and a great way to get a 2 year transfer degree.
Junior,5,The professors at Clark College are awesome and everyone is very friendly. The staff and board of directors really care about the well-being of every student and are very accepting of everyone. The campus is nice and very easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Clark College began last winter and I have to say, it's been a wonderful journey so far!  From the advising and registrar officers to the instructors and professors, all have been cordial and professional.  Given my age, I envisioned anxiety and a greater challenge, however with the outstanding support I've managed to follow my quest with minimal difficulties; extremely thankful for the help and guidance of the advising staff.

Starting my second year this winter quarter and hopefully graduating by Summer of 2020; ONWARD!"
Freshman,5,"A very well put together community college overall. I have been to 4 different colleges and when working with the advising team, this has been the best by far. Really great Veteran Center and you can see the instructors really care about the students. The facilities are fairly robust for a community college and there are a lot of great clubs. The aerospace club even competes in competitions against high profile schools such as MIT/Stanford and even earned an honorable mention in 2018."
Freshman,5,"Clark is a great college. The campus is beautiful. It is easily accessible. They offer a wide variety of classes and programs. My experience with the instructors has been really positive. You can tell they want you to succeed. The student life is very active, and always have something going on."
Sophomore,5,I love the community at Clark. All of my professors have been nothing but helpful. The staff and councilors are always willing to help and troubleshoot. Campus is beautiful and class sizes are just perfect! Tutors are available for basically any subject and are open the same hours as office buildings.
Junior,5,I really liked Clark College because it was close to home and the campus was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,5,It's got a lot of friendly people and great classes for a cheaper price. Plus many events take place at the school that are inspiring or helpful. The college itself is a miracle for second chances and new beginnings.
Niche User,5,"As a Running Start student that has started her first term, I decided to take on a College 101 class. I think it is a smart move as we get exposed to all the resources we can use while at Clark. We get connected with Career Services that helps us cement our career choices. Meeting academic advisers is easy and the staff are very approachable. Whenever I attend a Student Success Workshop, handouts and flyers contain valuable links to better my skills. The community is very diverse and the class sizes do not exceed 20 individuals. I like that major classes such as Math and English have three options: Web-Enhanced (meets in traditional classroom), Online, and Hybrid (combination.) With these options, there is flexibility, and some professors don't mind the format of their textbooks so it is up to the student whether to have an e-book or paper copy."
Niche User,5,I love how much the teacher enjoy what they do! and everyone is really helpful and all of the resources are clear and easy to find.
Niche User,5,"Clark College is a very welcoming and supportive environment. The school offer a lot of majors for a community college. Clark also has a fantastic network of tutors that can help with just about any class that people are struggling with. The school offers numerous resources to students in need such as career services, scholarships and even free legal counsel. All of the staff is very friendly and nurtures a great learning environment."
Sophomore,5,"Clark has an amazing campus located very close to two major interstates and a major highway for Vancouver. All the employees and professors are fantastic in this college, especially Dwight Hughes Director of Networking."
Freshman,5,My college navigator has worked with me on many tough issues and has helped me apply for college courses when I thought I had nothing coming.
Junior,5,"Clark college is an excellent institution that focuses on creating a healthy learning environment for every student. Not only are the courses academically excellent, and in some cases the best in the state, but the faculty and staff go above and beyond to support their students. In the last 5 years I've had many instructors and each one of them has done their best to see me and my classmates through to the end."
Freshman,5,Every in Clark College is very nice and helpful. From the first day of applying to college I was guided step by step to successful future career. If I would have to refer Clark College to any one else I would let them know that this would be the school to go to. They have many option for different career options to many other recourses. I'm very happy I chose this college for my future.
Junior,5,"Clark College is the gold standard of community colleges. The school is an important part of the community of Vancouver, Washington and a great way to gain an education and connect with all different kinds of people."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Clark College as amazing! I loved the faculty there because they were always ready to help the students pursue their educational goals, along with their career choices."
Sophomore,5,"Clark College has an overall calm and welcoming feel to both campuses. I have had lots of good professors at Clark college, especially at the CTC campus. The main campus has some pretty good food options. The CTC campus only has vending machines, but there are many great food options within walking distance near the CTC campus. Most people on both campuses are very friendly and helpful."
Niche User,5,"Clark is an incredible option for anyone looking to advance their education. From online classes, night classes and a variety of odd hour classes, I was able to continue my education while still working full time, without changing my schedule."
Alum,5,I spent my last two years of high school attending Clark College. I loved how involved all the students were with the college community because of the activities provided for socializing.
Alum,5,Clark lets you have the room to grow as you decide the path your life will take. Clark is a great stepping stone from high school into the real world with endless support and resources.
Freshman,5,"Finishing up my 2nd quarter and I couldn't say anything less than excellent!  Professors, instructors, and staff have always been supportive and helpful in advocating for what's best for personal success.  Bookstore committee, finance staff, career services, and advisers have always gone out of their way to meet and greet with professionalism.  I continue to look forward to my next quarter this summer when I'll get involved with physical education and athletics instructors and staff!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Clark College! There are so many student supports that it would be nearly impossible to not only attend Clark, but to succeed at Clark. I feel that Clark wants me to do well. Our library is top notch. The professors I've had so far have been extremely knowledgeable, and my classes have been fun yet challenging. The campus is also beautiful."
Freshman,5,"All of my professors have managed to motivate me, as well i can connect with my professors because so many had gone to a community college themselves and been successful. I'm so happy with my choice here."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this school. They work so hard to provide numerous opportunities to help students succeed. These include workshops, free tutoring in all subjects, free food for students with low income, free food for students who are hungry, fun clubs and lots of fun events tat the community can join. Clark College cares about your education, but they also care about your overall well being and health. I highly recommend this school."
Freshman,5,Clark College is very organize and well prepared. Every student has good guidance from the start to have a successful education path. I would defenatly recommend Clark College to all my friends and family.
Freshman,5,"Clark college has an amazing up beat campus. Everyone is very friendly, and welcoming. The food and coffee is amazing! Whenever I needed help with anything, there was always more than enough assistance!"
Junior,5,I am just starting here so I have no real opinion thus far.  At present time they seem to genuinely care about my future.
Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is friendly and helpful.  The main campus is beautiful with brick buildings, lots of greenery and walking paths as well as art installed everywhere.  They proudly display their love of diversity on campus.  It is also very easy to find and has a decent amount of parking as well as fantastic mass transit that cuts through the campus.  As a student returning to school after nearly 30 years I have had all my concerns addressed and am very excited to start school in a month."
Freshman,5,Since I started Clark it has been fun. The people and the teachers are great and very helpful. I recently transferred from Foothill College so it was pretty scary moving to a new state and a new school. I really like the English department even though that is not my area of study.
Sophomore,5,"Clark College student life services are excellent. They are dedicated to making students feel at home at Clark College. We have several student parties, get-togethers, movie nights, pizza/dinners together, and students are safe, protected, and united. The instructors are excellent. And Clark now has a 4-year degree option, which is fantastic news for me!"
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the environment of Clark college. This is a fun college, where sometimes proffessors make learning fun. I am excited to be in my second year as a penguin."
Sophomore,5,"I am attending Clark for the Early Childhood Education program. I have completed one year and I am very happy with this college. The selection of classes are great, the staff have so far all been great. When I met with my adviser for ECE she was extremely helpful and nice. My overall experience at Clark has been great. The campus is very nice, and they are very diverse."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment in Clark college. Everyone is so positive and pushes everyone to do their best. What I would change is the attide of some professors. Some seem like they don't care to be there.
Freshman,5,good dd dstertert  retert ertertea aewr sreter arerwea awerwear ytytrytrea awerwe aer aser awe awere
Alum,5,Good school. I was there for running start and got an AA. Good teachers. Interesting students. Interesting courses.
Freshman,5,"The one thing I really love about Clark College is how hands on teachers are with their students. They take time to listen to them, answer questions and make time to help them outside of school. Clark college sets students up for success and they truly try to help every student who goes there."
Alum,5,"Clark college is a great place to either start or continue your education. The campus is safe and very nice. The offered degrees are plenty. The professors are knowledgeable. There are so many possibilities there. I'm a graduate of the DNET department and I absolutely recommend that route. You even have possibilities of employment while you go to school. The parking isn't that great at the main campus, but there are plenty of alternatives."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy attending Clark College. It's a beautiful campus and all the professors and admin there have been excellent.
Alum,5,Clark College is so diverse and so helpful when it came to getting my associates degree. I was in running start which is hard but they were there to help me achieve my goals.
Freshman,4,"Online learning is different for different students. I have had fairly good experiences with professors and course work. Additionally, I enjoyed working ahead and learning"
Graduate Student,4,"I took many online classes. One downside would be that the professors were not always very communicative. However, I felt like there were the resources and materials provided for me to be successful in that course and subject."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved Clark, especially when operations were full. There was a lot of potential for student involvement, resources, clubs, workshops and so forth. The professors there were all very kind and did a good job of teaching the material. One downside would be that the campus is open campus, therefore it was not always the safest-feeling place to take an evening class or to be alone at."
Sophomore,4,"I am not much of an online learner, but Clark has several options to help students like me learn from the online programs. which has been very nice."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy a welcoming environment. the staff and students all take pride in being helpful and respectful. I also enjoyed the outdoor effect that Clark has to offer. walking outside to each class gives me a chance t get some fresh air in between classes.
Sophomore,4,What I like most about Clark College is the great environment the students and professors bring every single day. I'm always smiling. Plus they all work together and make each other better people and better learners every day. The one idea I have to change would be outside of it.
Junior,4,"My over all experience over the last 3 and 1/2 years of attending Clark College have been good. I have had helpful admissions counselors and aids in scholarship app department. 95% of my professors have been excellent. I have been able to get into nearly all the classes I wanted to register for. I have had difficulty with the financial aid department at times. When I have asked for help figuring out what extra paperwork is needed for loans they have not always been the most knowledgeable. When trying to apply for a loan amount change related to a change in income they took my application and I never heard back. Since Covid started they have only been available via email which takes at least 2 weeks for a reply. They have tried to improve that will drop in Zoom appointments 3 days per week, though those were not widely advertised. Things have been a bit of a struggle for everyone with switching to online learning so I try to have a lot more patience."
Alum,4,"I took a few online classes through Clark and they can be hit or miss. Some classes require a weekly essay you post to a board with two responses required and then there are some that require no discussion posts and are solely quizzes/submitting work. Definitely look into professors on ratemyprofessors.com to find what learning style works best for you or what your schedule allows for, time wise. Overall online classes are possible to pass just some take more time and effort than others while still providing the same amount of content."
Freshman,4,"I have taken two classes online so far, and with summer and fall 2020 quarters coming up soon, all the the classes I have enrolled in are online. I enjoy the easy access of online classroom and how convient it is to do on my own time. I work a full time job so online classes have been really ideal for me. However, with classes being forced online due to the pandemc, it doesn't seem like some teachers know how to really connect with their students this way."
Sophomore,4,The environment is really nice with lots of open space on campus. There's a lot of trees and on nice days walking from building to building is definitely welcomed. The teachers are for the most part very supportive and want to see you succeed. They have a couple hours a day where they have to be available to help students. They even have a lot of programs to help less fortunate students with food or school supplies. The clubs also seem pretty interesting from what I hear.
Senior,4,"Clark is a wonderful school to study at.  I enjoy the small class size in comparison to studying at a typical four-year university. There's a huge amount of diversity present, which allows for many learning opportunities. Almost all of the professors I have learned from have been fantastic.  Here, I was able to earn credit towards my degree and discover other interests that I have.  Overall, I have been very blessed to study at this school."
Freshman,4,"Clark's system updates can make it difficult sometimes, and the leadership is always changing, but the staff all over campus is great and there's never a shortage of helpful people. The campus itself is lovely. They have degrees outlined on their website which makes it super easy to plan your time there"
Niche User,4,"I like how at Clark there are plenty of resources that students can have access to. For instance, I love how I can go to the quiet floor in the library and study."
Freshman,4,love going to Clark College. I think the best part is taking place in a sport with them. It will truly introduce you to a new family. It is a great in-between for athletes hoping to play for a university. The academics here are also very good. The only reason I would give four stars is because I have had some problems with the teachers just being in it for the grade and test but not actually teaching real good lessons.
Freshman,4,"Clark College is great for running start students. When I applied there as a running start student, everyone was really nice and supportive.  There are many guidance options, counselors, and centers to help students with their problems. I personally liked visiting the writing center for a tutor to review and help me with my assignments or just get feedback. Also, the campus is really pretty during the spring with the cherry trees blooming and the college has a variety of lounge areas to study and rest in comfortably."
Sophomore,4,I had a great experience at Clark. I felt I got a really good education for an affordable price. The STEM building is beautiful and I love the library. The teachers were all very supportive and helpful.
Sophomore,4,Most of the professors that I have had are very nice and treat you like an adult. They give you freedom over your schedule and are very understanding
Freshman,4,The classes are small and intimate with Professors that seem to care about you personally! They offer many degree and class options for students to experience different subjects to make a decision about their course of study. The campus is compact and easy to maneuver with easy access
Sophomore,4,"It isn't a big university, much closer to a community college, but it is good at what it does. I have had almost all great experiences with professors and other things on campus"
Sophomore,4,"I like Clark because it was a good transition school. They were very welcoming as I am in the Running Start program, and therefore still a high school senior. I felt very welcome here, and all of the professors have taught me well so far. It's nice having so many people my age here, because of the high school across the street."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Clark. I am a Running Start student, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be earning college credit while I am still in high school. The staff are very supportive and friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed Clark College. I thought that for the most part, all of the staff was ver professional and that they clearly were there to help you. There is always a lot of support available to students such as free food pantry, counseling services, financial aid, veterans benefits, and academic advising. I would definitely take advantage of as many of these services as possible since you are paying for them! I also found that the professors were very well educated and wanted to see their students succeed. I think Clark College is a great bang for your buck. I definitely recommend!"
Freshman,4,"I really like my teachers at clark and how low the tuition is. The area around Clark is very good as well, the food is very affordable and tastes good. I like the students here as well and how welcoming everyone is"
Niche User,4,Clark College is a great college. I plan on attending after I graduate high school which is only one semester away. They have great programs for any field you want. The campus is stationed in a good community which is even better.
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty laid back and easy to navigate, with helpful advisors and staff. Good selection of classes that are not to hard to get into. Friendly atmosphere with good professors."
Sophomore,4,"The staff are so nice and very helpful. Any problem you have there is a team of people there to help you every step of the way. The campus is very well kept and beautiful, especially in the fall. The professors are a hit or miss, but luckily most of my professors have been really good. They have a great selection of courses, and is an amazing school to do running start at because the head start you get on your college career is priceless. Clark is a great place to start off for students beginning their college career. They are always updating the college to make it the best they can for the students and professors. Also online resources are smooth and very helpful. Overall, it is a very nice community college."
Alum,4,"As a running start student I love that Clark College offers running start, it was a great opportunity to get a head start and save money in college. The professors felt very hit or miss with their teaching style, which is not on the school, but there were some classes I wish the teacher would've tried different teaching methods because everyone was struggling in their class. The campus is beautiful and I loved walking through it every day, but the surrounding neighborhoods aren't the best."
Niche User,4,What I liked about Clark College is that the instructors and staff are helpful and they host many events.
Junior,4,"Classes often fill up too fast, but other than that I have had a very positive experience with this school and had great professors who care about the work you submit and your future career goals. Lisa Staley is an amazing part of their art department with lots of experience teaching and has been a great resource for other resources. 
The only complaint is that because Clark is a running start college, I have been the only college aged student in a few classes, which was great for those students but limited my own education in those classes. I have had a professor take my essay to peer edit because she felt like I wouldn’t get appropriate input from the other students in the class because of this."
Graduate Student,4,Most of the instructors I had while at Clark College were intelligent and understanding people. I hardly ever got B's while attending Clark College and the students often keep to themselves. A peaceful environment.
Sophomore,4,"Clark college is a good community college, if you know how to look for it there's professors that are better than universities."
Sophomore,4,"I like the support available and activities you get to participate in, it makes it worth being on campus."
Niche User,4,"I am part of a early college program called running start, so I am a high school student that takes classes at Clark College. I love the diversity here, and students are generally very nice. I've also connected well with most of my professors."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Clark College has been good. The professors and office staff are willing to help any student as much as they can. As well as, many of the students are positive and have great attitudes."
Sophomore,4,Great campus. Nice student body and faculty. Large focus on diversity and acceptance. Wish there was a greater selection of online or evening classes.
Freshman,4,"Clark College is a small community college in Vancouver, but you would see students from 14 to 40 or older normally. The classes are slightly easier than high school classes and you can mix credits between high school and Clark."
Freshman,4,"The small class sizes make it easy for students to receive assistance from their professors. All the faculty is welcoming and passionate about what they teach, which makes for a great learning environment. They offer a variety of courses and an expansive schedule that gives students the flexibility in their schedules that they need. Overall and very nice school for an affordable price."
Freshman,4,Clark College has a good environment and good professors that genuinely care. The only issues that I've noticed is the parking can be very full and you could spend 30-40 minutes just looking for a spot to park and there are a limited amount of classes offered which could be filled up even before your registration time because students who have been there longer get first pick.
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere and the teachers are excellent. There were many different activities to get the students involved on campus. I've been very happy with the education that I am receiving.
Junior,4,"Clark college has taught me many things in and outside of academics. Navigating college on your own can be quite difficult, but the friendly, helpful staff and the many resources provided on campus made understanding how to navigate my college experience much more clear. Clark College consistently provides many resources and workshops. The teachers and staff members are also open and willing to give you extra guidance. I think Clark College does a good job at keeping the campus safe. They conduct multiple kinds of safety drills each term, provide e-mail and text message updates to students if the college is suspected to be unsafe, and have a security office on campus that you are able to call. I think they do a good job at welcoming diversity. There are different clubs that help promote community and multiple posters and flags that welcome minority students. 
Clark College could improve by expanding and provide more resources and classes for Art and Liberal Art students in general."
Sophomore,4,"Clark has a lot services to fulfill your needs. If you hungry & have no money, they have student pantry where you can eat for free. They have tutor services (stem, writing, languages) for free. Sometimes they have family movies dates, with free foods & drinks! Plus there are a lot of clubs for students to participate!"
Sophomore,4,"Diversity on campus is great. Most professors are excellent and very helpful and passionate about what they teach. There are tons of classes offered online or as hybrid classes, which is very useful for someone like me who has to work while attending school. It makes for a very flexible schedule."
Sophomore,4,"Clark College has been an excellent experience. The main reason why I like it so much is that the education I have received has been top notch. Overall, my professors have been not only great educators, but kind, caring and genuinely want us to learn and excel."
Sophomore,4,"Love the campus, teachers, and student involvement in activities. I would have liked more help moving onto a four year university. As a community college, I feel their goal should be to move students onto another school after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"The school is great about getting their programs out there, however the professors are a mixed bag. Some are awesome! other are awful! Then there is the running start program, most of the students that attend Clark are High school students. Which isn't a bad thing... it has it's pro's and con's."
Sophomore,4,"Clark college is an excellent place for people who want to further their education. This college is very inclusive of everyone and makes people feel welcome within the school. The faculty is very helpful and truly want you to succeed in what you are going for. I never once had a teacher turn me down for an opportunity to learn, even outside of class time."
Alum,4,Excellent community college. Many online and traditional courses to choose from at a reasonable cost.
Sophomore,4,Clark College is a college that celebrates diversity. Most of the professors are good. There is no on-campus dorms because it is a community college. It is a very safe college.
Freshman,4,The campus is beutiful and (realitively) easy to navigate. I would discribe it as big enough to feel open yet small enough still to feel like a community college. Their online interface is a little confusing at first but you do use canvas for most of your acedemic stuff and honestly it isnt too bad once you get used to it.
Sophomore,4,"There is a supportive atmosphere at Clark. Everyone wants to succeed. Your professors usually have too many students to get to know you individually, but if you have them again they recognize you. Parking is poor and students constantly hit other student's cars, without fail it will happen to you. Enrolling in classes can be challenging since there are so many students and not a lot of room or faculty. Great place to start your college experience though!"
Sophomore,4,"Instructors have mostly been very helpful. Campus is nice and new STEM building has great lab rooms. Staff is most often knowledgeable, library has many resources available. I would like to see more study rooms. This is a great college for completing general education requirements in order to save money with college."
Junior,4,"The staff is always more than willing to help, the students who attend are respectful and willing to help others, and form study groups. I haven't had a bad experience. The only thing I recommend for Clark is to have better Wi-Fi. Other than that, Clark has always done a outstanding job on giving students opportunities to attend free work shops of any kind, making a stress free environment during finals week,  work force opportunities, and so much more."
Freshman,4,"Clark college is overall a great school. They have a broad selection of programs and helpful staff to get people on the right path towards a degree. After 18 years I am back in school and I have to be honest, I was a little overwhelmed at first, but once I got there, it was easier then I thought to get set up and ready for school. They also have a lot of student events, an amazing library with great resources and lots of other things like a family movie night, and a discounted swim at Marshall Center."
Sophomore,4,I have had absolutely  amazing instructors and advisers. Without them I wouldn't of been able to grow to be such a strong student that I am today.
Sophomore,4,Clark College is great community college. Clark offers many different programs in many diffrent fuels making it easy to get a degree or certificate in something that you are interested in. One thing that Clark College could improve on is making more parking for the students and staff.
Sophomore,4,"Clark College is a great overall community college. Most of the professors care about what their doing and believe in what their teaching which makes a huge difference when its the other way around. Clark College offers a lot of interesting classes while earning my degree here I've taken a Rock Climbing class and a Scuba Diving class, where i earned my certification so now i can scuba dive almost anywhere in the world. Also there are many technical programs that are offered here at clark such as welding which could lead down to a promising career, also there are many ways to pay for tuition here like work study programs, so that is never a thing to stress over which is nice especially in college. Many students go here right after high school and earn their AA then transfer into a 4 year college because prices for tuition tend to be higher at a university. Clark is overall a great school for anyone looking to gain post high school education."
Sophomore,4,"This year I will be graduating with a General AA Degree. During my two years at Clark College, I have met many diverse groups of people, both in the student body and in the staff. Everyone is generally courteous and welcoming, and I have yet to personally meet someone who is not. Although improvements could be made to the campus, such as parking and building quality, I have been overall satisfied with my experience."
Sophomore,4,I went to Clark College for Running Start and would say that it has a positive atmosphere to it. The professors I had were super helpful (as long as you reach out to them). You'd feel involved here!
Freshman,4,"My experience with Clark College has been great. I've enjoyed most all my teachers. There were a couple that did the bare minimum and were frustrating in delaying grading. But they were the exception, not the rule. I've been to both the downtown campus and the CTC campus. Both are great. CTC is smaller and newer, and closer in proximity to me, so it's my preferred choice. I'm glad there is a community college choice that is so great in my area."
Junior,4,Clark College has a very clean and modern campus. They are on the ball when it comes to communicating to the student body. they always have ample computer labs and recently they added a culinary program which means a new cafeteria for the rest of the students!
Junior,2,Online learning is never fun and Clark College doesn't have it any better. Alot of information gets missed out or lost in the online classes and therefore the grades tend to get lower. Also the teachers don't always respond to emails right away or at all so alot of questions  to unanswered.
Sophomore,2,"Most professors aren't great with online classes. Course work is heavier and the ""learning"" part is not sufficient."
Sophomore,2,"Advisors aren’t helpful at all, you will hear multiple different things from different people and on top of all that it contradicts with what the website says."
Niche User,2,"I like that if you look close enough, you will find people dedicated to the success of students.  What needs to change is a lot but a good start would be communication. There should be a meeting with the heads of each dept monthly with e mail updates and inter department meetings to share the information from the meeting of the department heads."
Sophomore,2,I am not super impressed with the overall experience of Clark. The teachers and staff are not helpful and it takes forever to get information from anyone there. I ended up switching to all online classes because I did not like the atmosphere of the campus.
Sophomore,2,"Clark lacks diversity among other things, and doesn't have the best professors who seem to halfheartedly be participating in class. It was always rare to get feedback on work done in and out of school; and some professors simply weren't that nice to begin with. The school doesn't necessarily do much to make all students feel involved or as one, in regards to students understanding one another on a more personal level. There's a large array of students, and yet there isn't any common ground to be found between students, which is why I cannot wait to transfer."
Alum,2,There are a lot of students and not a lot of classes or parking. It was a fine school for an AA but I would not want to receive any higher education there. the staff is not very resourceful and finding help with can be very challenging.
College Junior,2,"The career center does a good job at helping students figure out what their options are, but the advisors do a poor job of helping students get there."
College Senior,2,"Not a very talented staff over in the career center. They are lacking in up to date material and their advice for your resume building could improve. They have interns with no experience looking over them. They take out anything that would make you shine in a resume, including volunteer experience."
College Senior,2,Transferring credits can be difficult... Especially as a person transferring away from Clark. The advisors don't really know what they are talking about. If you're not careful you will take classes that don't transfer. The best this to do in that situation is the be communicating with the colleges you wish to transfer to. Do not take clarks staffs word as the final world.
College Sophomore,2,As I mentioned earlier the GED prep courses I took were at a very sluggish pace for me.
College Student,2,Getting financial aid is kind of annoying.
College Junior,2,This campus is 99% white people but there is a very welcoming diversity center on campus for LGTBQA+ people and POC.
College Senior,2,It's a struggle trying to find classes that fill your degree requirements and your schedule. Sometimes you have to wait a whole year before the last credit you need is available to take.
College Senior,2,"My major isn't available at this school and I can't take any classes that involve this major. At most universities, you can take an intro class for my major, but you can't at Clark. I found the Associate of Arts degree program to be really boring."
College Senior,2,"The computers are quite slow. You get 15 credits for printing. There are designated ""quiet areas"" but people eat in there and talk. It's not quiet at all."
College Senior,2,"I don't like all the high school students who treat Clark like they don't care about anything. The student body is what really ruined my experience. I came to Clark to get away from high school, but I still feel like I'm in it. Instructors feel like they've had to ""dumb down"" their teaching because of these students."
College Senior,2,"Way too many high school students here. It's easy to get in and they obviously do not know what it is like to be in a college. They are obnoxious and act like children. The instructors even share the same complaints, as they are teaching to high school students. I've never had any problems with people who are out of high school."
College Junior,2,Online classes involved far more assignments and work to keep grades up than traditional classes which have more discussion and communication between the student and teacher.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only item I received post graduation was from the alumni association asking for money to help support the school. I was not there to find a job so my experience with the career center was non existent. My association with the college was simply a stepping stone to get to where I wanted to go, and for that, the school serves a great purpose."
Freshman,1,This is beyond a horrible school. The staff is constantly dropping the ball. You have to keep your eye on your teachers to make sure they give you the credit you earned and worked for. It’s a joke dealing with the staff. I have more than 4 horror stories but no space to tell them. I am now looking into PCC. The hardest part about going to this school is dealing with the staff and keeping track of the teachers and making sure everyone’s doing their job correctly. I will not give them another penny. I would rate them negative stars if I could.

Senior,1,"Went to Clark in hopes of finally obtaining my nursing degree. I wasted 3 and a half years here and have a perfect GPA the first time around, and when applied, was denied, can you believe I  was not able to get into the nursing program. Do not go here for nursing, do not waste your time, it is not worth the years wasted to obtain perfection and still be denied! Clark College wasted my time and money. They need to be investigated for their fraud."
College Senior,1,Students enrolling in online courses at Clark College must acknowledge an insurmountable deficit when it comes to becoming engaged with peers and digesting relevant and interesting information that would otherwise provide foundation for a well-rounded learning experience.
College Freshman,1,"In the begining of the quarter my financial aid didnt come through and i wasnt aware of it, so we had to pay for all expenses out of pocked. Then winter quarter was about to start and it didnt come through again so i went to the financial aid office to see what was going on and my financial aid informatin was lost in the system and i had to redo the entire thing. i had to re apply for a direct loan and the school didnt process it fast enough so i had to put my classes on hold and wait for my money to come before i could pay for my classes."
College Sophomore,1,Impossible to reach advising by phone. You have to wait in line for hours to see an advisor or in financial aid office. Financial aid office makes mistakes too often. My friend filed for a loan and they lost her paperwork.
College Junior,1,"The computer labs are pretty nice which is the only reason why I didn't give them a F but their wireless access kicks you off about every fifteen minutes on your phone whether you are using it or not, it took me forever to figure out how to print single sided (which I'm sure is what they do to save on printing), and there are not enough computers for all the students so really owning your own computer is the best way to go."
College Student,1,Test centers will accomidate those who have a disability or need help.
College Senior,1,"Not Helpful – The tuition is very high for a community college and they are not helpful at the financial aid office, nor do they grant you anywhere near the funds you need to pay for even your base tuition. i wish i never would have trasferred there. it was a HUGE mistake!"
College Student,1,"Depends on the Teacher, but Usually Horrid. Clark is always switching around its online software, and the professors have a hard time adjusting. My online teacher didn't know how to use the site and it could sometimes take me forever to find my assignment on the site because he had randomly put it in some obscure site location... If you have trouble with an online class don't be afraid to email the instructor and ask them what's up..."

Freshman,5,It was challenging but the teachers were always willing to talk. The teachers always made themselves available t students.
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful. It's all in one area and everything is easy to find. The people are so kind and accepting. The professors and coaches are so adjusting and willing to help out if needed.
Sophomore,5,"So far  I've had a wonderful experience at St. Mikes. The students are very friendly and chill.  It is a very eclectic group with a diverse array of interests and hobbies, I have friends that are exactly like me and those who I differ from completely, which makes for an interesting experience. the overall social atmosphere is way more laid-back than high school. The campus is very small but it can be nice because you always see friends around. It is a fully residential campus so it's not hard to get to know people. The majority of professors are very good and the material tends to be intriguing.  As a result of small class sizes, the professors and staff look out for your academic well-being and provide you with support if you need it. Overall, there's a great sense of community there,  Both among students, staff, and the alumni network. If you are interested in the small school vibe I highly recommend it."
Alum,5,Saint Michael's College will give you the college experience you want. Everyone lives on campus all four years and the classes are small so you know your professors.
Senior,5,"I could not have asked for a better undergraduate experience. Being such a small school allowed me the opportunity to work closely with both my professors and classmates. The school provides numerous internship opportunities in your field of interest, no matter what it may be, but you do have to seek them out. Overall, I would not change anything about my SMC experience."
Alum,5,"I was impressed with the quality of my education, the devotion and knowledge of instructors, the support provided for students, and opportunities for experience in and out of the classroom. The community is service oriented and passionate about justice and equality for all."
Freshman,5,"I couldn’t be happier with my decision to attend SMC and to be a student athlete. The campus is in a beautiful town with tons of activities, professors are hand on and students are friendly and tight knit."
Sophomore,5,"Its a small school, but everyone is so nice and it feels like home! The campus is just outside of Burlington and provides access to so much of beautiful Vermont, especially in the fall and the winter."
Freshman,5,Its a great community to be involved in. I have found my place at home here and I really enjoy everything about it.
Junior,5,"Saint Michael's College is a great small school. They offer students lots of services on campus and are very responsive to students' needs. The faculty have strong relationships with the students because of the small campus environment. Often, you will know most people on the campus as everyone is highly encouraged to live on campus all four years."
Alum,5,SMC was a wonderful place to spend four years. I was apart of MOVE at SMC which is their community service organization. I really enjoyed being apart of such a loving welcoming community. I miss it every day!!
Freshman,5,"I love it here! I was a little homesick at first, but most people are when they start college. The professors are very nice and the school is small enough that you see most faces, but big enough that you don't know everyone here."
Alum,5,"SMC changed my life. The friends I have today, those closest to me, we’re friends I made during the first week on campus. It will feel like home to anyone who attends Saint Mike’s."
Alum,5,Great small college that had a strong community!  Teachers that actually know your name and cared about you.
Alum,5,"SMC brought me the happiest years of my entire life. I can't give this school enough praise. The professors care deeply about students' success, and the students care about each other.

If you're looking for a big school atmosphere in which you will be anonymous, St. Mike's isn't for you. Otherwise, go here!!! I would do it again in a heartbeat."
Junior,5,I love that it is a school with a smaller population and that everyone lives on campus. It's on the outskirts and reminds me of home but just a few moments away is the city of Burlington.
Freshman,5,"I wouldn't change anything about this college. I really like that they tend to their student's need as fast as possible and in the best way they can. My experience with the environment, the campus, the professors and everything has been great."
Freshman,5,"Small, residential college, small classes, professors know you, adventure club, close to mountains, Lots to do in Burlington"
Sophomore,5,"I loved the small classes and how I knew all my professors. Everything is close together, making it easy to get places. I knew people from all 4 years, which was nice too."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 1990 with a degree in English and the academics were excellent. But I loved most were the people. I am close to many of my classmates and we have become lifelong friends. We also had more fun and have more amazing stories about life at Saint Mikes and the Burlington area than any person has a right to. If I could do it all over again, I would go to Saint Michael's College. I loved it there."
Alum,5,Graduated 34 years ago.  My St. Mike's friends are still my very best.  Went onto graduate study at Columbia U. and NYU.  Did a lot of growing up there.  St. Mike's is commited to the success of all students.  My Alma Mater and Vermont will always be home.
Junior,5,Saint Michael's is a safe community.  There is many opportunities to expand your educational experience.  It's very easy to get involved in clubs and programs that you are interested in.  I recently came back from studying abroad in Uganda and it was a wonderful experience that I am grateful Saint Michael's gave me.
Freshman,5,"St. Mike's is a lovely school. The campus is beautiful, and everyone here with rod hard to make you feel at home. Plus St. Mike's has so many wonderful opportunities, I don't want to be any where else! "
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school because it is the perfect place for me. Plenty of clubs, sports, and activities for everyone to enjoy. Lovely community feeling where everyone can feel included."
Recent Alumnus,5,Would do it all again in a heartbeat--it's home!
College Sophomore,5,Saint Michael's College is a very open and welcoming community that appreciates each  student and sees each as a unique individual.
College Freshman,5,It's an extremely safe campus. Public Safety responds very quickly and effectively if there are any safety concerns or issues.
College Freshman,5,"The professors and variety/quality of classes here are excellent. Professors genuinely care about students and are very helpful and available if you need extra help. So far, I've only had one professor that I was not keen on. For the most part, my professors have been really passionate and knowledgable about their subject, and are just generally really nice people too. I've really enjoyed the classes I've taken here so far. As a liberal arts college, there are plenty of interesting and unique classes that you wouldn't find at a large state school. Course registration is a little stressful, but that's expected."
College Freshman,5,"I cannot imagine going to school anywhere else. For me, it's the perfect size (not too big, not too small), the location is great (close to a big city, but surrounded by nature too), the professors are really passionate and engaging, course options are interesting and expansive, there's lots to get involved in, and, best of all, everyone here is extremely friendly. St. Mike's is like one big family, and although you see people you know everywhere, you're constantly meeting new people too. Overall, it's a really happy, easygoing environment full of great people."
College Sophomore,5,"Classrooms are great, professors are welcoming and go out of there way to get to know you as a person rather than a student. Variety of majors here is amazing!"
College Sophomore,5,"Feel extremely secure here. Public safety however goes a little

Bit to the extreme for unnecessary instances."
College Sophomore,5,"Despite a few shortcomings here and there, Saint Michael's is a worthwhile experience."
College Freshman,5,"It's very easy to get alcohol and weed here. Partying is FUN! And you can easily go to the 3's for some nightime parties. Parties here only happen on Friday and Saturday nights. Make some friends and join in on the fun, it's not crazy like in the movies. Just some drinking and hanging around, maybe some dancing. Nothing crazy."
College Freshman,5,"As long as you don't party every night, it really doesn't affect the student experience. Not everyone drinks either, there are plenty who don't participate. And that's fine."
College Freshman,5,"This has to be the safest campus ever. There haven't been any major incidents this year, and I walk around at 3am sometimes in the dark. There is no threat here, and campus safety is always driving around."
College Freshman,5,"Housing is the BEST! I easily got into a dingle (a double that's a single). They take everyone into consideration and the dorms are amazing, (some of them). They're kept pretty clean too."
College Freshman,5,"If you are looking for a warm, welcoming community to call home for college, this is the place! Every tour guide at any school is going to talk about how nice the people are, but here it is actually true. Everyone holds doors for each other and smiles. Not to mention there is a very high percentage of students who regularly take part in community service so that also speaks to what kind of people attend this school. All the professors are very kind and understanding and are always just an email away (they will answer!). As far as parties go there is always something happening on Saturdays, but if that is not your thing it is very easy to find other chill people to hang out with who enjoy card games, playing guitars, watching movies, etc. The academic buildings are always accessible if you want to watch movies on a big screen. Overall, this is an amazing school and I am so happy I came here!"
College Sophomore,5,"I have such a wonderful time at Saint Michael's college. I have really felt welcomed by students and staff alike, and have formed such strong bonds with people in such a short period of time. I cannot wait to go back next year and meet new people, learn new things, and see old friends."
College Freshman,5,I love the close community the school has to offer. Everyone gets to know each other well.
College Sophomore,5,There are so many choices of amazing food in and around Burlington.
College Freshman,5,"Burlington has some of the best places to eat! Knight Card is also accepted at a lot of locations, and student discounts are everywhere because it is such a college town. Sweetwaters is great for when parents come up to visit, and some of my personal favorite cheap and delicious options for an afternoon out are Boloco and Ali Baba's Kabob Shop. Coffee shops are also abundant."
College Freshman,5,"One of the reasons I chose to come to Saint Mike's is because of the financial aid package. They are very generous and accommodating, and especially love if applications have an emphasis on volunteer service."
College Freshman,5,"Burlington and Winooski Circle are great places to grab a bite to eat off campus. There is a variety of options in both places, and they are both just a bus ride away."
College Sophomore,5,"For a small school, there are a lot of good looking guys and girls. Mostly white, with lots of bean boots and pea coats, but friendly all the same. No one will care if you show up to class in sweatpants either. It's chill and there are lots of attractive people here."
College Junior,5,"I love the Burlington area. There are always activities going on, especially outdoor!"
College Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed living off-campus, but it can be difficult to find quality housing."
College Freshman,5,"Half of Saint Mikes campus is wet. Thus, if you are 21, you are allowed to drink. However, this wet campus is right in the center of campus and they throw parties Fridays and Saturdays. When the weather is nice, everyone parties outside. Everyone is welcome and noone is exclusive. As the weather gets colder, the parties start to happen in the houses. Most of the time they will let you in. Its a small campus so everyone pretty much is friends. 

You can even find parties on Thursdays. I've gone to a party almost every thursday at my friends apartment.

So if you are into partying in a friendly environment, this is the place for you. It's a totally different then a big school. IT's better. Everyone just wants to have a good time and you feel safe here."
College Freshman,5,"Saint Mikes is 5 minutes away from church street in Burlington. On this street you will find shopping, restaurants, bars, and a few night clubs. There are also many events that take place here including a Saint Patricks Days Parade and the Art Hop. There is a free bus that takes you to Burlington and the other towns around the campus. In the neighboring towns you will find 3 other colleges including University of Vermont. The students here are as friendly as the ones at Saint Mikes and it is easy to go to their events and parties.

Saint Mikes is also located near lake Champlain and Mount Mansfield. This allows for skiing, snowboarding, hiking, swimming, and kayaking. It is beautiful and you will never run out of things to do."
College Freshman,5,Couldn't have asked for a better life on campus
College Sophomore,5,The options of dining are amazing. We are in a great area that has so many different types of  dining places you really can't be disappointed. We have a good amount of places where we get discounts with I am thankful of.
College Sophomore,5,"Every Student at out school is extremely nice and welcoming. I have yet met a student who has been ride, mean, or unpleasant. The community at our school is positive and exciting. Everyone is themselves  dressing their own way and having their own interest. I have never seen anyone to be judged or made fun of. I have seen many people make strong relationships only after the first year!"
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the atmosphere where Saint Mikes is located. We are so close to Burlington which is such an advantage! There is always something going on Downtown, events, shopping and more. At our school I always feel safe and student are always outside playing music and sports having happy and positive attitudes!"
College Sophomore,5,"Burlington is an awesome little town. Students get to take the busses for free so we can easily commute into town. It's a beautiful town and Lake Champlain is gorgeous. A lot of shopping and cheap dining options, cool boutiques and a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,5,"Being in Vermont, there is absolutely zero discrimination between any sex, gender, race, ect. It is a very welcoming and accepting place, especially around Burlington."
College Sophomore,5,"Safety has never been an issue or area of concern here, I have never felt unsafe or in danger once here. It's a safe and close environment even late at night."
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't trade the students or staff for the world. I love it here and how everyone is so friendly. There's real way to describe the atmosphere except with the fact that people will hold all doors for you and you can't walk anywhere without seeing someone without saying hello. My only wish is that I could move the campus and people somewhere warm. Even that it's cold, I still wouldn't trade that for the amazing times I have at St Mikes."
College Freshman,5,I have genuinely grown interested in topics I never thought I would even give thought to. Classes are interesting and provide a great education. I feel as though that each class gives me a thorough understanding of fuzzy topics I may have skimmed before in high school as well as advanced ideas.
College Freshman,5,"From a freshman's point of view:

The nightlife is incredible. Plenty to do. Usually how it goes is people hang around the dorms to start, then end up walking to parties at the 100s, 200s, or 300s later on in the night. Saint Michael's tends to start the process a bit later than most other schools so the night goes as long as you make it. When friends visit from other schools, they all tend to love it and want to return ASAP. Another big thing is that, because there's no greek life, there's no hierarchy during parties, which is great because it leaves the options of what to do on weekends wide open. There's also plenty of people who do not go out and have plenty of fun; usually those people tend to get housed with or near each other."
College Freshman,5,"Printing is free, you can get wi-fi all over campus (also free!), and free tech-support."
College Freshman,5,Burlington was voted America's #1 college town. Enough said.
Freshman,4,"It's a good school, nice people just a tiny campus and not a lot of choices in regards to club sports and stuff."
Sophomore,4,"Professors were very understanding with online classes, and tried their best to accommodate all students. Overall, not bad given the situation."
Freshman,4,My professor was so understanding and was willing to accommodate to all of our schedules. He understood that we were all seniors in high school and that we have lives outside of schoolwork. All of the course work was easy to find and very accessible. He made all of the assignments easy to do on a computer which was nice. This was a great gateway course into actual college classes without actually having the pressures of being in a class.
Freshman,4,"Bottom line is, SMC has very good academics, professors and ROI. I got a huge merit package to attend. Campus food is GREAT. Alliot Dining Center is brand new and it shows. BUT, everything else about the college is mediocre. I’m an athlete and the facilities are the worst in the NE10. Lots of students athletes aren’t serious about winning or academics. The school is also claustrophobically small. I knew it was small, but didn’t realize HOW small. President Sterritt needs to launch a new strategy and get alumni, businesses etc to make a huge investment in the college or getting students to come to Vermont is going to be really difficult."
Freshman,4,"I'm going to Saint Michael's and it is now the second semester of my freshman year and I love it very much. A year ago, I had no idea what a liberal arts education meant, but now I feel as though I was meant to be here. I love learning about everything from philosophy to Christianity, to computer science and mathematics. Everything here is beautiful and I am happy knowing that I am already a much more well-rounded student after just 1 year here."
Alum,4,One of the best things about Saint Michael's College is the academics and the amount of attention that professors are able to provide to each individual student. There are many opportunities for students to get to know professors and other staff on a personal level. They serve as excellent resources when it comes to finding post-graduate plans.
Senior,4,"I love the small class size of Saint Mike's. The professors get to know each and every student and they are passionate about their jobs. They want you to be successful and all assignments/exams are fair. It is in a great location with many outdoor activities to do, especially during ski season."
Senior,4,"The best aspects of Saint Michael's College are its academics and location. I have learned a lot of valuable information from professors who care and the school is located in the best and most vibrant college town in America - Burlington, VT. It also has countless cultural activities in the surrounding areas as well as outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing."
Junior,4,"Even though Saint Michael's is a small campus, having the opportunity to connect with professors and peers and building close-knit relationships makes the college experience highly enjoyable. I have always been the type of student who likes to build relationships with teachers and classmates; Saint Michael's has certainly let me interact with my professors outside of the classroom and feel comfortable talking to them about daily events. It is so relieving to know that my professors know how I learn and what I need in order to succeed in school. I would love to see Saint Michael's expand and build/add new resources that will help develop more majors/minors, activities, and community events. The President of the college and all of the students aim to make Saint Michael's a friendly, welcoming, and positive environment so that everyone can have a great experience."
Freshman,4,"Everyone here is so nice! We have really good academic programs, cool extracurriculars, hundreds of talks and presentations that are really interesting to attend, and most of the classes here are under 30 students. You really get to know everyone here and it's just a nice community to be a part of. It would be nice if the school was a little more diverse, but that's just northern Vermont I guess."
Freshman,4,The campus is amazing. All the professors know you by name and they really go out of their way to make sure everything is going well for you there. Don't be afraid to get involved in things around campus because they have a lot of fun things to get involved with.
Junior,4,"I loved how small the school is; I always see someone I know, but still constantly meet new people. I also really enjoyed the small class sizes. All my professors know me by my name and are always willing to help students. Lastly, I loved playing on the hockey team here."
Alum,4,"The location was perfect.  There are so many activities off campus and being near Burlington and the lake is awesome.  Everyone is friendly, students and professors.  Don't let the ""saint"" word scare you away as people are not very religious.  There weren't many options for classes to take and it was especially hard to change majors or come in undecided. Traditions are fun and quirky.  It is very cold.   I like Saint Mike's!"
Sophomore,4,"Everybody here is really passionate about what they do. Students and professors. That liberal arts mentality of leaning for its own sake and valuing the humanities is strong here. I wish there was a film studies program so I could double major, but my experience with the English program has been excellent.  If you want to study what you love, this is a great environment for that. Academics are challenging and immersive once you get past the introductory classes, and 100 level courses are always really interesting without being overwhelming. 

In terms of student life, the area is excellent. Burlington, Essex, Winooski, and Shelburne have a lot to do. People here are really active and you should have no problem finding people to hike, ski, or otherwise head off-campus with on the weekends."
Freshman,4,"Overall, St. Mikes is a great school.  I have certainly learned a lot during just my first year, and there are so many options for what to do.  There are a wide range of majors you can choose from, and you can switch if you want."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve seen some comments on the topic of diversity that I would like to address. Yes, the student body is primarily white. However, St. Mike's addresses issues of diversity well. We have a bias response team to address incidents when they happen, and the college is adding a class requirement on topic of diversity and inclusion. As for political views, it's true that most people on campus are liberal, but false to say that we don't listen to differing voices. We organize a lot of events surrounding difficult conversations about political issues that we try to get conservatives to attend, but often they refuse because they see us as 'liberal snowflakes' that are just trying to 'educate' them. Conservatives are free to speak their minds on campus, they just have to know that just because someone disagrees with them does not mean that their voice is being squashed."
Senior,4,"Despite its small size, St. Mike's packs a punch. It offers plenty of academic and recreational opportunities for students who want to get the most out of their college experience. The professors here are my favorite aspect of the college; they deeply care about their students and their work. As I near graduation, I feel that this college prepared me with essential life skills that go beyond knowledge from my major. I am much more confident, a better person, and a better critical thinker than I was 4 years ago. While there are certainly aspects of the school that could be improved (diversity, parking, athletic facilities), St. Mike's in general is a great place to be. I'm definitely going to miss the sense of campus community and the Burlington area once I graduate."
Junior,4,The community at SMC is amazing. Everyone really cares about one another. This includes the staff and faculty as well. I would just like to see availability of student life and maintenance staff increase on weekends.
Alum,4,"I loved St. Mikes. The location and the atmosphere of the school made it a great experience. The campus is beautiful and minutes away from Burlington, the classes are small enough for professors to know you one-on-one, and the campus itself is small. With roughly 2,000 students, St Mikes is more than just a campus, it's a community."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love SMC! It is a beautiful campus with many opportunities. We've had a problem recently with some hate-filled actions since the most recent election, however with more educational programs and talks and panels, we've seen less of it and it definitely does not represent the majority of the student body."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Michael's College provides a welcoming community that feels safe, inviting, and overall loving. The professors truly care about the success of their students, and you are more than just a number. At St. Mikes you get to choose your career path, however you also get to take Liberal Studies Curriculum which helps widen your education to more than just your major. The only thing I would change about Saint Mikes it their parking situation. It is not the safest to have first and second years having to walk a mile to get their car. Also the housing system should be run by more than one person to be more efficient."
Sophomore,4,The Saint Michael's community is one of the best I have seen is so many years. Everyone is so nice and are willing to wait in the freezing cold to hold to door open for you. The professors here are all so nice and want you to succeed in college. I have had some of the best professors and would recommend Saint Michael's to anyone. I love it here.
Freshman,4,"Great school. Loving community, professors push you to work hard and want to see you succeed. Great location, pretty close to Burlington and lots of great night life on/off campus. Large dorms,  most buildings are updated and well equipped. Be ready to push yourself and work hard."
College Sophomore,4,Overall I feel like I made a good decision to attend St. Mike's. I don't think I could see myself anywhere else. The community is amazing.
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe here.
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Mike's has such a welcoming community, and that's what really sticks out to me. No matter who you are or what you're in to, you can find a place here."
College Sophomore,4,I have loved most of my professors and have found my of my classes to be useful and interesting. They use diverse teaching methods and try to be clear with their expectations.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing process is a little tricky, but the housing it self is nice."
College Sophomore,4,"Students really enjoy getting involved with campus activities. There are multiple career options apart from work study. Being near a college town, there are work options outside of the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are average sized, but everyone is seen as an individual. Professors are really down to earth and are eager to share their knowledge."
College Sophomore,4,"Doesn't matter what time of day I'm in the area, I always feel safe. Especially with the fire station right across the street."
College Sophomore,4,"I am applying as a transfer student, and I've only seen a freshman dorm building. It isn't huge, but no dorm ever really is. This is a good size, however, for simply living. And there are plenty of room for storage spaces."
College Sophomore,4,"Not everything revolves around athletics, but getting out and trying new things is a big part of the college experience here."
College Junior,4,"Saint Michael's is great with old-style traditional teaching methods. However, when it comes to using newer technology and incorporating new methods with their teaching styles it tends to generally lack understanding on behalf of both the students and the professors."
College Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year, so I have not really looked into internships or jobs that much yet. From what I've heard from upperclassmen and alumni, however, finding a job after graduation does not seem to be a problem. Our career services is really helpful."
College Freshman,4,We have some really nice new residential suites for upperclassmen. The freshman dorms are pretty standard. I like how close all of the dorms/suites/townhouses are to academic buildings and the dining hall. The housing process is a little stressful though since its a lottery system and you never really know what you're going to get.
College Freshman,4,I've had great professors so far.  They're caring and generous.  Very understanding.
College Freshman,4,There are so many classes offered and the class size is great.
College Freshman,4,Saint Michael's College is a liberal arts college located in northern Vermont. I love the inviting atmosphere and social events on campus. My professors are friendly and always willing to help me. Everyone at Saint Mike's is extremely friendly and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,The science and business majors here are offered a lot of opportunities both during school and after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,The science and business majors here are offered a lot of opportunities both during school and after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"Great school. Academics is great, people here are beyond friendly. Professors are always there for you. Its like a little family away from your real family."
College Sophomore,4,"One of the greatest qualities about the school is the accessibility to professors. They are easy to talk to after class and are always willing to set up appointments if I desire. Sometimes I visit their office with no academic intentions but just to talk and see how their life is going along. They are always fair and with the small classes at Saint Michael's, ready to answer any in-class questions. They are open to constructive criticism and will listen to feedback I pose to them."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great diversity in classes available and professors that teach them. Though the registration process can be a burden, I've enjoyed most of my classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Michael's offers a home to those willing to look for one. I've found tight-nit circles to bond with and become a part of very easily. If you're looking for a small school that feels like a family ready to embrace new members, this is a good choice for you."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network basically is your gateway into the world after you graduate. You can contact any of them that graduated with your same degree and they'll help you. Finding a job after St Mike's is easy, and the faculty here is VERY helpful with this kind of stuff."
College Freshman,4,"This is an amazing school. The campus is beautiful year-round. The people are amazing and always supportive, friendly, and outgoing. The professors just want you to succeed. The only cons are the difficult academics and the tough financial aid. Overall, this place is my home."
College Freshman,4,"This school is amazing, the people, the events too. It's just the challenging programs here. If you have trouble passing a class or just need help they assume that you can't be in the major. I'm having a tough time this semester and I feel so alone with how to solve this issue. I passed a course with a 74, I need a 75 to move on and they won't comply. This school is very challenging and I sometimes feel I am not getting my money's worth."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are great and so are the people. I love the one on one attention you get from your professors in class and how you see the same faces everyday walking back to your dorm but also different ones as well. There are a good amount of international students who study at Saint Michael's College adding diversity to campus and everyone is accepting of everyone.
College Junior,4,With Church Street so close it's really easy to get a fix for whatever food you're craving.
College Junior,4,"It really gives you the chance to grow and monitor yourself and they are pretty lenient about first time offenders, but if you mess up a lot they won't be."
College Junior,4,For such a small school there are so many different options for housing.
College Sophomore,4,"It was a simple application process, but it did take awhile to get my check after it was applied to my bill."
College Freshman,4,"The school housing is very quaint and tries its hardest to put you in the type of community you would fit in with and get along with. The rooms are of average/small size but the walls are paper thin and you can easily hear what is going on next door or across the hall. The RA's also try to frequently hold updates and meetings, offering certain events to attend etc. Also as a freshman very close to class buildings"
College Freshman,4,"As long as you respect Saint Mike's and what it stands for, you will be fine."
College Freshman,4,"No judgment here! It's a great community that is welcoming to all lifestyles, and the parties can be fun. Although, the 300's could be a bit overwhelming at first."
College Freshman,4,"Although it is not ideal having only one dining hall, everything is edible and they do make an effort to always have healthy options. Knight Cards can be used at a lot of great places in Burlington though, so that's awesome!"
College Freshman,4,I  love the honors housing option; it is a great way to create a social environment.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are awesome, and easy to get to know. They are really dedicated to their jobs and will do anything to help you succeed. Registrations is easy and online, but you have to get up early and do it right on time if you want all your classes. Workload depends on your major, and what classes you are taking. You spend 3 hours a week in class and are expected to spend 7 hours outside of class. Classes are like a full time job. There are many options to help with studying, and class help on campus. The library is the most popular study spot, with two silent floors it is easy to focus."
College Freshman,4,"Apply using the FAFSA and Saint Mike's will do their best to accommodate you and your needs. Letters of appeal are always welcome, but may not always solve the problem. Campus ministry can sometimes help with scholarships for books and such. Saint Mike's tries to make it as affordable as possible. The biggest amount they may award is merit scholarships which is completely your responsibility to do well throughout high school to earn."
Alum,2,"I found that the professors within my major were some of the most intelligent and dedicated professors out there.  If the rating were just based on professors, I would give it 5 stars without a doubt.  I can't speak for other majors, but within the Business department, these professors are insanely talented.  Unfortunately, though, the school is run poorly and a lot of the best professors have been offered buyouts from their tenure without any replacements.  It's forcing the remaining professors to take on more classes, and it's common sense that the quality of teaching decreases with the larger workload.  Not only that, but if you need financial aid, best of luck to you.  The financial aid department is easily the most unorganized, joke of an office (I had to report them to the Department of Education to have them fix a mistake they made)."
Freshman,2,"Good college that has taken a turn for the worse following financial trouble. Freshmen class started at 450 and was 370 at the beginning of the second semester. Campus life and party culture has eroded with the loss of North Campus, the only fun activities around here are drinking and freezing trying to find a party. few knowledgeable and passionate professors but the rest are average at best. Food is just terrible, isn't just bad tasting but is some of the greasiest, unhealthy food I have ever eaten.  Public Safety is overbearing and ticket happy, severe shortage of parking. Housing for upperclassmen is actually quite comfortable if you get a good spot, but the rest of the options for unlucky students or underclassmen are marginal at best. Typical student is friendly but very cliquey, lots of townies from New England that would pass as a high school student in other parts of the country. Burlington is a great college city not too far away, but it's really boring on campus."
Alum,2,"For a school who preaches diversity it lacks extremely as you will have a political agenda pushed on you and your ideas will be shut down if they differ. Every single class will in some way, shape or form bash on conservative ideas and conservatism as a whole. If you plan on being an athlete in college, Saint Michael’s is not the place for you. The administration handles problems poorly and does not spend their money wisely. Burlington is a great area though and there is plenty of bars, restaurants and fun things to do downtown. All in all, if you like political agendas pushed on you in a learning environment, a school who uses there funds towards radical speakers, and one way thinking, come to Saint Michael’s. We will welcome you with open arms, of course only if you agree with everything we think."
College Junior,2,The town surrounding the school isn't that well off so it can be kind of sketchy and we aren't really allowed to live off campus anyway.
College Senior,2,Many things could be improved in Athletics.  Varsity athletes (with the exception of basketball teams) are treated like DIII athletes and subpar compared to other DII facilities and treatment.
College Freshman,2,"Varsity sports are definitely not everything on campus. Which can be nice because it prevents cliques and hierarchies. The teams aren't that great, but people don't usually come here to play a sport, they come for the education."
College Freshman,2,Pretty bad. Nothing tastes wonderful. You can expect at best average tasting food. They put better food out when prospective students come visit.
College Freshman,2,No one lives off campus unless it is with family
College Sophomore,2,"No one wants to live off campus, everything that happens happens at school. Sometimes it's even weird to go home for a weekend because you miss so much. "
College Student,2,"New assistant dean is cracking down. This is not a party school watch out. Freshmen are forced out of dorms because they are afraid to get caught drinking and must go off campus or to the townhouses. RD in freshmen housing is a complete asshole! He will try to get you caught for anything. A lot of RA's however are lenient and will not get you in trouble unless you are actually harming someone. Overall, the school is becoming a little too strict and is affecting kids having fun and a college experience. "
College Student,2,"The worst part of Saint Michaels! The food here is very repetitive and bland. In addition, the hours are horrible on weekends so sometimes you can only get two meals in a day. It seems as if the hours are based off of Sodexo employees rather than the students needs. The food quality is very poor compared to other colleges I have visited."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics aren't taken seriously by anyone except the students who came to SMC to play sports and the freshmen who were brainwashed into joining a club-like DII-III team. 
College Freshman,2,We were given an extremely expensive ticket for a small parking violation.
College Freshman,2,"Since the college is located in northern vermont, it get very cold up here fast. However, the snow comes faster which makes for early skiing. The fall season is extremely beautiful. "
College Freshman,2,"My major is engineering. Essentially we do not have engineering based classes. Instead we have an engineering program called the 3-2 UVM and 3-2   Clarkson. Which allows to be living on our campus and taking classes but instead taking the specific engineering classes at either UVM or Clarkson, Which ever is preferred. Overall for engineers its fairly good. Work load is heavy, you are at least doing homework 4 hours a day. Especially for engineers it harder. To be a college student here it is expected of us to do at least 40 hours of homework a week.  Unfortunately i do not know the internships that are available to us. "
College Freshman,2,"A new student center is being built, and I hope it lives up to my expectations. Alliot is not really a hub of activity, a void that hopefully Quad Commons will fill. Academic buildings are antiquated but tech-friendly. Athletic facilities are from a bygone era; work needs to be done there."
College Freshman,2,Not really very diverse at all. Everyone is from 20 minutes outside of Boston
College Sophomore,2,"Cold and Cloudy – The Burlington area is beautiful in the summer and on those rare warm sunny days, but Vermont is also very wet and rainy. In the winter, its absolutely freezing and snowing all the time... which is good if you're a skier! But, those cold, dark days get very depressing. It's not all that bad though if you know how to make the best out of the weather."
College Sophomore,2,Its kinda easy to find a spot to park however the security gives you tickets all of the time if you park in the wrong area even for a few minutes.
Alum,1,I graduated before COVID-19 happened so I never had to take classes online. But if I had to guess how it went for students I'd say it was probably terrible! Everything at this school is poorly thought out and planned.
Alum,1,"This school is falling apart FAST and the only thing keeping it afloat are the generous donations from alumni. SMC's tuition discount rate is more than 50%. Meaning on average they give more money than they take in from students which is totally unsustainable and why they have a multi-million dollar deficit. 

Enrollment has shrunk immensely from what it used to be. Moody's Investors Service actually downgraded the school's financial status and warned of a ""negative financial outlook"". Unless you want to graduate with a degree from a nonexistent college, don't come here. It's bound to close in the next 10 years."
Sophomore,1,"I’d say 90% of the “professors” are not helpful. They have hours for the students but are rarely even around for it. I’ve gotten tutors that barely know the subject and can not help at all. The buildings are old, upkeep is bad. They have issues with people breaking into the dorms but keep it quiet because they don’t want bad press. The tuition is really high for what u get. Strongly suggest to look else where"
Freshman,1,"Saint Michael’s is an alright school. Their academics don’t go above and beyond, but they are decent. However, the campus climate is downright depressing. Students lack involvement on campus and a large amount of the student body has money and means to find enjoyment elsewhere, which is why campus is always dead. The dorms are okay. The administration is quite uninterested or at least lacks the real potential to help diversity grow at all on campus. There is remotely no diversity and there seems to be an uproar in racially motivated incidents on campus. In addition, the food is not great and they have limited options for students who must stick to certain diets. Public Safety and RA’s show a clear motive that is to get everyone in trouble rather than being there for the community and often times the RA’s break rules. Parties are lame and everyone just stands around and gets drunk and damages property."
Alum,1,"* Uninspired teachers. My high school teachers were so much better honestly.
* Essentially entirely white student body. Boring.
* Zero sense of school spirit. No one really cared about the sports teams.
* Nothing to do on the weekends on campus. Theme house parties are pathetic.
* Absolutely freezing winters January - March. 
* Disgusting food in the cafeteria.
* Dorms were terrible freshman and sophomore year. Went off-campus junior yr.

I STRONGLY recommend UVM over SMC. Cooler students, more to do on campus, bigger student body. Burlington has a decent bar scene but even that got old by junior year. Graduated in 3.5 years because I hated the school so much. Thank God I did a semester abroad junior year.   A shame my high school experience was so much better than college. Also I had a good amount of friends at SMC, most of the lacrosse team to be honest."
Senior,1,"I want to see the diversity at Saint Michael's College expand.  The school touts it's diversity, but the school is predominantly white, with the only diversity truly existing in the one year exchange programs, and in the basketball team- it's brutal but honest to say so.  The school does a good job addressing problems, but cannot actually stop the problems in the student body from happening.  The faculty are well equipped to teach, but don't have the funding to really let the programs reach their full potential."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have greek life on campus therefore I cannot comment
College Freshman,1,"It's split because personally i do not like the campus dining but other people will like it. Lunch is the best and i do not like dinner. You actually see a lot of people going out, ordering, or just staying inside the dorm to snack, trying to avoid campus dinning. A positive review on it is, there a good amount variety for all different food lovers. "
College Freshman,1,"Its not that our sports teams are not good, its mostly that don't have much student involvement. The students on campus hardly know when there are games. There are no signs, announcements that are hard to find. Also club involvement is poor. There was even one club that was disqualified for a year because there wasn't enough students. Need work. "
College Freshman,1,"Pretty much every weekend, you'll see people roaming the halls going from dorm to dorm and drinking. Alcohol is very accessible to the students. However, if you don't drink the students will not pressure you into it or be condescending. Instead they'll say, that great man and smile. But be prepared to not be invited to parties and not having people asking to hang out with you. They'll be extremely friendly to you, but you wont be their 4th choice to hang out with. But! There many students who do not drink, which a lot of friends groups will form who do not drink  and will find many other activities to do.  "
College Freshman,1,"The food majority of the time is not that pleasing, especially if you are a picky eater and like your food cooked well done. Some days out of the month they will surprise you with a meal that you will enjoy and eat a lot of since very rarely there is something enjoyable."
College Freshman,1,"Even if there is a discernible population of Asian and African Americans on campus, they all hang out together; there is not much intermingling between races here. Diversity makes the college experience so much better and the school needs to do a better job at taking advantage of affirmative action (while it's still an option)."
College Freshman,1,The only diversity on campus are the people recruited for basketball and the Chinese scholars.
College Sophomore,1,It snows alot here and its often cold for many months out of the year.  The walk to class is okay everyday but its always windy with blowing snow.

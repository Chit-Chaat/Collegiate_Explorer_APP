Alum,5,"A great community of people with such diversity and knowledge. You are highly encourage to participate in clubs, athletics, and outside projects to broaden your perspective."
Alum,5,"I really like online courses compared to in-person courses because online courses give me more flexibility to work on these assignments or projects. Online courses are a good fit for those who need to balance work and school life to be more flexible. But it really depends on your major. Overall, I enjoyed the online course experience."
Sophomore,5,The only time I took online courses was during the COVID pandemic. RIT did a great job handling the transition from in person to online teaching
Sophomore,5,I am going to RIT for my second degree and I could not be happier with my choice of going back to school there. RIT and its professors really want you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,"RIT is the type of school that won't be fun unless you go out and enjoy what they have to offer. The community can be pretty solid if you hang around people whose company you actually enjoy. Some regulations can be limiting for campus life, like no lofted beds, only 10% of wall space can be used, no campfires, and things like that. Other than that though, if you join a few clubs, go to events, and enjoy the sports. You can definitely meet new people and you get the most out of this school!"
Sophomore,5,"I loved how inclusive everyone was: the faculty, students, and families involved were great. There are so many opportunities on campus and they prepare you for the real world. You can very easily pursue and further develop your interests."
Senior,5,"The faculty will always be there to work with you and the campus, while voted ugliest campus quite frequently, is absolutely beautiful. They add additions and improvements every year and really try to show that they care about their students"
Senior,5,All online courses I have had to take through RIT went very well. I was on internship over the last semester so I did not experience first hand the switch to online due to current events.
Senior,5,"I've taken a handful of online classes. They have all seemed rather encompassing, and they honestly didn't have too much trouble transitioning to all online with COVID."
Senior,5,"Honestly, I love(d) it here. The raising of tuition is obviously not ideal, but is common across most, if not all institutions of higher learning."
Freshman,5,I overall have really enjoyed my time at RIT. I've felt good about the basic stuff like academics and housing but honestly the thing I've liked best about RIT is the people. I have met some truly wonderful people at RIT and I love the overall campus atmosphere.
Alum,5,"I'm really happy with the return on investment I got with my degree from RIT. I was able to very quickly get a job and all of my friends have very high paying jobs working for large tech companies like Google and Apple. The student life scene is a little lackluster, but it exists if you try to find it."
Alum,5,I took several courses online while at RIT and all of them were very well taught. There was lots of support from professors.
Sophomore,5,I have had a great first year as a Photography Major at RIT and I know I made the right choice in school. Most teachers are very supportive and are there to help whenever you need it. I have made amazing friends within my field.
Sophomore,5,Almost all of my classes transferred to online very smoothly and I was able to continue learning efficiently. Only issue was not having any photography facilities.
Alum,5,"I graduated from the Game Design and Development program in 2019 and when I first arrived at RIT I wasn't sure I would fit in. It is one of the geekiest schools in the country and definitely not your average university. As the years went on, I visited my friends from high-schools universities and realized just how great RIT was. I like that the students were mostly nerds and that they were very driven. It has a very unique culture that you fall in love with. They force you to do co-ops in most of the technical majors which sounds like a pain at first, but when I graduated I had more experience than most of my peers who to went to other schools. I found it extremely easy to get hired while a lot of my friends are still struggling to find full-time careers. I am also considering RIT for graduate school in the near future. RIT has so many resources to help you with your career objectives and a lot of cool clubs and organizations. I definitely recommend RIT."
Alum,5,I have not taken online classes at RIT but my friends who did had nothing bad to say about them. The workload was manageable and they found that it was nice to not have to go into physical classes.
Sophomore,5,"During this Spring, I took all courses online because of the COVID-19. Compared to on-campus learning, I found online courses to be easier for me to learn because I am able to learn them on my own pace and able to enjoy myself better than showing up in a course and have to stay with the pace of other students."
Freshman,5,The one thing I love most about RIT is the amount of resources available for each student no matter what they are pursuing academically.
Freshman,5,Go to an Open House. You get to have lunch with the professors. They remember you from open house!!!  Love my professors. Have great friends. Join clubs and having a job isn’t hard!!! A++++ love RIT
Freshman,5,"Although not having the most beautiful campus, RIT should be highly considered by any New York state resident due its unfathomable generosity, inclusion, and diversity. From high-end academic programs to countless clubs and social opportunities, RIT upholds an unforgettable impression to any potential student. I have recently been accepted for the upcoming fall semester, and cannot be more excited. I have toured the campus twice and currently have a handful of friends attending RIT. RIT upholds amazing opportunities for their students with co-ops, which help students find a job within their field. Also, RIT is well-known for giving generous financial aid packages that are equivalent to the overall prices of SUNY schools. If you are looking for a school that is welcoming of all and cares about the future of their students, then RIT is for you."
Freshman,5,"As a first year student, I enjoy RIT.  The professors really seem to care about their students and there is plenty of academic support available.  I feel safe on campus.  I am local to the state but, if you are not it may take some time to adjust to the weather.  
Overall, I like it here but there are a few negatives.
-Food (D)    little selection beyond fast food items and the dinning hall is awful but you are required to buy 5 meals there per week.(first year only) 
Dorms (C+)     the dorms have strict rules and there is heavy competition for the one microwave per floor.     

Additional note - This is not a party school.  If your major focus is on academics, this is the place for you."
Freshman,5,The support that the staff provides to students both in their academic life and health is amazing. The staff plans events for relaxing and students can be involve in it too.
Niche User,5,"The staff and faculty at RIT are approachable, warm and tolerant.  They make an effort to ensure that students succeed.  Even when a student fails, RIT doesn't throw her/him out! RIT has a fantastic College Restoration Program that goes to the bottom of the student's programme and provides personal mentoring and coaching to encourage the student to move back into a 'performing' mode. RIT genuinely cares about their students and they want them to succeed in college and through their professional careers."
Niche User,5,"When I visited, I saw lots of places and opportunities for me to succeed since RIT provides many chances for their students to succeed in life after one or two semesters in their major."
Freshman,5,"I love the many undergraduate research programs included within the college of science. The campus is huge and very diverse and I feel honored to come here. Although the tuition is pretty high, they award a lot of scholarships, and make it worth it. The professors are wonderful and are very passionate about what they do. The professors are very reachable with emails and of office hours times. RIT also has a lot of programs and study centers if you need help with your courses. There are so many people on campus willing to help each student be the most successful that they can be. Students here always have something fun to do with the various events that happen all around campus. The food here is not too bad, and the many coffee shops are extremely helpful to stay awake through the early morning classes. I love being a student here at RIT, and I am very excited to continue my college career here."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this college! It may be pricey, but it has almost everything I need to for my dream job. The only thing it doesn't have are classes for vets, this is a technology school that's more widely known for its science and technology here. The deaf teachers are suuuuper friendly and you can come to them for help at the appropriate appointment times whenever you need it."
Sophomore,5,"This is an amazing school with all sorts of different activities that us students can partake in, as well as multiple places for getting food. Over all a 10/10 school would recommend."
Freshman,5,"Rochester Institute of Technology is a great school with a lot to offer. The wide range of majors makes it easy to find your place in the school. Among the faculty, everyone is very friendly and makes an effort to make sure that you are doing your best."
Freshman,5,"I think the people are as friendly as can be.  Everyone is understanding and compassionate.  Although, anybody can be accused of anything and get in trouble for it with no merit to the allegations."
Sophomore,5,"RIT has been absolutely wonderful so far. Their Technology-based programs are top-of-the-line, and their facilities are tailored to the needs of students. The faculty are amazing, and opportunities for on-campus jobs allow students to make some money while getting their education."
Freshman,5,The photography program is exceptional. The professors and other students are very insightful and helpful when it comes to critiquing work. Everyone supports one another to the best of their abilities and connects students with opportunities. There is plenty of opportunity for study abroad and activities in clubs and different academic programs.
Freshman,5,"I love how this school provides so much experience for everyone! I am only a freshman, first semester and I feel involved with my education due to the amount of hands on experience I have received this far. I feel that going to this school is a great choice because I feel like after I graduate, I will feel prepared to find a job because of how much RIT takes care of their students and values their education."
Junior,5,This school has amazing professors and resources that will prepare you for the workforce. The required Co-Op program is an amazing way for students to have real job experience before graduating.
Freshman,5,"The admissions office was very easy to work with. The college of engineering was also very helpful. Move-in day went smoothly, and the college really seems to care about helping new students find their way."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from Monroe Community College. 

Rochester Institute of Technology is exceptional, welcoming, and enjoyable.

The class sizes are relatively small compared to other colleges."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman in RIT, I've enjoyed being here. The classes are very vigorous and straightforward, the diversity is immense with over thousands of different races, and there is over 500 clubs to join and engage. One thing I would change would be the food on campus."
Senior,5,"The professors are very passionate about their fields and in teaching. I feel that the college does a great job in pushing students to get work experience. It makes students find co-ops so that when they graduate, they have the experience need to achieve their goal of getting their ""dream job."" 

I'm in a major that doesn't not require a co-op to graduate, biomedical sciences. But I was able to get plenty of research experience and learned quite a lot while in the lab. RIT helps you find mentors so you can stay occupied in the progression of your careers and give good advising."
Junior,5,So far so great! I just wish there were one app or something that shows all events happening because I feel I miss a lot of what I could go to.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful and lush green campus. The sports training facilities are pure classy. The university shuttles have great connectivity to nearby markets. The library has some of the best collection of books, journals, magazines and very comfortable seating on a the floors. On campus dining offer great food with frequent visits by outside chefs offering Indian, Japanese, Columbian food items."
Junior,5,"RIT is a really good school if you're interested in the technology side of everything. Everything from the liberal arts college to the business college all have large aspects of the technology involved with-in them. Overall a great place to get an education, But the U of R is right next door, so..."
Senior,5,"I love that Rochester Institute of Technology is a large school with a small school feel.  The number of students on campus allows for many niche classes and clubs to be offered.  However, you can still find your home within the sea of people and feel connected to the many students here."
Sophomore,5,"The students here are overall good, interactive, and understanding. The professors are even more understanding of students, and often work together with students to work out solutions to any problems that may arise."
Sophomore,5,"RIT is mostly known for their technical majors, yet every major is very strong and the students are very passionate about what they do. Everyone is quirky in their own unique way."
Junior,5,"RIT is a great school with excellent academic program and learning opportunities. The school is inclusive to all people and has great diversity in the campus. Most people want to help you and enhance your learning and working experience. The only thing I would say would need to change is lab instruction. I do not know if this was just my professor, but she did not offer any outside help to navigate the lab and how to use the equipment."
Sophomore,5,"It's really great no matter your major!! Super open to anyone and you'll fit right in no matter who you are! Incredibly safe, I haven't even heard of anyone being raped or hurt!"
Sophomore,5,"Rochester Institute of Technology has a wide variety of activities, courses, and career paths that a person can need and makes sure that everyone has the tools to succeed. My first year opened me up to new opportunities that would be hard to find anywhere else."
Freshman,5,I love that RIT have coed with deaf and hearing people together. I love their services with helping kids if they don't understand their classes or struggling with financial needs or etc. I don't see anything to improve their changes.
Freshman,5,There is tons to do and you most certainly will meet people that you will be life ling friends with. There are tons of places to go if you need help with a homework assignment or just a different teaching perspective.
Junior,5,"I love this school! This school is a great investment and I will definitely be prepared for the next chapter in my life. The only knack on my experience is that the city of rochester is really boring. I've been to Austin, Boston, LA, and a ton of other cities and must admit that Rochester has to be my least favorite."
Sophomore,5,My experience here in RIT has been exceptional. The location isn't the most lively but i strongly believe based on the intensity of the course. It is safe to say it works best for students so they can concentrate. RIT provides opportunities for students to be themselves without any discrimination. I recently got elected as an academic senator of the Kate Gleason College of engineering. I thank RIT for giving me the platform to grow my leadership skills. A lot of the programs still need further growth.
Freshman,5,RIT is committed to helping its students succeed. They offer students multiple ways to make their voices heard. The transition from high school to college is a simple and painless process at RIT.
Senior,5,"Great school! They provide a lot of help with studies, grants, scholarships and so much more. They are driven to give the students the best educational experience possible. The school is not far from Downtown Rochester either which is great."
Freshman,5,"The best thing about RIT is the people. Everyone who works and goes here is extremely nice and helpful. Plus the coursework is rigorous no matter the major. An important thing to consider: food. There is a wide variety here and they make sure to have vegetarian and gluten free options. The def community also has a large presence here, enriching the overall diversity of this campus. The wide range of students studying different fields allows for new ideas and all these people come together through common likes and interests. Even if you're not a fan of the brutalist architecture, you'll find where you fit and feel right at home here at RIT."
Freshman,5,I love this school. Positive learning environment and no pressure to do anything you don't want to do.
Sophomore,5,RIT has given me amazing opportunities just within my first two years of attendance. The Photography program is exceptional and I look forward to all of the specific and engaging classes I will be taking the next two years. RIT has given me the opportunity to apply for internships I would have never dreamed of being qualified for so early in my professional career. The exceptional connection to alumni is very helpful and allows its students to not only see where an RIT degree can take them but also opens up amazing resources in professional fields that have been pertinent to my success during my search for summer internships. The diversity on campus is also amazing. As a gay women I feel very safe and accepted at all times.
Sophomore,5,"RIT is a place where what you give, is what you receive. If you don't socialize and make efforts to meet people, you will be lonely. If you don't put in hard work, you won't succeed. I had  to take an academic year off before realizing that RIT is an amazing school, but only if you're willing to take advantage of all that it has to offer."
Freshman,5,"This school is amazing! Great faculty and students. Very diverse! It is a STEAM school, so there are art and math which makes it academically and culturally diverse."
Niche User,5,"#2 ranked program for game design and development.  Also, my father grew up in Rochester and we still have family in the area.  So, it will be nice to have Sunday dinner with my grandparents from time to time."
Senior,5,"This was the best choice I have made so far. The academics have been awesome, I have made many friends and found my passion and was able to advance myself to a career I want all because of the resources and people at RIT."
Alum,4,"Overall, very organized online learning systems. Some professors do take advantage and just use the same lecture recordings every year. This lead to a couple less personable classes."
Sophomore,4,"This school has many great programs to prepare you for your future career. Though, my only issue is the constantly rising tuition. The nerdy culture is perfect for me, I feel like I belong here!"
Freshman,4,"Rochester Institute of Technology is a great school in terms of providing a safe space for driven students to succeed in any environment following their graduation. Although it is not a very lively campus, the student body and it's numerous inclusive clubs and programs are what make RIT a fun place to be."
Freshman,4,"Amidst the horrendous year we've come to accept as 2020, RIT has done a great job to contain the virus and continue to keep their students safe. Although this has come at a cost to the overall campus experience. Professors have been proactive and been able to adapt to any situation concerning the virus whether it be split classes, fully online, or asynchronous."
Junior,4,Taking classes in person is definitely the way to go when it comes to RIT and it’s professors online doesn’t convey the same effect
Alum,4,RIT is a great school! Most of the professors are great and friendly with deaf students. My education experience was very great due to support services and good professors.
Sophomore,4,"The professors always tried to use the online platforms like RIT MyCourses to send out assignments and grade them. However other professors weren't as consistent with their online platforms, so going to class would be the only way to get certain information."
Junior,4,"I’m a photo student at RIT and overall RIT is pretty good. This school is really what you make of it. No, it’s not the prettiest, yes, it is mildly segregated, and yes, the majority population is white nerdy guys. But if you are looking for something you can find it. Some buildings are really cool and there’s a nice forest behind the dining hall. There are groups and parties that are race-specific but if you don’t belong to that group and want to participate you’ll be welcomed in. And there’s lots of fun and interesting people. The school is big enough to where you don’t have to interact with the people you don’t want to but small enough that you’ll always see people you know when walking around. Yes, I think this school could be better but I love it for what it is. PS anyone who says this school is diverse is a white person seeing a black person for the first time. There’s not that much diversity."
Junior,4,"It's nice, but not that nice. Pretty much depends on your major and how willing to get the maximum out of it."
Junior,4,"Professors are overall good. Depending on your major and how willing you are to work with them, you can get the most out of it, or just be another snorting face in the class. STEM is indeed very good, but still depends on what's your will power to get through it and what take out of it."
Senior,4,"The quality of education at RIT is phenomenal, however, I wish it were more affordable. Even though I am receiving a decent scholarship (about half off tuition) the cost is still outrageous and every year they raise tuition by almost $1,000."
Junior,4,Professors are nice and friendly and they are helpful to students who are struggling either academically or mentally
Sophomore,4,"Online learning was overall pretty good. Its a lot different than in-person classes, which I prefer because you can ask questions better and the environment is more suited for me. It is easy to be distracted with online learning and if you are not in a space where you can learn efficiently then your retention of material and overall grade can suffer."
Junior,4,"The online experience at Rochester Institute of Technology is like most online experiences. All course work is done virtually. The Professors are dedicated to your learning experience and are available to meet in zoom meetings, emails, and calls for any support they can offer to aid in your success."
Junior,4,"Rochester Institute of Technology is a culturally diverse educational experience that brings technology to the forefront of your education. RIT has integrated classrooms that connect your education directly to the technology of the future.  RIT is an opportunity to learn, grow, and begin the road to the career of your dreams."
Sophomore,4,"Rochester is a very intuitive institute with many help centers, as well as clubs to help you find your 'people'. Most, if not all of the professors welcome questions and help out in office hours when reasonable. The only problem I would point is the character of a few students. Not toward all students of course, but some tend to blatantly discriminate toward others, no matter if it is on the matter of race, sex, intelligence, and whatnot. That being said, this issue is only on  the character of some students, not RIT as a whole. Also, I hope they revamp the campus in some way, because they have A LOT of bricks lol."
Junior,4,"The education I'm receiving from the school that invented software engineering degrees is unmatched. It is clear that my major has been tweaked to by future proof as well as process and design based rather than just programming. The friends I have made through organizations within the computing college are some I know I will have for life. 

There have only been 10 snow days in the history of the campus and classes are not cancelled when there are dangerous weather conditions. The new president, Munson, tries his best to relate to the students and be active in the community, but usually falls short. He shows at some of our D1 hockey games with his wife Nancey and will even sit in the student section to cheer on the boys. Hockey at RIT is by far the most entertaining pastime and I will be a season ticket holder as long as I live in the area."
Senior,4,"I've taken a few online classes at RIT and they haven't been too difficult. They seem to be pretty average. It's easy to fake your way through without trying hard, but you obviously wouldn't learn as much that way"
Senior,4,"I've really enjoyed my time at RIT. Though there are a lot of students, it feels like a small community. The faculty can be hit or miss. There are a ton of great professors, but also some that aren't the best. I'm very glad I decided to attend RIT"
Sophomore,4,"May not be the prettiest campus in the world, however the people when you first get there are extremely friendly. Coming from the northeast, it was a breath of fresh air hearing someone stop and say hi for no apparent reason. RIT is a hard school, it is academically very challenging however not impossible. If you put in the work, you will get results."
Freshman,4,"The online experience was okay. The only online classes I did were after transitioning some of my classes to online due to corona and I suspect that most of the difficulty of that was due to the difficulty of transitioning classes to online in a short amount of time, not inherent to RIT."
Freshman,4,"Things I like about RIT are the environment, people, classes, foods, etc. I chose RIT because of major and deaf support."
Senior,4,"I have taken classes online in general as well as due to the COVID pandemic.  Of course, this is not the professor's fault but the classes meant to be online and those thrown online were  extremely different.  Overall, the online classes went well as long as the professor also cared about their students; generally the students of RIT want to learn so I found much of the online confusion came from the professor's behalf."
Senior,4,"I love RIT, I did NOT want to stay in New York but am so happy I did.  Their photo programs are amazing.  Being in such a tight- nit community helps their students thrive moving forward.  Its amazing to have professors care so much about the wellbeing of their students which is beneficial too.  On the other aspect some people, professors or staff, are only there for money and do not care for the student body wellbeing.  I think this should change immediately.  I hold a high position on campus as the president of an organization and I see the behind the scenes as well as what as shown to prospective and current students.  I think this college would soar miles above the rest if there could be full and unconditional support to the student body, and should that not be possible, the open conversation of those situations as an option."
Freshman,4,I have taken a few extra credit classes and I was able to learn as if i was physically there. Their online learning programs fits all types of learners and it allows lots of participation during classes to ensure noone is left behind.
Freshman,4,"RIT is generally a great school. From very welcoming staff to students that greet you with a simle, the environment makes one very comfortable. I was attracted to RIT not only for their excellence in technology but also their diverse teaching, as they give full support to all academic areas. I have much more time to spend at RIT so I am still learning of their practices."
Senior,4,"RIT has great programs for all majors.  The most valuable part of the curriculum is the co-op requirement.  This means that working in your field while enrolled as a student is required, which gives puts students a head above the rest.  Not only does it look good on resumes, it also helps immensely to relate what students learn in the classroom to real-world experience.
RIT also has a multitude of clubs and organizations, so there is something for everyone.  This is a huge help for everyone, but particularly those who are just starting to make the transition to become a college student and in need of a community to count on.  There is also a huge emphasis on diversity all throughout campus."
Senior,4,"Taking online classes at RIT depends heavily on your professor.  Some are extremely organized, and others fall short in that category.  Either way, you are bound to learn a lot from the class if you are willing to put in the time and effort.  You will get out as much as you put in.  My online experiences have all been very good."
Freshman,4,RIT is a great school with many different resources for its students. There are many good professors at RIT who are professionals in the topics they teach.  They have a D1 hockey team that students are able to get free tickets to home games.
Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed attending RIT and feel that I missed out on a lot of great opportunities and experiences when we were forced online. I feel that I missed out on a lot of quality discussions between with professors and classmates. However, I am particularly bummed about missing out on the campus life. RIT provides many opportunities to get involved in a vast variety of activities where students can engage with other students. I once heard a student say that “RIT is a place where you don’t get bored... unless you want to be bored.” After spending a month on campus I had discovered the truth in that statement. There was always an event to go to each week and I found clubs to join that thoroughly surprised me with their uniquely supportive environments. My favorite aspect of RIT is by far the campus life, though I shouldn’t demur the advanced academics."
Sophomore,4,"Rochester Institute of Technology is my only college that I ever attended to. However, based on my overall experience, the college feel nice to go to. The campus is massive. The food is great. Most of the professors are very friendly and willing to help even outside of the classes. Of course, there are some things that I am not happy within the college, one of them is the dorm."
Freshman,4,Student activity on the weekend instead of week days. Pool hall was hardly open. Bathrooms could be cleaner in the dorms
Senior,4,"So far, my experience with the Rochester Institute of Technology have exceeded my expectations. The professors are top of the line and genuinely care about your success during your college career. RIT's Co-Op program has allowed me to connect with many companies and gain real-world experience before I graduate to ensure that I am more than well-prepared."
Junior,4,"RIT has great academic programs, the engineering department is very well put together and the sequence of classes is very clear. There are many opportunities for students to join all types of clubs."
Sophomore,4,The professors and staff are nice and friendly. They are always willing to help. Students are nice and friendly as well. Lots of different food options.
Sophomore,4,"RIT is a wonderful school, full of opportunities for all students. There is a caring community, and endless resources to help students."
Freshman,4,"I wouldn't change a thing about my experience there so far. They give me all the tools I need to maximize my potential, and have a great mix of technical and creative focus in their classes which is exactly what I am looking for in a university."
Sophomore,4,"I am a student athlete at RIT. My experience has been very well so far, my classes have been relevant and informative and for the most part, I have had very good professors. I am kept very busy by my academics and commitment to athletics, so it can be difficult to participate in a lot outside of those two things. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed my first two years. The return on investment is amazing, students are well prepared for their careers through their classes and especially their co-ops. I am in the Physician Assistant program, so I do not do any  co-ops but I will do rotations in my  fifth year, where I will get a lot of job experience."
Junior,4,"The rigorous academics and focus on co-op education will always shine as RIT's most outstanding features. Truly, nothing prepares you better for the real world than real world experience coupled with a great education.
Furthermore, RIT offers tons of clubs and activities for pursuing passions outside of education. My skills in various hobbies have developed wonderfully in my time here.
Admittedly, the school isn't perfect due to various administrative difficulties and a shifting focus of priorities (from being student-centered to being research-centered). It's an unfortunate change of heart that spits in the face of what drew me to the school in the first place."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see the improvement in food places. Not only that, they need to improve the prices on food."
Alum,4,"It is a very academic and career focused college, with cooperative education requirements students must fulfill in order to graduate depending on their program of study. Due to this requirement, many students end with industry experience and job offers well before graduating. RIT offer's a campus wide career fair once each semester with companies such as Apple and even Microsoft coming to scout talent and offer internships."
Sophomore,4,"I just started at RIT in the Spring 2020 semester. I've enjoyed my experience so far, there are many intelligent and caring professors. Some people complain that it's a depressing campus, but you just need to put yourself in situations to meet people. There is also something to be said for the seasonal effect that may influence this opinion. I've only attended for about 2 months, but I think if you can get good financial aid it is definitely a worthwhile technical school."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very lovely and the admissions team is extremely friendly and helpful. The only change I would make is to have a little more outreach to incoming students. Updates are frequent once accepted, but die down quickly and many things are not stated that I had to find out had to be completed in order for acceptance and living arrangements to be confirmed."
Sophomore,4,"Rochester Institute of Technology is a great place to meet new people, make great connections, and really learn about subjects you are passionate in. The workload is fairly tough but if you stay organized it isn't difficult to succeed. My only complaint about being here is the price of tuition but I believe it will be worth it in the end."
Freshman,4,"There are many clubs and organizations on campus, so no matter what you're into, there's a spot for you. The professors are all great and easy to talk to, but I do think that the academic advisers need to be more accessible. It would also be cool if there were regular public transportation to downtown Rochester and other regular events that take place in the area."
Freshman,4,"Overall a good experience, there are certainly a few things to be desired but there isn't anything a student could possibly need that can't be accomplished on campus, or within a 20 minute bus ride."
Sophomore,4,It’s a pretty good school. Many Teachers are nice and willing to help you. There is a great community here for everyone and people are so accepting. The Only thing I would say that I don’t love is the winter.
Sophomore,4,"As a graphic design major, overall I have had a wonderful experience at RIT so far. I've met many wonderful people here, and both faculty/staff and students alike are very kind. RIT is full of many useful resources that are hard to find elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, an amazing school with lots of opportunity. Excellent computer science, engineering, and game design programs with intensive classes and labs. And while some classes can prove to be on the challenging side, the college also offers many options for tutoring, studying, and academic success at the ready for any students struggling or just looking for a little extra help."
Sophomore,4,"Overall RIT is a great school. Like anywhere there are some ups and downs. For instance, the dining halls aren't too great, and not every dorm hall has air conditioning. However, most of the professors are amazing and willing to work with their students to help them succeed"
Senior,4,"I like the safety of the campus. I feel safe walking around any time of the night. The academic buildings and the labs are open 24/7 and there are plenty of vending machines around. There are some nice people around, even though they are mostly white."
Freshman,4,"Great school academically. I love it here. Pros: easy to get everywhere, dorms are pretty good, I feel super safe here. Fixes: food is alright, hard to connect with other students (not a ton of events)."
Sophomore,4,"Many of the professors and staff members are very caring and flexible. As far as change goes, I would like to see more support and flexibility when it comes to students who are dealing with mental health issues."
Junior,4,"Great education, co-op program is great. It is a hit or miss with professors, some are amazing, others are really bad. Food isn't very good,  campus is all brick."
Freshman,4,"RIT is a college of mixed ideas and people. The majors vary, but a majority of those enrolled are apart of a STEM major specifically engineering. Like any college, there are the good and the bad individuals, but finding a group of bad people is hard to find.The NTID (National Institute for the Deaf) is a entire community that those who are not hard of hearing or deaf should defiantly go and interact with. Sporting wise it's a hockey campus all around with two separate ice rinks. The clubs have everything and anything you can chose from, including one's you never thought of. The goal of the college is to get you a job and RIT makes it apparent that you are here to get an education to go into the real world, not feel like you must stick around longer than you need to. The community here strives to gain skills then actively use those acquired skills in any and everywhere. Nothing is wasted here as long as you try."
Freshman,4,"Since I've been at RIT the staff and upperclassmen were all very nice and welcoming to all the incoming students, Academics here have been challenging but that I believe that if its too easy then the school is pointless so having challenging courses are teaching me good study habits. At first, it was difficult to find new friends because of im very reserved but sooner or later you will meet people that you connect with and very easy to talk too."
Sophomore,4,"I love being at Rochester Institute of Technology. My favorite part about being here is the people. I've never had friends at home the way I have friends here. The ora of the school is very positive and exciting in a way. I also love all the different class choices, clubs and opportunities that are given here. There is also a food share that allows for people who cannot afford to buy food to come and get free food. Although, I wish that not everything on campus was closed so early on Saturday and completely closed on Sundays. For example, the food places on campus."
Junior,4,I really like that Rochester Institute of Technology has so many great opportunities. I am a Diagnostic Medical Sonography major and RIT is one of the many schools that offer it. I love my program and without RIT and probably would not have been so happy. RIT offers a great amount and variety of courses that you would not find at other universities. RIT is such a large school that you see so many different faces each day. It is crazy to think about how many people actually go to RIT and the wide variety of diversity that it offers. I have met many of my best friends here and am so glad that I chose to attend Rochester Institute of Technology.
Graduate Student,4,"I've only been here for a few weeks but the staff, professors and students are kind and helpful. The professors are very knowledgeable and always looking to help."
Sophomore,4,"RIT has been a good experience for me so far. The only issue is that I might need to transfer due to money issues I am currently experiencing. Besides that though, the students, professors, and faculty have been amazing."
Alum,2,"Online lessons depend greatly on the professor. There is no standard online framework for professors and students to follow, so be careful."
Junior,2,"I have taken one class online so far and the professor didn't seem prepared to teach it. It was a class in the Computer Science department, and he just put all of his slides online and gave us weekly quizzes and assignments. We were expected to meet up with our partners in person weekly and there were questions on the slides that were unanswered because he did not give us his speaker notes. Overall, the slides were very detailed and included most of the information needed, but the class felt very impersonal."
Sophomore,2,"I am an African American  student currently enrolled in RIT's Saunders School of Business. Being from a somewhat Southern and diverse background I was used to sometimes being treated differently based on the color of my skin, but RIT takes it to another level so much so that the school is almost completely segregated in the student social life. Minorities often only sit with minorities also to avoid issues. Freshman year I was often asked for ""N-word"" passes by white peers along with noticing that specifically students of color from cities were often labeled ""hoodlums"" or dumb by our white peers without them having a single conversation or social interaction with us. At one point s group chat was made which included predominantly white students who would often say very judgmental and distasteful things about minority students. The party scene is also very segregated as there are often white parties or the minority parties which have naturally become very separated."
Freshman,2,"Rochester Institute of Technology had academically satisfying online courses before COVID-19 quarantine for some classes, but due to COVID-19 everything was understandably thrown out of wack. They did not provide successful alternative textbooks for ALL classes in order to accommodate the many students that had left theirs in their dorms for spring break before quarantine. I personally suffered from this and was very disappointed from the lack of help provided by the school and the teachers. English and Art textbooks and books in general are expensive and buying additional ones should've been unacceptable."
Freshman,2,"The professors are good but the campus life is terrible. Overall, I would not recommend this school unless you don't mind the lack of a party atmosphere and diversity."
Senior,2,"I have not had a good time at RIT. I do not feel prepared by my education for getting a job after graduating or ever just for a co-op internship. The professors are good for the most part but that is about the only good thing I can say about RIT along with diversity.

I'd say look for another school unless you are hard of hearing/deaf (NTID is fantastic) or looking to be antisocial/a stereotypical nerd/geek."
Junior,2,"The dorms are very old and dark. They're much smaller than other college dorms. They over enroll, so you can't live in dorms past freshman year, and they basically force you to sign up for housing beginning in October your freshman year. This means you'll end up with complete strangers and a disasterous situation. They affiliate themselves with park point American campus that scalps students for money knowing their housing is the only option for those who cannot drive to class.
The campus is an eyesore. Despite having ""leading"" design programs, they manage to put up monstrous signs on the buildings using comic sans and papyrus. 
RIT is not truthful with their students, they will cover up any controversial topics. A student’s suicide was called an “accidental fall”. They will not address their health center or counseling center who have been the main focus of student petitions. Prepare to be ignored as a paying student."
Senior,2,The teachers were not very kind and I didn't really feel as if anyone guided me through the college process. I kind of felt alone and confused during a lot of my academic planning and it took a large toll on my mental health and wellbeing.
Graduate Student,2,"My experience was very poor after a few incidents of major administrative oversight. 1. My homophobic roommate threatened my life, I had to find an alternative housing situation due to this poor assignment and lack of judgment on part of the Housing Department. 2. the change from quarter to semester affected the number of credit hours in our transcript, therefore, additional courses were required after meeting requirements, additionally, councilors were not privy to changes and made major clerical errors as to what classes were available and when. 3. key faculty members in were leaving and replacements were seldom offered for required courses. 3. internship registration had clerical errors and major problems.
I had entered under a set of expectations given by admissions that weren't met or were outright lies. I felt the money could have been used elsewhere at a comparable school that didn't have as much oversight and neglect."
Sophomore,2,What I liked about the Rochester Institute of Technology is that photography students such as myself have access to a lot of different equipment that we can check out for and use for not only our class assignments but for personal shooting as well. What I would like to see change is the amount of work given for each class and have class times be consistent and to cut down on the level of difficulty for some of the classes
Junior,2,"I'm a current animation student at RIT and although the campus is beautiful and the Henrietta area is pleasant to live in and has a lot to do, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at RIT. The faculty do not seem to care at all about the wellbeing of their students or even about what they are teaching. I have been in multiple classes and labs where we sit in silence for 45 minutes watching our professor struggle to use Adobe After Effects, TVPaint, or Photoshop when they are the ones who are supposed to be proficient with those programs. There is an enormous lack of passion and care amongst the entire staff and student body and I have honestly felt like I have been wasting money, time, and effort attending this school due to the fact that I have not been challenged, encouraged, or even taught anything new or useful in the entire time I have been here. Extremely disappointed considering I heard a lot of raving reviews from friends attending and artists online."
College Junior,2,Bad for deaf and hh students. Not too many African American student or Asians. Lack of women and ethnic teachers.
College Freshman,2,"housing lottery system sucks. too few options, all are too expensive. i almost plummeted down to my death in the sol elevators a few times."
College Sophomore,2,"Admissions lets too many people in and so theres not enough housing. Temporary housing built in the 70s is still standing, and the only housing expansions being made are the most expensive one. The off-campus non RIT student apartments take advantage of desperate students shafted by housing assignments. It needs a lot of work."
College Student,2,I feel left out being a minority
College Student,2,"Some of the people here are great to talk to and be friends here, but that's extremely little. A good portion of students are rude and for someone like me who is nice to everyone, it's hard to deal being here everyday. Money is the main reason I am here, because the scholarship I am on traps me to Engineering Technology majors only, but I don't want to do Engineering Technology anymore but I can't afford to switch majors, so transferring seems to the my only option. I feel like I don't belong here at all, I'm not on the same academic level with anyone here, especially me not knowing what I want to the for the rest of my life, so I would most likely not choose this school again if I could do it all over again."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing itself isn't terrible, but the process is a nightmare. Many students find themselves lost about housing and without housing for the next term"
College Freshman,2,"I would say its bad because there are not very many parties and they get busted pretty quickly. The best parties would have to be downtown, but are hard to get to. I would say that the party scene has a positive impact on people who have good experience and would be a negative impact on those, who drank too much and had a bad hangover. It is overall a pretty dry campus."
College Freshman,2,I would rate it pretty bad because I never hear about parties here and If you want to get to bars or nightclubs you either have to have your own car or take the bus. I would definitely say that they need to improve the transportation and create some more parties at school.
College Freshman,2,I would rate housing as bad because this year RIT housing really did not do a great job with placing students in dorms. They did not do a good job because RIT accepted more students that can fit into the dorms and this led to students having to live in the RIT Inn and the Raddison as well as having a overbooked double. They need to improve this for the next year. Also some students who requested housing for the fall semester next year were denied housing and that is not fair to them to have to go find housing for them. RIT needs to be responsible to find housing for every student who wants to live in the dorms.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life here is nothing like at other schools.  There's sororities and fraternities, but they're fairly small and aren't as established as at other schools.  I'm not a part of greek life and at RIT it doesn't really matter if you are or aren't."
College Student,2,I do not like my housing and think it could have been better
Recent Alumnus,2,I just lived on campus or a campus apartment just for convenience. too much of a hassle because off campus housing is usually too far
Recent Alumnus,2,Eh Never really my thing but even when I go its nothing exciting
College Freshman,2,"I don't get very much financial aid because I'm not eligible for a lot of it, and my scholarship is meh, so I have to apply for lots of outside scholarships (hence why I'm doing these surveys)"
College Freshman,2,"I don't really party that much. When I do I only go to SoFA (School of Film and Animation) parties, which are pretty good, free alcohol and cool people. Only went to one actual party and it sucked."
College Sophomore,2,I wish I've been to more parties; I'm a pretty sociable guy but I haven't been able to crack the scene. YMMV.
College Junior,2,I personally don't like the visitation rules. Other than that everything is okay.
College Junior,2,"RIT is located just south of the city but the only time students seem to go there is for field trips or to visit friends that commute from there. Jefferson road right off campus has every food/fast food chain imaginable so it is a busy area with many attractions including a mall and movie theater.. basically like any other major suburban area. it seems to be quite safe compared to where I am from but all the places around RIT support the school in which you can use TigerBucks, a currensy at RIT that some students can buy as a part of their meal plan. There is also a Walmart and several convenience stores and gas stations around. Parks are a bit of a drive but the city of Rochester itself is basically a no go zone unless your 21 or unless you are looking for heroin downtown somewhere. Me and my other white friend walked to the local corner store in the city one day and I guess they dont see white people often but I got offered drugs as soon as I walked out and other people yelled ""AY LOOK WHITE PPL!"" we didnt feel threatened but it was interesting.. Rochester Public Market is an awesome place to go for great food and a good time in the city by the way"
College Junior,2,"There are two ""ok"" apartment choices outside dorms but they were poorly built. All of the apartments except for two complexes require to drive but if you live there you cannot drive you must take a shuttle because there aren't enough parking spaces. It is really tough to get into these apartments and they are just a hassle overall."
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm not a partier. I chose a school that aligns well with my interests.
College Sophomore,2,RIT is not known for its parties
College Freshman,2,I don't really go to parties.
College Junior,2,"It's kinda bad. Most parties end up going with this specific scenario, where me and my friends would go to a party and no one would be dancing. everyone would be getting drunk while the guys will try to get in the pants of every female they see. The females get really stuck up to the point where they become unconversational. Things get weird and awkward because most conversations end up being about someones major. That is the point where you want to just leave and go watch soap opra or a football game. This happens mainly because the people who go here are really boring and don't want to step out of their comfort zone."
College Freshman,2,"Socially inept, less than attractive."
College Freshman,2,"Could be cheaper, tastier or healthier."
College Freshman,2,"the only thing that i can really say, is that the major i was accepted to was not what i had in mind from reading on the RIT site. im not feeling although this major is really for me anymore."
College Freshman,2,"the financial aid process was difficult because many of the documents that are required are hard to find on the school site. so many times a form that is required for a student is unknown until its either too late or they are on campus talking to financial persons. not only this, it is difficult to understand if the forms you have submitted are actually completed to a satisfactory nature."
College Junior,2,"They kinda treat victims like criminals at times. Very obvious cynical view from some of the people working with the on-campus ambulance. They're kind of jerks, which is a little arrogant of them considering how many people who are actually hurting others are getting away with it."
College Junior,2,There aren't many places to go on the weekend.
College Freshman,2,The ASL program is very elite and hard to get into
College Junior,2,"I didn't find the academics to be particularly challenging my freshman year. Most of the professors I had outside of my major were part-time hires, and hadn't been teaching for very long. Registration takes patience, as it is a long and arduous process, and you don't often get the classes you want."
College Junior,2,"Rochester Insitute of Technology would not be considered a beautiful campus, to say the least. Every building, save a few, were constructed out of the same color brick, and lacked beauty and imagination. Dorms weren't in terrible condition, and I found I had enough room, although the elevators were often being maintained during the busiest times of the day. There is one main green area on campus next to the dorms and the quarter mile and either it's packed with people, or it's completely vacant depending on the weather. I appreciated the Ben and Jerry's in the Student Union which also had places to sit and do homework. I think my all around favorite location on the RIT campus, would be Java Wally's in the library. It had good coffee, a nice environment and nice library access."
College Junior,2,"I found the area surrounding RIT to be mostly stripmalls and highway. It felt pretty isolating despite all the stores. There wasn't much to do off campus if you didn't have a car. There are slightly more activities in Rochester itself, but sometimes the city can seem much father away due to limited public transportation. Behind RIT is suburbia and farming land which further isolates the RIT students."
College Freshman,2,A shared dorm should not cost 2x that of an apt
College Freshman,2,Receiving outside aid does not equal less need!
Recent Alumnus,2,there is no differentiation for Greek people
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much every place on campus serves the exact same thing. Pizza, salad, subs or fast food."
College Freshman,2,they think so highly of themselves and it gets old.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid is not helpful.
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes the campus shuttles don't show up for hours before people give up and walk back to the campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Meh, they're cliquey and a small scene. If you go to recruitment, don't expect to be recruited if you're not perfect, especially if you're female."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The bus rides are insanely long and the schedules are hardly reliable. The time it takes for the bus to get from place to place is either equal to or longer than the time it takes to walk from place to place, and it's much faster for you to take a bicycle. So get a bicycle for the spring and fall, but don't expect to use it in the winter much."
College Junior,2,Your parents should probably have won the lotto or inherited quite a bit of business. The school is prohibitively expensive and they will take every opportunity to stick you for every last dollar that you do not have.
College Junior,2,"The town survives well enough with the university and has some things to do off campus, although the weather more or less doesn't allow for more casual expeditions off campus. The long-term picture for living in the area is depressingly bleak unless you are tied to the area."
College Student,2,"If you love the snow, then you will love about 5 months of it. I don't mind the snow at all, i'm just sick of it. The campus and surrounding area is like a wind tunnel. But i really like how one witnesses the change of seasons."
College Junior,2,"If you are not a fan of winter and cold weather, RIT is NOT the college for you! Rochester experiences massive snowstorms and bitter wind chills almost every year. Not to mention being near Lake Ontario guarantees lake effect snow every other day. Granted, I have had the fortune of not having enough snow to have to brush off my car every day, but it does get pretty cold for a good half to two thirds of the school year. 

The perks on the other hand: the summers are nice, but can be hot and humid and its not Minnesota or the Dakotas."
College Student,2,"Freshmen have to park a long ways away from the dorm at $100/yr.  Park any closer and you get a ticket, no question."
College Student,2,"It's in a retail suburb of Rochester.  It's good for shopping and eating fast food, but that's it."
College Student,2,Most people are from a typical well-to-do New England family.  Very few are down to earth middle class commoners.
Niche User,1,"No idea how RIT has a 3.5/5. Overwhelming majority of professors couldn't care less and just use powerpoints. Yes, that's likely how it is with other colleges in NYS, but those other colleges do not cost $50,000/year. Needed help getting a co-op (come from a low-income family so can't exactly move to California for a job) and was simply told ""just keep applying, your resume looks good."" Yes, thanks for the help. Needless to say I didn't get enough co-ops (I did somehow get one) and now I'm heavily in debt with no job nor degree. Also, thanks for getting rid of the bus system and building magic center instead of more on-campus housing. Really helps a first-generation low-income student. PS: went for STEM major"
Freshman,1,"This place sucks unless you're a super anti social nerd. The academics are what they seem to be, but everything else about this school sucks. The gender ratio is extremely prevalent. I have some classes comprised of entirely guys. The people here are very anti social and awkward in social situations. The party scene is NON-EXISTENT and I mean this there are NO parties at all, to put this into perspective right now there is a group of people playing dungeons and dragons in the community room right now on a Saturday night at 10pm.  The food here is horrific, the main dining hall and most of the surrounding restaurants you can eat at with ""meal exchanges"" all serve only pizza and chicken fingers. The best food is on the other side of campus and it's a Salsaritas."
Junior,1,"The only thing that is okay about RIT is the Academics. But that doesn't make up for the ridiculousness they put students through.
All MAJOR issues at RIT spawn from two departments, RIT Housing and RIT Parking Services. These two departments are responsible for so much hatred, anger, and depression throughout the community.  
RIT has had a housing Crisis for quite a while now, they are unable to guarantee you on campus housing, even in your second your; However they lie to you on their tours and say that they do. RIT owns a hotel which is a 16min drive away called the RIT INN. They consider the RIT INN being on campus regardless of its distance away from the campus, the INN also has infrequent busses, theft problems, a............

Senior,1,"not worth for international students who are looking to work in USA after master's. It's good for US students in terms of core study. but if you are looking for market oriented study.. you need to be cautious for chosing department. mostly Industrial department gives funding, but again feature work is a hurdle.  CS and electrical are famous but it feels all business in terms of international students. Also the college is at remote location, so it's hard to get interviews calls. you only had to depend on career fair. IST department is bit market oriented but you need to learn a lot of things on top of that by yourself. If you will depend on-campus job for your expenses... it will again eat up your valuable time and you will feel it as waste of money and you important time of career. There are so many student at present across the USA that it's hard to get into job, just because of remote location and high expenses. Many professors are unpredictable and biased to their judgment.."
College Junior,1,In the dorms on campus they do inspections periodically. Alcohol and drugs are still there just away when there is an inspection. Apartments and the RIT Inn are the biggest drug/alcohol places. Inspections aren't frequent there.
College Freshman,1,Not the frat or sorority you see in the movies. Not even close!
College Senior,1,"Two of the closest places are Park Point and The Province. They are owned by the same company, American Campuses. I don't know if RIT is turning a blind eye but the company is taking advantage of students. I didn't believe many people when I moved to The Province (where I still live due to leasing contract) about how bad the place was. The prices are high but that wasn't the issue, it was the leasing office. You get told one thing and they do another. Last year, I needed to release my contract as I was going on study abroad program. Once I signed everything, I asked two different people on two different occasions if I needed to pay rent for January of 2014, I was told ""no"" and that ""you are all set."" A month and a half later, my family gets a legal notice saying I was going to be sued if I didn't pay for the January. I would have been happy to if someone told me. What a irritating was the one of the person that said I didn't need to pay was the one giving me the run around. The same person I dealt with this summer when I moved there to do a co-op in Rochester. They didn't know I was living there for a month!! A few weeks ago, I found out that the price we agreed on for the apartment for this year was a bit higher than what was actually said. They only have my signature with the high lease on it but this was corrected immediately when I noticed the price. I signed the lease with the proper price but I was told they were not in possession of this lease! So now I pay the higher rate. I might add the same individual in charge. The office has never kept their word. I nor any other student has enough power to fight these people for their negligence as they are backed by a huge company. I've learned from my mistakes. No matter how nice they are (I did like these people), I will always have them write it down and sign their name on paper. If anyone from RIT is actually reading this, please look into the matter. I'm not the only student that has had issue with this company."
College Freshman,1,Campus police thinks they're the real police.
College Freshman,1,Unless you keep the noise down or have them off campus the parties will either suck or campus police will show up.
College Freshman,1,terrible its more like small get togethers with alcohol
College Freshman,1,the greek life is really bad and stupid
College Freshman,1,"The people who can use sign language are surprisingly rude and inconsiderate. There have been instances when they will point at you and then sign about you. It's like when someone starts talking about you in another language. It's really rude and makes you feel uncomfortable. Also, the professors don't seem to care about anything but collecting the pay check. They are not understanding or flexible."
College Freshman,1,it gets depressing from october to mid-may.. so all year
College Freshman,1,HORRIBLE. 90% of parties are busted by midnight.
Recent Alumnus,1,"For the bulk of the school year, the weather is a beast. From October until April RIT's campus is a frozen, windy, horrible place. You have to wear sunglasses in the sleet/hail/snow or else it will blow in your eyes and make you cry. You better bring boots, because you best believe there will be snow everywhere, nearly all of the time. There's a tunnel system you can take to try and avoid this in some places, but it doesn't cover the whole campus which is a shame."
College Freshman,1,"So much wind. It is pretty much unbearable for 6 months of the year. If you are at all interested in coming here, get ready to stay inside for the majority of your stay."
College Freshman,1,"For starters, I don't think I've seen the sun since I got here. It is always a discomforting gray sky that puts people in a worse mood. Nobody enjoys talking about the weather but when it is this bad all the time there is no choice but to mention how terrible it is. Spring and Fall are nice though for the 3 weeks of each we have per year."
College Junior,1,Bad. You will be inside or wanting to be inside for about nine months out of the year.
College Freshman,1,Not that many options and living off campus in apartments is expensive.
College Freshman,1,"If you like bipolar weather than RIT is the place for you! The weather here is terrible, during the winter temperatures can get down to negative 25 degrees. The wind makes it unbearable to walk to class. You don't get much warmth and sun."
College Freshman,1,"There's no a nightlife at RIT, being isolated from the city of Rochester and other university there's not much going. Transportation is very inconvenient and I found at times, the bus would be 45 mins to an hour late."
College Freshman,1,"Campus strictness severely limits my creativity and keeps me close minded. They keep a close watch on campus and are not lenient to underage drinking. This I believe destroys the atmosphere at RIT and it feels like a prison. I know public safety are there to protect the students and promote safety but the strictness of there actions actually hurts the schools reputation. Instead of bringing innovation to RIT and students, RIT is actually pushing them out on disassociates unity."
College Student,1,"It was unbearably hot, then it was freezing."
College Student,1,The dorms suck.  I hated them and I hated the people on my floor.
College Freshman,1,There's barely anything open past 7PM. The food gives you constipation most of the time. DO NOT EAT AT GRACIES.
College Sophomore,1,Cold and windy except for the summer and open house dates.
College Freshman,1,Henrietta is a total dump. The campus atmosphere isn't great either.
College Senior,1,Rit is not much of a athletic school.
College Junior,1,"Freshmen get the worst parking, there is not enough parking spots for everyone, even the commuters have to come earlier to get a spot. Parking tickets usually are left all the time due to the fact that students need to be closer to buildings so they try and park places you ""shouldn't"". There  is a new hockey arena being built that shouldn't which took up a whole parking spot. Even for outsiders it's so hard to get a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is so out-of-control. This is the only downside to this school. Unless specific teachers don't want to have classes on a super blizzard day, you have to go to class. They shut down the campus for nothing!"
College Sophomore,1,"Transportation on campus is pretty good since there are buses running all week to get students from their apartments to their classes. There are also many bike/skating paths available, which make getting to class much faster.  Getting off of campus is a bit more tricky.  The buses only go off campus on Saturday and Sunday and they're hardly ever on time.  They work on a looping system with several stops.  So if you need to make 1 stop, and catch the next bus back, it takes nearly 4 hours until you're back on campus.  I've also been stranded late at night when the schedule indicated there would be another bus.  The buses are free, however."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is atrocious here. Bill Destler, the president, has even noted that parking is bad and needs to be improved."
College Sophomore,1,If you're coming to Rochester and you're not from around the area/northern New York be prepared for a huge weather shock. The weather here is incredibly random. It could be 55 and sunny one day and raining and 20 the next. The wind is absolutely terrible and can actually slow you down on the way to class.
College Senior,1,"It is the worst. The employees in the Financial Aid offices are bitter and resentful. They could give two sh*ts about the students who go to them, and look to suck the money right out of your pockets! Be sure to speak with your academic advisor; they are God-sends with a huge amount of scholarship information. I have had a 4.0 GPA since attending RIT, and my scholarship funding has not increased even a single cent... pretty sure their  scholarship money goes a lot to the sports teams (specifically Canadian hockey players)."
College Freshman,1,Campo are way to strict. The campus is technically a dry campus which gives the campus police a power trip.
College Freshman,1,"I hate the food here, it gets extremely repetitive if you don't try new things but there's only so much variety when half of your meals are at the freshman dining hall"
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus tends to be tricky. The freshman parking lot is particularly brutal and is located about a 5-10 minute walk from the dorms, which is unpleasant during the Rochester winter. Ticketing officers patrol the lots like madmen and will not hesitate to slap you with a hefty fine for parking outside of your designated lot. Luckily the entire campus is totally walkable, although students who feel confined or get bored easily will likely feel the need for a car in order to get off campus and escape the bricks for a while."
College Sophomore,1,"LAKE EFFECT! WINDY!! SNOWYY!! SUNNY!!! It can be all three in less than a hour. The weather here is a crazy and always surprising. The snowstorm will come and the next day it could be 70 degrees out. It's like a pregnant women with mood swings. The female students will learn quickly that spending forever on hair in the morning is not worth it because the wind will be whipping it on the walk to class. Some Professors cancel class, but usually class continues. There are underground tunnels on campus which is really cool. They were built just to travel from one building to the other for the winter season."
College Junior,1,"For such an expensive tuition, RIT barely gives out enough financial aid. With the tough economy, the price to attend RIT keeps increasing and all the students see is a new pretty water fountain (that we can't use most of the year since it's freezing)."
College Sophomore,1,"Overall, I know security does the best they can, but there is still a very high crime rate that I wish they could handle better. Vehicles are often broken into, and motorcycles and bikes are often stolen and never returned. There have also been missing students who were never found in time, and there have even been reports of assault on campus where the perpetrators haven't been caught. Furthermore, in my freshman year, there was a report of a depressed student, who's friend told security he meant to kill himself. Security's reaction was to subsequently assume the student was armed, and sent a campus warning to students and parents and then hunted down the student and when someone tried to visit the student while they were surrounding his room, the friend tried to reason with security and they tazored the poor kid (there is a video online), and put him in handcuffs and reported that they had apprehended a suspect."

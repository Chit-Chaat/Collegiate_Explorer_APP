Freshman,5,I am not currently taking any online classes.  All my classes are in person.  I do have some zoom lessons and online studying but that is in additional to my in person learning.
Freshman,5,"Samford is an excellent school and I am so glad to be there.  There beliefs, staff and faculty are some of the best in the industry.  The campus is beautiful, the class offerings are many and the entire atmosphere is one of caring, learning, and helping."
Senior,5,"The online experience at Samford is mostly new, but that is actually a benefit as your input will matter about how you feel the classes are operated and run."
Graduate Student,5,I love Samford University they are very organized and are always willing to help me with any of my needs
Graduate Student,5,I have not had to experience any online courses at Samford however I have only heard positive things about them
Sophomore,5,"Samford did an excellent job facilitating learning online in light of COVID-19. The professors were all more than willing to do whatever necessary so that students could still have the best possible education online. There was plenty of communication throughout the process, and I always felt that my professors were easily accessible which was very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"I love Samford!!! It is the perfect school for me with just over 5,000 students. I have only been there one year but have  already made life-long friends. The atmosphere is great, and the staff and faculty really care about students."
Sophomore,5,"I love samford. It’s such a great environment, and so welcoming. There is always something to participate in even if your not involved with Greek life. People on campus are ALWAYS kind and your professors truly care about you doing well, and also you as a person."
Sophomore,5,"Samford is an incedible school! Here you will find professors who actually care and small class sizes that provide engaging academic opportunities. The student body size is small, but that makes it easier to feel at home sooner. Even though the school is small, there are still plenty of opportunities as one would have at a larger university. The on campus dining is not necessarily great, but that’s probably the only drawback of Samford University. There are plenty of student engagement opportunities, and the education is well known to be superb!"
Freshman,5,I love Samford.  The professors are very caring for you and your grade.  There is always someone on campus to talk to.  It's the perfect size to get involved and to also see new face.  Anything you can't find on campus is less than a 15 minute drive away.
Alum,5,Samford is a wonderful school with excellent educational programs.  The small campus is beautiful and offers a low student-faculty ratio.  The faculty and staff really care about the students and their success.
Alum,5,"attention potential students- you must visit and tour this campus! Samford is simply a wonderful, beautiful university."
Niche User,5,"Samford is a very friendly college. The professors take time to get to know each student and care about their well being. Samford's campus is beautiful, and I feel safe their because it is all confined into one area."
Sophomore,5,"Samford is amazing, the campus is great and surrounding community makes it even better. The academics can be challenging but for the most part professors are there to help you succeed and bend their schedules for students. There are plenty of activities and ways to get involved on/off campus. One of the main things that could improve is the housing, most of it is old and very expensive. It is still nice though and cleaned regularly. Overall for me, Samford is 10/10!"
Graduate Student,5,"Samford University Is The Best College Ever!  

The Campus Is Beautiful, All Of The Professors Are Caring, Smart, And Resourceful!! 

I LOVE Samford University!!"
Freshman,5,Samford is such an amazing college. Everyone is so friendly and all the professors and staff are so helpful!
Freshman,5,"I have LOVED the avaliability of my guidance counselor. She consistently answers my questions and genuinely has my best interest at heart. In addition, she helped me set up a visit which helped me to get a real feel for the school. Samford has been amazing so far and I have been in pursuit of going there for 2 years!"
Alum,5,Samford is an excellent university with a high-quality education offered at one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  Many universities claim to be a family but Samford actually is even well after you graduate from Samford your professors are still willing to help you and support you in your goals.
Niche User,5,"I love that Samford University is a Christian based school. Growing up in a christian home, I chose a school that would push me to grow closer to God as I earn my degree. The overall atmosphere and excellence of the campus makes it feel like home. The people there are the most genuine and intentional people you will ever meet, and it is crucial to surround yourself with good people when entering college. I feel confident walking into this next season of my life because of how amazing Samford University is. I am ecstatic to officially be a student there."
Niche User,5,Small private college with the same big college feel. Professors care about you and want nothing but the best for you. Pretty campus and it is easy to navigate.
Freshman,5,"Samford University is my second family! They not only care for my education that I receive, but also about growing in your faith! The application process was beyond amazing!! I had so much attention that I would never get from a state school! The professor are amazing and will invite students over for a home cooked meal and study session before any major tests! I will can’t wait to return to campus and the Birmingham area which is filled with so many fun things to do! The first week back is always a blast that allows you to connect with all the students before classes begin and allows a smooth transition into your studies with you classmates!"
Sophomore,5,"I have heard it said that you will know when you find the right college. That was true for me! Samford felt like home from the moment I stepped onto campus. The people are friendly, and the administration is very accessible. Every class is taught by a professor, and the class sizes are small. Birmingham is a great city with many options for food and entertainment."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Samford with a BSBA in Economics and Marketing. You will not find better people, community, and education than you will at Samford. Truly a beautiful and special place that only provides you with fertile soil for a bright future of learning, serving, and loving others."
Sophomore,5,"Samford University really pushes its students to rise to the occasion. The professors there really care about their students and it shows in the classroom and outside of it. The overall environment of Samford is fantastic. Everyone is friendly and wants to be there. Even better, there is something for everyone at Samford; whether that be learning, exploring, or enjoying the life of a college student. I could never imagine being at any other school, because Samford is my school."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Samford. It's not too small or too big, but I still feel like I know just the right amount of people. I honestly can't think of anything to change."
Sophomore,5,It is a wonderful place to get plugged in and grow spiritually. The offices are organized and signing up for classes is easy. The facilities are nice as well.
Sophomore,5,"Samford is an awesome community. The people are so loving. This past school year, which was my first at Samford, I had enjoyed all my classes and teachers. We are taught in a way the stretches and challenges our brains. I feel well prepared for my future classes. I can't wait to dive into classes for my major."
Niche User,5,Samford is a very close knit community. Its the perfect balance for a four year university. Everyone is very friendly. Academics are challanging and worth while. There is plenty to do on and off of campus. Samford offers a number of groups and organizations to be apart of.
Niche User,5,"I am an incoming freshman at Samford University. I feel truly at home here, and every visit I take makes me miss it when I leave. The students, tourguides, and representatives are both so warm and professional, I know that the university will open so many doors for me. All of the other freshman I have met are so welcoming and excited as well. GO BULLDOGS!"
Sophomore,5,"a)	 I love being a part of Samford’s community. I chose Samford for various reasons. A huge factor in finding my college home was the nursing program. Samford has the best nursing program in the state of Alabama. Another thing that made Samford feel like a home away from home for me is the people. When I came on my tour, I didn’t know a single soul here. Yet, the Student Recruitment Team made me feel so welcome and wanted here on Samford’s campus. Samford is an expensive school to attend but I couldn’t see myself spending four years anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Samford University has been amazing, I enjoy my classes, teachers, and friends. There are more than enough ways to get involved on campus and I enjoy those opportunities. I thought college was going to be stressful, but it has been the opposite for me. It has grown me as a person, and the people I've gotten to interact with have not only been nice, but engage in deep, meaningful conversations. I would not change a thing about the school, other than the amount I am currently paying to go here."
Senior,5,"I love the small campus atmosphere and the student to faculty ratio. It's been such a great investment, and I've had many great opportunities because of my Samford education."
Niche User,5,"Samford is a beautiful campus and all around a great place to be. They offer so many different majors that cater to many different people. Samford University is a place where you can embrace and express your faith, but it is not forced on to you if that is not something you are interested in. Honestly, there are not many things that I would change about Samford University. It is my dream school and I think that is a great fit for many people."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 2011. I came out of college so well-prepared to care for patients. My education at Samford has opened so many doors for me. It was incredibly challenging, but it is worth it!"
Senior,5,Love the campus and the feel of the school. Everyone is so nice and so helpful on campus. The teachers are so personable and really help and pay attention to the students.
Freshman,5,I have loved my freshman year at Samford. I love the small community and the professors that invest in their students. I also love that there are so many ways to get involved on campus in various activities. I am a part of greek life and one thing I love about it here at Samford is that it doesn't have to be the only thing you are known for on campus. One thing that could be improved is more parking.
Alum,5,"I graduated from Samford in 2009 with a BSN in Nursing. I loved all aspects of my experience; I cherish the memories made while I was there. The academics and professors are wonderful and very knowledgeable. I felt extremely prepared once I graduated and entered the work force. My roommates were the best - we are still connected today and were in even each other's weddings. There is a lot of opportunity to get involved in activities in the community as well; service to others is encouraged. I give Samford an A+ in overall experience, as I will never forget my time at one of the best colleges around!"
Junior,5,"Samford University does its best to help student excel in their future career goals. The teachers are personal and always makes sure the students are academically, physically, and emotionally doing their best."
Graduate Student,5,"Have been accepted to the Pharmacy Program for fall 2018. Great people, beautiful campus and exceptional learning environment."
Freshman,5,"Right now I am a freshman at Samford university. So far everything is going great and I like everything about this school. The professors are great, the campus is great, the athletics, and the student life is great as well. The teachers and professors here are very outgoing and willing to help you if you need it. The professors works well with the students all of them. I have nothing that I want to change on the campus right now."
Freshman,5,"If you are looking for a smaller and more conservative school where your professors can know you well you should look no further than Samford! It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.
There are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene."
Senior,5,Very personal! But expensive. Faculty cares about you. Beautiful campus. Safe environment. Not much diversity. Baptist-affiliated. Very spiritual. Requires convocation credits before graduation.
Freshman,5,Samford University is the perfect college and the education it teaches prepares one for future success in whatever career they pursue. The professors care about your success and work with you to help you be successful in whatever class.
Freshman,5,If you're looking for a school that will nurture and foster your faith while also providing you with a stellar community to love and support you - come to Samford.
Niche User,5,"It was a great environment on a great campus. I went and experienced a truly gospel-centered life, curriculum, and athletics. The fair was diverse and had some amazing careers to pursue. I highly recommend looking at this college."
Sophomore,5,I love my time at Samford.  They provide me with the exact education I need to go out professionally into my field one day.  I have been given several opportunities there that I feel wouldn't have come at any other school.  I love my professors and my friends and the environment that Samford provides.
Graduate Student,5,"Samford offers many programs that one may excel in, but above all else, I am surprised to find that every staff member, faculty, employee meets you with kindness and a willing attitude to serve you. Entering the pharmacy program this coming fall, they have been so adamant about preparing you for success, and that says a lot about the program's integrity!"
Junior,5,"If I could go back to my senior year of high school I would not pick any other college. I am going into my Junior year and still having the best experience. I picked Samford because it is a small Christian college with a great nursing program. Samford amazes me daily with the community it brings. The people make Samford what it is. They are friendly to everyone and great people to learn and grow with making lifelong friends. Also, the academics do not disappoint. School is hard but the faulty make it worth it. The professors are genuinely caring to their students and what the best for them as a person.  Another great addition is the proximity to Birmingham. Birmingham is only about 10 minutes away from Samford and it is always fun being a tourist in my own town. There is always something new to discover in Birmingham and a fun way to get off campus every once in awhile to explore.  One thing I would like to see change is the food and library hours."
Graduate Student,5,This is a wonderful school that provides a wonderful education and college experience. The campus is beautiful and faculty and staff  care about their students.
Junior,5,"i have loved my time at samford so much and am always looking forward to going back. The classes can be challenging and some professors are hard but you will learn and grow a lot. The people are very friendly and welcoming and there are many events on campus. Campus is beautiful!! Birmingham also has somethings but definitely not a big party scene , it is more laid back. The campus food isn't the best but the local food off campus is amazing! GO TO SAMFORD!!"
Senior,5,"I cannot imagine going to a different college. If you're looking for a positive college experience and can afford to come to Samford, do it. The professors will take time to know you. We obviously have a beautiful campus, but it's the community that makes Samford so amazing. I'll walk around the quad and can expect to see many people I know and have real, life-on-life conversations with people, and I'm not even one of the popular people. I'll admit that my parents paid for my education, but I would take out loans and pay them back for the rest of my life if I had to to stay at Samford. Don't expect to be sheltered, but the friends I've made here have helped develop me as a person and you can't replace that."
Freshman,5,"Samford really has become a second home to me. With a nurturing environment that strives for excellence in all areas, Samford provides its students with incredible opportunities both in the classroom and in the larger community of Birmingham."
Freshman,5,"People are super friendly here and it's pretty easy to get involved in things.  Everything is in walking distance and the surrounding area is amazing.  It's fifteen minutes from the center of Birmingham and most attractions.  The food is not the best, but the rest of what Samford has to offer far out ways that."
Freshman,5,I absolutely loved my first semester at Samford. It has always been my dream school and I was not disappointed.
Freshman,5,"Samford is a great school with great opportunities to grow as a person not only in maturity, but also in your faith! The people rock. I highly reccommend. "
Niche User,5,Samford University is an outstanding college with a great Christian community that allows students to continue their education in whatever they plan to achieve.
College Sophomore,5,"The Career Development Center has employers on campus every week recruiting. Plus, Samford has some of the best programs in the country. I am in the education program, 100% of our graduates have a job or are enrolled in grad school within 3 months of graduating. I'm not worried at all."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are amazing! They genuinely care about me and want be to succeed!
College Sophomore,5,"I am Greek, so I'm a little biased, but I love Greek Life! We have a really good Greek Life Office and lots of programs and activities. There are now 6 sororities and 5 fraternities, everyone has a house except for one newer fraternity and the new sorority. The greek housing is pretty nice, it's not on the state school level, but it's nicer than most of the other dorms on campus. From my experience, being Greek doesn't mean that I am only friends with my sorority sisters, yes I spend a lot of time with them and I love them, but my ""friend group"" has only two other greeks in it, the rest are independents. Being Greek at Samford doesn't define you, you are given the choice to make it what you want to."
College Sophomore,5,Samford is amazing! The faculty and staff wants us as students to be successful and happy. I truly feel as if I genuinely loved and cared for by my campus.
Senior,4,"I am very satisfied with my Samford experience. I am enrolled in a fast-track program. While they did not initially handle the COVID-19 pandemic well, they recovered from it well. The professors are incredible and the student-life is one of a kind. I would send my children to Samford in the future, but only for a specific program (ex. fast track or nursing)- not a general degree."
Senior,4,Samford is a smaller school that offers a lot if not all the same experiences of bigger schools. I myself am a transfer student who is now attending Samford and I can say with full confidence that the size of Samford's campus has allowed me to thrive both socially and academically.
Freshman,4,Samford has an amazing atmosphere with very welcoming and cool people! Academics are very good and I have learned a lot from all of my professors.
Senior,4,"Samford University is a great place for those looking for a school with a strong sense of community and emphasis on Christian values. The students, faculty, and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Samford has a beautiful campus in a great area of Birmingham. Samford is not a party school and many students spend their weekends exploring the city of Birmingham. Courses are challenging and offer many opportunities for growth."
Sophomore,4,"Samford is a good school for those that have money and aren't looking to have a ""typical"" college experience. It feels like a private high school, just on a more grander scale."
Junior,4,"As a current student, I love Samford University because of the environment. It is a community of loving and caring faculty as well as nice students. I like being a part of the School of the Arts. Though the school is perhaps a bit expensive, I do love being a part of the Samford community and I will cherish the time that I will be here."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the school. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. There is so much you can get involved in on campus as well as outside in the community of Birmingham.
Sophomore,4,I just completed my first year at Samford. This university helped me grow spiritually and academically. I love the community the school creates.
Sophomore,4,I love campus life and how much the university really wants to welcome and encourage students to get involved. I think that as a university with roots in the Baptist faith they still have a lot more modernized growing to do.
Niche User,4,"Samford has a very Home-y feel. My very first visit was very impressive. The faculty and students were very welcoming and I immediately felt at home. I went on many tours (including student-led and preview day) and was very impressed with the campus. The campus is small, but beautiful."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Samford University and my 1st semester was great! They have great academics and the teachers and staff really challenge you as a student. There are many ways for you to be apart of something or find your group. One thing I really like is how it is a small school but has qualities of a big school. Including sports, sororities, shuttles, and a newly renovated university enter with restaurants like chick-fil-a and moes. The are of Birmingham is really nice to explore and eat. Diversity on campus has improved over the years and I feel this because most people don't know about the school."
Freshman,4,"I love that Samford has small class sizes and that the professors really try to get to know you. It's amazing if you want a Christian experience during college, but that can also be it's downfall with small mindness. The campus is gorgeous and there are a lot of ways to make friends."
Junior,4,"The tuition costs are incredibly high, but this is a private Baptist university. I would say the professors are incredibly liberal, especially in my political science department. Overall the atmosphere is nice and everybody knows everybody. There are plenty of greek organizations and other clubs to get involved with."
Senior,4,Samford has great academics and plenty of areas were you can get involved on campus. They're are also plenty of research opportunities with professors in the Biology Dept. There are also plenty of opportunities to work on campus if you come into college without a car. The diversity is not that great even though they say that to minority students.
Sophomore,4,"Great school if you are looking for a small to medium size university.  The campus is beautifully maintained. The class sizes are small and professors really care about students.  Birmingham is a great place with all kinds of restaurants, entertainment, and shopping."
Junior,4,"Samford, while not perfect, is a well rounded and great university. I am proud to be a student here and to be apart of so many wonderful things that Samford has to offer."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is very friendly and you get a great education. Although there is an expectation of judgement because it is a Christian college, I have found some of the least judgemental and loving people in my life at Samford. You also start classes for your major as a freshman!"
Junior,4,"Samford University is a great Christian private school, where you can get a quality education and amazing professors that care about you. It has a beautiful campus that you will enjoy. The only downside is there isn't a lot of diversity, so a person that might come from another culture more than just an American culture can feel lost."
Junior,4,"No other student body is more welcoming and compassionate, and there's a palpable sense of camaraderie among the students that manifests in study groups and intramural teams and congregations in the library. It's a place where everyone feels comfortable and able to do their best academic work and where students are proud of their education. Because of the all-encompassing Christian atmosphere, Greek Life at Samford is noble, well-behaved, and active in the community. The members of Greek organizations are the most involved on campus, hold almost all leadership positions, and organize the most campus-wide events. Academically, students are challenged to go above and beyond because every professor is highly invested in his or her students on a personal level."
Freshman,4,I love  the community at Samford. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. The professors are very invested in their students and the classes are small. There is a lot to do on campus to get involved and the Greek system is strong. The only thing missing from Samford is an engineering school.
Sophomore,4,"I will be a sophomore this upcoming year at Samford University. I enjoyed my freshman year. I felt the school made it easy to meet new people. If I could change one thing about Samford, it would be the diversity. I would love to see more students of different race and diverse backgrounds."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at Samford.  The classes have been small, so the professors can really work personally with you.  They are challenging and it is definitely not easy to earn an A in most classes.  The campus is absolutely gorgeous and it is great to look at.  I love the fact that faith is taken extremely seriously in most activities and classes.  However, I do not like the fact that there is barely any diversity on campus, and that there is a certain ""type"" of person that has to attend Samford.  Most people are wealthy white people who have been spoiled their whole lives, and Samford continues to spoil them.  Coming from a white, middle class family, this can be suffocating and sometimes makes me doubt my decision in attending this school.  It is not a good feeling to be compared to everybody else because of your car or because you did not go to a private school.  I cannot say that I am completely happy with my experience at Samford."
Niche User,4,"Samford University is a beautiful campus with professors that truly care about you and your experience there. At night, fireflies can be seen floating throughout the rolling green hills. The environment is very  inviting, inside and outside of the classrooms. The faculty here are very professional and involved in the lives of their students. They do everything that they can to ensure success for all who choose to attend Samford University."
College Sophomore,4,"It's not really something that is talked about much on campus, as far as I know it is not an issue. I have never heard anyone not feeling safe or as if they didn't have a voice. As a female, I feel very safe on campus. They is a strong police presence on campus, especially at night. There are only two exits, and after 10pm you have to go through a guarded gate to get on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"A dorm room is a dorm room, you can't really sugar coat it. My freshman dorm in vail was definitely one of the bigger ones on my hall, but it was still a box that two people are forced to live in for a year. But the reason that I loved Vail and my freshman dorm experience was my hall. My RA quickly became referred as ""Mom"" and my hallmates became my sisters and closest friends. Its a beautiful campus with pretty nice facilities, but it's the people that make this campus great."
College Sophomore,4,"Samford has really good athletics programs and lots of student organizations work really hard to support them. We definitely aren't a state school, but I feel like our facilities and programs fit us. Intramurals are really big and popular, almost everyone plays on a team!"
College Sophomore,4,There are several internships and job openings that Samford offers. I also think the alumni network is great. We are receiving more money to work on our campus. I think the students who work calling alumni are doing a great job too.
College Sophomore,4,I like that we have a gate to get into our campus. Personally it makes me feel safe. I think that if we have our i.d on us we should have more privileges. Our i.d's should provide some sort of further security for us students.
College Sophomore,4,I am not in Greek life but my friends who are have had great experiences. All the Greeks are super kind to the non-Greeks and it is not weird if you are not Greek
College Sophomore,4,I attended the football games and those were really fun. All our athletes are really good and our teams are too. Since each frat and sorority get paired with a athletic team the games have a pretty high attendance and fan support.
College Sophomore,4,My major has 100% job placement. I have no worries about getting and keeping a job after graduating.
College Sophomore,4,"I am so glad I chose to go to Samford. The people, teachers, and courses are fabulous."
College Sophomore,4,"Samford police patrol campus 24/7. The police station in the HUB is always open. There are safely call boxes around campus. I feel safe walking around at anytime, day or night."
College Sophomore,4,Freshman get the best housing by far. Their dorms are in central campus and are super convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"It seems great. I personally am not part of it, but those who do participate seem pretty happy about it."
College Sophomore,4,"All facilities are easy to access and clean. There are multiple places to work out so you don't feel crowded either. Football is the most popular sport, but baseball is pretty popular too."
College Junior,4,I always feel safe at Samford. Freshman year I had money stolen from me but since then I have not had a problem. It was believed that a janitor at Samford stole the money because I left my wallet in the Llibrary when it closed and it was found the next morning near the janitor closet.
College Junior,4,Samford allows students a wide range in internship prospects and the alumni network is always willing to help.
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed Greek Life. Greek Life has allowed me to come outside my comfort zone and make lasting friendships.
College Sophomore,4,"Samford is know for having this thing called ""The Samford Bubble,"" essentially meaning that Samford's campus tends to be incredibly safe and secure. This also means that the campus (read: student body) can be blind to campus crime that takes place, such as sexual assault. There are almost never reportings of sexual assault, but it still exists on campus and many people have a blissful ignorance of that fact."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been satisfied with the quality of education Samford has provided over my first two years of undergrad, however, I constantly feel my particular major is not staffed as well as it could be. Occasionally, some classes seem aimless or the curriculum is rearranged during a four-year period, creating some annoyance with the faculty. Some classes are only offered at 8 in the morning and almost none of my major requirements are available for enrollment during the summer. The ministry opportunities are fantastic and diverse, so there is a place where just about everyone can find their best fit community in order to create the home-away-from-home atmosphere Samford is known for."
College Freshman,4,"If you're looking for parties, Samford Greek life is not for you. Samfords Greek life is a great example of what Greek life was and is meant to be. Greek life often times gets a bad rap because of chapters at large state schools, but it is truly one of the best aspects of Samford"
College Freshman,4,"The CDC with work with undergrads, graduated, and alumni to help them find a job."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are very knowledgeable about their subjects and with no TAsthe professor really knows the course and their students.
College Freshman,4,"Greek students are independent students are pretty evenly split at Samford. There is not a tension between Greeks and Indies and there is no bad blood. If someone chooses to be independent there are plenty of other campus opportunities with them. Greeks and independents are often very good friends and within the Greek community, fraternities and sororities, in general, do not restrict their social circles to just their sorority or fraternity."
College Senior,4,On-campus police are available 24/7.  205-726-2020
College Senior,4,Don't have to put quarters in for laundry.  You can wash and dry as much as you want.  That is the best thing!
College Senior,4,"There are no differences in the treatment of individuals depending on if they are a Greek or non-Greek.  Everyone treats each other the same.  Greek life does give a stronger sense of belonging, support, and community."
College Senior,4,Great opportunities for networking with employers and professionals.  Most teachers are willing to help students with anything.  Teachers are approachable.
College Senior,4,I do not know much about the athletics side of Samford University.
College Freshman,4,"The career development center on campus is absolutely wonderful. They are extremely helpful in all areas pertaining to major choice, options for internships, jobs after college, applying to grad school, etc. The alumni network is especially strong here, with a large amount of alumni still involved and willing to assist graduating students in finding jobs."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in Greek Life on campus, Chi Omega sorority, and I love it. I have made a lot of great friends both within my own sorority, and within others. That being said, I also have made great friends who are not affiliated. As with any organization, Greek Life can foster a spirit of envy and exclusion, but this is very subdued at Samford because of the size of the campus. Since the population of Samford is small and community-centered to begin with, Greek Life contributes to this instead of taking away."
College Freshman,4,"Samford's campus is very safe. You can go into the CAF alone, leave your bags and laptop on the table unattended with complete ease. You can do this in many facilities on campus. Campus security does a fantastic job and I have never not felt safe."
College Freshman,4,There are numerous amounts of career fairs and development opportunities for students to participate in.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are nice, especially on how close they are to everything on campus. Parking is a breeze and there is never any problem finding a place close to the freshmen dorms."
College Freshman,4,"Being part of a sorority, I have been able to experience everything from recruitment to being in an actual greek organization first hand. It has been a life changing experience that I would highly recommend getting involved with at my campus."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics, while not a huge part of campus life, is still very important. Most everyone attends at least one game on occasion, and it is extremely easy to get into the sporting event of your choosing."
College Sophomore,4,"From the other students, I heard it is great. I don't live on campus"
College Junior,4,"I've never felt unsafe or uneasy on campus. The gates close at 10pm, which keeps out a lot of crime and alcohol. Rules are fairly strict, which is good."
College Junior,4,"Although Greek life is often overwhelming, people are friendly and you feel like you're at home. There are many great opportunities to get involved, which helps create a sense of community on campus."
Sophomore,2,Basically Samford paints it’s self to be something it’s not. Things they don’t tell you: dorms have black model growing in them. They only take you in the nice buildings they have (most arnt nice). If you have big boobs and participate in step sing you have to tape them down. The food in the caf isn’t good. The only reason I’m here is because the learning experience is good but everything else is awful. If I had it to do over I’d go somewhere else. Also no one here has any school spirit and it sucks. If you live with in an a few hours kids go home on the weekends if not kids go to T-town or auburn or on a weekend trip. But rarely does anyone stay on campus because there is nothing to do.
Freshman,2,"Had high expectations, but wasn't too satisfied. I'll give it to them- I've met some really cool people here, but if you're not a middle class, white student, expect to feel left out. Diversity? Um..lol, a total joke. Also I feel as if this isn't even a real college experience- basically everything revolves around sororities/frats, and it's a ghost town on the weekends. What a shame.I'm looking forward to transferring next year. (PS- please work on renovating the dorms/housing for EVERY floor of the building, and not just the 1st and 2nd ones)"
College Freshman,2,"As an avid sports fan, the support for the athletics here is bad. Very few people attend games for multiple reasons including the large state schools in close proximity (Auburn and Alabama), and the overall performance of the teams which is often not that great. As students who have little money to begin with, I think it is hard to find people willing to spend money on a game they know will not be as great as a larger school's game, or will not result in a win."
College Freshman,2,"There is basically no diversity on this campus.  For the most part, everyone is white."
College Freshman,2,I want to get out of here and get out quick.
College Freshman,2,"There are great professors and great classes, but there is virtually nothing to do here.  There are no events or parties happening on weekends and most people are usually stuck in their dorm doing nothing on weekends.  Being dry probably plays a big role in that.  It gets boring so quick."
College Student,2,My advisor was not helpful at all until it was to late.
College Freshman,2,the cafeteria has major issues when serving food that is edible
College Junior,2,Campus safety is rarely present at night.
College Sophomore,2,"First of all, there are no sidewalks on the street that my university is located on and it is pretty dangerous to walk on the side of the road and trying to avoid being hit. Second of all, I have not ever seen a city bus in this city. Third of all, if you order a taxi, you will most likely pay an unnecessary amount of money because the taxi service comes from the airport. Fourth of all, it is crucial for you to have your own car if you desire to get out of campus for a late-night food run, coffee, groceries, errands, etc. Fifth of all, if you do not have a car, try to at least have a driver's license because you can ask a friend if you can borrow their car to go do something, and if you ask someone for a ride, most likely they are busy."
College Freshman,2,"Most students are white, middle class to wealthy, and Christians."
College Sophomore,2,"Seeing minorities around campus is rare, and those that are tend to stick within groups of similar backgrounds. Pretty much everyone comes from the same background though. Not very open to new ideas."
College Sophomore,2,"You have to have your own car, no public transportation or many sidewalks. Very hard to walk anywhere."
College Freshman,2,Campus really isn't very diverse.
College Freshman,2,You can walk to everything on campus but if you want to get off campus you are going to have to find a ride.
College Sophomore,2,There are few real attractions near by and they all very expensive. 
College Sophomore,2,I played on the basketball team last year and it was pathetic how little people cared. No one takes pride in the athletic teams on campus. 
College Sophomore,2,The social scene is horrendous. Samford is known as being a bubble campus and this is very true. Most of the kids come from the same background and have the same interest. If you do not share these same interests then you feel left out. 
College Sophomore,2,The hours and food quality is pretty bad. 
College Sophomore,2,"Samford is a small, private school and therefore you get around campus on foot. To get off you campus you must have a vehicle."
College Freshman,2,"Since the school is Baptist affiliated, and right in the middle of the Bible Belt, I would say it is not overly accepting of persons with varying religious beliefs or sexual orientation. I don't think these people would be harassed, but they would definitely feel alienated because most students are Bible-believing Christians. "
College Freshman,2,More money is always needed but they helped where they could.
College Junior,2,"At first, your scholarship seems great, but they don't tell you that tuition will go up a good amount each year and your scholarship won't change. You won't even get the equal percentage of the new tuition. I thought I could afford Samford all four years, but now, as I approach the ""real"" world, I find myself taking out more and more loans. Also, the department I'm in seems really strapped for money and only gave our $1500 in scholarships last year."
College Sophomore,2,The caf is only good when parents are here.  I exist on cereal.  I wish they would have more pasta and rice.  Perhaps some fresh vegetables to put on the pasta and rice.
College Sophomore,2,"Having just begun at Samford University I am unsure as to how to grade this criteria. I know that Samford, as all colleges and universities, promise to not withhold admission of a student based on race, religion, sex, etc..."
College Freshman,2,"Its a conservative private university, so people aren't there for the ""crazy night party life"""
College Freshman,2,"Its rare for athletes to be able to eat what is served as the main courses for the meals, we usually have to stick with the salad bar and grilled chicken options"
College Junior,2,"Apparently there is a Samford shuttle, although I've never seen it. There are no buses or other public transportation vehicles that come there. The parking situation is also infuriating if you are a commuter and don't live on campus."
College Junior,2,"Major Division – There is a major division between Greeks and Independents mostly because of the economic situation of the students. The students on scholarships can't afford to be Greek, and those that are Greek flaunt their money. Occasionally, Greek and Indies have good mingling in campus areas like University Ministries, RUF, and Campus Outreach. Greeks also have a stereotypical ""dress"" that can be spotted from anywhere."
College Freshman,2,"Birmingham is an area that still feels part of the ""Old South."" There is very little racial diversity on our campus. Being raised in England, but recently living in Atlanta, I am used to a wide range of races in one city. Yet Birmingham--and it is reflected in Samford's student body--has not yet adapted to racial diversity. Although this year a large number of Chinese students are studying at Samford, the percentage of other races in our student body is appalling. I believe that our president, faculty, and students are aware of this almost-embarrassing fact, it is tough to recruit when Birmingham is embedded in white culture. Samford, although I love it and am getting an incredible education, is unfortunately commonly known as a 'rich, white school.'"
College Freshman,2,"The teams at Samford are average and fan support is very little. The facilities are getting much better. Students have school spirit in honor of the school, and not the sports teams."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Safety at Samford is pretty good and they are pretty lenient towards being college students and doing dumb things every once in a while. However, other campus policies such as visitation require students of the opposite sex to check in at a residence life office before they can enter opposite sex housing. This rule is acceptable for freshman, but should be lessened as the years go on."
College Freshman,2,"Watch Out for Values Violations – You can get a values violation for almost anything: jumping in the fountains, throwing water balloons, having boys in your room, drinking, etc. It's better just to avoid it all together."
College Sophomore,2,"They were not helpful at all for me. Even before freshman year, I did everything I could to get scholarships and only received $1000. Then I went to ask for help when my father lost his job and got very little help. It is quite difficult to work with them."
College Freshman,2,"Samford has some Greek life. There are definitely other groups to get involved in besides Greek life, but it is also very popular among those who do it, so it really depends on the person. Greeks have housing but only some of their members stay there."
College Freshman,2,"There is great parking for people living on campus, but for commuters it is horrible."
College Junior,2,"Baptist Middle School – The rules here are very strict, and a recent campus newsletter comment accurately described the social life as resembling your average Baptist Middle School. However, it is easy to not get caught."
College Freshman,2,"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus – Boys at Samford are just plain weird. One minute they can be cool and talkative, but if you make the choice to talk to them first, they think you want to marry them. Girls are another story; I have met some pretty cool ones who know themselves and I have some (most) who are really fake."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics aren't Samford's strong point. If you want a great team to cheer for, you probably shouldn't come to Samford. Most games are poorly attended. However, there are a few very dedicated fans."
College Freshman,2,"The Caf – Because Samford is small we have but one cafeteria called the caf. At the beginning of freshman year the caf is great! The food tastes good, but by second semester it gets to be little tiresome, and by sophomore year well, it is very old. The food is good just not after a while, and to eat healthy, you are stuck with sandwiches and rabbit food. There is a food court that is pretty good downstairs and you get $130 a semester to spend in there that is attached to your tuition."
Senior,1,"I would never recommend online classes at Samford. For the price you pay, you do not receive your money's worth. You're better off paying less at a community college at a state school, learning more, and transferring the credit."
Niche User,1,"I went to Samford university and had to transfer schools. The entire school and experience was awful and a complete waste of time. The living situation/dorms are out of date and constantly having plumbing issues. The professors are bizarre and teach nothing -they mostly just go off on tangents for lecture. Hardly any of my classes transferred, so the accreditation is terrible. Greek life is basically a cult there and unless you join, your options for a social life are nonexistent. When I went on my tour of the university compared to actually attending and living on campus was a night and day difference. The tours seem great, but in reality everything said on the tours are lies. A terrible university, NOT at all Christian, and a complete waste of time and money."
Junior,1,"The campus and its grounds are actually nice but only from the outside. Most of the buildings are extremely dated along with the facilities. The cafeteria is absolutely repulsive along with all the new meal options like Chick Fil A and Moes for example are good but they are not good options to eat healthy or every day. This may be a factor of why so many people on this campus are obese and always sick. If you are looking for a fun experience you may as well immediately disregard Samford University in your search for a college. Although the fraternity and sorority life is a very large factor on campus, these are not normal fraternities and sororities. It seems as if they hand out bids to just about anyone and they do not have any true friendship bond which is what greek life is mainly about during college. Overall it is not a NORMAL school for NORMAL people or people trying to expand their knowledge or culture in any way."
Niche User,1,"If you are looking for a place that allows you to grow into an adult, this is not the place. The rules are ridiculous.  Also, there is absolutely no parking here."
Alum,1,"The entire BSN program is unorganized, the professors do not teach the material we are tested on, they have very low tolerance for anyone that has a learning or mental health disability."
College Freshman,1,"I do not enjoy it. It is too small, the housing is absolutely awful. Tuition should go more towards improving residence halls, instead of the landscape and outward appearance of the school. Half of the time, there is no hot water that works. I have not enjoyed my freshman year at all. The teachers here are excellent, and the classes are challenging and prepare you for your area of study. However, the campus is dead on the weekends. There is nothing to do. If you are someone who loves to have a good time, do not come here!"
College Junior,1,"I'm not particularly a fan of Greek life, but I know people who are. It depends on your personal preference, but if you know you do not like Greek life I would not recommend Samford."
College Freshman,1,This school needs to lay back.  They are way too uptight about no alcohol on campus.  They basically want you to be imprisoned and have no fun.
College Freshman,1,What party scene?  Everyone is boring here.  There are no parties and no one ever wants to go out to bars.  It's pathetic here.
College Freshman,1,I have to go to other schools to experience good parties; it's that bad.
College Freshman,1,"I'm big on being greek in college, but greek life is terrible at Samford.  There are only three decent ones but the system of getting a bid is extremely flawed.  If you don't come down to pre-rush events in the summer or know someone who is a best friend, you are not getting a bid.  Plus they don't do anything."
College Sophomore,1,I feel like I am in elementary school all over again. Its like I am being babysat 24/7.
College Junior,1,"Most of the ""nightlife"" in the area is strictly for those 21 and up. There are a few 18 and older clubs, but they're sketchy at best. The most a freshmen or sophomore can get are the occasional house parties, but be warned. Also, the campus likes to judge those who go out, which is awful. Most of my friends have to go to events at other colleges in the area to have fun."
College Freshman,1,The diversity aspect of Samford University is probably the worse. Samford University is  predominantly caucasian school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Do not go to this school. Samford is a liberal arts school that graduates lots of clueless students who end up working retail because they never learned anything useful.  This happened to me.  Don't assume that just because you may earn a degree, that you will be getting a good paying job. Do yourself a favor:  save your money, go to a technical college, and learn a real skill.  Besides, Samford is not a fun place to be for 4 years.  They restrict your freedom, and most of the students are rich snobs."
College Freshman,1,"Samford has very little variety.  Because so many students are of similar race, ethnicity, and religion, people feel obligated to be just like the crowd and often fake it even if they are not like that just to fit in. Often students leave Samford because they do not fit into the norm. I feel like there are many accepting students of other cultures which help them to feel comfortable but diversity is limited."
College Freshman,1,"unless you're a caucasian middle/upper class southerner – The title says it all.  If you are caucasian, middle/upper class southerner that enjoy not being challenged or put out of your comfort zone, you have found the college for you.  Bring your own car, so you can go home along with the majority of the students, because no one stays here over the weekends.  It's a dry campus, but no worries, if you're into the drugs and alcohol scene that is here also, but be hush hush about it, because as a 'baptist' university it would be a terrible reputation breaker.  Gotta watch out for that.  Oh, and if you're not white, you're just not treated like an equal, but its okay because Samford absolutely loves diversity...or so they say.  Sure the academics are good, but then again do you really want to spend four years of your life at a glorified high school where they have visitation rules, pest infested dorms, and a food court that doesn't stay open over the weekends?"
College Freshman,1,"Hard to Fit in If You Are Not White – There is no diversity at Samford. Almost everyone here is white and comes from a missionary family. Not that it is a bad thing, but it makes it really difficult to fit in if you are Native American and come from a small school."
College Freshman,1,"There Is None – The only transportation offered is bikes you can rent for free, but they are usually always rented."
College Freshman,1,Suitcase School – Everyone goes home. Night activities are sparse at best. There is virtually nothing to do here.

The businesses provide internships.  The community also attends sporting events, concerts, plays and other student events on campus. The community also sponsors the athletic teams and concert series with donations. The college is located near a German Prisoner of War Camp, a museum, Great Salt Plains Lake and Refuge, the Alabaster Caverns and the Little Sierra State Park. 

There is always something to do in the community.  It is a safe environment to learn."
College Junior,5,You have a mixture of all types on campus

College Senior,5,The life on campus is amazing. I am a senior and I still live in the dorms because of the cost and they are always having great and fun activities for the students to be involved in and get to know people. I love being apart of all of it. And the facilities provide great places to hold all of these events. 
College Senior,5,The school takes great pride in our athletics even is the season isn't going so well for a certain sport. I know we moved up to D2 (correct me if I'm wrong) and it's been great for the school but the sports are still getting used to it. But the school and the students are awesome at supporting them no matter what. Coming to NWOSU was the best decision I have ever made. I am so proud to be a Ranger!

College Senior,5,"This college is very strict on plagiarizing and fraudulent misconduct within writing assignments and projects. They use programs that help detect if this is being done on most assignments, my advice is to do your own work and learn to cite everything!!"

There is no judging on personal beliefs or sexual orientation and everyone respects each other and is positive and polite towards each other."
Recent Alumnus,5,"For my degree in Early Childhood Education, I am well equipped to go into the classroom.

Sophomore,4,I truly enjoyed my time spent at Northwestern Oklahoma State University. The classes are generally small sizes making it easy to get to know classmates quickly. My professors were great. They truly took time out of their day aside from class and lab to ensure that you were on the right track. NWOSU is a good school in general. I would recommend it to anyone.
Senior,4,"When I went to Northwestern Oklahoma State University I loved the campus. It was not super big but it also was not super small. Pretty great size. I also loved how they have a football and soccer team, my two favorite sports. They also have the most important thing for me, my major, nursing. I heard that they had a pretty good nursing program.  Another thing is the people are extremely nice and friendly."
Sophomore,4,For the time that I was at Northwestern; i was very happy with my experience. The Academic program was very good and I enjoyed it very much.
Freshman,4,Alva is a great community. The community does a lot for the college. The college its self-has great teachers that are willing to help you. The only downside is there is not a lot to do in town. The closest place to do anything in is an hour away.
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have enjoyed the atmosphere of this university and my time here as a student has been a great experience. Since the school is quite small, classes are smaller which allows for a more personal environment in the classroom. I am a shy person so asking questions in a large classroom is horrifying to me, but in a smaller class, I am more comfortable with asking for help during class which allows me to fully understand the topics."
Freshman,4,"Amazing school! Everyone is so friendly, the professors try their hardest to work with each individual student and make sure they are understanding the curriculum. I've never been to a class in which I felt no one cared about my education. I am proud to call myself a Ranger. The campus is taken care of and is absolutely beautiful. The dorms are extremely nice in comparison to many colleges I looked at before attending NWOSU."
Junior,4,Northwestern is a smaller university that has a good connection between professors and students. They have many activities where students can participate. They demonstrate care for the students and the want for students to grow.
Graduate Student,4,It is a small campus with different sites. The professors seems to care and with smaller class sizes they usually actually know you by name. Tuition prices are pretty good. Not much to do in small towns.
Junior,4,Very friendly campus. Has a larger high school atmosphere and most professors are always willing to help.
Junior,4,"NWOSU is a small, friendly college. They have some of the best curriculums in the state but they are not expensive.  Though small, NWOSU had a lot of student activities and groups to join."
College Senior,4,Great activities but average facilities
College Senior,4,Great school with a great atmosphere
College Freshman,4,I didn't get to go to many games but you would hear everyone talking about it in class the next day.
College Freshman,4,I love the community. I also love the atmosphere of the school and teachers.  They have helped me out on more than one occasion.
College Senior,4,Most are nice and helpful
College Junior,4,I know several people who have graduated from the nursing school and all of them have been successful in their careers.

College Sophomore,4,Except for a few bad teachers I'm so excited that I decided to be a student at this college! The dorms are definitely old school and the cafe isn't the best place to eat. Almost every teacher that I've had has been extremely wonderful and understanding!
College Student,4,"My favorite experience so far has been the activities during Rowdy Week. They had movies on the lawn, hotdog feeds, and of course the block party on Friday night. I would probably of went to a community college first if I could have a do over, simply because the change from high school to college is pretty significant."
College Junior,4,I enjoy the school that I picked. If I had to pick another school I would still chose this school. I like the environment that I am in and I like having close friends around me.
College Sophomore,4,They get everything done pretty quickly but make sure you fill everything out early.

College Sophomore,4,Most of the school will work with you if you make a poor decision. They try to help if you get into trouble.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms on campus are not new by any means, but they are friendly and the best option for most students. Parking is very easy, and the campus is small, so walking to class is the best option."
College Junior,4,The tuition is not outrageous but still gives you a great education at the same time
College Junior,4,At our campus it is mainly directed towards business degrees and nursing.  Since we are such a small campus off of the main campus a lot of the classes are offered over ITV.
College Junior,4,Everyone is accepting of one another and does not discriminate.  We have a very big population of lesbians and gays in our community and they are not treated any different.
College Junior,4,The campus maintains the grounds very well and the campus is kept very neat and clean.
College Freshman,4,Small campus so parking isn't a big issue
College Freshman,4,"Older campus, but they care for it. "
College Freshman,4,"Small town, but they value their college and treat the students well. "
College Freshman,4,"Buildings are close, so weather isn't a huge issue. "
College Freshman,4,They offer a pretty good variety of options. 
College Freshman,4,I have not had a problem with this here. 
College Freshman,4,"I changed my major, and it wasn't too difficult. "

They want to make sure alcohol and drugs are not in the picture. They want to show students that you can have a great party or get together without all of that. 
Niche User,2,I have not taken any online courses at this university so I cannot speak to the standard of this part of their education system.
Niche User,2,The professors at NWOSU were pretty good with some exceptions but overal the school is boring with no social life
College Junior,2,"I enjoy my school, the only thing i would fix is a few things around campus, like dorms, gym, parking lots, and then there are some problems with the way classes work here."
College Sophomore,2,"There is really no places to eat off campus. When you do find a place that is good, the hours are inconvenient. The service at almost every off-campus dining location is very, very slow."
College Sophomore,2,The food in the cafe always makes me and my friends sick. I have had raw chicken and was very sick right after. There is not a lot of options to choose from. It is the same thing every day.
College Freshman,2,"Alva is a small town, therefore there isn't much. There are a few chain fast food places. Other than that, it is pretty much just Mexican food."
College Freshman,2,The only place to get decent food is the student center. Eating in the cafe makes me sick and I despise eating there.
College Freshman,2,The dorms are small. I guess you get what you pay for.
College Student,2,"Not many options for off campus dining. In Alva the only chain restaurants we have are McDonald's, Taco Mayo and Subway. There are more dining options at the Enid and Woodward campuses."
College Senior,2,Oilfield popularity has caused prices to skyrocket in the last few years for a small town. But it's still better than dorm life.
College Senior,2,"Small town with more college kids than citizens. Nothing to do but drink or go to the movies. No attractions, rare activities, Brown's Shoes and Walmart are as far as shopping go."
College Junior,2,"NWOSU is located in a rural community. The closest mall and decent hospital is 75 miles away. The closest airport is two hours north in Kansas. This provides a good idea as to the type of dining present in Alva, OK. For low budget options under $10, there are a handful of fast food chains including McDonalds, Sonic, Pizza Hut, Taco Mayo, and Subway. The best places to eat in town are Gambinos (pizza) and The Sandwich Shoppe (only open 11-2;5-8)."
College Junior,2,"It's very quiet in Enid, Really only 2 Bars everyone goes to, and There are your average bowling alley, downtown life etc"
College Junior,2,I am actually not familiar with the meal plan.I have heard it is good though!
College Freshman,2,"The amount of dining halls (2) is reasonable because of the size of the campus, but the food variety is poor. The Student Center is the best place but they only serve breakfast and lunch. Also, there isn't much healthy food."
College Sophomore,2,"The people in the financial aid office are very nice and good at what they do.  I did feel like I was led on when accepted to the school.  I was given a full ride scholarship my freshmen year then my sophomore year, I recieved less than 1/4 of that amount despite the fact that I am a 4.0 student.  Thankfully, I had outside scholarships but I did feel ripped off. On the bright side, NWOSU is a very affordable school."
College Freshman,2,Small Town – Northwestern is located in a very small town. It is a place where everyone knows everyone else. Most of the time this is a good thing.
College Sophomore,2,"Alva does not have very many places except for may be fast food. And even then there is only a few. The only actual ""restaurant"" is Champs and it only opens at 5 in the evening and then it is a little expensive for a normal college student. There is Gambino's and Chopsticks though. Gambino's being a pizza place with a good college student discount and good food. Chopsticks is a chinese place that has become a favorite of most college students just because it is a nice difference to Mcdonalds or Taco Mayo which is what most students can only afford."
Alum,1,I was manipulated and lied. The best thing about my experience with science professors. It has been to long and I cannot remember how to spell their names. I found out that the school's academics were worthless for were I was trying to go. Wasted my time. I was told we do not hire people with an Oklahoma education. Thanks alot
Niche User,1,"I went to NWOSU for my freshman year of college. I had an awful time there. The dorms are tiny and no one follows the rules for curfew or respect of others trying to sleep. I was kept awake many nights when trying to sleep because of the large amount of students making noises late into the night. The one good thing about my experience here was the teachers. Most of them I got to know personally, and they really seemed to care about me as a person and my goals. The community is very supportive of the students, but most of the students that I met at this college were awful to me. Hardly any of the students I met were prepared to be in college, nor were any of them academically minded. Most of them were just there to party. The food in the cafeteria was absolutely disgusting and the price we had to pay for it was criminal. I understand since I left the school there have been some improvements, but when I was there it was awful."
College Sophomore,1,"Hard times with financial aid. Workers in admissions, financial aid are rude, not very helpful either"
College Senior,1,"Coming from a guy, Coronado Hall was atrocious. There is only one laundry room that all four floors are expected to share. My suite never had hot water to bathe in. I got woken up frequently by noise violations from drunk students above or beside me. It has made me incapable of living in a dorm setting ever again."
College Senior,1,"There are two Chemistry professors on campus. You will have to take both of them. One is extremely harsh and cannot speak fluent english, and their slides are not very clear. The second has no concept of time. They will always show up late to class, almost always keep you later than they should, and you most likely will never see three of your five exams because they won't grade them in time to return them."
College Senior,1,The weather at my school is crazy! It changes just about everyday and sometimes multiple times in one day. You can wake up and it's cold and rainy then by the afternoon you need shorts and a tank top. It also snows pretty bad and this past year we were out of school for over a week! It's crazy but when the weather it's good it's good. The only issue is you never know what the weather will be like so it's hard deciding what to wear or if it's fitting for a relaxing day outdoors with friends.
College Junior,1,"At NWOSU there are two sororities and one fraternity. Only one sorority has a good reputation, but the other seems to draw more participants. The lone fraternity is not recognized and does not complete its' philanthropic duties. No Greek housing available."
College Junior,1,"it is non-existant. relatively small campus, transportation not needed"
College Sophomore,1,"Their is no house on campus. The people in it are shaddy, and you have to pay a lot of money."
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation provided. The campus isn't big, so you wouldn't really need it. But there are no buses in the town to get you from campus to Walmart, or a restaraunt, or the bank, or downtown, or anywhere."
College Sophomore,1,I cant say that i had problems with parking because i don't have one to park on campus. From what i see on campus parking is crazy considering that many students park along the sidewalks beside the dorm when there are no parking spaces. Our Security gives a numerous amount tickets. Don't really know the cost of a permit.

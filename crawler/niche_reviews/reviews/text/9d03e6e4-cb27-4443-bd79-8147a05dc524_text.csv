Niche User,5,"My classes switched to an online format in March last school year. All of my professors were prepared for the change, and it was nearly a nearly seamless transition. I still learned just as much online as I did in-person."
Niche User,5,"My experience at Auburn University has been fantastic. I feel that I have received quality education near my hometown. Classes are not too large, so I feel like I am able to connect with my professors and other students."
Freshman,5,"AUM is the school I worked so hard for because it met all the circumstances. It's the school  they accepted me based on my academic and progress and my ambitions, not because of where I came from. I also meet a lot of intellectual people. The business program is rated as #1 top business schools to attend."
Freshman,5,"We offer a wide range of highly interactive courses that you can take entirely over the Internet. All of our courses include expert instructors, many of whom are nationally known authors. Our online courses are affordable, fun, fast, convenient, and geared …"
Graduate Student,5,"When I came to AUM in 2018 after receiving my Associates Degree, I was fully prepared for what it would be like taking online classes. The communication is key to the students success in online classes. Most students who leave High School and are introduced to the online environment are not prepared for the responsibility of deadlines and submissions. This Summer I took all of my  classes online. The MBA Graduate degree program is an online program which allows me to be able to work part-time and have enough time to work on my assignments in the evening.  Whenever I email my professors, they come back with a prompt answer. If I had a problem with my internet service or I could not get an assignment to submit, they have no problem opening the assignment back up for submission. The College of Business has great teachers and they really care about you and try to help you in any way they can. The group assignments are very interesting because they allow me to interact with other students."
Graduate Student,5,"I chose AUM because of the attractive Campus setting and the location. I like the fact that their new student orientation is very personable and they allowed myself and my parents to be in separate meetings to learn about every day operations. The parents were able to ask questions to a chosen panel of administrators which included the Chief of Police. The campus is clean and the staff and faculty are very friendly. The overall campus atmosphere is refreshing.  Most of the dorms are nice and spacious; however, there is a long waiting list to get a room.  The Student Athletes are involved in community service projects which I think is awesome. The Student Body is very active attending the games and supporting other events held on campus. There is also a scheduled on-campus bus route that carries the students to and from Walmart which is very helpful for students with no transportation. I would like to see the college expand to offer more student housing which would increase enrollment."
Junior,5,I haven’t taken an online class yet but I have friends who have that they said it was a very good experience!
Junior,5,"Most classes are often in person, but due to the recent epidemic, all classes had to quickly switch to online. AUM handled the sudden change with grace and gave every opportunity to students to help them make it through the semester. The regularly scheduled online classes are well thought out and challenging."
Junior,5,"I love how much of an international school AUM is. It has an ever-present sense of community that permeates the campus. There is a variety of students in terms of nationality, age, race, and class. AUM embraces diversity, allowing for a global feel at a local university."
Junior,5,I have taken about 6 online classes including those required for covid shut downs and the first little while was rough but after the teachers and students acclimated it was outstanding.
Junior,5,I've found it to be one of the more diverse universities with so many opportunities. It is a smaller university but the teacher have the ability to help you more because of it and become more personal with your needs as a student.
Sophomore,5,"AUM was the school I worked so hard for because it met all the circumstances. It was the school where they accepted me based on my academic and progress and my ambitions, not because of where I came from. I also met a lot of intellectual people. The business program is rated as #1 top business schools to attend. One thing I would like AUM to change is having my scholarship opportunities for the current undergraduates."
Freshman,5,The online classes are very well guide. They offer the ability to get your degree at your own pace and work on your schedule.
Freshman,5,AUM is great size college. it is just the right size that you are able to have a community of people that you can come to know while also having a large enough college that they offer many different degrees and class schedules that work with a student who has a full time job.
Niche User,5,I have five to two other colleges and AUM is by far my favorite of the 3 in terms of professionalism and communication.  Thank he responses from teachers and advisors are prompt and courteous.
Alum,5,"I had a good experience at this college, I was a transfer student. But I can say once I go to the school the teachers and staff was very helpful with my college experience and academics. The teachers was very hands on since it is a small university, you can be a BIG FISH in a small pond. However, since I didn't go my first two years I did not know my classmates very well just those in my college/field."
Freshman,5,"So far, I’ve only visited Auburn University at Montgomery but it was my most enjoyed college visit. I’ve been to a total of 6 different colleges and only 1 out of those 6 satisfied my expectations. They are known for being one of the best business schools in the nation and with me wanting to major in finance, that would be excellent."
Freshman,5,"Overall AUM is a graduate school. They put education over parties so if you like to party AUM is definitely not the school for you. I this year I stayed in p-40 if you love to cook like me and my roommates I recommend P-40 or Warhawk for incoming freshman to be in Warhawk your first year you WILL have to pay a 100 dollar deposit. Also I love the fact that we have no class on Fridays and on holidays we are our for two days because some professors work on Mondays & some work on Tuesdays so its a win win. With AUM you will not have to pay to wash your laundry like some schools do. Somethings I would change about the school would be the lack of parties, the fraternities and sororities and the food even though we just started having Chicken Alfredo and we received a ice cream machine. Other than those things I am having a great year so far and happy that I picked AUM to further my nursing career."
Sophomore,5,They really focus on your academician future.  The professors will take their time to work with you one on one if you show that you are trying.
Freshman,5,Auburn University of Montgomery is a really good school. You will enjoy the campus it as a lot of activities that happens around the campus so you will never be bored mainly if your really bored and would like to experience theses activities. The professors are really helpful about you getting help and making sure you not fail. AUM is really helpful with the tutoring its never a time where you cant help your work they provide a lot of things to help you graduate from college and be success. They also have a good accounting program as well I'm going into the accounting program and I am willing to stay at the school because its really good campus. You will get your moneys worth with the living process as well because their dorms are really nice and its a really small school so you will know everyone you walk pass everyday you will see them around. This is a really good school for people who are scared of big schools and small schools.
Freshman,5,I enjoy AUM because of the small atmosphere while being on campus and the resources that are provided help tremendously.
Sophomore,5,"At Auburn University Montgomery, I like the small school factor it has. The faculty and administration are so nice to me every time I have a question or need help on something. I like how the tutoring centers here at the school are included in our tuition so whenever I need help on a math problem or paper I can always go ask one of the tutors on campus."
Niche User,5,I liked how when I visited it wasn’t a big of a campus and how everything was a good walking distance.
Freshman,5,"My first experience at Auburn University at Montgomery, I was nervous but at the same time I was ready to get the semester going! I love the campus, people are friendly, and a nice environment. This semester, I plan to expand more and get out my comfort zone and get a chance to meet new people, working with new people, and attend events and get more involve. I want to see a change in the environment to where everyone feels comfortable and actually participate in the evens, clubs, and organizations."
Junior,5,It is a really great school. The staff and students make you feel at home! There is always something going on at the campus and is available to anyone wanting to attend.
Freshman,5,"I love the math bootcamp, it’s very helpful and easy to understand. They help out as much as the can with academics and it’s an all around great place to be."
Senior,5,"Hello,
 I love AUM. FROM THE MOMENT I STEPPED FOOT ON THE CAMPUS I FEEL IN LOVE WITH THE WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT OF THE STUDENTS AND STAFF. THEY GENUINELY CARE ABOUT YOUR WELL-BEING. NOTHING NEEDS TI CHANGE ABOUT THIS PLACE."
Freshman,5,"Auburn University in Montgomery, Alabama is a great school. I've learned many things while attending here, the professors here are very intelligent and they know what they're talking about, not to mention they're very lenient and kind to all their students. They manage to keep the campus looking clean and brand new inside and outside."
Niche User,5,Had a wonderful experience when I attended the open house. Love the atmosphere and the people. Very convenient to local shopping places. Easy access to campus.
Freshman,5,"The diversity , the professors. Simply everything is great about AUM. The dorms are even better and especially the roommates , people that I’ve never seen or met before became close friends. Professors became family."
Sophomore,5,The school is great. Everyone is very helpful and makes you feel welcomed. My favorite part of the school is that it is so diverse. There are so many different cultural backgrounds you cannot not help but feel like you are apart of something special. The environment is lively and there are campus events everyday to meet the special interests of every student.
Freshman,5,"The professors, students, and staff are very friendly! Everyone here is dedicated to success and making sure everyone succeeds. There are plenty of free academic resources available on campus. This is my first semester here and I have enjoyed my time here so far. There is always something to participate in on campus."
Freshman,5,I love Auburn University at Montgomery! It is such an amazing school and has the absolute most for the money you spend.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at AUM has been great. I really love the campus. Class buildings are not far from the dorms. One thing that is very helpful is the teachers and tutoring for when I need it. Professors are always an e-mail away for when you have questions. And when I needed help with math, tutoring was and still is my best friend. Older students are always around for your benefits. The living situation is also good in my opinion. I love that 
I get the opportunity to make new friends every year with my roommates. A thing I would encourage all upcoming student is to invest in rainwear such as boots and coats. It rains a lot and there are dangerously big rain puddles."
Freshman,5,"I haven't quite yet got accepted until the college. But the recruiter came to my school last week . I enjoyed his presentation , their great people to work with . They have great benefits . You wouldn't really need a car for transportation . They have a bus that  you can use for transportation . Plenty of invents and clubs you can attend. Overall the school is a very high ranked college."
Freshman,5,"Auburn University at Montgomery is a very small, yet lively college. I like the fact that it is small because I can get to know a lot more people, be informed with campus events easily, and communicate with my professors easily as well. The campus always makes sure that the students have things to do such as Silent Disco party, outside painting, sorority parties, movies on the lawn, etc. We have a Student Success department that does everything in their power to make sure the students are successful and help them strive for the future. I take full advantage of these opportunities and resources to improve my college experience."
Freshman,5,"The professors and advisors, everyone at AUM, is committed to helping you succeed. I have never seen a more supportive college with free tutoring help that really works. Everyone is super nice here as well. The food in the café tastes really good and is affordable."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Auburn University at Montgomery was an amazing experience. The school is very diverse and they offer a lot of programs during school hours and on the weekends; and a lot of volunteer opportunities. The faculty there is very nice and supporting as well. There have been many instances where I needed help in the hallway and a employee was able to help.  Since the demographic of the school is so diverse, they offer many different talks and seminars from special hosts to AUM's very own teaching staff. Overall, I've had a very good introduction to AUM my first year!"
Junior,5,I love the staff and how much there is to do on campus! The teachers have all been so helpful and have kept me on track. So far I have enjoyed my time at AUM!
Freshman,5,"In April I finished my first semester. I will be 30 in 11 days, so not your typical college student. I decided on this college for its many choices and grand reputation. It has not disappointed, I’ve already learned so much! I look forward to the next 3 1/2 years."
Sophomore,5,"Being that I am a Sophomore at the Auburn University at Montgomery, so far my experience has been good. AUM provide many opportunities to get involved on campus so that your voice can be heard. One of my favorite features that AUM is the learning resources.  They have many useful resources that can be used to get help outside of classes. If I had to change anything about Auburn University at Montgomery, I would change the food options and tuition fees. The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled. Overall, my experience at AUM has been non-complaint and decent. I am very excited to see where AUM take me in the near future!"
Freshman,5,I love the apartment style dorms and the classes are so small so it is easier to learn. The staff is very welcoming. I love being a Warhawk. AUM is a great place to be!
Freshman,5,"Diversity is amazing 
Could have better professors 
The pre classes should count for the gpa instead of not counting becouse we paid 1,000 for that clssss"
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and how nice the campus was . I automatically felt right at home . The professors were nice and ready to help students succeed at a moments notice. The dining was really nice . Thee dorms were nice and modern
Niche User,5,"My experience with AUM was moderately pleasing to me because I made some new friends while I was there. I loved the scenery of the campus and it was easy to get around. I made it to my classes on time due to the fact that the campus was pretty small, and all of the buildings were close by. I enjoyed staying on campus in a dorm room(yet sometimes the fire alarm would go off and we would have to evacuate). However, I still enjoyed it no matter what."
Freshman,5,I love everything about AUM!! The professors are great. They don't mind helping students. They have tutors that are glad to help students. The food is good and they offer a great vatiety. I don't have a car so I catch the transit to do my shopping and I haven't had any problems. I enjoy going to thw wellness center. There's so much to do there.
Freshman,5,I love AUM! It's a medium-sized college so classes are never over crowded. The professors are great and so are all the on campus events.
Niche User,5,"Auburn University is an academically sound university and is known to produce some of the greatest known professionals in the world. The campus isn’t so big that I’d feel insignificant as I would at other universities. There is a friendly atmosphere and a sense of family but very prestigious campus, one I truly want to be a part of. Diversity on the campus is a mixture of the world we live in be it global or within the borders of the United State. I like the dorm options seems to be a great fit because of the options. My only concern would be the entry level based on the ACT."
Freshman,5,Such a great environment with caring and considerate faculty. Since it's a smaller school your professors will know you which is comforting. Everyone is super nice and accepting. It's great sense of community. The dorms are nice and the RAs are pretty chill.
Freshman,5,Auburn University at Montgomery is one of the greatest university's. It's professor to student ratio is beyond to compare. We just opened a Panda Express in the cafe.
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time as a student at Auburn University Montgomery. The professors and staff are friendly and the classes are easy to obtain. I love the online website because it is easy to navigate and provides any information sought.
Sophomore,5,I like the great diverse culture that I'm around and I also just love the great overall positive vibe that this college brings.
Freshman,5,"So far since I been here, it’s been nothing but great people environments etc. I've met so many interesting people and I must say, when they say they care they mean it. All my professors were/are understanding and caring when it comes to their job. We as AUM students are their number one priority. the staff is wonderful and they treat you so nice it's like they've known you forever. We have so many resources/ supports here and I can honestly say, I feel at home."
Niche User,5,I don't attend AUM yet but it is the college that I am hoping to get accepted to. I have been on campus for tours and have visited some friends of mine. The campus is beautiful and well maintenance. I've heard of nothing but good things about how the professors and how they really care about your academics.
Freshman,5,"Auburn University-Montgomery has always been in the top 10 of universities I planned on attending. The professors, faculty and staff here are absolutely amazing. The classroom settings are not large so this gives the professors the opportunity to get to know each of their students on a personal level. They will also help you in any shape or form they can. There are free tutoring services here on campus."
Niche User,5,"Auburn University Montgomery is very nice and clean.  I liked that all of their programs are very close together and you do not have to drive to get to your classes if you live on campus. I wish Auburn, Montgomery would make it easier to go over to Auburn,  Auburn and that the scholarships would stay if you transfer over."
College Freshman,5,"I stay in the newer dorms and so far it's really nice. They're big and spacious . The other dorms are pretty nice as well , all the dorms have about the same distance to the class area . The more private dorms are pricy but you do get what you pay for ."
College Freshman,5,"I didn't go to AUM yet, but when I visited the campus the teachers all seemed so nice and involved. Not only the teachers, the counselors were also helpful."
College Sophomore,5,I'm excited to share that I've obtained a degree.
College Sophomore,5,I LOVE OUR WELLNESS CENTER!
Sophomore,4,"The professors are always at your disposal. They respond quickly to your concerns and questions. The work was fairly easy but you do have to read, work ahead, and study in order to pass."
Freshman,4,"I am beginning an online course this semester. I am looking forward to it because I did online high school classes, so I am expecting to feel comfortable with this class."
Freshman,4,"This college has been great so far. Of course the experience has been different than the typical experience would be due to COVID-19, the faculty has been very welcoming and helpful to any questions I may have."
Junior,4,Everyone including students and staff are so nice! Their is such a diverse of people and cultures and its amazing.
Freshman,4,"I have not begun attending yet (I will this fall), but I can already say the staff is incredible. Everyone is helpful, and they all know what they're doing. If someone doesn't know the answer to a question you have, they know the exact person who does. I myself didn't know much of anything about college, but the staff was welcoming regardless and answered all of my questions very clearly, with ease and care. I felt bad reaching out to ask questions, but upon finding out how friendly everyone is, I felt better and I know more about college than I ever thought I would. The school also offers a lot of opportunities, is fairly affordable (and has guaranteed scholarships given your ACT score), and even offers superscores for the ACT for more scholarship opportunities. They also offer free tutoring. I visited the campus and was incredibly impressed by the looks of it. All of these factors have me very excited for school, and I feel more secure in what I am doing as a student."
Freshman,4,"This is one tight-knit college. The relationships between students are more than strong, and it's always help everywhere you look. The school also hosts many great events and activities that will draw you out of your dorm and cause you to, truly, enjoy your college experience. Another positive thing about this school is the strong relationship you're able to build with your professor; this allows more help and devotion from the teachers."
Junior,4,Auburn University at Montgomery is a good college for students who need small class sizes and/or a less expensive option. Most of the professors care more about their students instead of just grades. They push to see students excel in their academics and are willing to help those helping themselves.
Freshman,4,I like the ratio of students per class. it is more personal. It allows you to listen clearer and ask any questions.
Freshman,4,"The campus is perfect and beautiful, not to big. Staff and current students are super friendly and welcoming. The school strives to make sure students are very involved with school activities. The staff are super helpful from bookstore, advising, and counseling staff members. However, there are a few problems I've encountered already just being here for a few days. Almost everything is ran by students, which mean they could only do so much and know certain things, when calling for problems the housing office could be of more help instead of having to wait a few days to get your problem fixed, and they only give freshmen 48 hours to make any complaints about their rooms which could seem like a lot but technically day 1 you're moving in trying to get settled and clean and day 2 still settling in and may not notice things as early on. Other than that it's pretty good so far. #AUM23"
Sophomore,4,This University has great faculty and professors. The fitness center is the best in the city. I enjoy the flexible course hours that are offered as I work full time and the hours that are offered fit my schedule. The campus is clean and there are a lot of student events that go on during the semester. The men's soccer team is one of the best in their conference and attending sporting events are always fun. The cafeteria has a lot of good food choices for every diet.
Freshman,4,What I like about AUM is that most people come out to campus events and when you see that you see the diversity and people that are interacting with each other. People there makes campus feel like home.
Sophomore,4,"I love this University. The faculty and staff is very welcoming and they love helping and making sure we feel at home. I enjoy the diversity on campus because I love meeting new people and learning about their different cultures. The only thing I would change is the Cafe food, I wish we had more varieties to choose from."
Junior,4,"Overall great school: I changed my major and, due to hardship, left AUM with 4 years of course work but no degree. Personally, I appreciated the smaller campus and classroom sizes. The campus itself is nothing special aesthetically. Academically, coming from a college-prep high school, I aced nearly all of my general education courses. As a single parent, I had to bring my child to class once. All of my teachers that day allowed it. The higher level teachers presented a nice challenge, but with some of the level 1000 and 2000 level course teachers, I felt like I knew more about the subject matter than they did--notably one of the Spanish courses I took--but again, my high school was so difficult, I appreciated a more lax college experience for the general requirements. Dorms have improved over the years."
Sophomore,4,I do love this university. Everyone has a good attitude and the staff are very helpful. I do believe that I am learning many things that will help me get the job I want.
Freshman,4,I had my doubts about attending AUM. Auburn University at Montgomery is a great school. The professors are pretty nice and you’ll always have the one professor that’s hard on you. I love that there isn’t any class on Friday’s. You have classes Monday-Thursday.
Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are small which means you have the opportunity to create an strong relationship with your professors, something that is not often found at larger universities. My experiences with a little over half of my professors has been great. The majority of the educators here want to help you succeed and will often set time aside from their own schedule to help with any questions you have for them. The new Wellness Center is equipped with a pool (both indoor and outdoor), plenty of treadmills and elliptical, and a wide variety of free weights and machines."
Junior,4,Auburn University at Montgomery is very diverse which is a main attraction. This allows everyone to feel as if they have a place to belong. The environment is very warming .
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at AUM, it is very nice school. The advisors and professors are great with helping you succeed at AUM. There are plenty of resources for free if you needed help with school work."
Junior,4,"AUM is a large community campus with a diversity of students and a library full of resources but the classes seem too large and the Professors seem disconnected to their students.  Also, there are constant last minute class cancellations and unexpected costs."
Freshman,4,The campus is open yet not too big. The staff is always nice. I wish they had more hours on the cafe and library and math lab past 9 for students who work.
Junior,4,"Overall, AUM is a good school. Certain classes can be tough but that’s at any school. There are lots of things to get involved in and lots of organizations you can join."
Freshman,4,AUM has a very diverse student body.  The campus is large enough to give you a real ‘campus’ feel but small enough that it still feels ‘familiar’.   Auburn is a name synonymous with excellence so it’s great being part of such an established institution.
Sophomore,4,"I like that Auburn University- Montgomery has so many opportunities. They also have very helpful resources. You are guaranteed to pass all of you classes. Their housing is affordable and comfortable. I look around and all I see is smiling faces. No matter which part of campus you are on, you will always feel welcomed. Everything is nice and up to date. It is good to know that you are not alone in this college journey because it can be stressful. There’s  always someone to talk to on campus. The only thing I wish could be changed is the food."
Freshman,4,I thoroughly enjoy Auburn University in Montgomery. I am an upcoming freshman with a major in Nursing and the positive environment of the school has really made me feel at home.
Junior,4,"I have always enjoyed Auburn Montgomery as a place to pursue a college education. The campus is smaller and caters to a more diverse age range, but you still get that quintessential college feel and experience. There is a very active Greek life and regular activities that include all students. The class sizes are similar to that of high school, so the students and professors get to know each other and they're willing to work with students most of the time. I really couldn't imagine having gone to a different school, it's been a perfect fit for me and I hope it is for other people too."
Sophomore,4,"Small but good. Small class sizes and nice professors. Short walks to class, parking is not a huge problem. Montgomery is not the most exciting place so there is not much of a night life especially if you're under 21."
Alum,4,The instructors are very knowledgeable and did not mind you asking questions when needed.  The instructors were available when they said that they were.  The college provided a variety of programs and degrees under the different programs.
Sophomore,4,Auburn University at Montgomery is a smaller school which makes it easier to make meaningful connections with faculty and fellow students. The university does a great job of making college life manageable for a student population that is mostly made of long distance commuters and working students. Auburn University at Montgomery is located in the capital city of Alabama which means there are always and abundance of activities going on and ways to get involved in the community if you just look for them.
Junior,4,I am elated that AUM gave me the opportunity to finish up and complete my degree studies after first attending way back in 2004. I am determined to finish up my last year up and get my degree.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Auburn University Montgomery have so far been good. I'm a strictly academic student that have a job on the side I love the campus its for the most part quiet, peaceful and safe. There are always people there to help when it is needed. The campus is near a great shopping center with a variety of stores to choose from in the spare time. My professors that I have encountered my two years hear have for the most part tried there best to make sure the students got the education needed in there course. Extra help is given if needed, tutoring is available. They have a great gym that have absolutely every work out instrument you could possibly think of needing there as well as work out classes such as yoga, Zumba, Cardio Classes and more, these classes are offered everyday and you don't have to register for them. It have great diversity with friendly faculty and staff as well ass students. Therefore my experience at my university have been awesome!"
Junior,4,"AUM has many caring professors that are willing to take the extra mile to ensure your success. Cafe food choice is limited, but there are many restaurants nearby. Students are also very friendly. Overall I have enjoyed my time at this campus."
Freshman,4,"The professors are really nice and helpful. I love how close the classes are! the hard studies are going to help me succeed in my career.  I wish they would change all of the nit-picky class room stuff. I really do enjoy going to this university, and I would strongly recommend to any upcoming high school seniors that they should attend."
Junior,4,Being a junior I've gotten the chance to see what AUM is all about. The home of the War Hawks is a nice institution to experience college life. if you like to be in a big city but small school its perfect. its in the capital of Alabama and it is filled with just the right mix of education and fun. There are so many resources for students. I has became my home away from home. Hopefully you can come and it'll be the same for you!
Senior,4,"Great school. Curriculum is slightly difficult compared to other colleges in the area. Diverse, but needs more student activities and things to do."
Freshman,4,I like AUM because it has a great staff and campus. The new gym is great. The only thing I wish was different about AUM is that it would have more campus events.
Freshman,4,So far I have had nothing but good experiences while attending this university and hope that they stay that way throughout the remainder of my college career
Junior,4,"I like the small class sizes and the friendly natures of the professors. Although the campus is small, there is a great amount of diversity. There are plenty of ways to be involved on campus and to join organizations that can help you make friends easily."
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior about to graduate from AUM. I have had a pretty nice experience here at AUM, but of course there are some things I wish I would have done differently. If you are looking for that stereotypical college experience where there is lots to do, AUM probably isn't for you."
Freshman,4,"It is a good school. There are campus events that are o.k. The staff here are great they really do care about your education. When I first got here the events held were really fun at first, then after while they get boring. You meet many friends here so you. It is a friendly environment"
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience living on campus.  I don't have to rush to get to class, have internet connection, get to utilize the campus computer lab, and library. In addition the campus has its own health facilities."
College Freshman,4,"I am really enjoying my experience so far. The classes are hands on and I get to get firsthand ey. In addition, the campus is located near very thing from shopping to emergency services. I also get the opportunity to meet and collaborate with students from other countries."
College Student,4,The professors are nice and motivate students to do their best.
College Student,4,"AUM is its own thing, not directly associated to Auburn by much except name. It has high ranks in its business and nursing programs."
College Student,4,AUM is a safe campus that works quickly to solve any and all safety concerns.
College Student,4,"The North Commons dorms feel like a hotel, but the elevators can be a bit shifty at times."
College Student,4,The Wellness Center is basically brand new and the teams are top notch.
College Student,4,It's a very beautiful campus and the people are extremely friendly. All the staff and faculty make you believe they want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,"When I began my first year, there were a ton of groups giving away free things I didn't want as I went to class. There were also a ton of events that I didn't go to! I like how there aren't classes on Fridays."
College Freshman,4,Classes seem like they don't have no more than 30 kids in them. The professors I've encountered are cool and are here to help but do want you to learn as well. The courses offered are a wide variety.
College Freshman,4,I'm a new freshman at AUM and so far I love it. They actually do have events on campus a lot but no one really knows about them which is why some people say they're bored. I'm on the bridge program as well and so far the professors seem like they really want the students to strive and be successful .
College Sophomore,4,Crime is very little to nonexistent at AUM. You can literally go from North Commons dormitory to the Nest in the middle of the night with no worries about your safety.
College Sophomore,4,"When I first started college, I worried that it would be like starting high school all over again.  As a current second year student, I can easily say this is not the case.  I've met more people than I expected to and made friendships that will last a lifetime."
College Junior,4,"Courses are difficult and require a lot of time and effort. A student definitely needs to work hard to succeed. There are plenty of options to take, with different professors. Most professors are very helpful and want to help you succeed. They try hard to give you plenty of opportunities to grow in your knowledge. Classes aren't too large, so that makes it easier for professors to work with students individually."
College Junior,4,There are many places a student can go to get advice or help with choosing a career. Career success is very imprtant to the staff. Individual professors will even help students if they need it. I am regularly sent emails about internships and job opportunities based on my major. There are career fairs every semester and they are helpful for knowing whats out there.
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on campus because there are campus police patroling the campus at all times. Also set up around campus are posts where a student can call for help at any time with a simple click of a button. Campus police will come right away if you need help. The parking lots are well lit, so you can easily see the way to your car or building. Students receive a text and email if there is ever an emergency situation, so students and teachers always stay informed."
College Junior,4,"Being a smaller school, AUM doesn't have a football team, however, we have a lot of other sports within the college. I've met many students from all over the world who have come to AUM for their athletic programs. Whether it be tennis, soccer, or basketball, these students are very successful in competition. Many students enjoy going to the games and supporting our teams. Having attended a few, I've seen just how spirited students can get at a game."
College Junior,4,"AUM is unique because it is a smaller school, but is also considered a high level school by employers. There's always a lot going on and plenty of ways to be involved in the school. It's a college that challenges you, but also helps you succeed through tutoring and any extra help you need. I definitely would attend this college again if I did it all over again."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at AUM is always really helpful. It's always easy to get everything done sometimes the work is too much, but this is college."
College Sophomore,4,"The security guards on campus are actually cops that had gone through the police academy and passed, so the cops are real cops, they just work for our school at the time."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience her has been great. My teachers are very nice and to me it makes me feel like they care. Everyone is very helpful around campus. If there is a question to be asked about anything just ask someone. If they do not know it they will find someone that does.
Senior,2,"I loved my teachers and their style. They make an effort to know the students and assist in the best way possible. However, administration does not care about us. For example, they do not make an effort to keep us updated on changes in our financial aid, resulting in charges on student accounts we are unaware of."
Freshman,2,"The school is way too expensive for all that they have to offer, the food is awful and the staff members suck. Don’t expect to make friends here easily because most people are rude for no reason and have bad attitudes. Campus life is dead and there’s not much to do here. Don’t come here if you want to actually enjoy your college experience."
Freshman,2,"This is a college that does the bare basics and feels completely detached. There are barely any clubs or orgs and the few that exist are hard to join. The school is also old and outdated. And generally everybody scoots in and out of the campus making it extremely difficult to make friends. Overall, I would rate this an average if not below average college. I can’t say that I would recommend it. Hoping to transfer out sometime in the future to UAB which is SO MUCH better."
Freshman,2,"Auburn University Montgomery hasn’t proved to be as good as it tries to show on the internet, there is no campus life, the number of students are less as compared to campus size, the housing apartments aren’t renovated and you don’t have any activities to do. Montgomery is a very dry city with slow life and no point of interest of students."
College Sophomore,2,"With are school being so small, there is probably five different Greek groups. I see them recruit around campus sometimes, but it's more like they are looking for people instead of people flocking to them."
College Sophomore,2,"Although we have an array of sports here, I feel like no one actually attends. The reason for that though I feel is because not a lot of people that attend this school are young. Many of the people that attend are of the older generation. That means many have families and other duties that the last thing on their mind is some basketball game."
College Freshman,2,It is bad because they school is right off of the highway and anybody could come on the campus.
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life at school is not big or known really, you barely so the Greeks or their parties, if there is any."
College Freshman,2,When I came to school I thought that my financial aid had been distributed and it hadn't so when I went to financial aid they just keep giving me the run around on what I needed to do. But eventually I got it taken care of.
College Freshman,2,My tips would be to make sure you get it done weeks in advance
College Junior,2,There are a lot of people from other countries. There aren't a lot of attractive people.
College Senior,2,"We have some teachers that are good people, but NOT good teachers.  They talk, but never teach."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks do not have their own houses, so it is hard for them to function like Greeks do at bigger schools. The Greeks at AUM are only given a single room to meet in, so that makes it hard for them to become larger and as involved as they might want to be."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't had a great experience at AUM. I have had terrible advising, there aren't many social events, and classes are difficult."
College Sophomore,2,The only good bars are the high-class expensive bars downtown and in Old Cloverdale. Underage nightlife is awful and the few places they can get into are expensive. There are rarely any parties but they are usually good when they happen.
College Sophomore,2,Most students commute so a car is pretty necessary. It is not clear at first which spaces are teacher only until you receive a ticket. There are always open spaces but you usually have a long way to walk to get to class. No spots are close to the class buildings.
College Sophomore,2,There's no where to hide from the rain. If it's raining and you don't have an umbrella you WILL get soaked
College Junior,2,Walks to class can be difficult during storms
College Junior,2,You really need a car if you are going to be at AUM.
College Junior,2,"There is no other way to use your meal plan.  Trust me I have tried.  There are two places you can use it.  1 is the cafeteria and 2 is our coffee bean shop.   The food is very limited.  We have pizza, salad, chicken, bean bowls, and subs.  They have pre-rapped stuff from Walmart, but it is WAY overprices. With most of our options you can order it “the way you like it” but after a few weeks you have tried everything on the menu and every combination. We are trying to work on improving this.
"
College Junior,2,"I do plan to have an internship, and I do have concerns about finding one.  In my degree everyone has to have an internship to graduate.  That being said there is high demand on internships.  I worked as an intern when I graduated high school, but that was not related to my degree.  AS far as student teaching I have been a volunteer teacher for children for several years. "
College Junior,2,"Night Life would have to take place off of school grounds.  There are plenty of spots in Montgomery, but none on campus.  As far as transportation goes we do have a bus that will take you to most of the places you would want to go in Montgomery, so you are good to go.
"
College Junior,2,It is very hard to find a park close to your class. 
College Senior,2,Main campus is one of the best. Especially football
College Junior,2,"Drug safety is not as strict as it should be. Although there are not a lot of students that uses drugs, there are a few. The few that use drugs get away with it because there is a wide range on independence and privacy when it comes to being in dorm rooms."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, no one really cares too much about the greeks here. If you're apart of them, if you're not, great.  They do a lot for the community and offer numerous activities on campus, so they're not ""bad"" per say, but they're not exactly the life of the school either."
College Student,2,"AUM have only few scholarships to get for continuing students. It is really hard to get the scholarships. The scholarships there are not well announced. Another thing, the scholarship requires one to have a close to perfect GPA. For example, the scholarship requires one to have a 3.5 GPA. I am not eligible for any scholarships there with only a GPA of 3.0. I could not get any grants based on what my parents made last year. I am desperate in need because both of my parents work for or get there money from the government. Since congress did not sign the form dealing with the deficit budget. My parents who helped pay for college will not get the same amount of money they have made last year. It is not really that much help from financial aid. I applied for FAFSA for both AUM and Auburn University at the same time. I got my reward towards FAFSA at Auburn. I still have not received the reward at AUM. The people over financial aid have told me that I would get the reward over the summer. Still to this day, I have not received it yet. I would wait again, but if it gets too close towards late in July. I really have to talk with them again."
College Freshman,2,"I personally don't really see drugs, just smoking. Although many people smoke. Drinking and partying may be more popular in the dorms but nothing goes into the classrooms and on the main part of campus."
College Senior,2,You normally don't see them or know that we have any greeks unless they are having an event or fundraiser. You have to keep your eyes open to find out whats going on or where they will be
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is not a substantial amount of public or school transportation, and what there is does not run reliably. It is also not available 24/7."
College Senior,2,I have only received one scholarship while at AUM and it was only $500.00 for books which was only for one semester. Not saying that I am not thankful but scholarships are competitive. You have to truly stand out from the crowd. I have received ample amounts of federal student loans but that's just debt. I haven't had trouble reaching financial aid representatives and most of them have great attitudes and are willing to help.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is not that great it only has 3 places to eat. However, they do have good salads, which is important when considering ""freshmen 15"". East Chase mall is right down the street and Atlanta highway has a lot of great places to eat."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm from out of state & was not really given many good oppurtunies to get scholarships, some where based on ACT scores & they didnt want my SATS.  I cannot say how is it for instate students though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Much of a Nightife – This city is not really a ""college town"", and although campus life is growing, it still remains largely a commuter campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Construction Mania – See Auburn University Montgomery isnt a big school, we dont have a far commute to classes the building are all bunched together. the dorms arent very far away from the West courtyards maybe a 2 minute walk and from the North Commons maybe a 5 minute walk. Well now we have a load of construction going on which makes the commute longer, the cafeteria has a broad choice of foods so no one is in there, and barely if they are. Its just boring here on campus its nothing much to do."
College Freshman,2,"Just a Few Parties – Auburn University- Montgomery, has little to no nightlife activity. We have had about two parties on campus hosted my greek life members. They were memorable, but if you are looking to party every week AUM isn't a place for you."
College Junior,2,"Not Worth the Money – AUM cafeteria food is not too bad, but it is not too good either. There is the typical salad and sandwich menu and recently added chicken grill, providing chicken fingers and sandwiches with fries, and Papa John's pizza, but the price you pay for any of the foods provided is far more than the value. There are not too many places around campus to get other foods, and with only a 40 minute lunch break you are almost stuck with buying the mediocre meals in the school cafeteria."
College Freshman,2,you have to go and get a parking decal for visitors that's just crazy. I love my school but the parking is ridiculous. It takes forever yo find a good parking spot.
College Junior,2,Registration Process – AUM's clinical psychology department lost my application and took over 2 months to inform me on my acceptance even though it was only supposed to take 3 weeks.  Let's hope my experience with the school gets better!
College Junior,2,"The only real way that you can get around is by walking. You can drive your car to school but there is no other way to get around the campus but by on foot (or if you bring your skateboard, bike, etc). There is a city bus that can bring you to and from campus and wherever else is on its route."
Sophomore,1,I need to be face to face. There’s way too much work thrown at with very little explanation on what to do.
College Freshman,1,I don't eat on campus
College Sophomore,1,"Most students do not even know that we have a transportation availability.  There is one, because I have seen it driving on campus before.  However, it is not well publicized."
College Senior,1,I had 1 class to finish and they cut me off before I could graduate!
College Student,1,I've learned that the average 'arrive 30 mins early' for a good spot doesn't work for AUM. You need to arrive at least 45-60 mins early to even consider getting a close spot. Any time after that and you don't get close to your building.
College Senior,1,"The availability and convenience of parking spaces is absolutely awful if you are a commuter student. The resident students have a bad habit of driving to classes instead of walking which means that there are less parking spaces. Commuter students can not park in the dorm parking lots, so this adds more stress to the situation. I would suggest getting to campus at least thirty minutes before your class starts because of the lack of parking and the long walk if you manage to find parking."
College Sophomore,1,Parking can be a headache! Most people fight for a close parking place. You have to get there super early in order to get your desired parking place. And it is the same for housing parking places.
College Freshman,1,No Help at All – The financial aid department is not a department I like dealing with. The workers are not on top of their game ever.
College Senior,1,"School of Education – There is allot of emphasis placed on skills you will need as a teacher.  The one big shortfall is in teaching us not only how to use up to date automation, but in teaching us how to teach with it.  AUM is good, but many of the professors are stuck in the distant past."
College Sophomore,1,"I currently use the PACT program that covers most of my tuition, but the school has not made any effort to send financial aid/scholarship to help me qualify for additional assistance to cover the remaining expenses and books."
College Sophomore,1,"It is easy to get a loan, but grants and scholarships are hard to come by"
College Sophomore,1,It rains alot in the summer so walking to classes can be a burden.
College Sophomore,1,"We have a very good tennis team, number 2 in the nation, they won 7 times the national championship. The other sports are not bad, but it's not that great. Not a lot of people are coming to watch the games. The gym is just a joke. I have never seen in my life a gym smaller than this."
College Freshman,1,The only nightlife I know of on campus is evening classes.
College Freshman,1,"very boring, there are little parties on the weekend but nothing big. and there is nowhere to go if you are under 21. the people are nice but its really boring."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty Dry – Night life is pretty nonexistent if you're under 21, besides a few stray places that are mostly geared towards one culture."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus at AUM is a nightmare; unless you live on campus. we must walk at least a mile away and the parking lots are all seperated, and the buildings are so far a part, that when its cold outside, you get iceburn from just walking!"
College Sophomore,1,Campus Activities – There are hardly any. Not much goes on at campus. Just go to class and go home. There is nothing there to keep the students hanging out there any longer than they have to
College Junior,1,Leave Town for Parties – Clubs in town are fine if you're of age. Parties on campus are boring. You're better off going out to Auburn main to find a good party. They have better bands too.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not enough.  Much of the handicapped parking is not all that close to buildings.

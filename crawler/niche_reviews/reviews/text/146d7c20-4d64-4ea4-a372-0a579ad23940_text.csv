Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Washington and Lee so far.  The students and faculty are amazing and encourage exploration in all disciplines.  I am an arts and business student.  My various advisors and professors always try to collaborate to make sure my schedule works and I have enough time to finish assignments.  As a member of Greek Life, my time at W&L has been significantly influenced by my sorority in the best way.  Overall, Washington and Lee is an amazing place for students both academically and socially."
Alum,5,"I did not attend online classes at W&L but I am very well aware of the efforts being made by professors to make online learning accessible and interactive for all students, both in person and virtual."
Alum,5,"Graduated in 2019. I loved everything about the school. Yes it has a rough history and it is not perfect, but the atmosphere, students, professors, social scene, housing, food, and sports make such a positive impact on people's lives including mine."
Alum,5,"No online.                                                                                            
All classes were in classrooms.

The systems that they had online were great. They could have compressed everything into one central site, which they did the year after I graduated. So great!"
Junior,5,"I know it's been a hot topic recently, but I would like to set the record straight. This school is by no means perfect, like all other colleges there are plenty of flaws, but it is truly one of the best options for an undergrad university that you could choose. Despite what rumors may have indicated, most of the students are incredibly friendly, academics are superb, the town of Lexington is adorable, extracurriculars are treasured by nearly every student. Unlike some of the schools I have previously attended, W&L is an incredibly close-knit community full of passionate and hardworking students. It is considered ""cool"" to be smart, and students at W&L work and play hard. Also, If you are considering playing a sport here- DO IT! As a student athlete I have had an incredibly valuable experience and the woman on my team will likely be close friends for the rest of my life. I simply love this school- of course it is not perfect, but no school is."
Junior,5,"There is no better school in the country for civil discussion and diversity of thought. W&L allows students to explore ideas freely and openly, something that is rare in the modern university. Greek life is a big part of the University’s culture, and it creates long-lasting bonds. The campus itself is among the most beautiful in the world with the colonnade as it’s shining star."
Junior,5,"The University had a quick turnaround time for online classes due to COVID -19, but things were well thought out. Online classes themselves are not the most enjoyable, but professors adapted and learned."
Freshman,5,The speaking tradition establishes a sense of camaraderie  and community on campus. Everyone is willing to stop and speak to someone if they need help. The professors take the time to get to know their students and form personal connections with them.
Niche User,5,Washington and Lee University is a very prestige academic institution with dedicated professors. It offers an above standard liberal arts education with over 50 majors and minors to choose from. Their large endowment allows for exceptional financial aid packages that are affordable and flexible. It is a D3 school with very competitive sports teams that allow for both athletic and academic success.
Alum,5,"W&L is an exceptional university with a rich history, rigorous academics, and a strong alumni network. Contrary to its stereotype, the student body is pretty much half conservative and half liberal (relatively conservative compared to most colleges; however, this even divide really surfaces some interesting conversations and greater tolerance towards others of differing political beliefs--which is nonexistent on college campuses nowadays). The surrounding Rockbridge area is picturesque, and there is so much to see and do. While classes are pretty challenging, they (and the professors that teach them) are incredibly engaging and stimulating. I can't say enough positive things about W&L and how much it has changed my life for the better."
Senior,5,"Wonderful school with dedicated professors, small class sizes, and strong alumni connections. The majority of students have successful career outcomes and all students receive a strong, liberal arts education."
Niche User,5,The community was so tight knit and friendly. The honor code is an amazing policy. The people are great and the town is just as cool! So much history as well within Lexington.
Freshman,5,"W&L offers endless opportunities to its students (grants, fellowships, study abroad, extracurriculars, classes, etc.). The culture is social; people are friendly and energetic. Greek life and parties are popular, but learning to navigate this environment strengthens your sense of self and knowledge of your own needs. There are other people and alternative activities - a student just needs to be willing to explore beyond what is the most visible option. 

There is work to do and changes still to be made here, but that's why W&L's motto is ""not unmindful of the future."" If you are willing to fully challenge yourself to take action in and out of the classroom, you will truly find a home here among the quaint city of Lexington, the beauty of the nature, and the enthusiasm of the professors. Reaching adulthood and personal growth isn't meant to be easy, but at W&L, you will build relationships that remind you what it's all for."
Niche User,5,Beautiful Campus. Friendly people. Good food. Great Academics. I love the place so much everyone has been so welcoming and inclusive. Alumni network is insane.
Junior,5,"It’s the best school in Virginia for a reason. Superb education, sense of community, and social life. One of a kind"
Niche User,5,"The campus is amazing and small, the education is second to none and, the people are very kind. The honor system makes you feel very safe on campus and the city of Lexington, Virginia is absolutely amazing."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 2002 and I still keep up with my professors, faculty, classmates, and most of all my fraternity brothers. The alumni connections are worth the tuition alone. It teaches you far more than what can be taught online or in a classroom alone. The best 4 years of my life!"
Freshman,5,Fantastic place.  Always have felt welcome.  Freshman dorms are very nice and new.  Food is great.  My professors are excellent.
Sophomore,5,"I'm so happy I chose Washington & Lee. My experience at W&L thus far has been amazing. The academics are challenging and engaging, professors prioritize their students, and the campus is GORGEOUS."
Freshman,5,"It's such a great school. Professors, alumni connections, and resources are amazing. Greek life is very open and friendly. "
College Sophomore,5,The alumni connections through the school allow for graduates to have an immediate family and go-to in the working world. A graduate can connect with alums who will know exactly what type of person they are getting. Career services are so helpful and will remember you personally throughout the years meaning they can give you advice and notify you of opportunities as they scroll across their screen.
College Sophomore,5,The integrity and honesty present on campus provides for a very safe environment to live and study.
College Sophomore,5,"The first year dorms are all newly renovated so the dorm experience is amazing. The rooms are very nice and very big. All the showers are new, clean, and spacious."
College Freshman,5,I love everything about the school
College Freshman,5,The Student Career Development Center is wonderful and it helps us utilize our vast alumni network.
College Freshman,5,"Fantastic. The dorms are like apartments and there are newly built 3rd year housing which includes full kitchens, three floors, washers and dryers, and huge beds."
College Freshman,5,I love everything about W&L. There is not a single bad thing to be said about it.
College Freshman,5,"Professors all really seem to care about their students. The classes are interesting and class sizes are small which makes learning more personal, especially as you get into more advanced major-related courses."
College Freshman,5,"The school is known across the country for being one of the best of the best, and a W&L degree is a great thing to have on your resume."
College Freshman,5,Lexington is a wonderful community. It is definitely a college town. The LexPo are pretty relaxed and nice if you are polite to them! I have never felt unsafe on or around campus.
College Freshman,5,Campus housing is stunning. The freshman dorms are some of the best in the country in my opinion. Pretty large and well maintained. The RA's are all pretty wonderful as well.
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of varsity sports that many students take part in. The equestrian program even takes students who have never ridden a horse before! Rugby is the most popular club sport, and many young men take part in it."
College Freshman,5,I have had a wonderful time at W&L! It is a great school and is well recognized across the country as a top-notch liberal arts institution. I don't think there is a bad program in the entire college.
College Student,5,"Greek life at Washington and Lee is, in my opinion, one of the best in the country.  It is easy for anyone to find a frat or sorority that they want to join, and almost everyone does end up going greek."
College Student,5,"From the beginning of the admissions process to now, Washington and Lee has been the best experience of my entire life.  The alumni are extremely connected to all who apply, and from the day I was accepted I remember having many people who I did not really know call me and talk about how happy they were that I was becoming a part of their college family.  The people at school are very easy to talk to, party with, and learn with.  A very work hard, play hard environment leads to many girls and guys getting together and getting to know each other well.  I love my college."
College Junior,5,Most of my peers have already committed to career prospects well-above those of students at similar caliber schools.
College Junior,5,"W&L is an extremely tightly knit community. Although the Greek system might create an illusion that the school is fragmented, students really care about the development of one another. By the end of your 4 years, you will likely have strong bonds across the entire community. Combined with the small and engaging classes, W&L fosters a supportive and valuable learning experience."
College Junior,5,Important to W&L's rich tradition.
College Sophomore,5,"The campus career services aren't that great, but the personal alumni connections you make and will make absolutely make up for it."
College Senior,5,"I love this place. If I had to make this decision again 1000 times over, I would make the same choice every time. W&L has given me so many opportunities for personal and intellectual growth. I've had many firsts here, and some lasts as well. The professors are amazing and really care about the students and their success. I've house/pet sat and had dinner at my professors' homes, and I see them all the time at Kroger and at restaurants in town. I have close relationships with my academic advisors and can talk to them about anything. Residence life freshman year was awesome and everyone got the shared experience. By the time recruitment rolled around in January, we were all on even footing and more comfortable with the upperclass women, which made the experience more enjoyable. I pledged a sorority and never looked back. I love my sisters and the way the Greek Life and campus life fit together like two puzzle pieces; it's like no other college I've seen or heard of, in that respect. Because 85% of students participate, greek life at W&L is open and inclusive with minimal infighting. (That said, the rumor mill is unreal here. Everyone knows everything.) As an athlete I've gotten close with my team, but widespread student body support of athletics is nonexistent. For instance, it's school tradition to leave football games at halftime. I love living off campus and having my friends live off campus where we can hang out together in a more comfortable, relaxed environment. Some of my best memories are in off campus houses either partying or just having a quiet night with friends. The honor system is REAL. Yes, some do cheat, but as a school, we don't condone it at all. The professors trust us implicitly and I've enjoyed the freedom to take tests whenever I want (within a certain period) and have keys to all the classrooms in my department. I know this is really long, so some highlights to finish it off: House mountain hikes, Fancy Dress, and the greatest people ever."
College Junior,5,"W&L will be the best four years of your life. After graduating, students enter one of the strongest alumni networks in the country. For instance, W&L has alumni across several prestigious Financial Institutions most prominently Wells Fargo, Sun Trust, JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank. From my experience, all it takes is an email to any of these alumni and 90% will respond almost immediately with a genuine desire to help. Plus, the alumni at these institutions are constantly pushing to hire more students in investment banking analyst positions."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love my school. W&L gives me the ability to study at a top notch institution while still being able to be involved in many areas of campus life.
College Junior,5,Students will always feel safe thanks to the honor code.
College Junior,5,"As long as you don't lie, cheat, or steal you will be respected by administration and public safety."
College Junior,5,They just updated Graham-Lees and Gaines and now they are immaculate. Most freshman will live in these two dorms.
College Freshman,5,"High prevalence of parties, if you want to go out on the weekend there is a place to go. Parties take place mainly at fraternity houses, windfall, and pole houses with a few off campus houses in addition. The vibe at Washington and Lee is work hard play hard. People work very hard to get the grades they do and the parties act as a way to blow off steam and rejuvenate."
College Freshman,5,"While my living situation this year is below average, there is a huge amount of construction happening right now which will provide amazing dorm living for the next incoming class."
College Freshman,5,"For a school of its size, nature and academic reputation, W&L throws down pretty hard. Whether it be Red Square parties or late nights at the poles or Windfall, there is always a solid party on every Wednesday Friday and Saturday"
College Freshman,5,The Honor System is well-upheld. The University constantly works with students in order to act in the student body's best interests.
College Freshman,5,"The Johnson/ Robert E Lee Scholarships are phenomenal. Unlike most Universities, W&L allows you to use the money to cover Greek Fees and Housing."
College Freshman,5,"W&L has an extremely active party scene. It's common for students to go out three times or more a week. That being said, your friends understand if you need to spend a Saturday night in the Library. Parties are inclusive to all members of the W&L community."
College Freshman,5,"As of next year, all first years will be living in newly renovated dorms. In addition, the University is starting construction on a Junior Housing Development that will house the current freshman class and beyond."
College Freshman,5,The Johnson scholarship is absolutely incredible!
College Freshman,5,"Johnson recipients, Questbridge matches, and Robert E. Lee scholars basically all receive full rides for all four years. Definitely apply! Also, I've heard the financial aid is really great as well."
College Freshman,5,"There are parties almost every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday night and sometimes on other days of the week as well. Parties are super fun and although they're almost always thrown by fraternities, they're open to all students at W&L."
College Junior,5,"Lexington has delicious food, and the Blue Ridge Mountains are truly spectacular. Plenty of beautiful hikes and natural wonders to explore."
College Junior,5,Graham-Lees was the best part of my freshman year.
College Junior,5,Greek life is incredible - my sorority has introduced me to so many people and allowed me to enjoy social events and activities all over campus.
College Junior,5,My classes have been small and interesting. I'm very happy with my majors.
College Junior,5,"I love this school, and I am so happy that I decided to attend. I cannot imagine going anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"This fall, I had to take some virtual classes due to them not being offered in person.  My professors have worked really hard to shift the class to fit an online format.  Personally, I struggle to learn online and prefer to be in person; however, my experience online has been great comparative to my friends at other institutions."
Alum,4,"I cannot express enough gratitude for the education I received at W&L. I received a top notch education, met friends I will have for a lifetime, experienced academic and extracurricular opportunities I would have never imagined, studied abroad, connected with professors who I still speak to regularly, published papers and presented at academic conferences as an undergrad, and even researched alongside professors and was published as a co-author on those papers -- and all on a full-ride scholarship. It is by no means a perfect institution; few are. But you will be able to find or, if need be, create a space for yourself, and the opportunity and access you will find here is hard to match."
Junior,4,"I love my school because of how generous it is to students financially. Apply to the Johnson Scholarship! You never know if you can go to a prestigious college for free! The professors are really good and they all work so hard to let us succeed! I did not go to parties much but I've heard of how the greek system is very exclusive, have alcoholism, socially toxic, homophobic, etc, etc. I just hang out with other independents and focused on my schoolwork. You can still find your niche as an independent, person of color, and not rich. The school has been putting in a lot of effort to be more inclusive and educate students about diversity, but I don't feel like these are changing the campus climate much. The greek and non-greek people need to make friends more.

Summer in Lexington is boring and sad btw. Watch out for ""freshmen 15!"""
Junior,4,"I liked the small knit community here and the fun traditions. However, I see improvement in the mindset the town has increasing awareness about being more inclusive."
Alum,4,"Washington and Lee offers a wonderful liberal arts education at a premier southern institution.  Although the campus environment is not for everyone, I enjoyed my time there.

Prospective students should know that Greek Life, while not mandatory in any sense, is deep-rooted in our campus culture. That being said, there are plenty of groups and organizations for everyone to feel involved and welcomed somewhere. 

Professors genuinely care about students as individuals and many will make efforts to get to know you. Office hours are abundant and the professors are always willing to go over difficult material with students. Class sizes vary from 5 -20 students with few exceptions.

There are 5 dining areas on campus: one main dining hall and four smaller ""cafes"".  The food is alright."
Sophomore,4,My favorite things about Washington and Lee are the professors and the myriad of opportunities that come your way! Washington and Lee has great academics and encourages you to become the best version of yourself!
Sophomore,4,"As a returning student preparing to enter my sophomore year, W&L has already given me more than I could imagine in just one year. I learned how to adjust to different college classroom settings, how to establish good relationships with my professors, and strengthened my ability to present and work in groups. W&L has more than just incredible academics, but a wonderful social scene as well. The social atmosphere at W&L is open and friendly; the ""speaking tradition"" of greeting even those that you don't know is certainly still alive and I am grateful to be a part of it. If I could change one thing about W&L, however, it would be the pressure on every student that comes with attending such a prestigious university. As every W&L student was an excellent student in high school, there is a lot of pressure on everyone to keep up the good work that got us here. Other than this, W&L is an outstanding institution and I could not picture myself attending college anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"It's an excellent school, though the student body can be a bit elitist. Diversity is a bit lacking, but there's a strong but small LGBT community on campus."
Junior,4,Great school full of excellent opportunity. Has a great mix of outstanding (and difficult) academics and a large social scene.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are very approachable and willing to help in any way they can. The workload is challenging and heavy, but there are many resources available to aid in studying and learning material."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is very inviting and as a participant in a sorority, I believe that it is a great use of time and service. The housing is incredible and the friendships made are unforgettable. Greeks and non-greeks get along amazingly."
College Sophomore,4,I am a varsity athlete and I believe that the student-athlete community is one of the best. Most students at the school are athletes so there are many common interests. Most teams support each other and about half of the teams each year win their respective conferences.
College Sophomore,4,The school has amazing resources and opportunities to succeed and engage in activities that interest me. My only regret is not choosing a school with a better department for my major.
College Sophomore,4,so far I've been having a great experience its been really challenging and a fun environment
College Freshman,4,The houses and chefs are awesome. The comradery is even better.
College Freshman,4,"The school is trying to cut back on Greek life which is really hurting the students. Many people want to go Greek, but can not as the school has cut back on quotas. Therefore, sororities are not able to get girls they want, and some girls are sad when they get cut during rush."
College Student,4,"For the conference that we are in, we do very, very well, recently winning our football and cross country leagues.  The track team placed second, though we are going to be far better in the years to come, with the brand new facilities being built across the road at VMI.  Though not everyone participates in cheering for varsity athletics, it is definitely a large portion of many peoples lives."
College Sophomore,4,"This was my dream school and still is, even though I've broke through some of the gilded aspects of W&L and realized what it was really like in some ways."
College Sophomore,4,"Junior year on-campus housing is in the process of being built and many of the current sophomores (class of 2018, the first to move in next fall) have mixed feelings about this."
College Sophomore,4,"Because 4/5 students are Greek, it's technically inclusive, but within the sororities and fraternities, tiers definitely materialize."
College Sophomore,4,"I love almost everything about this school except for the fact that its cliques somewhat resemble high school. The more time that passes, the farther apart each social group drifts from each other."
College Freshman,4,"W&L has a good academic reputation and strong alumni network; people seem to do well after graduation.  The coursework can be challenging, but classes are small and professors are always willing to help.  Students, for the most part, are well-dressed and smart.  The social scene is greek life oriented."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is really great, but it is in the 'deep south' so some experiences have a more conservative flavor"
College Freshman,4,"The Drinking scene is huge on campus, but drugs are only there if you want them to be there. Despite this, safety is a huge concern of the school. Rather than condemning what they know will happen, they work really hard to maintain a safe atmosphere. Besides drinking, honor is a huge thing here. They take honor very seriously. This in itself creates a very trustworthy atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"The Dining hall is great for its purpose of every day foods; but there are great options beyond it. Including a kosher cafe and a co-op which both provide many more options. On top of that, sororities and fraternities have meals at their houses!"
College Freshman,4,"Generally they just want to keep things safe, If you're not making trouble, they won't bother you"
College Freshman,4,"D-Hall has been working on being a bit more original with their meals. As an athlete, Co-op is really convenient for me for later meals."
College Freshman,4,"The new housing plan for W&L should change things as they plan to move to two freshman dorms, but I live in Gaines and find the new post-construction Gaines great! Spacious and new"
College Freshman,4,Most people live in houses owned by their Greek organization. Some are very nice; others are worn down.
College Freshman,4,"D-hall gets a lot of flack from first years, but it's constantly improving. Sandwich and Salad Bars ensure that there's always a good option if you don't like the hot food."
College Freshman,4,"The dining hall has a lot of variety and has definitely been greatly improved this year! On the other hand, Co-op is great for late night eating."
College Junior,4,"I'm very happy with the professors, classes, and assigned readings. It's very possible to do well."
College Junior,4,"Because of the honor code, the administration trusts students to do the right thing, and therefore, much of the school's administration, regulations, and rule-making are left up to the students and the committees they appoint. I think it's a great system, but it also can lead to a lot of favoritism."
College Junior,4,Always easy and available - there are a number of landlords who regularly rent to W&L students and are very fair.
College Freshman,4,"They just renovated Gaines, so it is practically a hotel, and they are in the middle of renovating Graham-Lees, so Freshman Housing is pretty nice."
Recent Alumnus,4,It is super easy to major in whatever you want at W&L. I pretty much accidentally stumbled upon a second major and added it my junior year.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Parties are always happening, both formal and informal. Very awesome party scene overall. Most parties are open to everyone (at least after 10) and the administration funds a busing service so students don't drink and drive."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus is super safe from most crime without even being enclosed. You can leave your backpack somewhere and it will very likely be there when you return. The townies are pretty cool, except they might try to steal things from off-campus houses during school breaks. Lock up! The only real danger on campus, in my opinion, is drunk entitled frat boys who don't understand the word ""no,"" because no one ever told them that before."
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus is beautiful and the school is constantly renovating the older buildings and bringing them up to date. The new buildings are gorgeous and traditional.
College Junior,4,"My favorite part of Lexington Off-Campus Dining would be the range of options. There are restaurants that are more formal (and thus more expensive, although the food is phenomenal) that are perfect for special occasions, as well as restaurants that are less expensive, but still very nice. For a nicer place to eat, I would recommend the Bistro. Other great places to visit would be Macado's, Salernos, and Blue Sky."
College Freshman,4,"In my opinion, people are strict about the things that matter. They're lenient about underage drinking, which is good because everyone is doing it anyway. This way we're doing it the safest way possible. Parking could be less strict; never park in the wrong lot or you will get to make a trip to auto tow. Our honor system is the best in the country."
College Freshman,4,The honor system makes everyone feel very safe. Friends will always take someone to the health center if he/she needs to go.
College Freshman,4,"Food is good, but variety is limited. There's only one dining hall, and greek organizations have food in their houses."
College Sophomore,4,"If you don't want it, you don't see it"
College Sophomore,4,All night life is at fraternity parties
College Freshman,4,"Freshman dorms are old and small, but they just renovated Gaines which is now practically a hotel. The fraternity and sorority houses are very luxurious for the sophomores."
College Freshman,4,"I brought my own computer, which I use everyday for work and entertainment. There are some computers in the library and commons, but it would be helpful to bring your own."
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate in drug use at the school. However, there are a decent amount of students do. They don't advertise the drugs or make people feel uncomfortable during parties, but if people are trying to find drugs it is pretty easy to do so."
College Freshman,4,"Most freshmen live in one large dorm, which is fun and makes it easy to get to know one another. There are a few other dorms for freshmen and they are all very close to one another."
College Freshman,4,"Traveller is awesome for getting people around from parties, it's a safe and free option for all students, and the Traveller dispatch is great if there's an emergency situation."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't gotten to explore everywhere yet, but there are so many local options right in Lexington proper! Most places are less than a five minute walk and of course there's fast food about a mile or so farther down the road."
College Freshman,4,"Wireless goes out sometimes, but it's usually back up and running pretty quickly. I haven't run out of printing quota yet, so the printing is pretty reasonable."
College Freshman,4,"Drugs are not tolerated whatsoever, and while some people do sneak them around, if Public Safety catches wind of any activity, the culprit is reprimanded and must pay a fine, could even be kicked out of campus housing."
College Freshman,4,"Can be a little cold during winter, and we've had crazy snow this year, but it's beautiful during summer! There's almost always a rainbow after it rains too. It's beautiful"
College Freshman,4,Research in the summer can be competitive. Apply early.
College Freshman,4,"We have great Biology Professors here and lots of research options. However, the workload is crazy hard."
College Freshman,4,"I love the weather here! School gets cancelled if the roads are icy, but we do not get that much snow. Lots of classes are outside when it is nice."
College Freshman,4,"Lexington is a very small, cute town. There are no chain restaurants, but plenty of local places to eat, a movie theater, and fun little shops"
College Freshman,4,Public Safety is very available and constantly patrolling campus.
College Freshman,4,"Registration is maybe the most stressful part of many people's semesters. Classes are small, which is wonderful, but that means there's very limited enrollment. While that is the case, it's easy to get into classes you want to be in. If there's a class needed for an FDR (foundation and distribution requirement), it may be a challenge, as everyone and their brother wants to be in econ 101 and geology 111."
Alum,2,"Washington and Lee University has an amazing faculty and is situated in the lovely Shenandoah Valley, but unfortunately that's about all I can say that's positive about this institution.  Yes, the parties are pretty awesome during your freshman and sophomore years, but eventually you will become consumed with nihilistic despair as you realize how meaningless your life has become after having wasted so much time getting drunk with rich white kids who are trying to become investment bankers."
College Freshman,2,"Confederate flags everywhere.  Greek life rules. Super minimal diversity. The only social options are alcohol. Honor system is not as great as it seems. The academics are like a shining beacon of light, but some departments are super tiny and many professors seem very frustrated with the school/students. Financial aid is great. Sexual assault is problematic. Handling of sexual assault is problematic. Political awareness is surprising low for a school that sends so many students to politically minded jobs. Food is okay."
College Junior,2,"The law school has very few good-looking people, but the undergraduate side of campus has more. Everyone dresses the same on the undergraduate side of campus - the same brands, the same color schemes, the same clothing styles."
College Freshman,2,"Washington and Lee is mainly rich, white, Republicans. Most of us are open to diversity, but it doesn't really exist at our school."
College Freshman,2,"There's no kidding yourself, Robert E. Lee's mausoleum is the centerpiece of this campus. While slavery is not part of this fine institution, there is very, very little diversity of race and ethnicity. As for religion, there are many varieties of Christianity, and maybe 30 Jews. Socio-economics range widely, but the wide swath are upper middle class, white, suburban kids. I don't think I know any gay people here, but there are probably a few around. It is not a gay-friendly campus, but I'm sure if one is very comfortable in their non hetero-sexuality, they will make a niche for themselves. If you're not okay with conservatism, this is not the place for you. While you don't have to BE conservative, you have to know how to interact and co-habitate. The College Republicans is the largest club on campus, and Mock Convention is held every four years and is one of the biggest events of every W&L student's experiences. Politics are big, and will undoubtably come up, so don't be afraid to express beliefs, but know that it is a predominantly conservative place."
College Freshman,2,"For freshman, there is a lot that holds everyone's car, but is really far from campus. If a freshman car or an upperclassman who lives less than 5 miles away's car is found in the wrong lot, they're not afraid to tow."
College Freshman,2,"For freshmen there are currently four dorms. The majority of students live in Graham-Lees, a huge dorm that is very centrally located with a lot of singles. There are Gilliam and Davis, which are rather old, and then Gaines, which is being redone. Next year, the majority of students will live in Gaines, while Graham-Lees is being redone, and I believe, upon completion, students will live in Gaines and Graham-Lees, leaving Gilliam and Davis for other purposes (?). The dorms get cleaned daily (except weekends), but are pretty unclean. They're not maintained very well and the dorms are small, so it's hard to avoid messes, if they're there. As far as upper-classman housing, sophomores live in their sorority or fraternity houses, and juniors and seniors live off campus. Those who are independent, who don't get into their greek houses, or who choose to live on campus us juniors and seniors, live in Woods Creek apartments, which are rough and don't look like they're being redone too soon."
College Freshman,2,"It's impossible to get to school. There are a few taxi services, but holiday weekends they're usually pretty booked. Ride sharing is the way to go, unless you live far away, in which case a car (which is a surprisingly good option) or just flying are your best options. As for getting around the area, there aren't shuttles or anything, but for parties there's Traveler, a bus that goes around the city and county, from party to party, so to limit drunk-driving. Trav is excellent, but it's usually extremely crowded and infrequent."
College Freshman,2,The freshman lot is almost completely off campus. Horribly inconvenient. 
College Freshman,2,"really far parking for freshman, but it's useful to have a car"
College Freshman,2,"Lexington is a very isolated city. Finding transportation through other students is never difficult. However, finding means of transportation through the city or the university is pretty difficult."
College Junior,2,"Mooch off someone else's car if you can.  Parking isn't that expensive, but it's the furthest part on campus from any dorm rooms.  That said, the school is very small, but the freshman lot is on a huge hill.  Also, if you are a freshman, do NOT park anywhere BUT the Freshman lot for over an hour.  You will get ticketed, you will get towed, and that ain't fun.  I've done it myself."
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen have to park at the back of campus, probably a 10 minute walk from the dorms. Not too bad, but definitely a little inconvenient. But it's worth having a car on campus to go to Walmart, drive to the quirky Lexington ""hot spots"", or escape to Roanoke for shopping."
College Freshman,2,We are pretty homogeneous but it is rapidly changing
College Sophomore,2,"Lexington can feel a bit lacking in the ""fun things to do"" department, but there is at least a movie theater and a few good restaurants within walking distance of campus. The cheaper restaurants, however, are only in walking distance for those with an extra 20 minutes to kill, and the same goes for the grocery stores. Roanoke, 50 minutes away, has an awesome mall and essentially everything a college kid could ever need!"
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen have to walk 15 minutes to get to their cars which poses a problem for first-years. Upperclassmen have it better but not great. The parking deck is a decent distance from the main campus classrooms, but nothing too ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,"Not too big on sports – The sports here are a big part of campus only if you take part in them. Besides that, not many fans come to the games, even for football. It contrasts a big state school in this regard completely. No one is ever talking about the upcoming match and not many people show interest in varsity sports in general."
College Sophomore,2,"The Lexington Police force seem to have it out for students. Especially in the past year the not so affectionately named LexPo regularly patrol the greater Lexington area breaking up parties by midnight. They go through spurts charging students with MIP's and what have you. Campus security regularly comes through the fraternity and sorority houses. As long as you are not drinking in the hallways during an unregistered party you are good. Registering a party in the fraternity houses protects you very well, and obtaining a noise permit keeps the LexPo off your back for the most part."
College Freshman,2,"W&L also known as White and Loaded. Enough said. But if you're looking for diversity beyond the color of someone's skin, W&L is definitely home to many people from many different backgrounds and locations. It has a great student body!"
College Senior,2,The parking is not very good. can only really park in the parking deck.  Police in town write parking tickets all the time.  the walk from the parking deck to classes is under 5 minutes
Alum,1,"I spent four years in the closet at W&L after being out in high school. I was naive when I applied at 17, and didn’t understand that the school’s veneration of Robert E. Lee was code for maintaining generations of systemic racism. I’m embarrassed by the name of the university on my resume. Washington and Lee will always be a dog whistle for white privilege until it changes its name."
Alum,1,"I am an alumnus of Washington and Lee University.  I have fond memories of friends I made and teachers I had but it is time for the school to rectify its terrible decision to honor Robert E Lee by renaming the school after him.  Lee is most famous for leading a war whose purpose was to continue the brutalization of black men and women, and separating children from their parents so that black people could be forced to make money for white people.  When a student attends a school that honors Robert E Lee they receive the message that black lives do not matter.  How could they matter if a famous university has a place of honor for a man who did such horrible things to black people?  I hope that the school does the right thing and removes his name immediately."
College Freshman,1,W&L stands for White and Loaded.
College Freshman,1,"Freshmen eat in D-Hall and upperclassmen eat in D-Hall, at home, or at their Sororities and Fraternities. D-Hall food is rough. There are few options, it's repetitive, and it's rarely very fresh or healthy. To eat healthy, one must make a conscious effort to weed through what's been served, so the freshman fifteen are not an unlikely possibility. Having that said, Sorority and Fraternity dining is a big improvement. Chefs are hired at each house and cook monday through friday, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sororities' big meal is lunch and fraternities do dinner, but you eat at your house, with your brothers/sisters, and there's always something good for desert. Chefs are happy to accomodate eating restrictions or preferences."
College Freshman,1,"Lexington is definitely a part of appalachia. The town is lovely, but moving into the county, you can tell where you are. The school is in a nice hub that has little interaction with anything beyond the town, but living in Lexington after graduation would be a joke."
College Freshman,1,"Lexington, Virginia is far from a cultural hub. There are a few places in town that have okay food, but they are extremely pricey. There aren't any chains in walking distance, due to a town policy, so to get to a CVS or Kroger it's a 15 minute walk, or a drive. You have to know that while at W&L there will be no starbucks or chipotle (they're each a 40 minute drive, each way, from campus)."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to Do – Lexington is an extremely small town with nothing to do.  You may find it pleasantly quaint if your into that sort of thing.  Social life is centered around Greek organizations.

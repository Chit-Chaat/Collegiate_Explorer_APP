Alum,5,"Didn't take any classes online, only did some online assignments. Heard good things from my friends who did."
Alum,5,"Great student life, beautiful campus. If you take the time to reach out to office resources, they're very helpful."
Freshman,5,I believe my professors have done a great job adapting to remote learning. The majority of my lectures are pre-recorded which allows us to watch them on our own time. The quiz sections are live.
Graduate Student,5,My online learning experience has been great. It can definitely get overwhelming at times however the university of Washington has been great about assisting students with their needs.
Graduate Student,5,I am a first year student at the University of Washington and my experience began with online schooling. It has been a great experience so far and i am very excited about going to campus when it opens back up.
Junior,5,"Currently all my classes are online due to COVID-19. At first it was tricky but thanks to the Ischool  at the UW with their help it became easier to navigate. Overall, online learning with the University of Washington is great!"
Junior,5,"Currently all my classes are online due to COVID-19. At first it was tricky but thanks to the Ischool  at the UW with their help it became easier to navigate. Overall, online learning with the University of Washington is great!"
Junior,5,"The program that I am enrolled in to finish my Bachelor's degree is a strictly online only program designed for returning students and working professionals.  There is a good variety of classes to choose from, and the program is really tailored to help funnel you into a theme within the social sciences that means the most to you.  The program is easy to navigate and the perfect way to work online finishing my degree."
Junior,5,"I am enrolled in the specialty online Bachelor's program in Integrated Social Sciences.  The entire process, from application to admission was so easy and I felt like there was always someone there to help.  In the program I'm in, I have a personal academic advisor, they do intensive audits of your prior transcripts and help you put a plan in place for every class needed to graduate.  Despite being an online only program, I am eligible to graduate in the regular on campus ceremony and my degree is the same as someone who is studying on campus in a program.  I love the University, the professors are so approachable and knowledgable and everything feels like I just ""fit"" there."
Junior,5,"The campus is absolutely breathtaking, especially in the springtime, as soon as I viewed the campus I was able to see the University as the place for me. My first quarter I was able to make a lot of new friends with on-campus living. The professors are all very inviting people and they gladly answer any questions you have. The classes that UW has to offer are extremely diverse and interesting, some being more difficult than others. The campus also has the IMA which offers a variety of intramural activities."
Junior,5,"Online learning at UW is really easy and I don't have any worries about forgetting assignments since the professors are sure to email the students and remind them of assignments. There is also a good amount of interaction that happens through break-out rooms, so there's still a good social aspect to learning. Professor office hours are more organized since appointments are easy to schedule online. Canvas is also a great online platform that is easy to take tests on or turn in homework."
Alum,5,"I had a few online courses, and they were all organized well. A lot of professors were able to record and distribute their lectures in addition to holding live sessions for questions, which definitely helped."
Alum,5,"The UW was by far one of the best experiences in my life! Everything and then some is available to you, from world-class academic offerings to a thriving social scene. The school is large, so it's your responsibility to make the most of the experience. I strongly recommend getting involved in activities outside the classroom in your free time. Having entered into the private sector on the East Coast after undergrad, I will say that the UW's reputation is right up there with the ""Public Ivies"". The ROI is definitely there if you strive and push yourself academically. I love this school!"
Graduate Student,5,"Like many schools, UW is transitioning to online learning due to COVID-19. So far, I have been very impressed by their innovative efforts to work around the current crisis and enable continuous learning."
Graduate Student,5,"This school has a very beautiful campus and many different areas of study, so students can explore their interests and find the right fit for their major and eventual career."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at the University of Washington, yet I have not taken any classes. However, I just attended the orientation and got all my classes settled down. The experience with the university is very smooth, in my opinion. I have no trouble enrolling in higher-level courses using my running start credits. Now, I plan to enroll in one of the capacity constraint majors and hopefully get in. Overall, it is a lovely campus in which you should go check out."
Freshman,5,I don't have too much comment about online learning because it won't start until September 30th. But I believe it will be just as good as the on-campus lecture since my friend said the UW professors are doing a good job making the online transition better.
Sophomore,5,Lots of resources to utilize. Beautiful campus and also met some great professors. Wonderful college experience on the overall.
Freshman,5,"As of now, my online classes are fine because my profs post their lectures and slides on canvas. It really depends on the prof but overall I would say it's pretty good."
Freshman,5,The campus is awesome! You'll love this school if you like researches since this school is heavily research-based. Pretty supportive towards freshmen and lots of clubs and eventss.
Freshman,5,"Well done. Even though some of the professors struggled, all of them did the best that they could on such short notice."
Freshman,5,"Great experience. It was a very fun school to go to. Highlights were the academics, diversity and athletics."
Junior,5,our professors have been extremely understanding and flexible during these tough times. we are so grateful to have such great leaders in our vicinity!
Graduate Student,5,"UW is such a great school! I'm getting a first class education. I'm a graduate student, and compared to my undergrad studies at a different school, this is such a huge difference. UW is amazing!"
Graduate Student,5,"My professors really care about me, even thought we're online. My advisors check in with me often, and schedule meetings with me to make sure all of my needs are met."
Niche User,5,"The University of Washington is an amazing school! The atmosphere is wonderful and the academics are very strong here. In addition, it is so diverse and there are so many opportunities available to everyone, from research to volunteering to clubs."
Freshman,5,"The only online meeting I had so far was the freshman orientation. Everyone was friendly and had high hospitality. It might be awkward but there was always someone who led the conversation. Staff's attitude was genuine and patient with the questions we had. Everyone got to have a say and had individual advice from the staff. The meeting didn't have any technical problem, it went smoothly and comfortably."
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school.  The only downfall is how competitive the majors are, if you don't get direct admission life can be very stressful."
Junior,5,"So far the events I have participated in have been smooth. They have well-structured agendas to follow, and the zoom calls have always gone really well."
Junior,5,They are doing a great job getting all of us incoming transfers ready for school during COVID 19. It is a stressful time and they are handling it well.
Junior,5,"profs were very good with the transition to zoom U, they were very understanding and considerate. Definitely a better experience than what I've heard about other schools"
Junior,5,"I like all that there is to learn, the different classes and different people you meet. Its a big school so its easy to meet people."
Junior,5,Alot of accommodations for students and made the experience as best as possible in struggling times.
Graduate Student,5,"UW is a very diverse and enriching school. Breaking through the barriers and able to time manage, a student can succeed and make long life friends."
Niche User,5,I haven't started my studies yet but I am excited to begin and I definitely can share that the experience I had throughout the application process was seamless and without any stress.
Niche User,5,I have only been accepted to a program and will start in the fall but I am excited to attend a university that has a fantastic reputation for the program that I want to pursue and is local since I already live in Seattle.
Junior,5,"My overall experience is very positive, but with an asterisk due to the fact that I haven't really gotten the full experience due to the Coronavirus pandemic. But the University's response to the pandemic has been well-received, all things considered. The campus is beautiful, the people are nice, and the classes have lots of variety. The amount of clubs is bountiful. It is a very good institution."
Alum,5,"I took a few classes that were online or partially online, and overall it was a good experience. I think tech-savvy TAs really upped the game more than the subject-matter-experts could have done on their own, on this front."
Alum,5,Really great classes in the mathematics department. The professors who were passionate about the subject matter really drew in students and made a fantastic learning experience.
Freshman,5,I was very lucky that all of my professors did an amazing job with online learning and were all very understanding!
Freshman,5,My experience has been extremely good. The professors I have had are engaging and always have time to meet outside of class. The facilities are very clean and high class. The counselors there have really helped me understand what I should be doing and made the transition very smooth.
Freshman,5,"The University of Washington is an incredible school, one that pushes students both in and out of the classroom to become the type of people they desire to be. They provide the necessary support to make dreams into reality."
Freshman,5,My online experience couldn’t have been better. The University of Washington frequently communicated with students to aid with any confusion. My professors were well prepared to switch over to virtual learning in the spring quarter. The academic level of the University of Washington never slipped during our time online learning. It was a great experience. They always tried to keep the community together when togetherness is what everyone craved.
Sophomore,5,"This school has abundant resources for students! Most students and professors are nice and friendly. Even though school food may not be so good. But near the school, there is a lot of different food to choose from. The campus is beautiful. And the weather in Seattle is well done I think! I love this school even though it is very competitive!"
Sophomore,5,We do take online classes and the course content varies depending on the professors. I consider in most of the time the online experience is good.
Freshman,5,University of Washington has the most diversity school I attended. The academics is beyond expected entering in. The whole experience was beyond the expectations.
Alum,5,"Extremely strong in-state university, world class faculty, world class facilities. Medical students have the option to travel to as many WWAMI sites as they wish for more variety of clinical settings."
Senior,5,"I am unsure what the online experience will be, but I am looking forward to it. I believe since COVID-19 they have done a great job to have online resources available and any technical support for their student body."
Sophomore,5,"For my online learning experience, it was a lot easier than on-campus learning because most professors canceled midterms and finals. Some professors had trouble with the technologies but overall it was not bad."
Senior,5,I love how professors teach in their best way in online classes during this hard time with Covid-19 . I would say that most of the professors reply to students' questions pretty quickly with emails or Canvas.
Senior,5,I love the University of Washington very much because students are diverse and it is the best place to make friends from all over the world!
Sophomore,5,I did my entire spring quarter online and I thought was incredibly manageable. My professors took it a little easy on us and worked hard to make sure the content was well understood even through online platforms like Zoom.
Sophomore,5,Online classes here are straightforward and easy to navigate. All my online professors were also accessible in person!
Junior,5,"Some of my classes have been software classes and those have had smooth transitions to all online, but the other math and lecture based classes not so much. I don't think its the UWs fault though."
Junior,5,I love the university. It has been very impactful on my education and allowed me to create many lasting relationships. I love the Seattle area and wouldn't see myself any where else.
Senior,5,"In light of recent events, they've definitely got it together more so than a lot of other schools. It's not the same as being in person, but it's pretty reasonable."
Alum,5,I really enjoyed my college years. UW was a great place to study and grow as a student and young adult.
Niche User,5,What i liked about the university of Washington is the Seattle scene around it. the food is pretty good. nice campus and a overall good school.
Junior,5,"The school is very large so there are a lot of clubs to join and people to interact with. The UW is also arguably the best university in Washington State, especially for those who want to pursue a career in Business, Medicine, or anything STEM related."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy how inclusive it is. I also enjoy all the resources they have available for minorities.
Freshman,4,"I am still new to UW, however I have enjoyed my time so far. I only have experience with online classes. My professors have done a great job adapting. There are a great variety of clubs here."
Alum,4,"I had a good time at the University of Washington. The campus was pretty and the history of the place is fascinating. I liked the fact that the U-Pass they supply students with allows them to travel unlimited on pretty much any sort of public transportation short of an airplane. Campus was a little large, and getting to class sometimes was a hassle if the buildings they were held in were far apart. Accommodations from the professors and other faculty members made me feel at ease about staying on track with my graduation process, and student communities were also easy to come by. The most pressing reason as to why this is a four star review instead of a five is because I encountered an uncomfortable number of professors who had no problem weaving in or blatantly expressing their personal biases (particularly regarding politics and religion) throughout their lectures. Thus, I often felt as though my own beliefs were coming under fire. Aside from this, I enjoyed my time at UW very much."
Alum,4,"I haven't actually taken any online classes from this university while I was there. They do use online modes of homework completion and assignment completion. This is mainly done through Canvas, but specific fields like math or science have their own homework platforms (like Aleks)."
Alum,4,"The University of Washington, provides a large campus and with that a large variety of fields and communities to engage with. It's a very great choice for in-state students who live close to Seattle because they might be able to decrease their cost of tuition to about $16,000 while still receiving some of the state's most quality education. The focus of the university is research, but professors do take time to listen to student concerns and try to reform education so that students feel positive about their education. Lastly, diversity and inclusion can be hit or miss at this school. Their mission statements say they are committed, but sometimes specific programs don't understand what ""realized inclusion"" looks like in practice."
Freshman,4,My overall experience with the University of Washington is very good. They provide a well structure curriculum that will help their students get the best of of college. The staff are also respectful and understanding.
Freshman,4,"So far, my online experience is going good because everything is well organized. However, I would say that it is difficult understanding the materials because it is all online (such as chem labs). Despite that, the University of Washington made it easier to learn while having remote classes."
Junior,4,"This is my first quarter at UW Foster since I’m a transfer student from Bellevue College, but I was lucky and got admitted into Foster school of business. Although everything is remote now due to circumstances of COVID-19, professors seem to be really enthusiastic and accessible. They’ve modified the course so that you are able to gain as much knowledge as you would in an in person class."
Junior,4,"We meet weekly sometimes even two times per week in zoom meetings and we have pre-made lectures and power-points to study from before and after the meetings. Grades are divided between participation, quizzes, discussion boards, team projects, and the final."
Sophomore,4,My professors for Spring 2020 took online learning very seriously in terms of ensuring their students could still succeed despite no in-person interactions. They structured their lectures with designated readings and quizzes for both lecture material and supplemental videos/textbooks. There were lots of practice tests and organized activities over Zoom to ensure everyone had the opportunity to get the help they needed.
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE the UW. The campus is so beautiful and it never fails to amaze me how much the place feels like home. I commute from the Eastside but traveling to school became something that I never dreaded doing as I loved to see my friends and spend time on campus. There are so many opportunities for you to connect on campus with other freshmen or students that share commonalities, so it is very easy to become a place where you feel comfortable."
Sophomore,4,The professors tried very hard and worked to make the grading system more fair throughout the quarter.
Junior,4,"Professors and school are trying to provide the best environment to encourage students by improving zoom video qualities, online library access, and writing center tutoring. Several online sources, such as free textbooks and writing resources, help students to benefit from school."
Junior,4,"The University of Washington has the most beautiful and exciting environment to study. Professors and students are actively engaged in class together. However, tuition is very expensive for non-resident and international students."
Sophomore,4,I liked being able to connect easily with other students that had similar interests and the opportunities to learn outside my comfort zone.
Sophomore,4,"Honestly speaking, it's hard to say what's a good standard for online learning right now. I personally had a good experience with it in terms of being able to manage my own time. One thing that was difficult was getting to know new professors and classmates through online platforms."
Freshman,4,Their fast response to emails and communication as well as their helpfulness to welcome the freshmen class during these hard times has been wonderful
Freshman,4,The professors did a wonderful job working with and using the online classroom to their benefit and really engaging with students similar to if we were in a classroom setting.
Junior,4,"the courses offered are very interesting and we have a lot of majors. however, it is very competitive and hard to find space within the majors. there is also an extreme lack of diversity."
Freshman,4,"At the University of Washington, there are many things that a person can explore. There are so many opportunities for low class propels and they offer so much help. It is a diverse school and there are friendly faces everywhere."
Freshman,4,"I have taken all of my classes online because of the pandemic. The professors accommodate with what you need for your classes and it is a comfortable learning environment. The professors accepts everyones opinion and tells the students- me on what is expected in the class. The online process is not easy overall, but at the University of Washington it is smoother."
Junior,4,"Overall, the University of Washington is a pretty good school!  Definitely wouldn't go here if you didn't get direct admit into your major, though.  I was lucky to get direct admit into the college of engineering, but still had to compete to get into the mechanical engineering department.  The dorms are really nice at the University of Washington, but they are pretty pricey.  I think the best part about the University of Washington is that they have awesome clubs on campus."
Junior,4,"I took all online classes this past Spring quarter.  In general, they weren't too bad.  They all definitely got easier."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman at UW. Although I haven't had many experience with the school just yet, the staff and peers seemed friendly to me when orientation was held. The campus, of course, is undoubtably beautiful and historical. Taking a walk on the campus really relaxes stress and tiredness. Popular majors at UW are competitive, you will need to try your very best to get admission to your intended major. The atmosphere of each area varies, no matter who you are, you will find a place you like. For example, the North Campus feels suburban, quiet and peaceful, whereas the West Campus feels urban and bustling."
Senior,4,I have been very happy attending UW. They have a top notch nursing program and the staff have been supportive and helpful. Their financial aid department works very hard to ensure you have access to all available resources. They have communicated well around COVID-19 and the challenges it has posed for attending school.
Senior,4,I will be taking my first online class in the fall. So far the university has been very good about communicating how that will operate and made it easy to acquire a laptop and other technology needed to attend online class.
Sophomore,4,The students are hardworking and form a supportive community. There are many resources and opportunities to explore new things and get devoted in your area of interest.
Junior,4,"UW is great, lots of resources and good research opportunities for undergrads, my only complaint is the grad students teaching the classes..."
Graduate Student,4,"The use of online school is new, so not much to talk about at the moment. the professors however are very accommodating about online classes right now."
Junior,4,"I love this school, but out of state tuition for online classes for two quarters now (last spring when COVID-19 started and next fall) is ridiculous. I wish they offered more financial support."
Junior,4,"I'm zoom fatigued. Some professors were more understanding than others, so the level of difficulty in adjusting differed greatly amongst classes. Also, it's a lot harder to pay attention and to engage in classes. Personally, it's pretty unmotivating to have online classes, especially when the expectation is the same if not more than regular in-person classes. Everyone's at-home situation is different, and I wish classes were a bit more accommodating for these situations that are out of the student's direct control."
Junior,4,"The University of Washington is a great school, with a large variety of academic subjects and extracurriculars. The large size and competitive atmosphere of the school can make it difficult to succeed at first, but once within a major, you have access to caring professors and peers."
Junior,4,The classes I took online spring quarter of 2020 were accommodating for the most part. Professors and Teaching Assistants went out of their way to make adjustments for students if conflicts surfaced.
Junior,4,"I took online courses for spring quarter at University of Washington due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. I'd say that it went fairly smoothly. One of the courses was essentially a studio class, but the implementation of online learning and having us work on projects at home went smoothly. I did have class with some hiccups in the experience (communication issues, connection issues, clarity of material), but overall, the experience was positive."
Senior,4,"Excellent campus with a wide variety of programs, clubs, and opportunities available to even the least enterprising student. Electrical Engineering and STEM programs in general are good. The 10-week quarter, though good for variety, does not encourage a healthy lifestyle, however, as the moment the quarter begins, so does cramming for tests and projects. Food could also use some work. Also costs a hella lot."
Freshman,4,"I love UW! It is a school with many opportunities and resources, this is one of the main reasons I had such a good experience. If you ask for help and take advantage of whats provided to you, you can accomplish and learn a lot!
However, I did not rate it as excellent because I feel there needs to more of an active effort of communication in regards to student Housing and Dining concerning financials."
Freshman,4,I took my whole spring quarter online due to covid and it went better than I thought. I feel I still learned a lot and my professors were very flexible due to the difficult quarter. They always had time to meet after class and they they had well structured online lectures. I had a design class and I was anxious since it seemed like online might not work but it was one of my favorite classes. They sent prototypes to our homes for us to design and they gave a lot of lessons on 3D  modeling that we could do on our computers. I think the University of Washington did a great job with being so adaptable.
Alum,4,"Not focused for online use, at least at the medical school. All lectures are generally recorded, but (at least prior to COVID-19) the expectation was for all classes to be taught primarily in person."
Senior,4,"I have appreciate the University of Washington’s ability to provide lots of online resources and information. However, I have found that as a new student it’s been difficult for them to communicate via email due to COVID-19 crisis, which I believe most universities are learning how to make the communication process more efficient between nursing students and the faculty."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus of University of Washington. It has a diversity of student groups. It is very academic which means it is really hard to get into a popular major.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a rising sophomore at UW and my favorite part about the school is definitely how beautiful the campus is. There is so much to see and do around campus and nearby, it truly makes it worthwhile to be there. Adjusting to the school took me a while, but I think the same goes for anyone dealing with the transition from high school to college and I was definitely provided with a lot of resources that helped me through it."
Sophomore,4,It's a very difficult but rewarding university. I've met some really incredible people here but at times it can feel overwhelming and challenging.
Senior,4,"The online classes are in generally good, deepens a lot of the teacher and the particular topic. Many classes inside of the programs are more easy to deal with, because the teacher already knew the students but for the general classes the amount of students can generate some issues."
Senior,4,"The UW is a very good option as a college with a big campus, a diverse student population, quality education with passionate teachers."
Freshman,4,"The COVID-19 online experience was overall pretty good. My professors managed to adapt the classes fairly well online. At some points, I felt like I was not learning much and it was not worth it but considering they only had 2 weeks to figure everything out it was overall a good experience."
Freshman,4,I love the intellectual challenges I experience in class every day. I feel like way more worthwhile stuff in this past year than I did all 4 years of high school. The only thing I don't like is that the school is so big it feels like there is no sense of community.
Sophomore,4,"The school is very good academically, very competitive for all majors. The workload can be a bit overwhelming because of being in the quarter system and having to cram a semesters worth of material into 10 weeks."
Alum,4,"Amazing professors and a beautiful campus! I think the Seattle campus is a bit too big for my liking and can be very busy and lots of traffic happens there, so I would personally pick the Bothell or Tacoma campus!"
Alum,4,"Online learning is hard in general, but the professors managed to do an amazing job. Online learning is super challenging and specially during the time of the pandemic, it did take a really long time for me to get used to it, but overall, I liked it."
Senior,4,"This is a great school if you are resilient and self-motivated. It is competitive and the administration definitely won't hold your hand through everything. The professors are pretty good overall, at least in STEM courses. It's a beautiful, lively campus with lots of clubs and activities. It's in Seattle, so the public transportation is really great and there's lots to do. If you're more outdoorsy, there are clubs you can join that will take you hikes, skiing, etc.. It's a big school, so you have to put in the work to make your community smaller and feel more at home. The dorms are great but a bit pricey for the most part. The majors can be very competitive, so there's a chance you won't get into your first choice, especially if you want to major in computer science or business. We have a great gym called the IMA that has tons of resources and clubs. There are bunch of work and research opportunities. It's a great school with lots to offer and lots to do, but has a competitive side."
Freshman,4,"I love their active and positive campus atmosphere. There is never a quiet or dull moment on campus and their friendly activities that goes on while passing through campus. Honestly, the people and staff their are very friendly. They are always giving opportunities to be a part of the community and have abundance of resources for us students to use or connect with. I wouldn't want anything about those to change at all. The University of Washington is a campus I like to be on. The one thing I would want to change is the dining types. The food is somewhat okay on the first two weeks of school or just being on campus. However, they need change the food in one place or add more places for variety of food. That would be the most likely thing to change."
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity and culture on campus. There are so many opportunities here and lots of resources there to help. The school is just very big and it's hard to figure out where to start and how to reach for help at first, but it's a means of getting used to."
Freshman,4,"Definitely getting the best education at this school! Love the atmosphere and the many opportunities this school has for internships, research, labs, etc!"
Junior,4,"The view at the University of Washington.  There are a vast amount of opportunities for everyone to get involved, including clubs and research.  The downside is that the major is very competitive."
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Washington is a great institution for learning. I received my undergrad from the university, I've been working at the university since, and now I'm going to attend a graduate program. The campus is beautiful, the school is forward thinking, and the instructors are invested in their student's success."
Sophomore,4,The University of Washington is a great school overall. The worst part is the continuously rising cost of attendance and lack of opportunity to speak out against that. The professors are usually amazing with great credentials.
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman so I don't have that much to say yet. I need to get into a major first. When you apply here, make sure to select a major on the application so that you may be directly admitted into the major you want to pursue."
Alum,4,Attending the University of Washington allowed me to not only further my education but also allowed me to build strong connections that would last a lifetime. Whether it was through various classes or the vast selection of clubs available to students.
Junior,4,"Faculty and staff seem to be understanding and caring during difficult times, and are often willing to work with students to fix problems.  Seattle is a scary place, but the UW tries to let students know when there's a particular danger on or near campus, and there's security people who will walk with you if you're concerned about safety.  I don't really party, and I don't know about the college sports, but I've heard people say good and bad things about those things at this school, and the campus is very large so it's difficult to get to all the places you might need to."
Junior,4,"University of Washington has nation wide top programs such as nursing, computer science, or and other stem related majors. University of Washington offers good education for variety of interests such as business and art, and has newly increasing demand majors such as HCDE or Informatics. The only difficult part is getting into major. If you didn't get in with direct admission, it can get really competitive. The community is really great. Joining a club of your interest can help you make connection for your future career as well as making the college life memorable.  The jew dorms are recently built so they are really clean and nice but the food isn't so great. The campus is beautiful with the cherry blossoms in the spring time and being close to the downtown seattle and water makes the  campus look beautiful."
Senior,4,"The University of Washington provides a quality education and is a great value for in-state students. It can be easy to feel like a small fish in a big pond, but it forces you to be proactive in finding help in school as well as socially."
Senior,2,"No professor was fully prepared for the quarantine/zoom courses, despite the fact that other countries had the virus and were handling it far better — it took too long for a change to happen and you’d expect with all these intellectuals with Masters and Docters to learn from China and think ahead, they didn’t. Lots of students struggled with meeting deadlines, zoom meetings were basically optional (for my major/classes) and not many students are comfortable with talking via online which made discussions and learning useless. At the end of the day, it felt like any other online class with teachers, not so much professors and it feeling and being presented as a course from UW."
Sophomore,2,"I am a sophomore studying biochemistry, and transferring to a smaller school next year. If you want to study STEM and have a life outside of academics, don't go here. I wanted the in-state tuition, but knew all along that you get what you pay for. Classes are huge in the STEM field, professors are more focused on their research than teaching most of the time, and academic resources are limited. You can attend office hours, but there are always tons of other students that take up the professor's time. Socially, if you can find a group to identify with right away, you might feel fulfilled, however I joined a sorority and quickly realized Greek life is isolated from the rest of the school and a toxic, entitled bubble. The one redeeming quality about UW is the diversity and inclusion efforts made by the school and research opportunities nearby. Bottom line: if you want small classes, academic support, and a sense of community on campus (not just in a group you join) - DO NOT attend UW."
Sophomore,2,"It is a beautiful campus, and they have an incredible range of studies, but the classes are obscenely difficult. It is not in the best interest for any student to be pushed in the way that UW tends to do; college is meant to be difficult but these classes are no help. Professors often do not care about student success and the University itself lacks the proper resources students should have in order to succeed."
Junior,2,"This school is far more competitive than its admission rate would suggest, because of over-admission and the capacity-constrained major system. Essentially, there is only space for half, or less, of the students intending many popular majors like CS or Business – the school's overall admission rate should be something like 20%, not 45%. 

Instead, the result is a hyper-competitive culture in which many students are more concerned with outperforming one another to beat the grade curve than building up one another. Also, there are so many students that the quality of education, advising, and other resources suffers. The best reason to attend UW is for in-state tuition at a school with a solid reputation, which it has, or because you were directly admitted into a major of your choice. Otherwise, choose a school with a lower student-faculty ratio and more undergraduate focus."
Junior,2,Getting into desired majors is extremely difficult. Social life of students on campus is non existent. Low credit class assign unrealistic amounts of work.
Sophomore,2,"If you are not a resident of Washington state, do not bother coming to University of Washington. The only good thing here is the price of tuition for in-state students. My review is based solely on someone who is pursuing a STEM major, I don't know anything about the other majors at UW. UW is so competitive that people are often unable to get into their desired major, meaning you have to re-choose your major, meaning more classes, and more money spent on school.  University of Washington doesn't teach students well, it just attracts very smart people who make the school look good. As for non-academic related things, the Athletics is popular with a very good football team and nice stadium. If you want to party, you have to join the Greek System."
Freshman,2,"While this university is top-tier in many fields and providing of almost any opportunity you can dream of, it is extraordinarily competitive as a result of capicity constrained majors. If you want to study STEM, the odds are your major has a 50% (or, more likely, less) acceptance rate, with an average GPA of admitted applicants of 3.5+. While this is certainly doable, it severely limits one's options,  creates a pervasive atmosphere of stress, and vitally limits the students ability to fail, or in my experience, grow as a person."
Niche User,2,"I came out for the freshman session, campus and housing tours. First of all I don't mind rain but it was a pelting, sideways, soak everything on you, kind of rain. Surprisingly, drainage was lacking so the walkways were puddled, and forget trying to walk on the mushy grass. I can't imagine having wet shoes all day. Since everyone was scurrying it was hard to get a sense of the students or community feel. The dorm was freezing and smelled musty, it made me sad just to be a there for a few minutes. The honors program here is excellent but I'm not sure I would survive the climate."
College Junior,2,"Being a non-Greek student but having friends in the Greek system, I have seen it from both sides. In general, Greek students do not like non-Greek students and there is a clear divide between the two. Most of the fraternities and sororities are very exclusive and are generally not very diverse. To party with the Greeks, you either have to be Greek or know someone who is influential enough to get you into the party. I have steered clear of these parties regardless as they are known to be out of control and trashy. However, I do know that UW has one of the biggest Greek communities on the West Coast, and all of the Greek housing seems to be very nice. I am happy that I did not decide to go Greek, but if someone is looking into it, they will probably not be disappointed."
Recent Alumnus,2,Some are extremely arrogant and don't offer much help. Class sizes are way too big and courses taught by TA's are a horrible idea.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I find it overly misogynist, and a overall negative impact on a college campus. The amount of liquor and unprotected sex that happens should not only not be allowed in an academic setting but is a terrible way to set human beings up for their future. I know students who stay up partying until 4 and go to class drunk at 8"
College Junior,2,"I don't think Greek life really seems to impact the professional degrees. If it does, I don't know anything about it. The only times I hear about Greek life is when something bad happens and they are in the paper. If they would do good things and end up in the paper then I would probably think they were better."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics at UW are very important to the university, to many students, and to alumni. They are a crucial part of the culture at this school. Unfortunately, the school puts a disproportionate amount of funding into sports and athletes in general. Standards of acceptance at UW are much lower for athletes (from an academic perspective), and they are offered many more resources than ""normal"" students."
College Freshman,2,"UW is a very competitive school, which means that in addition to being competitive overall as a university, students are extremely competitive amongst each other. This is not the college to attend if you want to have a huge group of tightly bonded friends. While most people you approach are somewhat kind, or at least polite, they do not have time to be your friend. Everyone here is focused on their own success. Keeping up with a full course load takes a lot of time, especially if you are enrolled in any STEM classes. The science classes at the UW are structured to weed out as many people as possible in the introductory course. This is not ideal for most students, unless you did extremely well in AP classes for EVERY subject in high school. The grading system is rough, though not unfair; for BIO180, the introductory biology course, the average score is a 2.6-2.8 on a 4.0 scale, for the students who earned a 4 or 5 on the AP Biology test in high school. Scores for those who did not take AP Biology are even lower."
College Sophomore,2,"On Friday nights when I'm coming home from hanging out with friends, I can usually see at least one or two groups of guys or girls on their way back from a Frat party, and are hubbled over on the side of the pathway trying to keep the alcohol down."
College Freshman,2,There is too much focus on the Greek community here at UW and it gets old.
College Senior,2,"The ease of the housing process was good. The worst part about living in campus housing was that you felt like you really weren't getting your money's worth. The dining halls within the residence halls were generally terrible, the amount of money you are forced to have in your dining account was definitely not worth it. The best thing about living on campus was the close proximity to classes."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally I have a lot of problems with Greek life and the class and gender disparities which it perpetuates. Furthermore, I don't really see any of the ""community service"" element happening. Most greeks just come off as cliquey, moneyed, and aloof. I also live right next to the frats and sororities and they leave garbage everywhere all the time."
College Freshman,2,North campus housing is too old and the heaters weren't even fully functioning. The lack of coziness made the transition of a freshman leaving home pretty difficult.
College Freshman,2,"I don't have many friends, and since it's a large school, it's hard to bond with classmates. The major I want to get into is too competitive, and for how much it costs, I don't think education from this school is worth it. I wish I had taken another offer to a cheaper university where I would have been admitted into my major as a freshman."
College Sophomore,2,"They are known not to give that much aid. If your in state is super cheap. Out of state people have to pay 48,000 dollars a year."
College Junior,2,"Sexual assaults exists but the issue has been brought to attention more lately. The police departments in the area are very supportive regarding safety measures and always holds the student's safety first before law procedures. I feel somewhat safe on campus, however the break-ins around off-campus housings is uncanny."
College Sophomore,2,"I was not offered any financial aid other than loans, which is unacceptable in my opinion"
College Freshman,2,For the price we are paying it is not up too par. At the quality they give us the food should be all you can eat like other schools.
College Sophomore,2,Honestly I have never been to a good party here.
College Freshman,2,"The AVE has little to no student discounts. You can't expect students to use their dining plan 24/7, because food would get repetitive. Also, those who are commuting, off-campus, or Greek system should be allowed discounts and convenience as well."
College Freshman,2,"Financial statements are difficult to read and I was not told that I was given my $3000 scholarship with my left over financial aid, therefore, it was not effectively used."
College Freshman,2,"I have applied for many scholarships and financial aid, but received nothing, even though it costs more for me to go here than what my father even makes..."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing has been one of my largest headaches since transferring to UW. In my experience many landlords are deceptive and try to take advantage of young college students by charging insane amounts for unsafe housing. The closer to campus, the more this is true. Apartment living in the University District is unattainable for most due to the inflated cost of living in Seattle as a whole. An average 1br/1ba costs around $1400 per month. Parking is also difficult in residential areas and near apartments near campus. Most students are forced to live farther away from campus, or to live with upwards of 5 roommates. Affordable housing options near campus are usually terrible quality units. As a whole, housing is hard to come by as well because there is such a high demand in the area."
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, dining on campus (not including University Way and University Village,) is incredibly expensive. Also, healthy options are hard to come by."
College Freshman,2,"Nothing really seems to get done. The Greeks participate in underage drinking far more than regularly and drugs are openly dealt on the outskirts of the campus. Other crimes are kept under close watch and discipline, but that is only restricted to campus proper."
College Sophomore,2,"Crime does not really occur on campus, but it is pretty common just outside of campus on the Ave or greek row. People are mugged and frat houses are robbed quite often."
College Freshman,2,"It's bad and it's getting worse. UW needs money and they've been continuous raising the tuition for out of state and international students. It sucks because you go in, having calculated everything and then halfway throughout your college career you realize you might not have enough. On top of that, the competition to get scholarships is tough."
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in one of the older dorms last year, and maybe I just had a bad dorm experience, but I did not start to like it until halfway through the schoolyear.  I missed my home, so I just ended up going back every weekend."
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of options to eat off campus.
College Senior,2,"The cost of living in U-district is absolutely ridiculous. The cheapest rent I have ever paid is $700/month for living in a big house with 10 other people, which wasn't even that great of a place. Rent keeps increasing and now students pay almost 1600-1800/month for a studio."
College Freshman,2,Everything at the markets is great and you can use dining money for that but I have yet to find anything that actually tastes good in the dining halls.
College Junior,2,Campus housing is restricted and follows some strict laws.
College Junior,2,"I hope it was easier! However, it is competitive and takes lot of hard work and time/money investment."
College Junior,2,"Overall, the campus housing system is a safe-place, whereas students find it difficult to live in an environment where you have to be a little more safe."
College Sophomore,2,We hear about break ins to sorority houses and frat houses every so often. And at night things get dangerous if you're alone
College Sophomore,2,I get no financial aid because the government thinks I'm too rich. The school also thinks I'm too rich.
College Junior,2,The financial aid department is rude and not helpful at this school. Responses take more than 2 weeks.
College Senior,2,"The nightlife around this school is not that great, usually we just cab to capital hill."
College Student,2,Financial aid in this country just generally sucks. Middle class students get absolutely nothing because they think your parents are rich enough to pay for it. My dad works A LOT of overtime just so I can make my tuition payments. I haven't had any luck with scholarships at all because of the qualifications.
College Senior,2,Save your time and go buy housing in apartments. Campus housing is only good your first year to meet people after that gets boring and annoying
College Senior,2,Every week things go down
College Junior,2,"Due to the high volume of student that receive financial aid, getting help of being able to talk to an advisor can be extremely difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"As a non-resident, it is almost impossible to find any scholarships that I am eligible for!"
College Sophomore,2,"Seattle is always raining and often times very cold due to the wind, which makes it difficult to be outside most of the year. However in the spring and summer it is extremely beautiful."
College Freshman,2,"UW is super competitive.  I started out thinking I was going to do engineering, but the competition was so stiff I had to re-think my major.  The intro calc and chem classes are DEFINITELY weed out courses.  I'm now a pre-business major and am doing much better in my classes, mostly because the classes are better suited to my skill set, but I sometimes think that if I were at any other school I'd be an engineering major right now."
College Freshman,2,This rating applies specifically to registration. There are so many students that you frequently cannot immediately (or ever) get into the classes you need. It is discouraging and frustrating.
College Student,2,A lot of worrying and essay writing. Talk to your advisors and professors.
College Freshman,2,I chose to live in one of the older dorms on campus because I could not afford the new dorms on the west side of campus. The old dorms are fairly dirty and old. There was a bed bug infection at a few points during the year and the water on my floor from the water fountain is a murky white color. Most people who I have talked to in my dorm agree that there is a bias about caring for the students housed in the newer dorms rather than the older ones.
College Senior,2,Rain is the biggest downer of this area. The only pleasant months are May-September on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I got ZERO aid from this school. I am a minority, first college-goer student with great grades and I got nothing. Wasn't even offered a school loan."
College Freshman,2,My scholarships were used all up in one quarter
College Freshman,2,Hard to get financial aid but it is always worth a try!
College Junior,2,Not a lot of scholarship opportunities for tons of students.
College Junior,2,"I live off campus, and the dorms were renovated after I moved out. My old dorm was terrible. The new ones seem nice."
Freshman,1,"Online experience was difficult, not because of the school but the experience. The whole learning environment was not how I imagine learning."
Junior,1,"UW canceled Black History Month events to prioritize hateful rallies in 2018. Transfer rate for people of color is higher than people think.  Also, the undergrad grading system at UW needs to be changed. Professors tell their students that the average GPA for a class is 2.6 and doesn’t do anything to bring it up. They should be trying to push the curve so more students get an A. Otherwise, students won’t feel supported. My professor sent out a message saying  the average grade for the mid-term exam should be ~65%. Who makes an exam in hopes of an average of 65%? They should make sure students are understanding the material they are being taught! I don’t feel supported what so ever here. If you have questions, professors will just direct you to their TA. Good luck trying to get a strong letter of recommendation. Very disappointed with the education I’m receiving here."
Sophomore,1,"It's such a big school. It's truly a numbers game. Because of the sheer number of students, the desirable majors are competitive and extremely difficult to get into, leading to many to either transfer out to a different college, or settle for a random major that really has nothing to do with their desired career goals."
Alum,1,"The Germanics department, though there were a few stellar classes in film, was overall mob culture. Additionally, faculty were often on leave and those that remained didn't even return papers. I watched a fellow student be mobbed by an advisor who excluded her and denigrated her behind her back for the years I was there. The whole experience was a waste of time."
Sophomore,1,UW either needs to open another campus or lower their acceptance rate. It is absolutely unacceptable for required courses to fill up and close so quickly. As a freshman you will struggle to find a way to get your credits in subjects you're interested in. Prepare for 600 students in lectures.
Sophomore,1,"If you were not directly admitted to your major as an engineering student, do nt come here, you will not get in."
Sophomore,1,"Unless you are directly admitted to a STEM major, you will not get in. They over admit to steal money from people coming in with hopes of getting into their major and completing a degree, when in reality the majority will not. This university is corrupt and a scam, stay away."
College Freshman,1,"There is a really bad reputation for greek row here. There were a lot of problems with guys taking advantage of girls (rape and such). Housing on the other hand is great and not all of them are bad, some are very academic and never throw parties"
College Sophomore,1,Student housing is overly costly and is unresponsive to student needs. It is cheaper to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is a poor use of student time and students involved in Greek life are only known mostly for being superficial party animals.
College Freshman,1,"Oh god, don't go to UW if you're looking for a party school."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive much financial aid. Still can't afford to pay everything myself for four years.
College Sophomore,1,"After a year at UW and inquiring with advising and financial aid, I am still unaware of campus scholarships that I qualify for. Very few scholarships exist outside of major academic departments, ie: business, engineering. I am still trying though."
College Junior,1,I did not get anything and office was unhelpful.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid department is the worst. I have spent weeks dealing with them and they are never very helpful and there is always a line and they take forever to reply and I could go one....
College Freshman,1,The computer science major is so good at this school that you spend your time stressing out constantly about missing one point on any assignment and worrying about not getting in and having your life ruined.
College Senior,1,"I am not eligible for financial aid, because my parents make too much. This is something I think needs to be re-evaluated. Some students are paying for school themselves, and this is not taken into consideration. I am paying for school completely on my own without any help, therefore I am working two jobs and still struggling. Because of the way the financial aid is structured I am not eligible based off my parents income, instead of my own."
College Freshman,1,"Fun-sucking RAs, expensive housing, and after over two quarters I don't even know everyone on my floor. The cluster system sucks."
College Freshman,1,"I personally have a Resident Advisor that is very intrusive on students' activities. I have been chastised for laughing ""too loudly"" in a private room outside quiet hours."
College Senior,1,"I live 50 minutes away from campus and no one in my program lives near me. Public transit would take hours each day, each way. The only convenient option for me is to drive myself."
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are ridiculously expensive, and only two to four hour parking is available in non permit lots."
College Junior,1,"It rains a ton, and is usually pretty windy. the spring is very nice though."
College Junior,1,My dorm terry had very bad food. I never ate there. I usually went to subway.
College Junior,1,"Pre med is super competitive, and the curve seems pretty unfair."
College Freshman,1,"I applied for financial aid, but did not receive any reprieve."
College Freshman,1,UW gives very little financial aid for in state.
College Sophomore,1,"If you want to park at the dorms, it's really only on the weekends and coming/leaving for a holiday that you will have a hard time. "
College Junior,1,"The Greek community is a very segregated community from the rest of the university. Many of those students don't have friends outside of their sorority or fraternity. Many of these students also seem to have a status attached to their position within their house, it seems like they feel that they have a much more active social life and have better, long lasting friends than those students who choose not to participate in Greek life. For the rest of the students who aren't in a sorority or fraternity, many of the members come off as snobby party animals"
College Sophomore,1,"UW tries its best to make its students feel safe but it just can't be helped that it's in a metropolitan area and right next to downtown Seattle. We have NightRide shuttles and NightWalk security escorts for those needing to get around campus at night which is really useful. It's scary getting criminal notification emails from the UW police frequently though (mainly phone theft). Some occur right next to the dorms or the Ave or other areas surrounding campus. My phone was stolen on the bus a couple stops away from campus. There is also a strong presence of the homeless people on the Ave. Most notably there is the ""Spare Change Dude"" that practically verbally harasses people asking for spare change as they walk out of Bartell's. I definitely do not feel safe walking off campus unless I'm with a large group of people in broad daylight. As for on campus I feel much safer but you still have to be cautious at night."
College Sophomore,1,The only time I feel safe on campus is during daylight when its bright out. If it is dark I do not go out onto campus alone. There are lights but they are not bright enough.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The cost for short term parking is fine, but it accumulates for long term. However, the fines for illegal parking are far more than the cost of the parking permits. Cars are not allowed in most parts of the campus. The routes for cars are mostly surrounding the central campus. It is difficult to find a parking space, and even having a permit does not guarantee a space. In the case of some special events, such as football games, the space might be reserved for guests, not permit holders."
College Junior,1,"The UW is not messing around when it comes to billing. Expect to file a lot of paperwork and be charged as soon as possible for every little thing. It's difficult to make an appointment with the financial aid office, and when you go speak to them, they refer you back to the website."
College Sophomore,1,The cost for a permit is outrageous. There is some free parking but it is hit or miss on whether or not you will find a spot. Most people use the parking garage that is about a mile away and ride the train to campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Everything is overpriced, the area near campus is dangerous and filled with homeless people. Someone was stabbed to death right next to my boyfriend's apartment last week. Scary s***. Don't expect most of the landlords to call you back if you're applying."
College Freshman,1,"There are a lot of parking spaces available, but it cost's too much money a year. It costs about $15 to park each day, that could amount to a lot of money for the entire year or quarter. It's recommended to take community transit. But there is some free parking around campus on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,Becoming a CSE major is very difficult and competitive. There are many prerequisites that prospective students must take and the courses are very challenging.
College Sophomore,1,"Its always gloomy, raining and cold. Not something I'm used too although people here love it."
College Freshman,1,Parking here is terrible and expensive! Parking tickets are frequently given out even if your time has only been up for 5 minutes. I would recommend not bringing your car if you plan to stay on campus.
College Freshman,1,It cost way too much to park here. Also the parking off campus is free but they fill up really fast so its hard to get a spot close to campus.
College Freshman,1,"I was able to get a lot of ""financial aid,"" and at first was stoked when I saw the amount I had received. Then I realized that the only type of aid I was offered was loans. Talking around with friends, it seems as if the financial aid given is just random."
College Junior,1,"So fines around the area are very expensive, around 55 dollars depending on the ticket. Parking in the the parking garage costs 15 a day? Parking on the street is 4 dollars an hour with limit of 2 hours, but the streets are always fullllll. The permit is probably the most ridiculous at about 400 dollars a quarter. There wouldnt be too big of a need for a car because we are mandatory to pay for a upass which gives us bus privileges. Seattle area with a car costs a lot"
Recent Alumnus,1,"closer to the campus, it's true that it's more expensive. However, commuting 1 hour from your house to campus would waste your energy to study. I really recommend people to commute very close to the campus."
College Junior,1,Parking is very expensive and nearly impossible to find.
College Freshman,1,need more security on campus and more regulations for underage drinking. The greek system is ALL about drinking and should focus more on other aspects of social lives.
College Sophomore,1,There is little variety and it is basically cafeteria food.  Meat is very expensive and hard to get.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is an absolute nightmare- it is expensive on-campus, and if you brave parking off-campus you will have a horrible time finding a spot, and risk the Parking Enforcement cops, whose goal in life is to ticket you for minor parking violations of any kind....."
College Senior,1,"Money and Money – The school is large, and the administration is poor. This leads to the mix of many bad people with a few good ones. However, the bad downgrade the benefits contributed by the good. The learning experience in class sometimes suffers from this. Moreover, regardless of the real purposes, many of the school's policies seem to earn money instead of serving students and faculty and staff."
College Senior,1,"No Strict to Catch but Strict to Punish – The school seldom enforces their policies strictly, so it is not easy for an offender to be caught. However, when caught, the punishment is severe. 

Note that even if one does not offend anything, when the school doubts him or her, the chance of receiving an undeserved ""punishment"" is almost 100%."
College Freshman,1,Huge cost. Not a whole lot of spaces. Pretty far from most classes. Not worth your time and money
College Junior,1,"It is an insult that people have to pay parking in order to go to school. If you are a visitor it is understandable, but being a student and having to pay for parking is CRAZY. The parking lots are very far away from where you wanna go. The rates are INSANE. To find a place to park is almost a nightmare."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible Ras – the RAs in the dorm are terrible. there are some good ones but in general, they have a stuck up attitude and are way too strict on their policies."
College Freshman,1,"Not Enough – University of Washinton does not give you the automatic grade based scholarships that many colleges do. Also the scholarships that they do have, have many people applieing for them so are diffucult to recieve."
College Sophomore,1,"Tickets Are Given Out Like Candy! Buy a parking pass or expect to be paying tons of parking tickets.  They WILL catch you, even if it's just for a little while.  Park on Greek Row for free, but that's a real pain in the rear. Parking at UW sucks, but it is an urban campus after all."
College Sophomore,1,I feel like my school isn't academically minded enough. The Architecture program only admits 48 students to it. As a student we are told that this is because there is not enough funding for the program. There is no question that the school doesn't have enough money to make the program larger. NO QUESTION! The school spends near a billion dollars a year on intramural sports and clubs and such. Why can't this money by used on something more important like academics?? I don't like my school because of this and because the atmosphere isn't happy and I feel depressed whenever I'm there.
College Freshman,1,"As an out of state student attending the University of Washington, financial aid is a nightmare. The university does not give any sort of aid to out of state students, not even academic merit scholarships for incoming freshman. Because it is a state school, the university claims to reserve all of its aid for in state students, leaving out of state students with no choice but to take out loans or apply for a plethora of very competitive privet scholarships. The best advice I can give to any out of state students trying to afford to attend this school is to apply for privet scholarships early and apply for a lot of them. The university is very stingy about its financial aid."
College Freshman,1,"Its Fun If You Only Want to Party – Everyone in greek life tries to convince you that the frats and sororities are really cool and have more to them than just parties, but when it comes down to it, you'd be better off getting a house with some friends than going greek. The only reason that the university doesn't crack down on the crime in the area is because they don't have enough housing to accommodate everyone in the dorms"
College Sophomore,1,There isn't a lot of on campus parking and its really expesive. The same is true with off campus parking. There is free street parking in the greek system but you'll usually spend for ever trying to find a spot and end up parking 5 blocks away.
College Freshman,1,Campus parking is expensive at $15 a day. Street parking is difficult because it is only 2-hour and that doesn't normally fit with class schedules of the students. I live in the greek system and parking is insane. It sometimes takes 30 minutes to find a place to park and sometimes it isn't anywhere close to my house.
College Senior,1,"Fairly Bad, Not Nice – The dorms are a pretty poor option for any student to consider after their freshman year.  They are expensive and the food is bad if you have any type of diet restrictions (veganism.)  Be sure to live off campus your last three years with a few people and save a bunch of money.  Mcmahon is horrible for freshman, lander and terry are fun situations."
College Sophomore,1,"Frats have many parties, however, they usually charge a fee and end very early. Most house parties are very crowded, and there aren't many clubs around campus. Your best bet is to go to downtown Seattle."

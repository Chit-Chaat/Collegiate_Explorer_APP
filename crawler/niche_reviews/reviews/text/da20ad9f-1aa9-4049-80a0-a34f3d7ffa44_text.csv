Freshman,5,"The advisors and the  staff have made applying for entrance into Nossi so easy.
They have guided me thru this process very informative and provided me with the information I have needed to succeed in my entry into my first college experience."
Freshman,5,I am expecting my first year at Nossi to be one of the finest in my life. I cant wait to see what this year brings me.
Junior,5,"Nossi College of Art has the classes that I need to learn how to be a graphic designer, is hands-on with tours, field trips, and school and community projects, and is technologically advanced in computer programs for digital art, projectors, WiFi hubs, and video and photography equipment. To top it off, it has the conveniences of having our meals, relaxation/work areas, clubs, and job opportunities on hand in the campus. The teachers are great when it comes to knowing their subjects to teach to class, although a couple of new ones are still learning the ropes of how and what to teach at Nossi,  and there are tutors on hand in case if there are struggles in a class. A few changes that I would like to add to Nossi are upgrades to WiFi, new clubs with sponsors to spark different interests in students and staff alike, etc."
Freshman,5,All the faculty is super nice and easy going and they really care about their students!! They're super supportive and want to make sure that the students understand the topic at hand.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone cares about each other, even the staff and faculty. The class sizes are small, which is good because you can have one-on-ones with your instructors. There are plenty of opportunities to showcase your talents. Everyone wants to see each other succeed. It's like a second family."
Senior,5,"The reason why I am giving full starts to Nossi College of Art tit's because I love all the programs Nossi has, I love how each class will be, I love how everybody cares for each one another which it's one of the 5 bucket lists, social. 
My experience was speechless while taking a toured, all the award from different categories and much more art just made my mind blow from all the amazing things that I can accomplish in this college of art."
Freshman,5,"Nossi provides a state of the art learning environment along with instructors who are working professionals in the field they teach.  I believe that this is an exceptional advantage for students.  We are getting real world insight from professionals who know what it takes to succeed in the industry of Commercial Art.   With the help of Career Services and Nossi's All Access Program, we are given every opportunity to succeed."
Niche User,5,"I honestly loved the tour so much!!! The college is very small and everyone is so sweet, and it's like they are all one big family and anyone who is really dedicated to art and design, can really blossom here and can live to their full potential!!"
College Sophomore,5,think it will be good
College Freshman,5,I love Nossi and the entire staff. All the professors are extremely knowledgeable and care about the students.
College Junior,5,There's a class to cover all the information I need.
College Junior,5,"I only go 2 days out of the week, with the rest of the week to whatever."
College Freshman,5,You get hands on experience with teachers and they're all in their field while they are teaching.
College Freshman,5,I'm not sure just yet since i'm a freshman but from what i've heard they stay with you if you're willing to try too
College Freshman,5,All the teachers are experience and working in their field while teaching so it's hands on & there extremely nice & flexible
College Freshman,5,There are vast amounts of people at my school many are working class with families. All ages are in the crowd and all shorts of fields are here.
College Freshman,5,Everything I am paying for is worth it. The financial aid team was very helpful and helped with all forms I needed.
College Junior,5,Very Easy. I get to choose when I can attend school . I can still be a full time student and only attend two days  a week. Very flexable.
College Junior,5,"Seems to Have Everything I Want – When I checked this school out, I was impressed with pretty much everything. I looked into other schools offering photography degrees and was surprised and disappointed. They just didn't have the equipment, studio facilities and even found that some of the instructors were just students. Nossi seems to have it all."
College Junior,5,"Very Student Friendly – The campus is great. Spacious and clean. Covered eating areas outside, nice large indoor break area, vending machines leaning towards healthy choices. Online groups for students to discuss concerns and issues or to praise the good things. It's a very very comfortable campus."
Junior,4,"For now, I'm taking my summer classes online for three weeks before going back to Nossi on June 1st officially. So far, it's been challenging and somewhat efficient when it comes to going online to chat with teachers who are using either Zoom or Google Hangouts to communicate and show their lessons to other students, checking on Moodle to see what assignments are there to do, and turning them in online via Moodle or email or both."
Freshman,4,I love they was Nossi allows their students to be working in their field while still in school attending every day classes.
Sophomore,4,I love Nossi. I love the small culture and the family vibe from the school. I just wish it was less money...
Junior,4,Nossi is full of great professional artists that instruct you in the commercial ways of the field and if you do your work and make friends with them they will help you out in staying a career as an artist. The administration needs work though. No one knows what's going on in the office next to them and in turn confuses students on who to go to for certain things.
College Junior,4,"It's Great! Got to enroll, Do it!"
College Junior,4,"Nossi has a career center worker that will help you to connect to companies and get your first interview (this is what I was told when I signed up, I have no personal experience with this). I do however, know for a fact that they frequently send emails to students informing them of opportunities in and around Nashville. Current students have little interaction with Alumni unless they knew them in school and kept in touch. There is however a page for the Alumni so that they can all keep in touch."
College Junior,4,"Nossi offers two associate degrees; one in Graphic Design and one in Photography. It also offers three Bachelor degrees; one in Commercial Illustration, one in Graphic Design, and one in Videography. The Commercial Illustration degree is unique to Nossi! Classes are assigned to you after every semester, you don't have to go through the hassle of registering for classes."
College Senior,4,"Online classes are fairly close to the in-class types, but often have more leeway in how to take tests or have discussions. Just about all of the General Education courses are online at various points of the year."
College Senior,4,"Mostly working-class and fresh out of high school people fill out the student roster. Lots of night students as a result of the former as often the school overages don't cover everything for school. Overall, they are somewhat sociable, but, holy cow, a lot of them smoke a lot."
College Junior,4,All Good. I really like the financial aid team. They know what they're doing and respect us students and our need for help greatly.
College Senior,4,"Helpers Are Great – The financial aid advisers are amazing, and the tuition cost of the school is great; prices are going up though but once you lock in your tuition it stays that way till you graduate. Only bad part is there are 3 semesters a year so that's 3 tuition payments a year you have to worry about to."
College Senior,4,"Give and Take – There is a good diversity ethnicity, economy, and sexualy wise at the school so that's nice since it allows you to meet many different kinds of people. But, the school use to be a little more directed to the serious students, now the school seems to let anyone in that thinks they have even a little artistic tallent and dont know what they want to do."
College Senior,4,"Printing is limited, you have to pay for your printing account. Also, curtain websites that have high bandwidth problems to try to keep the internet faster, but this is annoying if you want to play pandora or visit other high bandwidth sites on the school premises. But all in all, its all fair and the interent is fast."
College Junior,4,"I'm Impressed – I haven't had any issues with the wifi although I hear others have. Being a photography major, it's great to see all the equipment they have. The studios are well equipped and very impressive. My classes haven't any issues with not having studios available. The library seems to be well stocked and manned with a very knowledgeable staff."
College Junior,4,Personal Family Atmosphere – I enjoy the personal attention that I get with the smaller class sizes.
College Sophomore,4,"Not So Bad – Nossi is supposedly known for their illustration department but us photography students keep the ship floating. The teachers that you'll get will help you and give you all the information you would need in getting into the photography field you desire. Some semesters will give you far more work to complete outside of class then others but it's nothing that is impossible. All the classes, except for the ones that have some specific teachers, will be extremely informative. You'll learn many different fields of photography that you can go into and how to market yourself in those different areas and to make a real, comfortable, living doing what you love."
College Sophomore,4,"Very Pleased – The financial aid process at Nossi is very strait forward and extremely helpful, you'll get notices well before the time everything has to be done and turned in so there's almost never that last minute hustle. The Tuition is also amazing, there is a fixed tuition so that once you sign up for classes that tuition will never increase unless you take a semester off. The cost of the tuition is a great deal with the amazing education you'll receive."
College Freshman,4,"Art Experience – Very pleasing, everyone in the school gets along and the teachers will take one on one time to help you if needed. I would pick this school over again. It's very unique in the type of art it teaches here, it's something that will help you go far in life."
College Freshman,4,"1St Year Hopeful – It's my first year in and, so far, so good. Many of the teachers I've had so far are interested in helping out freshmen with their studies and getting them ready for their later courses. The Illustration curriculum feels more geared towards graphic design, but since it's also some of what I need for the line of work I'm heading into, it's not all bad. My only major grievance is that the school incessantly pushes the student body to purchase MacBooks for their second semester, but fail to really give any sort of insight in how to pay for such a costly expense."
College Freshman,4,"Easier Than I Remember – For the most part, the tuition costs for the school are pretty inexpensive for what it offers. And, for whatever reason, it was much easier this time around for me to financial aid paperwork processed and ready for subsequent semester than it had been some years before at another college. My only gripe would be that I wish I had enough money to get all the supplies I need throughout the year."

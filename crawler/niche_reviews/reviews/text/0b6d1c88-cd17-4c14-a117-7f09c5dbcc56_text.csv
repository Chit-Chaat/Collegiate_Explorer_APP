Sophomore,5,Really good school! Where the presence of the Holy Spirit can move freely. I have been privileged to sit at the feet of Jesus here while He fills me up so that I can be a blessing towards others. It’s not always being here because we don’t have all the piece but one thing that I know is that my God is faithful.
Freshman,5,"Northpoint has been an amazing college to go to. I’m glad I chose it.  The courses are fantastic and the professors are knowledgeable, helpful, warm, and understanding.  The students are unlike any that I have seen and the price is unbeatable. Choose Northpoint!"
Freshman,5,"Northpoint Bible College - Grand Rapids Campus is a phenomenonal place! I have never been someplace where people care so much, take time to interact with each other and learn so quickly! The professors enjoy their jobs and make class time awesome!"
Sophomore,5,"Northpoint is a small campus but for me that makes me fall in love with it. With the campus being so small it makes for a very close intimate feeling with other students and also with the staff and professors there. On larger campuses it makes it very difficult to get one on one time with the staff or professors there and it is also on a very professional level. At Northpoint, some of the closest people in my life right now are staff members. I love being there and when we get breaks from school, honestly I miss being there because it is my home now. 
                     One of the things that I wish would change at Northpoint is the focus on physical health because the campus is smaller the gym there is old and not in very good condition. Also a lot of the food served there regardless of having choices isn't healthy. I would like to see a better improved gym and more food choices that would allow healthy eating."
Sophomore,5,"If you are looking to go into full time Pentecostal ministry, then Northpoint Bible College is the school for you. Northpoint is dedicated to training and equipping ministers of the gospel."

College Freshman,5,"Every teacher I have had in class, or met so far I have loved!

College Freshman,5,"I love my school! All of the staff and administrators genuinely care about the students and their success. It feels like home, since it's such a small school, everyone becomes like family easily. The classes are interesting and well taught. The chapel services add to the experience and make the school richer and more united. There's always extra fun events going on to get involved with as well, so it keeps us busy. I love it here and would recommend it to anyone seeking to pursue a life a ministry."

The admissions office is friendly and prompt to applications for admissions. Workload is minimum of 12 credit hours keeping the students on books.
College Student,5,"The college is Biblical centric with pentecostal and theologically qualified faculty with ample teaching experience over the years. To be a BA in Biblical studies student is like entring into a potters house for moulding. The curriculum is such that it impaccts the total person: spiritually ant intellectually.
spacious and conducive unpolutted atmosphere offering leisure and social interactions.
Churches around offer good opportunities for internship. No job opportunities guarantted with the campus."
College Freshman,5,"Zion Is Strict – As a Christian school, I believe that Zion is excellent at keeping students in line with the school's mission. Training students to go into the ministry is not an easy task, and there are things that we need to represent the One we are called to serve. Dress code violations result in fines, and if your room is messy you also get fined. Cerfew is at 11, unless you're a senior. But punishments are not done in a way that is degrading. There is a reason behind every rule, and the administration explains each one."
College Freshman,5,The off-campus dining is so excellent and yet perfect to what God provide us in live and follow Christ. Pray for our food and thanking God for live.
College Junior,5,"No Problem – Everything's pretty organized in regards to parking. Traffic can be a nightmare around the school, depending on the time of day and if they're doing construction."

College Junior,4,The school does it's very best to connect students with churches and possible employers or internship programs.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are most always clean and the rooms are spacious! I love living on campus and getting the experience of dorm life. It's an all female dorm where boys are restricted to access, so we always feel safe and secure."
College Senior,4,"My School is really great for those who feel called into Ministry. It is then only A\G college open that only focuses on ministry. There are many good Christian colleges available, but the atmosphere is what makes this school great. Not only are you learning on the classroom but you are encouraged to be a part of the community and get hands on experience. My favorite experience would be with a teacher. I am a teachers assistant and the professor I TA for is always willing to help me. He always says I dont work for him, he works for me. So he understands that without the students, the teachers wouldn't have a job, so he is willing to do whatever it takes to help out his students. He has allowed me to access his library for papers and has even just been there to talk to. The professors are the best part of the school by far. They are always sacrificing to make our school more enjoyable and to give us as much education as they can."

College Sophomore,4,There really isn't that much going on- everyone is off doing their own thing at night
College Sophomore,4,"This is New England, if you don't like the snow then you should go somewhere else. During the winter, there isn't that much snow, really. Fall is the best season here, but Spring is also very beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a beautiful location. A lot of stores within walking distance, a nice park also within the area and absolutely beautiful atmosphere. The students bring love into the town that everyone can not only see, but also feel."

Niche User,2,"Little flexibility with course selection, limited library resources, constant WiFi connectivity issues, maintenance issues (elevators were broken, copiers off-line). Some professors are great mentors."
College Senior,2,Technology is a constant problem. Wifi and printers are often down. Heavy student responsibility to use online features that are not easily accessible.
College Freshman,2,"Locals are nice but the area is NOT. The school is close to the highway though, and everything is 20 minutes away."
College Freshman,2,"The workload is ridiculous. Papers in most classes. Mandatory reading, Five hours of SPICE (volunteer work on campus) Church responsibilities. Disorganized communication systems between offices- everything takes much longer than it should to get done- especially for such a small campus."
College Freshman,2,"The curriculum is challenging and does not seem well planned out. The whole Bible in one semester- it should be broken up. Also, the professors don't seem to know when others are giving tests and papers. The schedule is unreasonable and the information is not really practical."
College Junior,2,"Only intramural Frisbee and basketball, depending on interest level."
College Junior,2,"Dorms are new but have problems with heat. The wifi is often down. There are strict rules about keeping rooms clean and fines are enforced for unannounced ""room checks."" The bathrooms are not the cleanest and there is a strict curfew."
College Junior,2,"Students are not allowed to get an apartment off campus unless they are married. On campus married housing is poor- rent is reasonable but most apartments don't have a bathroom. There are frequent heating/cooling and wifi issues. Also, apartments do not allow cooking."
College Junior,2,Very limited. Reflective of the likes of student council but not necessarily of the students collectively.
College Senior,2,"the computers are good, the wireless is really good."
College Student,2,"Located in the new England, the winters are a bit harsh and snows a lot but this doesnot affect classes and classrooms are well heated to make it comfortable for studies."
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek like so I cannot answer any of these questions.
College Freshman,1,"Strictness about everything- appearance, relationships, participation in events, even how assignments should be. Mandatory attendance to classes and chapel. Cannot even give a meal away that's already been paid for..."
College Senior,1,there is no Greek life at Zion. We are a Bible based school and no drinking and drugs that sort of thing is allowed. We have clean fun!
College Freshman,1,"There is not much to do off campus in the local area. You have to travel at least 20 Minutes to get to a good store, and 45 minutes to go to any fun attraction sites."

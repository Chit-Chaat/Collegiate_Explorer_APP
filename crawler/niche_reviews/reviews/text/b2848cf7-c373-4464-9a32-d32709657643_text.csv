Alum,5,"I applied to Macalester because I was so struck on my tour and during my interactions with students and faculty just how much everyone seemed to care about making the world a better place - and that turned out to be the case. What an accepting, inspiring, challenging, and transformative place. As a 2012 alum, I am still actively using my Macalester education in my work and personal life, and I continue to feel part of the Mac community in meaningful ways. The faculty pushed me to think critically and open-heartedly about the world, trust my intelligence, and pursue my career aspirations. My fellow students were non-stop inspiring in their pursuits of their passions, their creativity, and their kindness. Macalester attracts smart people who want to learn, be engaged in the world, and dive deeply into the college experience. I am so grateful I had the opportunity to spend four years at Mac."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online courses during my time at Mac, as I attended from 2008-2012, but I have been very struck by the way the school responded to the pandemic - giving students laptop who needed them, paying for low-income students' wifi, etc."
Freshman,5,"The professors really make an effort to make it as easy as possible. The work load has been lessened and even though it can be difficult at times, the professors are really flexible."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment and the community. Wonderful people and resources for anything you need (mental health, physical health, academic, personal...)."
Alum,5,"A life changing event. I often think fondly of my Mac days.   I had 2majors: history and  an IDIM in Romance languages. The professors were great, they went the extra mile."
Alum,5,"None of my classes were online, but many used online resources extensively. I found that they enhanced the classroom experience and made the materials more easily accessible, both as they were assigned and for future reference."
Alum,5,N/A - I didn't attend online so I'm not able to give an accurate assessment about the quality of the classes
Alum,5,"Macalester truly changed my life, and I am so grateful for the entire undergraduate experience. I am originally from the Southwest US, and I was drawn to the Twin Cities and Macalester after my first campus visit. I was so grateful to receive a generous financial aid package that made it possible for me to attend school out of state. The students are passionate and engaged. I was taught by the incredible staff and faculty how to grow intentionally and find my purpose in school and beyond. The winters are cold, but Minnesotans are like no other. If an Arizonan can do it, so can you! And it's worth it."
Alum,5,I did not take classes online but the pieces of learning that was assigned with online resources was helpful and relevant.
Alum,5,I’m a Mac alum from 2016 and still feel thankful and connected to the place and people. It is an amazing community full of quality people and learning.
Alum,5,"I initially went to Macalester with the intent to transfer to Cornell University. I changed my mind within the first year. My first year floor was full of amazing people who challenged me to get outside my comfort zone and try out new clubs and activities. My first year floormates remain some of my closest friends to this day. I also still keep in touch with professors. They are so accessible and really want to see you succeed! During my time at Mac, I had multiple professors invite me to their homes and take time to get to know me outside of the classroom. The faculty to student ratio is one of the main things that kept me at Mac."
Alum,5,"From Jana Hong, Class of 2017:

While your college experience is ultimately what you make it, and the college you choose should hopefully fit with who you are and who you want to be, for me, Macalester was the best choice. 

The pre-orientation and orientation programs, the student organizations, and the First Year Course really helped me to make friends and to adjust to college life as a first year.

Over the years, I made great friends, picked up an unexpected but much loved minor and concentration, and experienced the unwavering support of faculty and staff. 

As an alum, I serve as a Mac volunteer because of the financial and emotional support and the education I received while at Mac, and I hope that others can have the same great experience. I know Mac isn't the perfect school for everyone, but it was the perfect school for me."
Sophomore,5,"Macalester was an excellent choice for me. I am from California and was looking for a small liberal arts school with strong academics, a diverse community, a suburban/urban location and the opportunity to play DIII sports. The highlights of my Mac experience have included great access to professors in challenging classes, finding an amazing group of friends from all over the world, ready access to explore opportunities in the twin cities, a well balanced and supportive environment for student-athletes, and an engaged and welcoming community. I highly recommend Mac!"
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Macalester. It was a really high quality liberal arts college education, with smart, interesting, contrarian students who remain good friends to this day in the middle of the twin cities. The students remain really smart and ready to connect with the cities (St Paul & Minneapolis) around them. This also helped me and helps current students to get a leg up on finding jobs and connections in the local community."
Niche User,5,I am the parent of a current Macalester Junior. We have found that the Macalester experience has been an enormous asset to our son. The smaller liberal arts classes with direct access to professors has provided inspiration and mentoring from extremely accomplished academics. This has brought lab and research opportunities that one would not accomplish in a larger school. We could not be more thankful to the Macalester community for creating such a tremendous learning environment.
Niche User,5,I'm a parent of a Macalester sophomore and we couldn't be more pleased with the college.  The small liberal arts environment enabled her to develop close relationships with her professors which served her well as she transitioned to remote learning because of the pandemic. She is a student athlete and we have been impressed with the care that everyone from the coaches to the strength and conditioning staff to the sports psychologists provide.
Alum,5,"You know when people say things like ""This school changed my life"" and you are like ""that is completely ridiculous, no way did that school change your life."" 
Macalester changed my life and I know, it is ridiculous, but it is also true. I met the most incredible people at Mac. People that pushed and challenged me, people that asked me to grow with them, people that continually inspire me to re-imagine a better world for all of us. After all, Macalester is just a cluster of buildings in St. Paul. It is the community you will find there that makes it one of the most special places on earth."
Alum,5,"My name is Molly Thorsen Connolly and I graduated from Macalester College in 1993 with a degree in Political Science and International Studies. I choose Macalester because of its focus on Internationalism and urban location and couldn't have been happier with my choice. I met and learned about people and cultures from all over the world and made life long friendships. My education at Macalester helped prepare me for a variety of career adventures from international finance in Washington, DC to starting my own software consulting firm in Chicago when I was 25 years old. Macalester gave me the education and confidence to pursue my dreams."
Alum,5,"I am an alum from the class of 2013 - Macalester was the best fit I could wish for: rigorous academics, located in a city, super international and excellent professors. I was able to take advantage of the college's ample academic offer with internships in the twin cities - both prepared me to successfully enter and succeed in the job market. But there is more: at Mac I discovered and built a community of friends for life that have been the highlight of my experience. If you want to be stretched, learn by doing and build a resilient community, Macalester is your place."
Alum,5,"Life changing experience. 
Location - Macalester sits nearly equidistant from the downtowns of St. Paul and Minneapolis. 
Macalester prepares graduates to thrive in a changing world and be engaged citizens of our planet."
Alum,5,"My 4 years at Macalester were some the most influential years of my life. I learned so much, grew in ways I never expected, and came out very well prepared to have a fulfilling life. I would absolutely choose Macalester again if just starting down this path my self, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a liberal, challenging experience."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school here! The people are amazing, teachers are so helpful, and the classes are interesting. The environment is so welcoming. I couldn’t have picked a better school for me."
Freshman,5,"Love the people at Mac and overall just a great experience. Everyone can agree that when they aren’t at Mac, they miss being there."
Works Here,5,"My brother goes here. He is always happy. I am surprised that this is not considered one of the best colleges in the country! Many smart people go here and it has excellent professors. If you want quality people and education, Mac is for you. Hopefully, I am going there next year."
Sophomore,5,"I really wasn't sure how much I was going to like the school. I'm from California, which is a good distance from Minnesota. Being from so far away, I knew I wasn't going to know anyone, and was just praying that I would be able to make friends. After my first step on campus, all my worries were gone, as a man named Shea Husband approached me. Shea and I immediately became friends, as we both shared an interest of listening to k-pop and speaking Korean. Shea made me feel so comfortable at Macalester, and after meeting  him, I 100% know I made the right choice to come to Macalester. On other note, there are some Debby Downers at this school. After knowing Shea for a while, I eventually got to meet his roommate, Ethan. I felt so bad for Shea because Ethan wouldn't even make an attempt to hang out with Shea. All Ethan did was sit in the dorm and play Minecraft all day long and clap his hands while watching anime. Other than the Debby Downers, the school is great, and I highly recommend it"
Sophomore,5,"Best choice I could have made! The small size gives us amazing access to professors, opportunities, and resources. I also love the tight knit community, the social scene is fantastic."
Sophomore,5,"Macalester has stellar academics and some truly amazing resources for both student support and health. Sports are rather mediocre, though student orgs definitely help make up for that. However, the administration and overall culture has some issues. The resources made available to students at times seem more meant to boost the college's reputation and image than actually help students, and the college has made questionable decisions with regards to Presidential salary and the use of its endowment (which is quite large by any college's standards). Students can also be rather lacking in passion in a number of cases, which is a shame considering the level of intellectual ability of the student body."
Alum,5,"Macalester provide high quality education while maintaining small classroom sizes. The professors are able to form deep mentorship bonds with students. Many students get to participate in faculty research during the summer months, and are paid by research grants!"
Freshman,5,"Love it. Best-teaching professors who care about students, rigorous academics and great location. Great opportunities on and off-campus. A diverse student body and socially aware at the same time."
Freshman,5,I've found the overall environment of Macalester College to be very inviting and welcoming. The campus has a great atmosphere for academic success and the student body is generally committed to not only their own excellence but helping others achieve theirs. The professors are generally very approachable and make an effort to be available to their students. I really enjoy the school and highly recommend it!
Freshman,5,"The classes are rigorous and time-consuming, but the amount of support, push to become better and love from those on campus makes Macalester an amazing college choice and completely worth the work!"
Freshman,5,"Excellent, knowledgable professors and I love the people I have met here. I play a sport and it's an excellent community to be a part of."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my four years at Macalester.  The professors are superb.  The atmosphere of the college is intimate and caring.  The student body is culturally, socially and ethnically diverse. The college has a strong international flavor with a large population of foreign students.  The campus is located in a wonderful neighborhood of St. Paul.  Macalester ranks among the best liberal arts college of the nation."
Freshman,5,"Macalester is inclusive and tight-knit. Everyone cares for each other, especially the faculty. The theatre department gives me opportunities for acting and seeing productions that I would never have imagined getting. The choir program is incredible and well-known. The academics are quite rigorous but provide beyond adequate preparation for the real world."
Niche User,5,"Macalester is a very diverse and globally focused school. This school provides opportunities to have peers that are of a different background, religion, economic status, and political beliefs. The facilities are very nice and it is a small community that feels like home. My first time touring there when I was a senior in high school, I felt the connection. It is such a great place."
Niche User,5,"My son absolutely loves Mac! It is a beautiful campus, great people, and they really care about student safety and activism. Great for go getters!"
Alum,5,"This has been the best experience of my life. I sincerely hope that you apply if you are considering Mac for the next four years. Really in-depth education, the sports teams and clubs are great opportunities to meet people. The dorms are the best place to get to know others. Even though there isn't a Greek life system, there are no shortages of volunteer ops w/ other students. Highly recommend!"
Freshman,5,"Love this place! My favorite thing about this place is that the people and professors really care about you. It goes both ways. If you come here looking for an education you won't just learn more about the subjects you study, you'll learn to think for yourself, and create real-world solutions to the issues that face society today. Mac is a very activism-orientated environment. That means that no matter what they are doing, the people and profs are passionate about their areas. Not for everyone - just for the people who want to change the world."
Niche User,5,"My partner attends school there she always tells me how great her school is how amazing her professors are and how much she really likes it. I've stayed a few times in her dorm and well its a dorm, not too big of a party scene but fun after class activities to do. Overall seems like a great school!"
Junior,5,"really committed to diversity and excellent academics, studying here is a challenging and transformative experience!"
College Sophomore,5,I love the profs and courses at Mac so much. Super approachable and eager to help with anything. Very very intelligent people.
College Sophomore,5,Social capital is abundant at Mac.
College Sophomore,5,I love Mac! The location is great and there's a ton to do on campus and in the Cities.
College Freshman,5,"I don't know the exact percentage, but there are a great number of international and ethnic students at Macalester. On my floor alone, it's at least 25% international students. I'm friends with people from several countries and know a great deal more. Walking across campus, I hear different languages spoken around me. There are all gender bathrooms across campus, in all the buildings, and an all gender floor is offered for a living option on campus. People are incredibly accepting of diversity, something that is facilitated by all the opportunities to learn about other cultures, countries, or ways of life."
College Freshman,5,"For a small liberal arts school, the course, major, and minor offerings at Macalester are amazing. Students can be pre-law or pre-med, can major in computer science or Gender and Sexuality Studies. Most classes are capped at under 20 students, while the larger lecture classes are capped under 30. The class offerings change from semester to semester, ensuring there will always be something new or interesting to take that will meet requirements at the same time. Students can take a course knowing that the professors will be engaging and encourage discussions and such. My experience thus far has been positive, with professors who want their students to succeed and are always ready to answer questions and provide a center for discussion."
College Freshman,5,"I love Macalester so far. It's a very diverse place where I can interact and be exposed to many different cultures and nationalities. There are countless extracurricular activities one can get involved in - sports, theater, music, dance, clubs, student government, etc. - and I have taken advantage to the fullest extent my free time allows. I play hockey and joined the rugby team, am participating in mock trial and the gaming society. At Macalester, I have found that I can explore anything that interests me, regardless of how different or obscure the activities, and find support from my peers. The classes are varied and engaging, with many topics offered from semester to semester. The variety keeps the learning experiences interesting, therefore keeping me engaged with the material. On top of what the school offers, the location is superb. It's located close to nearly everything students could need or want, as well as cultural opportunities being a mere bus or train ride away - the school is located in St. Paul. But despite being in a city, the school's location in an upscale neighborhood gives it the feeling of someplace smaller, more immersed with nature. The campus is gorgeous (my opinion) - the trees are brightly colored in the fall and flowers bloom in the spring. When the sky is a bright blue and the wind is blowing, the air can feel so fresh... it's lovely."
College Sophomore,5,"Always feel safe, good security, safe spaces for all"
College Sophomore,5,"Macalester has provided an incredibly welcoming and intellectually stimulating college experience thus far. It's students and faculty share an excitement for learning and the avant-garde. Before coming to Macalester I was unsure of how I would feel in this alien place, but since being here for nearly two years I have grown the love the college and all the members of its community. It truly is a hidden gem."
College Freshman,5,"The first week on campus is orientation, where first years are put into ""clans"" made up of students from our first year courses and students from another ""sister"" first year course. Clans spend this week getting to know each other and the campus, by playing ice breaker games and talking in circles. There are also opportunities for students to go and explore campus, meet staff and introduce themselves to different services offered on campus. There were also a lot of activities being held at all hours of the day- sometimes it could be overwhelming because there was never enough time to get to everything, but it was nice to have options. There were mandatory meetings with the school president and other staff to teach the first years about Macalester values and principles, such as consent, sustainability, diversity, and multiculturalism. While these could get a bit tedious, it was also very nice to have all the first years in one place to learn about Macalester. Overall, orientation here at Macalester was great, and really acclimated me to the college- so much so that after orientation, I already felt as though I had been on campus for a month, rather than a week. The welcoming nature of Macalester and the acceptance felt from staff and fellow students did not dissipate once classes began, either. Any stereotypes you have previously made of people based on their appearance or clothing is contradicted at Macalester. Everyone that I would normally write off as shallow or rude turn out to be very intelligent, kind, and open. It definitely threw me for a loop for a while, but it is nice to know that negative stereotypes do not prevail here. This means, however, that diversity of opinion on political and social issues is not very diverse. Most people on campus are very progressive, and this is definitely not a campus for someone of more conservative beliefs because there will rarely be someone else to agree with. Finally, classes are challenging but interesting and rewarding"
College Sophomore,5,Macalester is the perfect place for me! I am surrounded by people with the same passions as me and everyone is interesting.
College Freshman,5,"The number & quality of off-campus dining options is dangerous... I spend all of my money on food because it's so good. Being on Grand Ave is a perk, and it's easy to take the bus and/or light rail into the cities for endless dining options."
College Sophomore,5,"I love professors at Mac. They expect a lot from you, which can be daunting at times, but they're generally very open and warm. I love chatting with them and joking around. You don't need to feel intimidated by them or feel like you have to put up a front to earn their respect. They're very knowledgeable and current in their fields."
College Sophomore,5,"Food at Mac is great. I think it's of very high quality! There's always fresh fruit at every meal! There are lots of vegetarian and gluten free options. Don't really know about vegan, as I'm not a vegan. Tons of options at lunch, a little less during dinner. There seem to be less options on Friday and Saturday nights, and the cafeteria has weird shortened hours for Saturday dinner. The hardest part for me is balancing the number meal swipes I do each week with the amount of flex points I spend. All first-years have to be on the full meal plans, which is only meal swipes, so that's not something you'll have to deal with at first!"
College Freshman,5,"The twin cities are awesome! It's really great to be able to have the liberal arts experience but in a metropolitan area with so much going on. There are frequently concerts and other events to go to and theres always the opportunity to just explore the cities and more permanent attractions.

The Mac-Groveland neighborhood is super safe and comfortable. There's lots of little streets to walk through the neighborhood (doing this in the fall is the best!) and Grand Ave. has most everything you could need super close by (little shops, food, coffee, etc.)"
College Sophomore,5,"I love off-campus dining! There are so many options nearby, and a ton of variety! There are all sorts of different ethnic restaurants and it's never hard to find something new to try!"
College Freshman,5,"Professors are kind, humorous and engaging. The workload is manageable if one budgets their time. There are numerous opportunities for volunteering, jobs, and internships both encouraged on and off campus."
College Freshman,5,"Weed is common but there isn't any pressure to use it if you don't want to.  Same goes for alcohol.  Most students use one or the other to some degree, but it isn't a big issue like it is at other schools."
College Freshman,5,"While we are located in the middle of a metropolitan area, the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood is more residential, yet well-populated.  The community and students mesh well together, and it's a nice area to live."
College Freshman,5,"There are security dispatch phones located in multiple locations on campus, and you can also dial from your cell phone.  Security will help you immediately with any problem you have - even small matter."
College Freshman,5,"Security is great... very kind & helpful.  There are rarely safety concerns even with campus being located in the Twin Cities.  As long as you are respectful of how your choices affect your living community, you aren't likely to face punishment for drugs or alcohol."
Senior,4,My learning experience at Macalester college gas been very rewarding. Although very challenging I have built the necessary skills to be successful in whatever I plan to do post-grad.
Senior,4,"This is a very welcoming college that has made me into the amazing woman I am today. With professors who care about me and engage my critical thinking, I have gotten a great education here. A beautiful campus year round and extra curricular activities that make me an active member of the community."
Alum,4,"The professors are by and large incredible, empathetic people that will push you both in your academic interests and in your personal development. The overall culture of the school buys into the ""glorification of business"" that is so toxic for so many young people, so please be conscious of saying yes only to what is enriching your growth, because taking on too much means getting less out of each opportunity. I learned an incredible amount from my peers about equity and justice, but beware of the self-agrandizing attitude that some students will take when they recognize that their social status is tied to their righteousness. You would do well to those who hold a high standard for justice while being more interested in conversations that call people in, rather than those that push people down and away for their own personal gain."
Senior,4,"My online learning experience with Macalester was okay. We switched to an online format in the middle of the semester to accommodate COVID-19 related health guidelines. Macalester is very much a community-based and organized college, so it was difficult not to be able to mingle in the hallways or just drop by office hours unannounced. I would say I had difficulty learning online, but that's because I chose Macalester because I understand my learning style. I like personal relationships and at Macalester, the professors know your name. Our staff and faculty worked really hard to ensure a good transition to online learning but there was still some benefit lost."
Senior,4,"Macalester has well-designed schedules, good food in its meal plan, a nice and small campus layout, and it's located right in the Twin Cities. Getting involved off campus is encouraged and many students branch out of their comfort zone with all of the buzzing opportunities around. Macalester encourages learning that is supportive, inclusive, and they understand that not everyone is going to have the exact same needs. While Macalester does have a lot of representation from other countries, my time at Macalester has made me wonder what diversity does look like. I think it's great to have students from over 90 countries in the world, but sometimes, if there is only 1 student from many of those countries, it puts a lot of pressure on international students to ""perform"" their nationality and serve as a generic template for all people from that region. However, Mac is supportive & understanding of its students overall, & you will learn almost as much from the students as the professors."
Sophomore,4,"I think that Macalester College provides a very personal experience that influences the way you are able to learn. The Macalester community is so small and it allows for people to make relationships with a variety of people and I really appreciate all the connections I have made. Although the size allows for these connections, it can also encourage a homogenous environment. I wish that Macalester was a place for more types of people and that more people could find there place."
Sophomore,4,"Good academics. Professors are usually very competent, although some are less so. Use ratemyprofessor for your teachers. Research opportunities exist. Very expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Macalester allows students to be active in their education. Small class sizes and discussion based lessons give students the opportunity to widen knowledge bases and think quickly. One thing that I think Macalester lacks is the ability to live up to its proclamations of internationalism and social justice. While I do believe that they are ahead of many colleges and universities in this field, there are gaps between what is advertised and what is done. For example, Macalester preaches a goal of carbon neutrality, but has investments in fossil fuel companies."
Sophomore,4,"I really love the small class sizes, the engagement of the faculty, and the opportunities that I've been given here. It's very well located (Twin Cities) for a small liberal arts college."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, professors who care, and decent cafeteria food. Boasts about internationalism but still lacking in diversity. Overall, a great college with wonderful students and faculty! The Twin Cities is a GREAT location."
Sophomore,4,"Macalester is excellent academically. The professors are intelligent, engaging, and eager to help students pursue their interests. The location in the twin cities is helpful for finding internships and volunteer opportunities. While the campus is close to downtown Saint Paul, it is located in a very safe residential neighborhood, which means that much of the student life is focused on campus. The athletics are considerably good for a division three school. There are also a wide range of clubs and other activities for students to be engaged in. The school could be much more diverse, but it is more diverse than other liberal arts colleges I have visited. Overall, it is an excellent school!"
Freshman,4,Macalester College has excellent academics and a invested professors. The professors always have office hours available to student and schedule appointments outside of those hours for people who can't make it. Students are friendly and most don't act pretentious.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that Macalester was open to conversations about diversity and inclusion. There is definitely a strong support system in the Department of Multicultural Life for students of color. However, there is still a lot of work to be done at this PWI."
Sophomore,4,"Macalester is a warm and welcoming community to all. The teachers there are able to create deep connection with their students through small class sizes. The campus is beautiful, and the perfect size for students living within the twin cities."
Freshman,4,"Just finished my freshman year, I love it so far, all of the people are really amazing and the atmosphere on campus is amazing."
College Sophomore,4,Class time can sow seeds of productive thought.
College Sophomore,4,Many students take initiative in the job world.
College Sophomore,4,I've never felt in danger on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Dorm life is fun with some good friends.
College Sophomore,4,It's essentially a new world to explore.
College Sophomore,4,Overall a really safe campus and neighborhood.
College Freshman,4,"School spirit revolving around sports teams isn't huge, but the support in between teams is great and the Leonard Center (and other athletic facilities) are fantastic."
College Freshman,4,"I am so far very happy with Macalester. The people are interesting and kind, the professors are almost all geniuses, and the twin cities are awesome. Would definitely recommend with sufficient financial aid, which is pretty easy to get (especially need based)."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoyed most of my classes and professors. I liked the small class size a lot, and I felt that the professors made an effort to be engaging. TAs were used only to lead study sessions or provide extra help in addition to office hours. Many professors were very available for office hours, some of the busier ones were a bit harder to get ahold of. The discussion-based format was far preferable to giant, impersonal lecture halls, and I felt like the course work was challenging and thought provoking. Grades and competition are present a little too much for my taste though."
College Freshman,4,"Security visibly patrol campus at all hours and have regular office hours as well as a 24 hour number students can call. As far as health goes, there is a health center on campus which is available to all students are fairly accessible hours. My experience with the health center has been a pleasant experience thus far. The nurse I met with was very personable and helpful with what I needed, giving me her email and helping to follow up and ensure I had what I needed. The campus security is vocal where security and such is concerned, and if or when incidents occur, whether on or off (near) campus, they are sure to post memos and send out emails and such to everyone on campus. I feel safe walking across campus, and when I've left campus, I've felt safe in the area surrounding Macalester."
College Freshman,4,"The rooms can be small (mine is great!) but everything from singles to quads are available. The dorms are close to classes, which makes life easier when running late, and close to food. (Let's be honest, it's a small campus, the dorms are close to everything). The only downsides can be the bathrooms, as there aren't options for those (you've got to use what you've got). The rooms' temperature is well regulated and such, which is nice when considering the MN winters. Overall, I'm satisfied with my dorm experience so far."
College Sophomore,4,"Courses are excellent, professors are generally great and accessible, though there are a few outliers. Class sizes always good, good variety of courses and styles"
College Sophomore,4,Good prospects if you are active and take advantage
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are cute but not a big deal. Great gym facility open to everyone
College Sophomore,4,"Great but one negative is cost of tuition. Diverse student body and challenging classes, niche for everyone"
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very passionate about what they teach. Recommend talking to other students who have taken some courses by certain profs. Class sizes are always mostly small.
College Sophomore,4,Apparently Macalester spews out many students onto graduate school so something's goin on right.
College Sophomore,4,"Housing guarenteed all four years. In my case, it's more practical and cheaper versus renting, though rates are pretty good around the area ($300-600) if that's you're things. Required to live on campus your first two years. Turck has the best freshman dorms. Doty's good too, perhaps the rooms may be a bit bigger than Turck, but Turck has niceR bathrooms :p (newly renovated) Dupre is the worst but its ""great sense of community"" makes up for it and people say they get use to the very very tiny showers that are dimly lit a dupringles. There's also specialty housings like language houses, and other stuff, but you can look that up yourself if you're really interested."
College Freshman,4,"My college experience was a bit hectic in the beginning but then I got a good list of colleges i wanted to apply to and then it worked out. The school I am at right now is very fitting to my needs. It is small, focused, has good professors who are dedicated to teaching and it has a lot of resources for me to use."
College Junior,4,"I love it here. Great campus, great professors, wonderful friends,"
College Sophomore,4,I'm thankful to have met the minds and people that I've encountered on Macalester's campus. The school is a little expensive and many of the student's come from wealthy homes. A very white campus. More women than men. Generally trans friendly. Wheel chair users would find it impossible to live in a dorm. Few mental health resources.
College Freshman,4,"Many students do party, but there's no pressure to drink/do drugs at parties. There's not really a divide between students who drink and students who don't."
College Freshman,4,"Macalester is very expensive, but generally pretty generous about financial aid. Most students receive some form of aid."
College Freshman,4,"People like to complain about food on campus, but it's much better than what you'd find at a lot of other schools. Meals in the dining hall can get really repetitive, but there are lots of vegetarian & gluten free options."
College Freshman,4,"First year housing is pretty average in terms of room size. Turck & Doty have sinks in every room which is nice, and Turck is generally regarded as the best. Dupre is where most first year parties happen. The housing process after your first year is a bit of a headache. Triples & suites disappear in a matter of minutes, leaving some students scrambling to find new roommates at the last minute."
College Sophomore,4,"Being in the cities is definitely an asset. It is easy to get internships and be able to do them for the school year, even getting academic credit for them. There are alumni in all corners of the globe. I've heard that having a degree from Macalester carries a lot of weight, especially in Minnesota. The Career Development Center (CDC) is there and helpful, but you have to reach out to them. I feel like it can be hard to be aware of events going on related to the CDC unless you're intentional about it."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't think that campus is very strict! I've heard of a few people getting in trouble for underage drinking, but I think it's a pretty rare experience. They're a little more strict on drugs than they are on drinking."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are relatively nice and spacious. Living in dorms is a great way to meet other people and make friends. Two first year dorms, Doty and Turck, have sinks in every room. That being said, not having a sink in the room isn't all that bad! Everyone has to live on-campus for two years, which makes running into people that you know a lot easier!"
College Sophomore,4,"Sometimes it can be harder to find parties, but when you live in the first-year dorms, it's pretty easy - just follow the noise. People are generally really welcome and inviting at parties. A lot of groups (clubs, teams, classes, any kind of defined group) at Macalester have themed progressives that include scheduled themed stops. These are very open and inviting to members of a group and a good way to bond with people on the weekends or outside of an academic setting. On top of that, you don't need to drink to go on progressives or go to parties in general! There's very little pressure to do so if you don't want to. Off-campus house parties are usually pretty cool and fun. Sometimes they can get pretty loud, but unlike at some other schools, I've never heard of the police being called or the hosts of a party kicking people out for illegitimate reasons. On-campus parties in dorm rooms occasionally get busted, but the punishments are pretty lenient. In my opinion, the noise levels on-campus can get pretty loud without having to worry about getting in trouble."
College Freshman,4,Solid academics. Some classes are definitely better than others though which has a lot to do with the professor.
College Freshman,4,Never had a problem with administration. For the most part they are simply there to help.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are all a comfortable size. Some dorms have nice amenities like sinks in each room, large windows, and nice bathrooms/showers."
College Sophomore,4,"There's a lot of diversity in terms of race, religion, nationality, etc., but students seem to be pretty homogeneous when it comes to political beliefs and upbringing. The vast majority of kids seem to come from middle-to-upper class suburbs, though there are some who come from cities, and a few who come from rural areas."
College Freshman,4,"While Macalester students are typically intelligent and quite attractive, the pretentiousness and social ignorance is disgusting. In addition, most Macalester students are hypersensitive to their own and other people's feelings and thoughts and are therefore socially awkward. Online dating is a necessary tool."
College Freshman,4,"Macalester is a D-3 college. We have wonderful athletic facilities and the athletes do not fit the ""jock"" stereotype."
College Freshman,4,There are a number of places to try that surround the campus. Macalester is located in a suburban area of a city and transport into food-diverse areas is convenient.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the computers on campus are Apple computers, though they boot to both Windows 7 and Mountain Lion."
College Freshman,4,"There are computer labs in the library, Humanities, and Dupre. They're convenient and printing is free but the printers in Dupre are often broken or out of paper. It would be inconvenient but doable not to have your own laptop. There's wifi all over campus which is usually good but varies in speed (sometimes Dupre is weak)"
College Freshman,4,"If you get yourself off campus and on the bus, St Paul and Minneapolis are easy to get to. It just takes the extra motivation to get out of the dorm and off campus, and I think a lot of students don't take advantage of those opportunities as much as they may think they will when they first come to Mac."
College Freshman,4,Great sense of hall community.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of places to eat up and down Grand Ave, and Domino's and Jimmy John's will deliver to the dorms in the middle of the night..."
College Freshman,4,"If you want to drink or smoke weed, you can find it. But it's also very easy to avoid, and there's no pressure to take part."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of nice, affordable housing options in the area"
College Freshman,4,"Turck is the best for first year housing.  Sinks in the room.  Doty pretty much sucks.  Dupre isn't the nicest, but the sense of community is huge there & many parties take place within.  After your first year, housing is great unless you get stuck with last draw and get placed in Bigelow."
College Freshman,4,"There are many great places to eat within a short walking distance.  Grand Central, Shish, Caribou Coffee, Jamba Juice, Breadsmith, Dunn Bros, Pad Thai, Italian Pie Shoppe, Khyber Pass, and St. Paul Cheese Shop are all surrounding campus.  Wish there were more late night options, but there's always Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Jimmy Johns for drunk cravings."
College Sophomore,2,"Small school small parties same people. Eventually get bored and tired (me, at least). First years tend to be a little crazy and try to be all hardcore. Some gatherkngs may be more exclusive than others, say athlete parties but if you don't mind the cross contamination inthise circles, go for it. But really, it's a small, small school. I suggestyou make some friends off campus or at the U who can get access into frat parties and the like if you're into that."
College Freshman,2,"Minnesota winters suck! But a warm coat makes all the difference…the longest walk to class (across campus) is 7 minutes. If you dress for it, you'll be fine."
College Junior,2,The athletics program is really building and really great but only other athletes go to games and support each other. 
College Junior,2,"Our cafeteria is too small for how many people eat at the prime meal times. Also, the food is good but so unhealthy. I lost 15 pounds just from not eating at the cafeteria (even when i was eating very healthy options there!). "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most drug use is smoking pot.  Things are hardly enforced and when they are, you don't get in much trouble."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is pretty difficult to find and there are lots of problems with cars being towed during the winter snowplowing months.
College Sophomore,2,The underclassmen dorms are horrible but at least the RAs are nice.
College Sophomore,2,"Cold and Humid – MN is known to be the coldest state in the US. It snows ALL the time, and we end up having to cancel a few classes here and there."
College Sophomore,2,"Point of Bonding – The weather sucks from November to March/April, but when there's remotely decent weather, Mac kids make the most of it. Plus, the campus is so small and most of the dorms are connected, so you don't have to spend too much time outside if you don't want to."
College Freshman,2,"Cold, but Not Horrible – It is really cold here and snows a ton, but it doesn't inhibit the social scene.  Also, dorms are close to campus and campus is small, so its not that big of a deal."
College Senior,2,"Can Be a Buzzkill, If You're Not Careful – RAs tend to only care about one thing: noise.  If you're being loud, they will come and bust you, and then write you up for drinking/smoking/whatever it is that you're doing.  Consequences are pretty light until it happens multiple times.  The police on the other hand have been cracking down on off-campus parties.  I know students that have been fined for noise violations and having underage drinking in their homes.  Just watch where you go and be a good neighbor, and it shouldn't ever be a problem."
College Senior,2,"I do applaud the campus dining for having vegan options.  What frustrated me a bit was the insistence that ""taking too much"" would induce waste.  Oftentimes they would give you less than a cup of pasta and you'd have to come back multiple times to get a full helping of it.  If pasta was the only thing you liked that day, it would take a very long time to get fed and if you needed to get in, eat, and get out you might not really end up full."
College Senior,2,"No Strong Opinions Either Way. If you have any kind of mental health or medical issue that might require you to miss more than two classes per semester, don't expect a lot of understanding.  Courses are interesting (in some cases) but few were life-changing or particularly exciting for me personally."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is not the best at Mac since there is not availability of parking spaces unless you want to walk 10 minutes from the dorms to the Janet Wallace parking. It doesn't affect much of the students because it is strongly encouraged that students not bring cars and the public transportation is pretty reliable.
Alum,1,"I did not take any classes online.  When the tuition is over $50,000 a year I feel on line classes would be a waste."
Alum,1,"Students are allowed to believe one way.  Must be liberal Democrat, any other opinions or beliefs are not tolerated."
Alum,1,I did not take any courses online. I was class of ‘77;I don’t think it was an option back then. I don’t like online learning.
Niche User,1,Literally transphobic. I was shunned and gawked at. Housing options for trans and gender non-conforming people are next to nonexistent. I would rather go to school in hell.
Niche User,1,"n/a-didn't take any online classes, left before I even had the chance because Macalester just is horrible."
College Freshman,1,Minnesota weather is not for the weak! DO NOT come here if you cannot handle the cold!
College Freshman,1,"I'm from California and am not used to this... just going outside hurts and they don't cancel classes for weather. I'm told that this year was unusually bad though, so it's definitely manageable if you're okay with being inside all the time."
College Senior,1,"The day I discovered my mortality was less disappointing than my overall ""college experience!"""
College Senior,1,"Leaving Minnesota ASAP! I never grew up with winter. Not a real winter, anyway (just a grey, chilly mess and occasional snow/city shutdown in Washington DC). So I really had no concept of what the winter would be like here, and figured it would be like an extended version of what I'd already experienced. I was wrong. 

The winter is miserable here. There's just no other way to put it. It's just so long, and SO much colder than I ever thought it could be... To be fair, the transitional seasons before and after the winter are beautiful. It's just too bad that unless you live in the Twin Cities over the summer, you only experience a month or two of that beautiful weather, at best."
College Senior,1,"Not So Great. Most Macalester parties are broken up by midnight and honestly don't get very exciting.  People drink, they get sick, and that's about it.  Many students (including students who enjoy partying) complain that Macalester parties are not so great especially students who are under 21.  There are night clubs in Saint Paul/Minneapolis but I can't say I have much experience with those."
College Senior,1,"Didn't Like It. Dupre wasn't great.  The building is old and the floors are stained.  RAs don't really have the authority to do anything about noise, drama, alcoholism, bullying, or anything else.  The school staff (including deans) don't do much about these issues either.  The policies in effect don't really allow anyone to do much of anything about bullying.  Dorm life was very cliquey and it was hard to get much sleep with the noise.  Macalester also has a ""gender house"" in Kirk designed for students wishing to explore issues of gender and sexuality.  It is a joke.  Most of the kids who applied for it the first year were rising sophomores who just wanted an excuse to live in upperclassmen dorms and drink without getting caught by RAs.  Frequently both toilets would have vomit on them so there would be no real way to go to the bathroom until a janitor arrived.  Complaints about this did nothing to help the situation.  It was loud enough to be a super bowl night at two a.m. on weeknights and was fairly ridiculous.  I have also heard that the Veggie Co-Op is incredibly cliquey and is kind of the closest thing we have to a sorority or a fraternity.  Most people living there aren't actually even vegetarians or vegans, but are simply living there to be closer to friends and not have to be on the meal plan.  For the most part, Kirk is alright but it is unfortunate to live in if you have a single because you won't have access to lounge space unless you have gracious friends willing to invite you over."
College Senior,1,"Who Drives? Most people don't drive. If you do, there are stories about getting fake parking tickets by Macalester security, which you don't have to really pay. There's not much parking though, which encourages students not to drive."

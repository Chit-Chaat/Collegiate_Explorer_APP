Alum,5,I loved my time at Albright College. The classes are challenging but the faculty are always there for the students if they need help. Albright is a fun school where you will meet friends that you will have for a lifetime. I am so glad that I picked Albright!
Freshman,5,even though i haven't started school yet with the world in pandemic I've felt nothing but warmth and happiness from the school and i know without a douth I'm getting ready to experience the best 4 years of my life. they have encourage us to mingle with other incoming freshmen students and as a result ive meet an amazing community.
Alum,5,My professors were so helpful with the switch to online learning and helped us succeed. I was fortunate to have classes that did not require studio hours but the professors' work with all classes was great. Everyone stepped up and made sure we would graduate and held programs virtually for all students to continue learning.
Alum,5,Some of my best experiences were at Albright College. The professors are fantastic and I enjoyed being given a well-rounded education that encompassed subjects outside of my majors. I also had opportunities like studying abroad and conducting my own research as well as creating some of the strongest relationships and friendships I have ever had. Albright is a home away from home.
Senior,5,The student professional studies program is a blessing. The professors are great at providing all the information you need to learn and are flexible.
Junior,5,"I am continually impressed with the sense of community and strong relationships that people can make while at Albright. At Albright the community matters and it is shown through both its small campus size and, in turn, small class sizes."
Freshman,5,"Im a freshman, however, the other students have been very helpful. The office staff is amazing. I am unable to think of any one thing I would like changed regarding my school."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with Albright College has been a good one so far. The professors are very committed to making sure their students receive exactly what they need so that they can flourish in classroom settings. The college has plenty of resources that give students the opportunity to strengthen themselves academically. The freshman dorms are as expected, typical dorm styles with a shared bathroom for the entire floor. The cafe food is not that great, but it has it's good days. Albright has plenty of different ways for students to excel. The only downfall about this school is it is extremely expensive for out of state students. It is very hard for students to find grants and scholarships, if the school was more affordable then it would be so much better."
Niche User,5,"Im going to be an incoming freshman and have done shadow days and tours, as well as accepted students day and feel in love with the campus, the teachers, and the students. everyone is so nice and open to helping you with anything you need."
Niche User,5,i loved albright's campus and the way everyone there just vibes with each other. it is an atmosphere where anyone can succeed and have fun if they allow themselves to do so.
Freshman,5,"Albright College is a place of community. The small school atmosphere is amazing, all of the professors know who you are opposed to big state schools. The professors care about your learning abilities and the college offers many amenities at no extra cost to the student. Its a win win!"
Freshman,5,"Albright College is a home away from home. With this school, I am able to fully thrive and be around people who are not detrimental to my health. I love my job, and I love my professors. My professors challenge me, but in the best possible way."
Sophomore,5,"Albright is an excellent school for academics, athletics and student life.  The teachers really care how you do in your classes and take a lot of time to ensure you are successful.   As a current athlete I have a coach that treats the team as family and supports all of us.  He stresses academics and encourages all of the team to have their priorities in order.  Albright is the best decision I could have made for a college."
Freshman,5,Albright is wonderful place to be if you want a small college atmosphere. The professors are really nice and they are willing to help. The academics are challenging and I was hoping for that. Albright Albright doesn't have a lot to desire on scenery or college party life. The cafeteria food is just ok and has a lot to be desired.
Freshman,5,"I'm going to Albright in a couple days, and the people have been so helpful. I'm the first person in my family to go to college so everything is foreign. The students and teachers have been very helpful."
Freshman,5,"So far, everything about Albright College has superseded my expectations. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. The staff is kind and courteous. The professors actually care about their students. The diversity on campus is amazing. There are always events going on."
Sophomore,5,"Albright College is a very welcoming institution, it is equally ethnically diverse, the professors are accommodating and helpful. The student life is very active, there being several organizations can join casually or committed. The nearby area is convenient and peaceful."
Freshman,5,"I would Love to see a bit more diversity at Albright college, but the academics are phenomenal. The classes are very personal and every professor I had knew me and was concerned with how every student performed in their class."
Freshman,5,"Albright College, wasn't my top college for a long time while I was in high school. I already lived in Reading and wanted to part away from the city and go to a big state school. It wasn't til a few phone calls and a real visit to Albright that I grasped how great it is there. The moment you get on campus you're embraced by many smiling faces, friendly personalities and you're treated as family. The campus itself is beautifully with their signature red Adirondack chairs spread around the campus. Since being so small of college you actually get to know your teacher and they know you, it has it's perks in the long run(Recommendations). I wouldn't really change anything so far at Albright, it's great school with great people, and I fit in just well."
College Sophomore,5,Love Albright!!! Reccomend to ANYONE
College Junior,5,Love it here and the people wouldn't trade it for anything.
College Junior,5,Degrees are very important to students.
College Freshman,5,I play rugby and everyone in the college really gets into all the sports
College Freshman,5,I feel super safe ON CAMPUS. The surrounding area is not so hot so I avoid going to far if I'm not driving.
College Freshman,5,"I have not participated in any sports but the facilities available to work out or play in the gym are great. They're clean, huge and modern. All of this is included in the tuition too."
College Sophomore,5,There is no discrepancy and you're accepted no matter religion or sexual prefrences
College Junior,5,"I am a Business and Accounting Major, and I absolutely love my professors.  The professors teach like they are on the same level as the students.  They work really hard to get to know every student not just in a classroom setting but on a personal level.  Every professor is an advisor to a set number of students, and they are able to talk with their students and get to know what kind of person they are. I am going to miss all of my professors when I graduate, but they said that they will always be here for us when we need them.  Every professor teaches differently, which means different styles of tests and different amounts of course work is involved in each class.  The professors expect so much out of us as students, and they believe that we can accomplish our goals.  They are here to help us along the way and guide us in our path.  The size of the classes I take at Albright are small (20-25 students), and many of them are even smaller than that.  I believe that a smaller class is easier for the professor to teach and for the students to learn.  There are a variety of courses offered at Albright, and since it is a small school a few courses are only offered in the fall or the spring semester.  The registrar is very helpful and accommodating if you are in a special situation, and they will work with you.  All professors teach differently.  Some do an all lecture based class while others do a more project based type of a class.  It is important to find professors that teach the way you prefer and take them for future classes."
College Sophomore,5,Our health center is amazing. They even treat walk ins immediately if you don't have time to make an appointment. We are also familiarized with public safety and are encouraged to keep in contact with them if we need assistance with anything. I have personally never felt unsafe on campus and feel that our school does a good job with protecting the students.
College Sophomore,5,"The academics are the best part of this school. The classes are very helpful and the professors are knowledgeable and take an active interest in getting to know their students. The information given in the courses are extremely relevant to my field of study and I actually feel like I am learning. The class sizes are very small and inviting, about 15-30 people per class but usually no more than 20. The courses are very engaging and isn't just lecturing, they actually incorporate activities into the course to help you learn. The tuition is well worth the money."
College Sophomore,5,"I joined a sorority my freshman year and it was the best thing for me. I've met so many people and some have become my best friends.  I never thought I would join a sorority, but after attending a few activities, I just clicked with girls from Alpha Delta Pi."
College Sophomore,5,"I've enjoyed my experience at Albright College so far, I can attend Albright all four years of college because I never thought I'd enjoy college as much as I have so far. Both socially and academically."
College Junior,5,There are so many great opportunities within this school. Albright has shown me that I can be successful and be an adult working student. I can still achieve incredible feats by going back to school. Albright has let me see that I can be an asset to society.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Albright College.  The campus is friendly, staff is helpful, and education is Top Notch."
College Freshman,5,Got great grants and scholarships and I know I'm not the only one. Almost every student here gets some kind of financial aid.
College Freshman,5,"Reading is an extremely pleasant area to live in. Although it is one of the poorest cities in the east coast, there is still much to do and experience."
College Freshman,5,"This school gave me the most aid, and helped with all the questions I had. They try to give you all the aid you need and are extremely friendly/helpful."
College Sophomore,5,Professors want you to succeed more than you do!
College Freshman,5,"There are always computers available to use, whether it is the library or computer labs. Also the printing is free, which is great."
College Freshman,5,"Public safety is very close to the dorms. There aren't too far and there are emergency boxes around campus should they ever be needed. They aren't overbearing and often the appear when needed. They do make daily rounds around the campus and the dorms. They are also open 24/7, so I feel better knowing that they never close. The officers are also friendly so it's never intimidating to approach them. There isn't a lot of campus crime, however the surrounding city sometimes has incidents that bleed onto campus grounds. We are informed as soon as an incident occurs via emails and text messages."
College Sophomore,5,I never feel pressured to do anything. if i dont want to drink it is fine. I surround myself with pretty laidback people.
College Sophomore,5,I believe the academics at Albright are top notch. the professors are extremely intelligent and always patient or ready to assist. I love this college mainly because i am getting the quality that i paid for.
College Freshman,5,"I had a pretty good experience with the financial aid process, and I really could not have done it without the help of my mom. My tips are to not get overwhelmed so easily at first, take it slow and relax and I promise it should all work out for you."
College Freshman,5,since our colleges cafeteria has just recently got renovated it really is one of the high points of my college. There are so many options that are all usually delicious.  They only make food at certain times though so you have to time it right. 
College Freshman,5,"Even though my campus seems to be in a very bad area, you are still given the feeling of a very safe college environment. "
College Freshman,5,"I would say that my campus is very diverse but it seems that we do have a large majority of African American, and Asian students. We all seem to get along very well though, most students come from Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Maryland. There are a few amount of students that come from new jersey like myself."
College Sophomore,5,Honestly I think Albright is best for its FOOD (and food alone).
College Sophomore,5,"The career center is very helpful, they take you every step of the way."
College Sophomore,5,Not so sure on this one.
College Sophomore,5,"My college is very diverse, that's one of the reasons why I came to Albright. I love learning about different cultures, especially languages."
College Freshman,5,"Albright was special to me because it had majors that other schools I looked at didn't. Their traditions of puppies in the library during finals, ponding on your birthday, and ooze ball, were all unique and were memorable. The campus itself if gorgeous and everything was in such good condition. The students and faculty were so nice and it created a comforting aura."
College Freshman,5,All the campus facilities are great. Everything is in good condition and there are plenty of resources for the students. There always seems to be something going on in the campus center. There is a number of activities weekly to interest the students. As well as plenty of spaces with chairs and couches for students to hand out in.
College Junior,5,"Albright is very diverse. There are many different ethnicities here such as Saudi Arabian, Egyptian, West Indian, Indian, Chinese, Puerto Rican, Dominican, African-American, etc. The sexual orientation is diverse along with the economic backgrounds, political beliefs, and religion."
College Sophomore,5,"I go to the library all the time and the computers are great, sometime the printer malfunction."
College Freshman,5,Albright is one of the personalized school I have ever heard of. You have the room to explore your major or a variety of majors without being held back from your expected graduation time. The professors give you their all. They really want you to be confident and happy in whatever field you go into so they prepare you with their absolute best.
College Freshman,5,I myself have a car and I enjoy the student parking they offer. It's very close to my classes and I don't have problems finding a spot.
College Sophomore,5,I love Albright and would choose it time and time again. The small campus atmosphere makes you feel right at home.
College Sophomore,5,"As a future Child Life Specialist, getting an internship was difficult. But the science department really helped me in finding one at the local hospital. They really took time to help me build my own internship that I would love."
College Freshman,5,"They're strict maybe too strict for my liking. They do a lot to keep the students  and staff safe here at Albright. I remember one time I was walking to the library around 11pm and I was spotted by a public safety officer, he asked me if everything was okay. I nodded and kept going. I understand he was just doing his job, but that was creepy."
College Freshman,5,The staff his is wonderful they are always around with open arms for anything you need. If you need one on one chats just to have some one to talk to as an adult the staff is very welcoming to that.
College Freshman,5,The atmosphere is so friendly and awesome . The people here are great people and wonderful to be around.
Junior,4,"I haven't started yet, but I'm sure it will be a great learning experience. The admissions process has been quite simple, and the admission guidance staff have been extremely helpful."
Junior,4,They have an online program that benefits adults who work for a living. I will be able to finish my degree in a very short time. The had transfer agreements that allowed for all of my community college credits to transfer seemlessly.
Alum,4,"I did not take classes on-line at Albright College, but I have heard that they deliver online classes well."
Freshman,4,"i immediatley fell in love with the campus the moment i saw pictures and i knew it would be a good fir for me personally, it was beautiful and small which meant great one on one time with professors and a beautiful site for walks"
Sophomore,4,"Unfortunately my opinion is slightly biased in regards to the experience with my college,  while I have been enjoying the experience itself, there were some features of the college that were missing due to construction, the library was not accessible for the entirety of my first semester, which means its resources weren't readily accessible for me. There were alternatives that were useful such as computer labs and etc. Besides the lack of library access the professors at this university are all pleasant to be taught under, and the introduction to college life was smooth, I wasn't overwhelmed immediately and any time I felt like I was getting close to being overwhelmed I had easy access to help that would support me and show me what I can do to improve my situation. The small campus was also a bonus, it allowed me to make deeper connections and everything felt more personal, I felt like a person instead of a number. There were some issues with papers and scholarships that got resolved."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the virus near the end of my second semester at the college all of my classes were forced to be online, as a result this I had to go from normal classes to online classes suddenly which resulted in some professors being completely unprepared for the switch. This resulted in a rocky start but eventually as everything got figured out the classes smoothed out and were not impossible to do. Some professors were more welcoming and calm about the situation which helped keep many of my friends anxiety low. The schedules for assignments were clear and laid out before us allowing for very little confusion and when there were issues my professors were more than happy to lend a hand and would often go out of their way to email you first asking if you needed help."
Sophomore,4,"Albright college was a community. At Albright you not only made friends but you made new additions to your family. This small college holding a class of 30 students per room, was created on creating close bonds between your pears as well as your professors. This led to gaining a personal relationship to be able to have study partners and tutors as classmates not only sharping your skills but theirs as well. Along with this Albright students spent quaultity time with one another through different events the school would hold such as dances, arcades and movie nights. Albright was more than a learning institute but a foundation to make a new family."
Sophomore,4,"Albright is a very welcoming college as I just have transferred there this year. It is a very open campus with beautiful landscape. The classrooms are small groups of students which allows you to really connect with your teachers and peers. They also have a lot of services to help you succeed. Also, all the professors I have had so far really seem to want to help every student to make sure they pass and succeed."
Freshman,4,"Albright is a good and affordable college to attend. There are different arrangements of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The professors are great and easy to work with. The campus is small so It's simple and easy to get to class. The dorms are nice and comfortable. Everyone is friendly and welcoming towards everyone. You will have a great time here at Albright."
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with Albright College has been a very good one so far! The atmosphere and community here are one that make you feel  welcomed all the time.
Niche User,4,I visited alright during a college tour and it immediately became my first choice school i had a wonder time exploring and meeting people on the beautiful campus. I even plan on going back to do a overnight stay in February to seal my commitment.
Junior,4,I am an adult learner. I am part of an accelerated cohort and able to take the courses I need to finish my degree with Albright at a local community college near my home.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are great - willing to help, respectful of their students - but the facilities could be much better."
Junior,4,Albright is a very welcoming & friendly college community. There are always staff & students ready to help one another. Albright is very inclusive and there’s always an opportunity to a join a club/sport or go to an event!
Junior,4,"I loved the atmosphere at Albright from the very beginning. Everyone, staff and students, are welcoming and ready to help. However, my major which was computer science, was not as beneficial as it could have been because there was only one professor."
Senior,4,"I am glad I chose Albright and if given the opportunity to go back in time, I would still choose Albright. Students there are reasonably friendly and the friends I made there made it the best 3.5 years of my education. I feel exponentially grateful towards all the professors that I had and that were so willing to help me out. Overall, Albright is an average college, but my personal experience is something I greatly enjoyed and will vary from person to person."
Junior,4,"I thoroughly enjoy Albright. The professors are kind individuals and willing to help you work through issues. There are a variety of courses with interesting topics, such as a vampire course, that are available to take as either gen. eds. or electives. Also, there are numerous events that take place so there is almost always something to do on campus."
Junior,4,"Liked the small number of people in classes, which made me feel in touch with the professors. Met really good people all over campus, there were some incidents were the college changed things without a warning which created some  turmoil on campus. But the reasoning behind the change was good"
Freshman,4,Albright is a great school but there are a few things that need to be worked on. I love the professors and other administrators they have such as the counselors because they care for all of the students and they make sure they let the students know that they are there for them whenever they need it.
Sophomore,4,Albright is a great College to attend if you want a school that you feel at home while there. Everyone knows everyone cause it is small. It will definitely become your home away from home.
Freshman,4,"its okay but many students are racists and the school itself ""used to be"" racist so it makes me uncomfortable but other than that its okay"
Freshman,4,"Albright College is a four year college that helps you advance into who you were meant to be. There are a lot of options that you get to choose from and if you are not sure, you get the chance to explore your options. The diversity here is really superior because you are able to connect with different cultures and meet different people socially, physically, and economically. There is always events going on around campus that you can always experience as well as events going on in your dorms."
Freshman,4,"The professors at Albright college are very helpful, plus the class sizes are small. The campus is a very small environment surround by beautiful hills."
Senior,4,The one off putting thing about Albright is its required internship to graduate. This is assuming the average student can afford or maintain one in addition to studies.
Junior,4,"Albright has a beautiful campus scenery, which it what attracts many people. The diversity at Albright has increased, which allows people to be able to find a group of people where they feel like they belong. The food is not the best and that is something that I would like see improve."
Junior,4,"I am currently a Junior at Albright College. My experience has been great so far. The campus is beautiful and small so you see a lot of the same faces daily and get very familiar with people. Even though, I have only been here for two years, all of the Professors I've had have been great and extremely helpful. A lot of the professors I go to for help, happen to be outside of my majors department, which is nice because everyone there is willing to help and just wants to see you succeed. One thing I would like to see more of is hands on experiences within the departments. I am a Fashion Merchandising Major, and an increase in hands on experiences will be beneficial because you will gain experience first hand from the school prior to getting an internship."
Sophomore,4,"I love Albright because of how nice most of the students a faculty are. The academics are also pretty good (I'm an English, Psychology comajor, I can't really speak for the other departments)."
Freshman,4,"Before coming to Albright College I was very hesitant and it was definitely was not my first choice, but I can say now that I am enjoying my time at Albright. I am making the most of my college experience and enjoy the positive energy that Albright brings."
Freshman,4,"Albright College tries very hard to make their students feel comfortable while they're on campus. From the moment you get there, fellow students and staff members are trying to make sure your transition into college is as easy as possible. There is always something happening on campus and there is something for everyone. The dining hall food, I think, is usually pretty ok but it lacks sometimes on the weekends or during certain times of the day."
Freshman,4,Albright is a pretty good school but is very small and not around much. The food is average and could be better. For athletics we could be better but we are a division III school.
Alum,4,"with small class sizes and knowledgeable professors, I received a very good education at Albright that has prepared me to succeed."
Niche User,4,Albright College has a nice campus and the students are very friendly. I went to visit the college and my tour was very good. I liked the tour guides and thought they did a great job presenting the facilities and were not afraid to answer any questions.
Freshman,4,"The community is great, professors are very good with communication. I came here to get a better education as a first generation student, and so far I have gotten more than that. The people here are lovely and friendly, giving you a hand when you need it, and helpful with their own insight."
Sophomore,4,The education at Albright College is excellent. Albright College has a wonderful science program that prepares them for graduate school or their future career. However; the campus and area of Reading itself is not that great. The campus in general needs to be updated.
Niche User,4,"Good class selection. I love that everything is included with tuition. No need to worry about buying your books, etc."
Sophomore,4,"As an international student, I must say the cultural shock was so real but through it all, Albright made it a comfortable place for me to adapt through the International students association. Albright helped me to be outspoken and take leadership positions. I got the chance to be a resident assistant as well and I’ve learned to understand and help people all different mentalities. I would love for Albright to make more African dishes at the cafeteria."
Freshman,4,"Albright College was a great fit for me, but there were somethings I believe needs to change with school. I would like the cafeteria to have more of a variety of foods that you can choose from instead of limiting the amount of food to just grill foods and pasta everyday. Sure you have special days were the food is experimented on . I would suggest changing the the quality of food that is served. For example, you can switch the usual penne pasta with a simple lasagna from time to time. Also the classrooms need a change, the classroom models are very old and desks could use an upgrade in the Masters and Teel hall respectfully.

The positive takeaways that sold me was the help and assistance the many professors had and how much the academics really challenged me. I think it's hard to find schools that offer these standards and I am truly impressed on how the school dedicates there time to these standards."
Sophomore,4,"Albright has been lovely so far, and I'm so grateful for my time there already. I do, however, wish something could be done about food selections. What is served isn't horrible, I just wish there were more options and healthier options. I also had an issue with the cleanliness of dorms (bugs, hair in the showers, etc)."
Freshman,4,The overall feel on campus is really nice. There lots of trees and open fields. The Fashion department is great and the teachers are very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Albright College's small class sizes gives each student the ability to have a more personal connection with the professor. Without the struggle of being in giant lecture halls, Albright is able to give the one-on-one attention to of their students."
Sophomore,4,The  teachers are all super friendly and amazing at teaching their individual subjects. everything on the campus and online is easily accessible. If you  like a small campus this is the place to go.
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is great.  I believe the career center could be a little better, but my job prospects after graduation should be pretty good."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very intelligent and very knowledgeable.  They are always willing to give more time to their students if needed.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not participate on a sports team, but I have attended a lot of sporting events and students on campus support the teams."
College Sophomore,4,"Albright is a great school.  The professors are very knowledgeable and are very helpful.  Professors take the time to reach out to students and they are always willing to meet with students one on one during their office hours.  Campus life is great.  People are really friendly and there are so many clubs and activities to get involved with, as well as Greek life.  Albright is a small school but it feels like a large family.  It is a really good school and I am glad I am an Albrightian."
College Junior,4,"The career center constantly sends updates about internship and job opportunities. Professors also connect students to contacts, making it easier to get experience in a specific field. When I began working in the library, my boss listened to my career goals and helped me get transferred into the appropriate department. I highly recommend applying for an Albright Creative Research Experience (ACRE) as well, since you will be able to work more closely with professors on a specific topic that interesrs you."
College Junior,4,"This is a wonderful college for those looking for a liberal arts experience. I enjoy working with my professors and feel that every student is treated individually. Though I have issues with the inefficiency of the administration, the poor conditions of housing, and the price of the meal plans, it does appear that the college is currently working to fix at least some of these problems and future students will likely have an even better experience than I did."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus and generally do not have an issue walking around by myself. The campus is open to the community though, and there are local kids and teenagers who will steal things or damage property. Nothing significant has been done to stop these delinquents, even after they broke into a building and stole costumes the week of the play. The strip mall a block from the campus is the site of several crimes, including shootings, and I do not suggest going there at night. There have also been some fights and intruders on campus, but these are handled fairly quickly. Campus Safety is always easy to reach and there is a van that will drive students to certain locations at night so they do not have to walk alone."
College Junior,4,"Albright College has wonderful professors who try to create mentoring relationships with students. The students themselves are typically friendly and represent a wide variety of types. There are activities for every kind of person: artistic, musical, geeky, social, athletic, socially conscious, etc. I love the school and have had mostly positive experiences. The only time I had a professor (who was an adjunct) who seemed disinterested in his classes and failed to uphold the standards of the school, it was taken care of and he was not invited back the next semester. My biggest complaint would have to be that the administration is disorganized. Departments do not communicate with one another and trying to do anything outside the norm (like take extra classes every semester out skip a year) is a hassle that will have you alternatively running to the deans, president, and registrar or waiting months for a response. This inefficiency also means that buildings are not improved quickly. I moved off campus so that mice and broken plumbing would stop being an issue. However, Albright recently hired new people, including a new president, so the school is trying to ameliorate these conditions."
College Sophomore,4,never had a problem with not feeling safe on campus. at night you can always see public safety.
College Sophomore,4,They are very welcoming and friendly but walking around campus you can really tell who is apart of greek life and who is not.
College Sophomore,4,I could not picture myself anywhere else! Love it!
College Junior,4,It's fun watching our teams play and being able to play ourselves.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are good and my teachers are very diverse! I enjoyed most if not all my classes.
College Sophomore,4,Public Safety is very friendly and relatable! They know us and keep us safe
College Sophomore,4,Im planning on joining next semester! Looks like a good time
College Sophomore,4,"I am so glad I chose to attend Albright! Its great environment, beautiful campus and students keep me motivated and help me enjoy school! Could not imagine being anywhere else!"
College Sophomore,4,"Albright has taught me how to come out of my shell and not be so nervous around unfamiliar people. Though I will have a heavy debt on my shoulders when I graduate, I am eternally grateful for the experiences Albright has granted me with."
College Freshman,4,"The public safety department here is awesome. The officers will respond to calls if you have them, and there are call boxes around campus to get in contact with them as well. The officers are great people and you can hear them making there round through the dorms around midnight if you are still awake and studying. In my experience, the only people who really don't like them are the ones that get in trouble for partying the most."
College Freshman,4,"Out of the 7 professors I have had here, I have loved 6 of them and disliked 1. There are plenty of awesome professors here in every subject, but my advice would just be to not be scared about switching teachers or classes if you are very GPA conscious. Most professors here are awesome, but I do wish I had left one of them behind."
Sophomore,2,"It is a rural area that you may need to take uber all the time as there are limited public transportation, it is so expensive for college student to go there without corresponding professionalism and qualities of education. I only appreciate the biology and chemistry department as there are nice and efficient professors there. However, the other departments like Computer Science and Physics only have one to two professors in a faculty is not enough and lead to most major classes in Computer Science are always cut out. It does not worth your single penny if you want to focus on your academics except for chemistry or biology. Campus is not safe as the surrounding neighborhood have gangs. Public safety on campus is not very useful and the facilities are old. In my freshman year, my lock of the door was broken so I submitted an request to my RA to send someone to fix it. They did not send someone to fix my door lock until my laptop was stolen. I did not recommend anyone to come."
Junior,2,"I just finished my sophomore year here. Transferring out for my remaining two years. There is so much potential but they do so little. Do not go here for fashion. They do not provide much opportunities   in that major which is sad, money is going for the wrong things, not just fashion everything is outdated, Dorms terrible. Food is premade and undercooked. Public Safety does not care at all and needs will not be addressed.  greek  life has no historically black ones which is sad. dont go here if you want a real college experience. If you like High School prefect place."
Freshman,2,"Wow, this school is absolutely terrible. I am currently a freshman and I am apart of the fashion program. The professors are very backwards and have no sense of creativity at all. If you are any type of art ESPECIALLY if you are a fashion major do NOT attend this school. While I did love the culture I was able to enrich myself in, the education you are paying so much money for is NOT worth it. This school lures students in with humongous scholarships but when they have the  I currently live in Krause hall in the basement and it is absolutely disgusting, when the janitors clean the restrooms they do not actually clean they rub the dirt around and call it cleaning. The showers are also disgusting FLIES COME UP FROM THE DRAINS......FLIES!!!! While the dorm halls are absolutely disgusting the academics are just as terrible."
Junior,2,"Albright College is a private school with a lot of potentials to educate its students and offer them a great college experience, however, the debt of the school and lack of funding is reflected in every aspect of the college. The dorms are old and decaying, new dorms are fire hazards and set off fire alarms frequently, the dining hall supplies very few options and undercooked proteins, the classrooms lack markers and desks and the administration is never aware of how much the students dislike the school. The school promises to be the safest campus in Pennslyvania, however, they do not apply an action to this statement. Several incidents have plagued the school since 2015 and the administration never handles them in the desires of the students."
Freshman,2,"Albright lures people in with huge financial aid packages, but many people have their financial aid decreased after their freshman year and many scholarships have high GPA requirements (3.5 for mine) that they don't tell you about. Since you are required to live on campus Albright isn't worth the money if that's the deciding factor in choosing this school. 

You have to transfer ASAP if you don't like it here because a lot (half of mine) of the credits don't transfer to other schools, which they do on purpose because they have a high transfer rate. 

The food is terrible. I lost 10 pounds within the first two months of school because there are limited options and sometimes they run out of food.

The dorms are depressing and my neighbor dosen't have a working lock that still hasn't been fixed (there have been multiple robberies this month)

Most of the ""resources"" Albright claims to have just lead to dead ends."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, I am not fond of cinder blocks and peeling paint or broken tiles. Even if the rooms were not ugly, I could not rate housing very highly. The pipes often break or leak and it takes weeks to fix it. Their solution to one leaking pipe was to remove the ceiling tile it was leading through so that instead it just dripped directly onto students' heads. The buildings will constantly look dirty, no matter how much the cleaning crew works because of the years of grime caked into the carpet. There are mice in almost every single building and the window units break frequently. The lighting in some rooms only reaches half the room. If you live in Albright Court, be prepared for fire alarms going off at all hours because the detectors can be set off by hairspray, singed hair, and steam. This is the one part of Albright I dislike strongly. I suggest looking at one of the apartment complexes behind the school, like Autumn Park or Oak Forest because you will save money and live in a nice building."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing is pretty poor. We have had no toilet paper and no hot water some nights. In addition, it is almost never clean and always smell terribly."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly know nothing about the Greek life on campus. I know a handful of kids involved with the Greek life. It is something that I attempt to stay away from.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many parties and they aren't the best parties by far.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no greek parties and most of the parties take place at the sports houses, that's it."
College Junior,2,"I am a commuter student now (junior year) because I had bad housing experiences.  My freshman year was a disaster because of a roommate situation.  The room was a decent size,  but it was a hassle to have to share a bathroom with the whole entire hall.  The lounge would always look like a tornado went through overnight, but that was the problem of some sloppy freshmen.  The cost of housing is too expensive, and it is not worth the money.  The cost is something that I would expect if I was renting a big, well-furnished condo.  My sophomore year was even worse because my room was no bigger than a closet.  My school renovated an old building down the street a while ago, and I think they made the utility closet my room.  The building was not maintained, and I was embarrassed to bring my family and friends (from high school) over to my dorm because of the appearance.  They would show me pictures of hoe there dorms looks, and I was jealous.  I also had a cockroach problem in my room which happened three weeks before the end of the school year.  My room was far from messy, but I was told it was because of the spring weather.  The housing lady told me that every home gets bugs and cockroaches when the weather changes from winter to spring.  I was like who are you trying to kid?  The building also had rats in the basement, and there were also sightings of rats on the fourth floor.  Thank goodness I was on the third floor, but who is to say that there was no mice crawling around on me at night with the cockroaches.  I would not recommend any student to live on campus at Albright  because it is a waste of money.  Most of the time there were never anyone in the dorms they either went home for the night or they were out.  The housing process is also messed up. The funny part is that every student is required to live on-campus for at least two years unless you live within a certain distant from the school.  The one hour distance that I drive everyday is worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"The students that are loud and disrespectful don't get penalized enough by the RA staff and I've heard personally from RAs that they are told by the higher-ups to not give out many write-ups. It also depends which floor with which students you get placed with. On my floor this academic school year, out of the eight rooms total, three were consistently loud and disrespectful during the set quiet hours. My floor also lacks an RA. My advice, get a floor with an RA if you are serious about your school work and grades. There is a kitchen in only two of the dorms that actually work, the freshman dorms have kitchens but are denied access to them. In the dorms, there is no separation between social and study lounges so good luck finding a quiet place in your dorm to study. Lastly, meal plans are required while a student lives on campus and get quite expensive especially if you rarely eat at the cafeteria due to the lack of options and good, quality, healthy choices."
College Sophomore,2,"No one really cares about sports at Albright and from what I've heard and seen, not many students attend the games. I believe that the women's basketball team recently won an award which is awesome though!"
College Freshman,2,"I lived in Smith Hall, which was the oldest out of all the dorms on campus. It was usually always dirty except when the custodians cleaned. It was very difficult to share a bathroom with 28 girls. They never cleaned up after themselves. Hair, makeup, and toothpaste would be everywhere. At least one of the showers would be clogged. No one followed quiet hours especially during finals. They were constantly being loud and obnoxious. There would always be strange smells in the halls, usually from someone smoking weed. There were bugs in the showers and in the heaters. The heating never worked or only worked on one side of the hall. Having a roommate was cool at first then I didn't really like her. She left half way through the semester. The I had the whole room to myself, which was great. Some of the people in Smith were nice and friendly. The RAs were really nice. There's only six washers and dryers for the whole building to share. One or two of them would be out of order. You couldn't use bleach in the washers. The study room is big and there's a quiet room too. There's a TV in the study room. Overall still pretty expensive for not that good living conditions."
College Freshman,2,The school is lacking in many areas and the amount of money that needs to be paid by YOUR FIRST SEMESTER to register for class NEXT SEMESTER is ridiculous
College Sophomore,2,"Albright College does not offer a true college experience. The small schools is still stuck in high school as the ""cool"" clique and the ""not cool clique"" There aren't many places for in-betweeners to fit in. The school is oddly divided as a high school is where athletes stick with athletes sorority sticks with sorority and theater kids with theater kids. No one blends in. In my experience I have had only one truly intellectual teacher who cared about what he was teaching and offered challenging and appropriate course work. While other teachers showed up to class gave either few or far too many assignments , though the classes were small the teacher involvement to even bother to learn kids names was hardly there. Unless one plans to attend this school for fashion or theater you should better look else where. The living facilities are a complete and utter waste. Bathrooms were cleaned once a month and the showers did not work, unless you like burning hot water every time someone flushes a toilet. The workers must have been to busy trying to fix the millions of other problems through out the living halls. If you wanted to party you would have to pray something was going on for a crappy poorly planned some athlete is having a party unless you were lucky enough for Pi Kapp to through a party which happened maybe once a month. The students stick in groups no one is friendly enough to get involved in other things minus the occasional theater major in a sorority."
College Sophomore,2,There are parties on campus but in my opinion it is wack.
College Sophomore,2,The food lacks flavor and they dont provide enough options there's generally 4 or 5 stations with about 2 meal options
College Freshman,2,They don't offer very many scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot of variety, which kills me. However, everything is at a reasonable price and what they offer is delicious. The best place is Mama's because of their student discount and it's a block or two away from the campus."
College Freshman,2,"You have to go to the next town over (Wyomissing) in order to get out of the slum areas of Reading. Reading does have it's good parts and some nice shops, but they are closer to Wyomissing. The city is in bad shape closer to campus, but it still has places to visit and things to do. Wyomissing is a LOT safer and cleaner than Reading."
College Junior,2,They're pretty strict and they'll search your stuff. Parties get shut down pretty fast too.
College Junior,2,There's no major party life with them except for SAE. They have small houses for each sorority. Most people are involved in greek life but it's mostly a life of community service and recruiting new members. There's no hazing for the Greeks here. seems like Greeks only date other greeks. It's super lame and not worth joining though. 
College Junior,2,You really don't want to go off campus. Extremely unsafe and dirty.
College Freshman,2,"Since I have to walk from my dorm to other campus buildings the campus weather can sometimes be annoying but it is never really a problem. You kind of just have to grin and bare it, dress warm, use umbrellas, and just act smart."
College Freshman,2,"Many students openly and proudly drink on campus. What is amazing is that a pretty high number of them are underage drinkers, and even though there isn't a terribly bad drug problem students still do use them on campus. Some of the peer pressure can be a little much at times, but the mentally strong students can usually hold their own. Even though the school is very strict on their policy enforcement they cant stop young students from very poor decisions."
College Freshman,2,I hate the atmosphere! There is simply nothing to do on campus!
College Freshman,2,"I am generally unsatisfied with my current school which is why I am on this site in search for a better option. I thought that a small school would be a great option, however, as it turns out there is nothing to do here and it seems like the resources are really limited. Although there are great attempts to help students with financial aid, the school is MORBIDLY expensive for the resources and facilities that are available. it seems like I have run out of resources.

The library sucks! It is completely outdated and I love reading so it generally sucks. There is nothing interesting in the college at all but many transfer from the local community college as it appeals to them.

I am also disappointed with the students that go here. The culture of the college is very strange. There are little cliques and the girls are really mean and ""bitchy."""
College Freshman,2,I am not satisfied with the staff one bit! They never smile and seem very angry to be there. I also strongly dislike the options that  students who are vegetarian or vegan. The weekends are the worse! The food is terrible and if you don't want a salad every single weekend you have to go off campus.
College Freshman,2,There really isn't peer pressure. At least not from my experience. You just have to make the right kind of friends. I have only heard but not seen drugs. I know alcohol is extremely popular. Especially since it is a wet campus. The policy enforcement is very weak.
College Freshman,2,They claim to be attempting to improve but the staff is not diverse so they can not relate to minorities.
College Freshman,2,The food is repetitive and always have onions . Need more selections and less onions
College Junior,2,Off campus housing is somewhat pricey. There are about 3 or 4 people that rent one house. Realtors are not as responsible as they should be. The apartments are somewhat close to campus.
College Senior,2,"Students rarely ever attend games, and the spirit is not very high. Athletes are separated from other students on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Not strict at all, sometimes people party up until 3-4 AM while we try to sleep. Dorms are noisy......."
College Junior,2,"There are 7 on campus housing buildings, yet there has not been new housing for a long time at Albright. While I loved living in the freshman dorms our dorms could use some TLC along with more on campus housing for upperclassmen."
College Senior,2,"There aren't many good options. You have Oak Forest Apartments which are really nice, but they are pretty pricey. Then there is Autumn Park next door, but those are cheap and really sketchy. Spring Valley is a little farther away, but those apartments are nice. There are a lot of houses you can rent in the area, but the neighbors are awful and the landlords will never fix anything. Plus, the houses get kinda pricey."
College Freshman,2,"Albright is not as diverse as other colleges. Most students are either white or from eastern countries. Albright only has a few Hispanic students and African American students, but apart from that it's a wonderful school where we accept everyone as they are."
College Junior,2,"A few of my friends are in Sororities/Fraternities, but most of them complain about their service work and their brothers and sisters more often than not.  It's very cliquey, but they are fiercely passionate about their Greek Friends.  They raise money for charities, but I don't know which ones.  I don't think we have Greek housing on campus.  The non-Greeks often view the Greeks as loud and obnoxious."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a drug scene. People do use but it depends on who you get yourself involved with. Drinking is around just like every college, but it can be avoided. Policy is enforced pretty well if someone is caught. Everything really depends on who you choose to associate with."
Freshman,1,"Overall, I did not like attending this school. At first, I liked it, but then everything seemed to go downhill. My professors were not really helpful, I didn’t feel like they were engaged with the classes. I played a sport there, and my coach never took the time to get to know me or the other freshmen, and was only focused on the starters and winning and not including the newcomers. Not a fan of the city scene and felt unsafe at times. Overall, I was very unhappy here."
Niche User,1,"I wanted to transfer after 3 days. It felt like high school part two. Facilities, resources, networking/internship opportunities are poor. I genuinely feel as if I was not getting anything out of my time there. There was nothing to do on campus and it did not feel safe. All the doors unlocked to a specific code and people would just walk into my dorm. Associated houses and the bank across the street were robbed while I was there. It was just not worth how expensive the tuition is."
Freshman,1,"If I could go back in time and stop myself from attending Albright College I would. Housing is absolutely horrid and they are now require that everyone lives on campus all four years. They care about nothing but the money that they can shake out of you and in return no improvements are made to housing or other facilities on campus besides some cosmetic upgrades so it could look nice on tours. Teel and Masters still only uses desks from the 1950's. The food is horrible and sometimes they're dead flies in the Deli section and they only have food at certain times and if you go in between those times to eat there is only the deli, bagels and sometimes fries. I was one of the lucky ones to transfer early, the place is a trap, they get you with the large scholarship but when you see Albright for what it really is it's sometimes too late. I made some nice friends though. But still DON'T GO!!!!"
College Junior,1,horrible in every way possible!
College Sophomore,1,"Overall my experience at Albright College has been deterring. The protocol that head faculty obey by are against the students. They care way too much about how they look on tours, and the food that is supplied is by a company that also administers food to prisons, Aramark. There is one academic building on campus that contain a large mold infestation, and they would rather fund for a new library rather than funding for a correction of this danger. Tour guides are presented with examples on how to avoid things on campus that will deter student from coming and normally present aspects of the college that are small in the experience at Albright. Last, but not least. The staff at Albright is in an infinite cycle of finding new professors, because professors are fed up with this college and keep leaving as soon as they can. One professor in particular has health issues because of their office being in the academic building that has the mold infestation. With every teacher that leaves Albright is faced to hire a new professor, most barely having any teaching experience. I spent more time going to the dean discussing the teaching and grading ethics of one professor in comparison to the time I actually spent in his class. All in all, this college will present you with so much money it will be hard to refuse, but trust me it is not worth it. They increase tuition by over $2000 every year, and do not increase your financial aid. That is how they trap you. Most credits and not transferable to public universities and you are not allowed to transfer unless your ebill is paid. The registration traps you into not getting a class you need and forces you to sometimes stay a semester behind which mean no scholarship funding. This college looked great at first, but eventually led me to become ill because of both the mold, and the stress induce by financial responsibility, lack of advising from newbie professors and the everyday vomit that they consider cafe food. DO NOT GO HERE."
College Freshman,1,There are no parties other than the ones that are school affiliated.
College Freshman,1,"Ugly city, not much to do off campus and can be dangerous."
College Junior,1,Kids irresponsibly drink themselves to the point where they need to be hospitalized.
College Junior,1,"For the same amount Albright charged for an 11 by 13 foot box, I was able to rent an entire 3 story house for the same price. The dorms are just boxes that don't have any amenities to make you feel at home. The room are really only big enough for one person, but now they are trying to shove three people in one room."
College Junior,1,"I know some kids don't have the GPA to play, but they still are allowed to play."
College Sophomore,1,"I wouldn't travel around campus, a lot of kids get robbed."
College Sophomore,1,The diversity is terribly choppy and it's obvious that it's hand picked.
College Sophomore,1,"It's Insanely difficult to pass the science classes. Very demotivating. Very small selection of Professors and not only do they not curve, but they are extremely hard graders."
College Sophomore,1,"Easy to get in, but once your in you won't stay long. So don't even bother."
College Sophomore,1,Super Ghetto right outside the school.
College Sophomore,1,"I barely get any aid. The freshman class that came in after me got all there aid covered, which is annoying."
College Sophomore,1,Reading PA is a horrible City to live in if you are not living on Campus. 
College Sophomore,1,"GRADING IS HORRIBLE. DO NOT go to Albright College if you are a Science Major. It is INSANELY DIFFICULT to get good grades as a Science Major. NONE OF THE PROFESSORS CURVE  and the exams are insanely hard. If you are a arts major or business major , then this school is good for you, but if you are intending to be a science major, you can definitely look the other way."

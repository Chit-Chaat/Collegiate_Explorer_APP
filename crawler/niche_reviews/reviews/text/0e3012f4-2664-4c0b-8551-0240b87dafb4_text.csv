Freshman,5,"Every one here is so kind and the staff is wonderful! With COVID 19, the administration has really made sure to enforce the rules set for us and by the CDC."
Sophomore,5,"I attended Brenau University on campus right after I graduated high school. I cheered on the competition squad until I got pregnant with my daughter. I am now planning to go back, after having two kids, and the staff have been working with me to make it easier on me and to where I can still work as well complete my degree. It's amazing!"
Sophomore,5,"I love taking my classes online, especially since I work and have two kids. It allows me to spend time with my kids and also not have to quit my job so I can continue to provide for them"
Senior,5,"I like the diversity and the liberal arts environment. Unlike most colleges they try to incorporate the arts in most fields to expand critical thinking and creative skills. I enjoy the organizations and the various opportunities that Brenau provides. There are several opportunities to go on trips and become leaders within the community. For instance, there is a student ambassador program that allows students to represent the university in a foreign exchange program. It allows students to be be exposed to various cultures and have a new perspective on the places visited. I’ve expanded my mind and learned to step into leadership roles and I have Brenau to thank for it."
Sophomore,5,"Brenau University is a home to me. I really enjoy being part of this wonderful community. I love the diversity here! Everyone at Brenau are great! I can not explain how thankful I am to Brenau University. She (Brenau University) is a place I can be myself without any one judging me. Finally, what I love about Brenau University is that every one there are loving people and are willing to help others in need."
Sophomore,5,"Brenau have great online professors. Especially, due to this pandemic, spring semester was not a bad experience with transferring on-ground classes to online. I like that Brenau University online professors are really understanding. They do whatever they can to help you with any resources."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the professionalism of the staff at Brenau. Truly feel like everyone there was the success of students. They are quick and efficient in responding emails and getting things straightened out. My advisor is super knowledgeable and she always gets back to me at a reasonable time. I enjoy the course I take. The instructors make the courses very fun and easy to learn.
Freshman,5,The online classes are very well established. Instructors are great in communicating the assignments and are very well timely mannered.
Freshman,5,"Brenau University is great, especially if you're an online student. You can complete your pathway 100% online!"
Freshman,5,"Brenau University is a small campus and a private school in Gainesville ,Georgia. The school is full of well-minded professionals teaching young students of the campus. Along with fun activities to do on campus, your mind can be full of creativity and passion."
Junior,5,Brenau University offer more than you can ask for. I am online student because my life doesn't allow me to attend classes. Everything I need is provided right at my finger tips.
Graduate Student,5,I cannot day enough about how fabulous Brenau Univeristy truly is! Although I studied online exclusively I felt a personal connection to each and every one of my professors. The flexibility of the scheduling allowed me to complete my degree. I am so happy with my time here at Brenau that I have chosen to continue on with grad school here as well.
Sophomore,5,I am an adult student. My overall experience at Brenau University has been very good. All of my professors have been very helpful and competent. The campus is well kept and easy to get around. The food in the student area is so good and overall life at Brenau has been a absolute pleasure.
Senior,5,"I have been nothing but happy. Even though I am an online only student, I have had people helping me to become successful along the way. From Arturo the admitions coach to my success coach I have always had someone to talk to."
Sophomore,5,"I love Brenau University! The teachers are so helpful and they seem to genuinely want you to succeed. The buildings are all in walking distance for the students. Another thing I love is the programs they have for international students. The only thing that I would change, is their tuition. It is a bit high, but you definitely get a quality education."
Freshman,5,"Brenau is the perfect school for people who want to truly focus on their academics and extra-curriculular activities. The teachers only want you to succeed, and help you as much as they can to do so. Due to the fact that it is a smaller school, you will become very close with a lot of people, and get opportunities you would not normally get at bigger schools. The people you meet will become a second family and support you no matter what. There is an amazing dance and theatre program, athletics department, and academics. It is a choice I would make over and over again."
Freshman,5,What I liked about Brenau is that everyone works in a team and helps each other. They help each other and are always there for you no matter what even the teachers.
Sophomore,5,"It has been great so far, I just signed up to go here. The  faculty is super nice and wants you to actually call for help when you need it. Also will go over everything for you"
Graduate Student,5,Brenau University is an excellent educational school. At Brenau the teachers require you to be self sufficient and learn with others in the graduate school programs. It really allows you to learn independently like you would post graduation. They connect you with real world challenges.
Junior,5,This College works extra hard for their students! Excellent help support and guidance. Amazing 100% online programs. Professors and staff really care about the students. Awesome college to attend.
Junior,5,Brenau University gives me a place to call home and allowed me to become a better person because of it. Being at Brenau has allowed me to grow in my education and personal life. Brenau has amazing student services that are really focused on the students for the students.
Junior,5,"I love Brenau University because of the amazing community and the support system that you have while you’re attending the university. Professors know you, so there’s an ability to be able to create relationships that will help you succeed. You have the chance to get so many opportunities that I know would not be available when attending another university. The staff and the other students at Brenau genuinely care about each other and want each and every person to succeed. If I had to describe Brenau in one word, it would be family because no matter where you come from or what you’ve been through, there is always someone that can help you push through and support you."
Niche User,5,"At Brenau University, there are positive and negative features that every incoming student can expect to experience. The staff made me feel safe to express myself. There is a majority of white students on campus than black or international students."
Junior,5,I love that this school has a part time option for working adults. I hate that this is the last year they are offering admission into the program. I consider my self honored to be accepted.
Graduate Student,5,I just transferred over to Brenau University and from my advisor on up to the Dean of Admissions were very helpful and concerned about my well-being. This stuck out to me. The one thing that I would change is lowering the tuition costs because it’s a little high for online classes.
Graduate Student,5,"I have only enrolled at this point but I have been so impressed with the support I have been given in my preparation to go back to school after so many years.  Financial aid & degree choices alone can be overwhelming while working a full-time job.  This college is very ""in tune"" with adult online students.  I have had 3 employees contact me to encourage and guide me through the early part of the process.  I also get many emails giving me information on what is ahead.  I can only imagine what is ahead for me in this exciting journey!"
Freshman,5,My overall experience with Breanu has been great and although this is my personal experience I hope it can help someone decide on if this is the school for them. The best part is that they have been honest with me in regards to how much school would cost and about the teachers and the degree I wanted. I am also taking online classes and with that we get so much help and there is so much that they offer for us students including the rushed course where it takes on-ground students  it takes months to finish one or two classes we only have  a 7-week course program which I think is great so I recommend this school for anyone and the the advisers are so great that you forget they are a adviser and turn into a friend that just want you best interest.
Junior,5,"I will be a first time student with Brenau University however, so far my experience has being great.  My Husband graduated from Brenau a few years ago and is currently back with them to finish his graduate degree.  I guess I can say that it has being great."
Graduate Student,5,The faculty and staff of Brenau University are all top notch!!!  The online graduate programs are excellent and the professors are all very easy to talk to and willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"I attend Brenau online. I do not get much interaction with staff on campus, however, the select few times I did, I was incredibly pleased with the kindness and willingness to help. My adviser has been fantastic and always just a phone call away if I need help with anything and she is always eager and interested in what I have going on in my life. The teachers have been wonderful as well. There has been one time I had an issue turning in a paper that was due and the teacher was very understanding of my circumstances and allowed a late submission (with points docked, of course)."
Junior,5,"I go to the Augusta campus and I still feel very connected to the main campus in Gainesville. I love the support and fast communication between the students and the staff. Everyone at Brenau is very helpful and it makes the experience of being a student that much more exciting and relaxed. Also, the small classes are great because it is less intimidating. I really appreciate the relationships that are formed between students and professors."
Alum,5,Faculty have time for one on one advisory and good feed back on student questions and progress. Awesome schoool to attend. Worth the money
Senior,5,I really enjoy the homey atmosphere at Brenau. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help you out. The professor really care about you and are experts in their field by obtaining Doctorate degrees.
Freshman,5,"I have only been a student at Brenau University for a short time now. So far, the faculty and staff have been extremely helpful. I haven't been in school in quite some time. I would say at least ten years! So it is really helpful to have someone there who understands I need a little extra help when it comes to signing up for the right classes, getting financial aid, finding my actual class, etc."
Junior,5,"Brenau is a wonderful private college to attend and they have a wide range of majors to choose from. All of the office departments are extremely friendly and they won't hesitate to work with you! As a student of 2 years, I can say that I am glad I chose to attend Brenau!"
Junior,5,"Highly qualified professors. Awesome, online program that is easy to navigate which includes video conference capabilities. Also, Brenau University offers convenient satellite campus within 5 miles of my home. Additionally, Brenau provides each student with their own success coach who helps with drop/adds and they check in periodically throughout the course to makes sure you are staying on track. The success coach really cares about my experience at Brenau University and advises me every step of the way."
Junior,5,I love the continuous support not only from the administration staff but the instructors as well. Work load is not too much and complicated.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Brenau is still happening , im a freshman in school but the weeks i have been here have been awesome. Brenau is a school where I dont see myself leaving because everything here is just right for me , I get along with everyone , the professors are great and even the food is good. If i had to change something it'll have to be the party scene here. You see Brenau doesn't really have parties that much and i feel that they should because the students be needing a break and it's plenty of places where we could party.  Overall , Brenau is one of the best choices i have made and i think it'll be a good choice for you or anybody."
Junior,5,"Communication is great among professors, advisors, and success coaches!  I'm in the online program for Early Childhood Education and it has been wonderful.  Programs we use are easy to navigate and user friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the flexibility of online courses.  I am a very busy regional area manager of a home health care company, and I am able to attend classes on my time so that I can achieve my Bachelors degree.  The faculty is excellent and very available for any questions you have.  The course work is challenging and the professors are great!"
Sophomore,5,Brenau is a small school but if you look at it from a different perspective you could really enjoy it. Classroom settings are small so you are not just a number at the school. Teachers know you by your name and really get that student professor relationship that you would not get at a bigger school. I love going here and I have met tons of people I will remember for the rest of my life !
College Freshman,5,the teachers are great and everyone is friendly
College Sophomore,5,It's a great school. The professors are great the administrators are out of this world great. They literally call you to make sure that you have everything you need. They help you by showing you how to spend your money and when to save . They alert you of book deals and help you stay caught up in your classes .
College Sophomore,5,"Brenau is a great college. I was struggling so bad and had a lot of things going on in my life and my grants hadn't came through in order for me to purchase my books so these professors gave me extra work to catch up on my college and they let me go back in when I did get my books and retake test and they were there when I had tons of questions. They called , text, and emailed me to make sure I was on task . I couldn't ask for better support or professors than what I had at Brenau."
College Junior,5,"Im apart of a sorority and we love everyone. We help out when needed, while also doing the things we love."
College Junior,5,"Even thought we don't have an inter mural team, we still have lots of fun. Its been a great 2 years with Brenau and our athletics."
College Junior,5,"My classes are small and we are able to learn more. My classes are hands on. It's a small school, but I love it."
College Sophomore,5,The education program is the best in GA.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so energetic and excited, and also very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone goes above and beyond to make sure we are safe.
College Sophomore,5,It has been redone and is now so clean!
College Sophomore,5,It is the best of the best!
College Junior,5,"Brenau is an unique place where you can develop more yourself not only as a student but also as a person. It gives you so many resources to be successful in class and therefore, it prepares you for the professional field. The campus is very nice and has so much history and traditions that it takes you to another place."
College Freshman,5,The professors are very nice and often learn your name rather than look at you as a set of numbers. You are a person in their class and they do everything they can to help you.
College Freshman,5,The career services department is very helpful and nice.
College Freshman,5,Athletics are a huge part of life. Everyone knows the athletes in every sport offered on campus and school spirit is high in every sport.
College Freshman,5,The ability to have small classes like I had in high school is amazing. The professors often know you by name and are persistent in making sure you can succeed.
College Junior,5,I have only had 1 teacher that was awful.
College Junior,5,I believe it is safe.
College Junior,5,I feel like I really matter to everyone involved.
Freshman,4,"I have a couple of classes online and so far it's been alright. Sometimes the wifi acts up and cuts you off the zoom which is super frustrating. If I get put into a group, the communication is very little and the teachers get frustrated but is also very hard to communicate virtually compared to in person."
Junior,4,I love on line classes they are very flexible with busy schedules. If you are confused your professors will not hesitate to help you! They are so helpful with anything you need.
Junior,4,Brenau is a wonderful women’s college. I have met many great professors that have helped me with anything I need whether it’s school or home related. It’s a great sisterhood university. I have made wonderful friendships and relationships I will carry after college. I love the ratio between students and staff. I always feel welcome and encouraged. All the professors are very helpful. I have learned great tips and have had great experiences there. The only thing I would change is the tuition.
Senior,4,I have loved learning through Brenau University and I feel like they have done their best to prepare me for my nursing career. The staff is supportive and always available to help. I do not live on campus and attend their remote campus in Norcross so I can't speak for the campus life/activities/athletics.
Freshman,4,"Brenau University is a very peaceful school. There are no big parties on campus, which allows you to focus on your studies."
Freshman,4,"Brenau provides you with all the tools you need to be successful. Everyone at the school is very welcoming and they make you feel apart of the Brenau family. Although we pay an arm and a leg to attend, the faculty and staff do everything they can to help us achieve our goals. We are provided with nice dorm rooms, good dining hall food, and great education. There are tons of clubs to join and lots of ways to get involved on campus and meet new people."
Niche User,4,Faculty is always willing to help and open door policy is actually in effect. They take time to know you and your special needs.
Freshman,4,I love the women empowerment initiatives. The value of education is high and thus produces great classroom experiences. The professors truly love teaching and offer great opportunities for the students. The standard of living on campus is lacking and the food provided in the dining hall is lacking.
Freshman,4,"I am new to Brenau and I love it, but I feel they should have advisors and success coaches that reach out to you more and that don't get discouraged if you miss their phone call."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Brenau. Small class sizes and beautiful campus. I was a biology major and all of my science professors made it an amazing experience. I learned so much while I was there and they have all been so helpful,even a year after graduating, doing their best to help me get into graduate school."
Junior,4,"Brenau is a wonderful place to receive an education and grow your personal leadership skills. It empowers women to become strong, independent, problem-solvers, and well-rounded individuals. The technology in the classrooms is a little outdated but is generally sufficient. The professors are genuine, helpful, passionate, and care deeply about helping their students learn. However, the room and board is poor at best. There are a few newer dorms with only a few maintenance issues, but the older buildings are in disarray; even if the maintenance crew actually comes to do repairs (which is rare), their repairs do not solve the problem for long. The dining hall serves passable food, but the meats are often over- or under-cooked. In terms of academics, Brenau is a shining star, but in terms of housing and dining, it is shabby."
Freshman,4,"I was a freshman student at Brenau University. I was very unsure of the college before I went there and I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it at all. Despite it not being perfect, it’s hard to say I didn’t end up enjoying my time there. I got to meet all kinds of new people, had a very good time learning with my professors in an engaging environment that promotes success. I can’t imagine being anywhere else. Being a boy, there aren’t as many of us as there are girls, and although it seems odd at first, you get used to it and learn to be friends with all kinds of people. Overall, Brenau is an amazing place to be at."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy my experience here. Im doing well so far. The teachers for online courses are great at communication.
Freshman,4,"I really like going to school here. The people are friendly, inviting, and accepting of all. Brenau's rich history and tradition make it stand out from other colleges. The only changes I would make would be a complete restoration of the buildings, dining hall hours, food options, and amount of students. I love the small college feel the school has but would love to see the campus population grow."
Freshman,4,"Brenau University does a great job when it comes to making students feel a sisterhood wherever you go.  There is not much to do here so getting involved on campus is easy, which looks good on resumes when you graduate.  As a dry campus, there is not a party scene but we have enough fun here that we do not really need one.  If that is something you are looking for in a college Brenau is still a good school because Athens/UGA is only 30 minutes away."
Niche User,4,"Brenau is a good school for the creative. Come in with good Jesus centered morals, you can become very bored at Brenau and find yourself in a bad place. Repent of yourself and turn unto the CHRIST for forgiveness of sin."
Sophomore,4,So far I like the school and I really like that they split the semester up into mini-semesters. The teachers that I have had so far are very pleasant and they try to help students achieve their goals and get a better understanding of the material that being taught. I am taking online classes so the only time I really get to interact with other students is during class projects or on discussion questions. I've found that most of the students to be very kind. The one thing I don't care for is doing group projects. I don't like having to wait on someone else to complete an assignment.
Freshman,4,"The reason I chose Brenau is because as soon as I talked to the enrollmebr coach I knew I wanted a chance to attend. I wanted a degree from an accredited university and she made the enrollment process a breeze. From the FAFSA application to registering for classes. Once enrolles I realized aftoer only one week that my professors are quality educators and I am a fortuitous student indeed.   
I would recomend the Brenau expierence to anyone interested in higher education. The futer me deserves to be a success and I feel Brenau is going to be a platform for that woman."
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate that Brenau offers the opportunity to earn your degree fully online.  I am a young mother and at some point it felt impossible to get back into school and continue furthering my education. When I came across Brenau University, I was happy to know that I would be able to earn my Bachelor's degree all online and still take care of my child."
Junior,4,I attended the satellite campus in Augusta where I found Brenau to be a refreshing educational experience. A diverse class with varying viewpoints was a n important part of my education. It is a superb facility with quality instructors who care about the education of their students.
Sophomore,4,I am just now transfering to Brenau. They are one of a few that would take my classes from my previous school. So far all the staff have been very great they are so friendly and helpful.
Junior,4,Brenau University is a great school. The environment and the staff is really amazing and very helpful.
Junior,4,"Brenau is a very good college, it has wonderful advisers that help you choose your best course to take and great instructors."
Junior,4,I am currently taking Early Childhood Education on line. I like this program because it offers the flexibility to complete my work on my own time and I do not have to travel to the school. Breanu also has coached that call to make sure you are on track and answers any questions you may have.
Sophomore,4,"Brenau University is a very good school academically, but I find myself constantly fighting with financial aid and the accounting office for fees they just tack on to my account. It is a hassle to get in contact with them as well."
Freshman,4,I am enjoying my time here at Brenau. The professors and students are very welcoming.  However there are a few things that need to be fixed.
Senior,4,"I love the closeness of the campus. I don't always like the food choices. We may have pork and pork options, or pork and fish, and that always doesn't fit everyones diets. The professors are amazing, and care about each student."
Graduate Student,4,Brenau is a great place for any student to come continue their education. The staff is inviting and makes anyone feel welcomed. The students there are friendly and there's a strong sense of community. The education I receive is of a high standard and prepares me more than adequately in the field.
Senior,4,This is a small women college that has a great vibe. Since it is small everyone seems to know everyone making it easier to socialize. There are many event going on throughout the year to keep the students entertained. This is a very proud school that is open to change.
Niche User,4,My whole experience for this school is based off of my admittance. The advisors are really helping me throughout the process and i would love to attend the school.
Niche User,4,Breanu is a very tough college. It takes a lot of commitment and study time to really be able to do well. You need to be very committed to graduating.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small community Brenau offers for its students and the easy access to help and information.  However, it is an all girl school, and I would like to see the school grow in diversity to allow more males to become students."
Freshman,4,I CURRENTLY ATTEND BRENAU UNIVERSITY AND ARE A STUDENT ATHLETE.  I LOVE THE SMALL INTERACTION OF THE STUDENT AND THE SMALLER RATIO OF TEACHER TO STUDENT IS PERFECT
Sophomore,4,Overall a good college. Works well with students who have other commitments like young children. Allowed me to take only one or two classes at a time to work towards completing my degree. I would reccommend this college to anyone who works Monday through Friday or takes care of their kids throughout the day.
Freshman,4,"The people here are absolutely amazing. I moved to Brenau from another state and knew no one going into the school year. I very quickly made many friends and got involved on campus. The professors want to see you succeed and are there whenever you need them. The food is decent, but there's not a lot to do on or off campus."
Junior,4,I love Brenau.  It's like a big family.  It's kind of in a transitional period at the moment but they're working out the kinks.
College Freshman,4,"Everyone here is super nice and are totally friendly. For my program, classes are crazy. I'm a freshman taking 17 credit hours. My adviser is okay. The food is good, but there's not much to do."
College Freshman,4,I feel very comfortable about finding a job after college. My program has an 80% job rate and the networking is unbelievable.
College Freshman,4,The dorms had more space than most college kids make it seem like. I majorly underpacked for the amount of space I was given.
College Freshman,4,They have a very nice facility that is open to non-athletes
College Freshman,4,"I've been here for a week and have really enjoyed it. My classes don't start until next week, but orientation has been a great experience."
College Sophomore,4,I would say that the workload is pretty hectic sometimes when you have four classes and it's a struggle to get so many things due at once in. The professors are helpful though and they reach out to you if they see you falling behind. You just have to communicate.
College Junior,4,It is very safe campus. There is no much movement but whenever there is any activity going on the security staff is there
College Junior,4,Career services department is always updated and ready to help you at any time. Professors help you for the internships and are always giving advice
Recent Alumnus,4,No issues that I have run into. I think that there is a great mix and people are tolerant.
Recent Alumnus,4,I haven't seen or heard of any issues. I don't think this is an issue.
College Freshman,4,The security office does its best to keep students safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,My freshman year housing experience was great. My RA (resident assistant) was wonderful and incredibly helpful. All of my hall-mates were friendly and made my year great.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is pretty big on Brenau's campus. It's highly encouraged for everyone to go through recruitment but in no way required and you are treated no differently if you do not participate in Greek stuff.
College Freshman,4,Most of my professors are or have been a professional in my field of study.
College Freshman,4,Many alumni have gotten jobs in the entertainment and theater industries!
College Freshman,4,We are told to always be aware of our surroundings.
College Freshman,4,"I do not participate in Greek life, however, many of my friends are in sororities."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't discovered the career center yet
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors I have had so far have been helpful and really know their subjects. Class size is fine as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I having loved my experience getting into Brenau. I actually was selected to do an interview for the Nursing Program, because my GPA was on the low end and they were seeing if I would be a good fit for the program. They made me really feel like they cared and wanted me to reach my educational goals."
College Freshman,4,They have provided me with many job opportunities/job fairs
College Freshman,4,I love the administration; they are always behind me making sure i'm stress free
College Freshman,4,Athletes are rewarded on campus
College Freshman,4,"I reccomend for undergrad students: organized, professional, great customer service"
Freshman,2,"I have not enjoyed Brenau at all. It is a very feminist and liberal atmosphere. The education is great, but there is absolutely no social life and the food is awful. There is nothing to do on the weekends because everybody goes home. My sports experience there also has not been the greatest either."
Freshman,2,Brenau has the most wonderful campus with the most lovely people on it. The women are strong and powerful and the teachers drive their great enthusiasm. However it is very small and there is not much to do. The food is also hardly edible.
College Sophomore,2,I wouldn't recommend unless you live with parents.
College Freshman,2,Visitation is pretty strict. Night monitors stay in dorms until 2 am and rush guests  out.
College Senior,2,Nursing is terrible. The professors don't ever help.
College Senior,2,This is a 95% all girls school
College Senior,2,There is not anything to do in gainesville other than work
College Senior,2,"Brenau teachers just read off the power point. They don't care if you pass or fail, you're just a pay check to them."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The buildings are historical, literally. Its old and what you expect for buildings barely renovated. Definitely not worth the price. Rooms are crowded. You learn valuable life lessons being cramped in a room with strangers who you may have nothing in common with and could be racist or plain rude. Motivation to get your degree and be able to afford your own place. Being on campus allows you to be involved with campus activities, aware and never missing events which is great. Commuters struggle to be involved on campus. But the quality of the building are deplorable. Outside of the rooms and the bathroom the neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful in historic downtown Gainesville."
College Junior,2,"Minimal. No major sports teams. Luckily, though, UGA is not terribly far, so they provide an outlet for people interested in a watching major sports."
College Freshman,2,Security is sometimes no where to be found.
College Freshman,2,Not very diverse. Some international students but they only talk to each other.
College Freshman,2,"Everything shuts down at 2am. Nothing fun to do at night. No clubs, no parties, no transportation."
College Freshman,2,Lack of sports offered at the school. Most games in any sport are away.
College Freshman,2,Very boring and the girls in the same sorority just stick with each other. Also you have thousands of more dollars just to rush and then more money just to keep your spot.
College Freshman,2,The shuttle stops running at 5pm. No public transportation. So you have to have money to even get a ride in a taxi.
College Freshman,2,"Students do hard drugs, such as cocaine, in their dorms. People smoking marijuana outside and in their dorms. Students come to class under the influence too."
College Freshman,2,"Way too many non student people are on the campus at night. Workers at the school will come into your dorm without knocking. Security takes way too long to reach you. Also, some of the security men do leave campus a lot. I don't feel safe at all."
College Freshman,2,"There are no parties here, you have to drive at least an hour out of the way to get to a good party.  There are fun things to do here but those do not include partying."
College Freshman,2,"overall the food isn't awful, it's mostly the hours.  There's only really one hall.  There is a convenient eating facility know as the tea room.  The tea room has more appealing options; however the hours also kinda suck. "
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are old. Sometimes I wonder what exactly I'm paying for, because the tuition is so high but the living quality is so low.  You almost always have to have a roommate even if you're an upperclassmen. If your parents live outside a 50 mile radius of the school, or you are married, you have no other option but to stay on campus for all 4 years."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is not much diversity in the student body but the few that there are, are accepted right away. Everyone is willing to help and approach them first. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The housing is great, but if it did have a little more space it would be better. The walls are thin but the social atmosphere is excellent. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The local atmosphere is very alive, but for the elderly. There is not much for the college students except one spot. It does have small stores in the square but it is mainly for tourists."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is always a shortage of classes. You have to have a plan b, c, and maybe even d. They do not have enough faculty to offer more classes."
College Junior,2,There's not much wiggle room when it comes to campus policy. Underage drinking or drinking on campus is a definite no and there are consequences if you're caught. Ra's are friendly and helpful but will come down on you for a messy room.
College Junior,2,This school is mostly an all Womans' University.  We have 50% white and the rest is single digits.  Not a lot of diversity.
College Junior,2,"The Dorms at Brenau University are average compared to other schools. I do not believe that you get what you pay for, but it's comfortable."
College Junior,2,"The dining hall is not very popular on campus.  They do have a good variety every day, but it is not the best food. Our tearoom is very popular with the students, but it is expensive to eat there when the students run out of flex bucks to use. The food on the campus could be better"
College Junior,2,"White and Black mostly few Ethnic people but that is typical for Atlanta, wh ile I have friends from Romania, Turkey and Iran.  However, Brenau is in a small town, Gainesville, and I live near downtown Atlanta - a bigger city, so it is more diverse."
College Sophomore,2,"I normally commute in my own vehicle to and from campus. I have seen a shuttle, buses, and taxis in the area around campus but I am not sure of the cost. Most students seem to own a car or walk to where they need to go."
College Freshman,2,"I don't like the fact that we have to pay for printing on campus because of how much we already have to pay for tuition. I think we should at least have a certain amount of print credits we should be given at the beginning of each semester, and then after that you have to pay or something. I just think it's a little ridiculous. And the wireless network is kind of bad too. It's really hard to get connected sometimes, and then STAY connected. And it's also really slow a lot of the time. I think it's smart to have your own computer because at least that way you can do your work in the privacy of your own dorm room if you're living on campus instead of having to be around people if you don't want to be. And also if you have your own personal computer, you can take it to the library or something and find quiet areas to study and do work instead of having to be where all the school computers are stationed."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many guys around the campus, but there are girls from all around the world so unique relationships can be formed."
College Junior,2,A string of chain restaurants but not too many to choose from.
College Junior,2,"There is not much for students to do. As a graduate student they even charge you to use the gym. The library is subpar, there are only 5-6 computers."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't enough places to choose from, and they are usually to high for a college student."
College Freshman,2,"They are still in the process of adding sports, but don't know if they want to provide the players with scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office is not always on top of their game. Sometimes it takes awhile for them to get back to you and provide assistance.
College Junior,2,You will have to pay for all printing you do in campus unless you have a personal printer and the campus network does not work everywhere
College Senior,2,"Of course there are sorority parties, but in a honesty the best nightclubs are downtown in Atlanta."
Junior,1,"Through my personal experience with Brenau University, i felt like it is a liberal college, and that is right. It needs more Christian views than politics views. Only tigers I like is Joe Exotic’s tigers, and no not his tiger on his pants."
Junior,1,It sucks and I wish I never went to this college in the first place but I had a scholarship to this college.
Graduate Student,1,"Before beginning this program, I heard only great things about how amazing it is and how prepared and educated their students are. Since starting this program a year ago, it has been nothing short of pure insanity and uncontrolled chaos. I am thankful for the friends I have made, but I wish I went somewhere else. Overall, there is very poor communication. We were told the incorrect tuition amount, professors don't answer emails, they have poor fieldwork placements and unnecessary classes. Students ask questions and make suggestions. We might as well say nothing since our suggestions and questions are either ignored or not answered."
Freshman,1,"Brenau is a horrible school.  If I could give it zero stars I would. They made everything 10x more difficult than it should have been.  I went into a seriously bad depression my freshman year and brenau didn't help me one single bit.  because its a womens college you would think that it is very for ""women uplifting women"", but its not. the sororities are rude and the sports teams are all horrible.  
there is zero party life whats so ever so you will not get a normal college experience.
My freshman year there was a man walking around on campus with a gun, and noone was notified.  Brenau was overall a traumatic experience for myself and the friends I made there. Glad we have all transfered and are thriving."
Freshman,1,"I've never felt more alone at a university more than I did at Brenau.  The school if filled with judgemental individuals who really only care about appearances. I was abused by the schools program and have never felt more depressed than I did here. If you are in high school and thinking about attending, please listen so some of these reviews and go anywhere else."
Niche User,1,"The enrollment process with Brenau is a nightmare.  They ignored my emails for days at a time.  Almost nobody would answer a phone call.  Most of the numbers they give you are just straight to voicemail and nobody calls you back.  I spent a month and a half trying to enroll only to miss the deadline, because of a small clerical error that would have been caught in time had anyone in the process done their job.  I wanted to enroll for a second bachelor's degree, but the staff just spent two weeks arguing with me about my decision instead of processing my enrollment.  I'm sure the program is fine, IF you have all day and night to process an enrollment.  This was the most unprofessional experience in my life.  I cannot recommend this school to anyone.  They actively tried NOT to help me meet the deadline.  Thanks for wasting my time AND money that I spent on rushed transcripts that were ordered prior that somehow the University didn't get.  Amazingly incompetent."
Freshman,1,why are these colleges starting to become money hungry???? the financial aid that is not used for tuition is suppose to go to the student not in the faculties pocket!!!!!! wake up students and PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR FINANCES!!!!!!!!WAKE UP!!!!!!!
Alum,1,"I had a horrible experience at Brenau University. The school is a historically all women's college, and you can see and smell that it is. When I attended the school the buildings were ran down and outdated.  The dorms were covered with spider webs and roaches, old furniture, and it smelled really old. Some of my friends had to call their parents and report the condition of the school. There was even black mold in the buildings and when it was reported the maintenance would just come by and paint on top of it.

The institution spent all of its money on maintaining the landscape and building new sorority homes just for advertisement purposes.If you weren't a part of a sorority you basically did not matter at the school.  It is also very expensive to attend. You are better off going to your local community college."
Freshman,1,"If i could go back in time and erase Brenau from my life I would. The dorms are filled with mold and the cleaning staff barely does anything. Other than how disgusting the facilities are, the administrative board is filled with the worst people on earth, they have zero respect for students. - When I decided to go to an all girls school, I figured everyone would be very up-lifting and supportive. Not the case. The student here are rude and judgmental. Greek life is terrible.  Its a dry campus and if you do get caught, (which if you do drink its literally in your dorm room, cause that's all there is to do) they throw very harsh unreasonable punishments at you. Another thing is how the question ""so are you staying here or transferring"" is very common, basically my whole hall is transferring because of how  terrible this place is. 

Not to be this dramatic, but please DON'T CONSIDER BRENAU."
College Junior,1,The campus I attended did not have sports.
College Freshman,1,The wireless network on campus is very weak and unreliable. It often prevents online assignments from being submitted on time.
College Senior,1,The nursing instructors don't actually teach. It's mostly self learn.
College Senior,1,"It's a lot of self teaching, and if I am going to pay them $12,000 a semester then I would like to be taught. The nursing program is on academic probation because they can't get above an 80% boards pass rate. Teachers will not stay after to help you understand anything and they give a lot of busy work."
College Freshman,1,"School is terrible. It's boring, nothing to do at school or off school. No places to hangout either. It's a small town so everyone knows each other and they are nosey. Student services are always trying to get in your business, financial aid takes months to complete your paperwork. Dining Hall food is terrible and old. Buildings are old and ceilings fell on some students."
College Freshman,1,Took three months for them to finish my financial aid. I didn't have books for my first semester.
College Freshman,1,It's an all girls school. However there are some guys that go there but they are gay and are in the theater or music.
College Freshman,1,Gas stations are the nearest to you if you walk. If you drive your near McDonalds.
College Freshman,1,"Very dry and boring. The square is the only nearest shopping area which has stores that sell expensive clothing. Besides that, you are near banks, gas stations, and factories. Hardly any sports at the school. The community people are fairly nice."
College Freshman,1,"The dorm I was living in had mold in the showers and the walls. Broken windows in the halls, and the buildings had easy access for any intruder to come in. Social life is pretty dry there. Nothing to do at the school or outside of it. Also, the washing machines always have problems. Carpets are ugly dark green that needs to be cleaned. The wooden beds are also always either way too high for people or squeaking a lot."
College Freshman,1,"Other than walking and driving your own car, I am not aware of any transportation to and from the school"
College Freshman,1,You have to leave the city to experience anything fun.
College Freshman,1,They have a city shuttle but you have to call 12 hours in advance if you want it to pick you up at your dorm.  
College Freshman,1,They do not have a large selection of majors.  I am looking to transfer specifically because of this reason.
College Freshman,1,"Financial Aid sucks it always appears that everything with be taken care of;however, there are always surprise charges and fees.The calculation used to determine your shortfall is odd.After all my scholarships, grants, and loans my shortfall for one semester was 9,000"
College Freshman,1,There are no guys on campus only the sketchy people of gainesville.
College Freshman,1,I was undecided so they declared me as a liberal arts major so most of the time i feel like im taking classes i don't need.
College Freshman,1,"Our campus is a dry campus therefore, if drugs and alcohol are present they are concealed very well."
College Freshman,1,My experience thus far has been horrendous. majority of the of the classes are online even though we are required to attend class in person.The communication is awful and there are always surprise charges.
College Freshman,1,"The school is in the middle of nowhere and transportation is not provided therefore, you must find a way to make it to where ever you are going."
College Freshman,1,The technology here is sad. there are hardly any computers and the wireless never works.there are wireless access outages constantly due to various problems.you cant even get WiFi in the designated hotspots.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are no parties on campus. The campus is alcohol and drug free and there are very harsh consequences. Other than that, there are parties off-campus, mainly thrown by fraternities. They are not much fun unless you drink. So to have fun, you need to drink, in other words the nightlife is terrible. There is one bar that has a dance floor but it barely fits people."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Some of the dorms are actually far from classes and the dinning hall, when it rain, you will get wet. Going uphill and downhill, your shoes get soaked. In the winter, it is very cold. If it snows and later melts, it turns into ice."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is not many options, it closes early, there is only one dining hall, and there is not many healthy choices."
College Junior,1,"for a private school and the cost, I would rate them low."
College Junior,1,This school is set in a small town with not much going on.
College Freshman,1,This school is very expensive and you'll have to invest in many scholarships or playing a sport.
College Junior,1,"Keep Looking for Other Options – This schools admissions office is very friendly and welcoming and will do whatever it takes to get you to attend however once you are admitted the remainder of the process is not at all easy. I have had much difficulty with the Financial Aid department at this school as the staff was not only not welcoming, helpful, or friendly l, they just did not at all seem to care about the students needs, only concerned with the school being paid."
College Junior,1,Some Faculty and Staff Are Not Receptive – Some faculty and staff (ie. Financial Aid) are not very receptive or helpful.
College Junior,1,There are no schoalrships offered by the school and they don't participate in many programs because they are a private school.
College Junior,1,"A few sororities, but no fraternities or affiliates, limited Greek life"

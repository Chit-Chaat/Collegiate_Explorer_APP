Freshman,5,Though I have not taken classes online through the university the professors and counselors have been very helpful through email and even offer zoom calls for easier communication.
Freshman,5,I have been a part of the Sooner family for 6 years now because of my older brother. The campus is beautiful and the environment emulates a college town. I can't wait to start this next chapter of my life a the University of Oklahoma.
Niche User,5,"I love the layout of the website, it’s extremely easy to navigate. I’ve also watched many videos made by prior or current students and they all were very satisfied with attending OU!"
Freshman,5,I love how everywhere on campus is walking distance from the freshman dorms. All the professors have been excellent.
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful. It is large but doesn't feel huge or overwhelming. I am very impressed by the School of Music, which is my major. There seems to be a sense of community and family within the department."
Junior,5,The University of Oklahoma is one of the best colleges that I have been to. The professors are nice and helpful

Junior,5,"So far I have had such a great experience. I just started this fall semester, and every staff member I have worked with so far has been extremely helpful, personable, and has made me feel incredibly welcome and supported. I feel like I have ""arrived""."

Freshman,5,"I have not taken any online classes yet, however I have heard from friends that their professors are always there to answer any questions or set them on the right track."
Junior,5,"I took an online class this semester, and it was absolutely amazing. My professor was very specific with all of her expectations, and even made room for virtual group work. She responded to emails very quickly and made sure we all stayed on track."
Junior,5,"I love that this campus is like home. Everyone is so friendly, and every advisor/staff member in every department is outstanding and caring. They take every step to ensure students receive the education they are seeking, and that they are safe and comfortable in their environment. Housing is great, there are lots of meal options (and meal plan options), and it is so easy to get involved on campus. OU is a dream come true."
Graduate Student,5,I like that their courses are understanding when learning. It is a friendly campus with helpful employees.
Graduate Student,5,It was good to take online. If gives a person to take courses at home. It give the opportunity to study on their own time after their busy schedule.
Niche User,5,My online experience was great. It was fun and enjoyable and relatively easy with the professors being generous in their assignments.
Niche User,5,This is my first semester here and I'm a big fan of the environment and the vibe that everyone gives off. It's a really great campus.
Sophomore,5,"I personally don't absorb information very well unless it is in-person. So my online experience overall is below average, in specific to the University of Oklahoma - my online learning experience was more of the same. The professor tried the best they could to maintain class engagement, but due to COVID-19 it was just even more of a challenge."
Freshman,5,"Even though I have yet to go to OU, I have enjoyed the experiences I have had with the online learning and such."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken the classes myself, but I am glad to know that the university is doing its best to adjust to a difficult situation."
Freshman,5,Theres no better school to go to!! I feel like i got the BEST freshman experience out of any school possible.
Senior,5,The online courses are very easy to navigate through and i never have felt overwhelmed. They give you plenty of time to complete your assignments.
Senior,5,I love The University of Oklahoma especially the Human Relations classes it is very diverse. It makes you feel apart of the University with all of the things you hear on campus that is racist i never witnessed anything like that being an minority in the Human Relations Department.
Junior,5,I liked everything about the campus nice people and easy to learn classes and also very professional and protective as well ! I recommend everyone to come to OU !
Junior,5,Online classes were good easy to learn and the teachers were very flexible and w  worked very hard to help us
Freshman,5,The transition online has been smooth. Professors have been very understanding and are willing to help whenever.
Freshman,5,Nice sized university. I love the variety of classes offered and activities to do. Overall I have enjoyed my time there.
Freshman,5,"The University of Oklahoma provides many opportunities for their students including internships, study abroad programs, and more! Not only do they provide for their students academically but socially. Their Greek Life and community as a whole is very welcoming and uplifting. I already know that OU is going to be a great home for me and am excited to become more involved with the OU community."
Freshman,5,Enjoyed staying in the dorms my Freshman year. Gave me a chance to get a feel of the University. Joined Greek life and love it! Loved attending the football games and local area. I hope to get more involved in other activities on campus.
Freshman,5,"Good professors, variety of food options, emphasis on Greek life and athletics. Dorms are outdates - mold, not always properly working fire hazard preventers (sprinklers etc.). Strong academics, variety of clubs and orgs. Social and party life is not as rich, as it would in a university in a city or another state, but not horrible either. Your experience will be what you'll make of it."
Freshman,5,"I love the overall feel of the campus, it is so welcoming and everyone is so kind. From the second I stepped onto the campus, I knew that it was going to be my future home. They have so many wonderful programs to offer. Plus, they have over 250 on campus organizations, so there is something for everyone! This truly is the perfect mixture of fun and education. You will meet some of your best friends here and have a good time, while also coming out of it prepared to start your future career."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! The campus is great, very welcoming. The people are so kind and the faculty seems like they really care about our success."
Freshman,5,My first year at OU I had an easy transition from high school and being away from home. The staff and students are excepting and are able to help in any way needed. My education is taken seriously by me and staff.
Sophomore,5,Everyone I know here loves it. There's not enough words to describe how fantastic of a University this is. Get involved and time will fly by.
Junior,5,"I like the learning environment, which is full of different resources to help you succeed in any class you're having difficulties in."
Freshman,5,"I love OU! I feel like I have really been able to find my place on campus. There are hundreds of students organizations to choose from, ranging from major-specific to Lettuce Club (They meet twice a year and race to eat a head of lettuce...don't ask me...), there's something for every student."
Junior,5,"The professors care about the students, which makes it easy to succeed academically. The campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,The University of Oklahoma's campus felt like home. There was plenty of opportunity to get involved both on campus and in the community.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy attending the University of Oklahoma. The atmosphere is great, the campus is very diverse, and there are plenty of things to keep you occupied. Good restaurants and shops are located on campus corner. Game days on the University of Oklahoma campus are the best. So many walks of life all coming together to enjoy a day of football with each other. The campus is very clean and beautiful and it is easy to get around the campus. The teachers seem to care about their students and their success. The price is a little high but that is to be expected with a major university. Really no complaints."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus with passionate professors. From the lively football season to the ever changing art museum on campus, OU is diverse as it is prestigious."
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the campus life and student life. It allowed me to feel at home when I visited the college.
Freshman,5,The University of Oklahoma has some of the kindest people on their staff. I have yet to have a negative experience with any professor. They are all very passionate about what they teach. OU tries to connect students to each other in so many ways. They are always have clubs and organizations interact with students in the South Oval.
Freshman,5,"I love the University of Oklahoma. It is a big school, but not too big to where you can feel lost. There are so many things to get involved in here at the University! I always feel welcome and like I belong at OU."
Freshman,5,The University of Oklahoma makes it feel like a home away from home. The University makes you feel apart of the Sonner family no matter what degree you're pursuing.
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Oklahoma. The coursework is hard but I enjoy that its a challenge and the grades aren't just handed to you, you have to work for them. The culture is usually nice and welcoming but we have had our fair share of scandals. We are trying to grow and learn and thats what I love about OU."
Freshman,5,Choosing a college became easy for me once I visited the University of Oklahoma. I immediately fell in love and I am thrilled that this is the journey I will take on in the next 4 years.
Freshman,5,"I have not regretted my choice one bit! So many opportunities! I enjoy the large campus and the diversity of the students. There are so many different clubs and events to go to. The professors are amazing and qualified, and the food options are great as well."
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful campus. Beautiful people and friendly people. I love it. https://bold.org/scholarship/bold-org-top-friend-scholarship/#search-custom-educational-fellowship-for-you-close-deadlines https://bold.org/scholarship/bold-org-top-friend-scholarship/#search-custom-educational-fellowship-for-you-close-deadlines
Freshman,5,The University of Oklahoma is a very inclusive campus. I love how diverse each and every class is along with many great professors who really do care about you and your education.
Junior,5,"At OU, they are involved in the student's lives. They make sure to keep their students involved, and they provide them with all of the resources they need to excel."
Senior,5,"I am enrolled in their online program and its great.  The site is easy to use, 8-week courses make it easy for the full-time worker like myself to manage and whenever you have questions, an advisor is there to help."
Freshman,5,"A fantastic school academically and culturally. I have gone to this university for a semester, and it has been some of the best moments of my life. I am a major nerd and my college I went to had to have a great lab with TA's that knew what they were talking about and OU definitely has this. The labs here at OU will teach you about the subject and more. I am thrilled to be going to a school as great as OU and I am excited for the rest of the time I will spend here."
Freshman,5,I love this place!!! OU has something for everyone to feel at home when they leave for college. The campus is beyond beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"In the short year and a half that I have attended the university of Oklahoma, I have fallen in love with every inch of the campus and all of the people. I think that my favorite thing about OU is that there is something for everyone. There is greek life for everyone, including sororities and fraternities for men and women of color, men and women in STEM, men and women of religion and so many more. There are also clubs that are geared towards women in service, young democrats and young republicans, and so many more. No matter where you are on campus, there is always a place for you. If I could change something about the university, however it would be in regards to the way that mental health is addressed."
Niche User,5,"I have been on multiple tours around the campus and it is beautiful. Even though I do not go there, I still know a lot of people that do and they love it."
Freshman,4,Even in the middle of a pandemic the school has done a very good job at protecting the student population and also ensuring that student are helped properly during these trying times.
Freshman,4,The online experience has for the most part worked very well. There has been some issues with the zoom classes but that ultimately comes down to how well the professors are with tech
Sophomore,4,The professors have been very understanding and there for any issues the students have. I am not really a online learner so it has been very difficult but my teachers try to make it as interesting as possible.
Sophomore,4,It is full of very friendly and diverse people who are there to not only advance their education but also to make endless memories.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Oklahoma tried its best to adapt to COVID-19 towards the middle of the Spring 2020 semester. OU students are offered free Zoom accounts with licensed benefits. The Professors tried their best to switch their classes to online classes and most of them were able to successfully transition. There were inevitable hiccups, but online classes were satisfactory."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are very good. Classes are taken seriously, and the work load is challenging, but not overbearing. Diversity is moderate, being made up of 60% white, but there is enough diversity on campus for me to meet all kinds of different people with different backgrounds. OU's athletics, particularly football, is among the top in the nation, and we take big pride in being part of the Big 12. The professors are excellent in teaching their subjects, and communicate to the students in a very professional manner. The life on campus is also very enjoyable. While the campus is a very large one, there are various facilities and restaurants all available for students to enjoy."
Sophomore,4,"OU handled its transition to online learning very well. Classes were still held during regular class times, and the college gave students the option to pass/fail their classes to compensate for the sudden shift in learning environments."
Niche User,4,"I took one online course over winter break and it was quick and easy, total joke. I remember the professor not being very involved and putting in minimal effort for an A"
Junior,4,"Most of my professors did well transitioning to online class, but with lectures and discussions it was hard to replicate the in person experience.d"
Junior,4,"Overall good place to get an education. Some issues of corruption at the higher level, but in the International Studies college the professors really seem to care about us as people and not just dollar signs. Football games are fun on the weekends too!"
Sophomore,4,"OU's transition online was really smooth, most professors were willing to slow down and be as helpful as possible. Professors at the University are great online and in-person."
Sophomore,4,OU is an all-around amazing school! Despite the lack of diversity which usually leads to racial indiscretions the professors and fellow students are usually considered with the safety and well being of others. Professors care about your activism and are very understand with online and in-person classes!
Sophomore,4,Learning experience is great at the University of Oklahoma. Professors are lenient and will help if you reach out to them and show them that you really care about the class even though you're struggling.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at the University of Oklahoma. It's very diverse and you get to meet people that come from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and it's very refreshing. The University of Oklahoma not only provides great academic resources, but also many organizations to help people find their place in such a big campus."
Sophomore,4,"When I first arrived on OU's campus the first thing I realized was how much I stood out.  There were no faces that looked like mine for at least 3 days, that is until I was approached by an upperclassman who knew the ""fish out of water"" feelings I was experiencing. Soon after, I was connected with some community,  resources, and got the chance to see the University in most of its glory, outside of the continuous racist acts that occur frequently - the University of Oklahoma has the tools needed to be the best University it can be."
Freshman,4,My freshman year was pretty good. My roommate and I have been friends since middle school so we don’t  have any roommate horror stories but one of our suitemates was so annoying. I got lucky with my floor in the dorms because we all became friends. The dining halls aren’t bad like other universities which is great. Professors are nice and have a lot of office hours if you need them. Walking to class everyday was nice and relaxing since since campus isn’t so big and seeing all the building and flowers bloom is a nice touch.
Junior,4,I love OU and think it is an amazing campus with great professors and resources. The campus really does have everything you need and is a place to thrive. The only thing that sucks is tuition is very high. I live in-state and I received no financial aid.
Junior,4,My learning experience has been great! The only thing I have trouble with is when professors rely primarily on the book for teaching information. Other than that I have received amazing learning resources through the DRC that have helped me tremendously and I really have enjoyed and valued my learning experiences so far.
Sophomore,4,"The biggest school of the state in a small-town setting. Academics are pretty good: a lot of degrees offered and good professors. Very pretty campus. A whole lot of student life goes around greek so that's something to consider, too."
Sophomore,4,"It has a good atmosphere, it's a little far from where I live buy it's the closest 4 year college near me."
Freshman,4,The community is strong. OU has great football and overall a beautiful campus aesthetic. I have met some of the friendliest people in Norman and there are so many resources available to each and every student.
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Oklahoma, the atmosphere, the professors, the students, and so much more! There is so much school spirit and a very family like atmosphere. As well as the professors for the most part are always willing to go above and beyond for students. One change I would like to see is more diversity  and no more incidents of racial discrimination, although I do feel that they have done a good job at providing diversity classes to ALL students."
Niche User,4,My favorite part of the university is the campus. The way it is arranged to make getting from class to class functional as well as just the appearance of some of the older buildings looks amazing.
Freshman,4,One thing I love about The University of Oklahoma is how diverse and inclusive it is. It truly does feel like home away from home. One thing I would change is the on campus living for freshman. But other than that it is perfect.
Freshman,4,"It is quite an experience being In the University of Oklahoma. In my first semester, I've already met some amazing professors, and they even inspired me to continue on my academic journey through college. Currently, in my second semester, things have been getting crazy with the new virus and how to prevent the illness from spreading, but it has been an excellent experience meeting new people, getting to learn new things that you wouldn't think of learning.  So OU is a fantastic place to be, in my opinion, friendly people, professors that care about your success, and the atmosphere is just something to behold, in my opinion."
Senior,4,"I love the job opportunities that the university provides. The programs for job placement are consistently updated. The only thing I wish to see change is our university parking. The parking passes are $250 and they sell more than what their parking spaces can hold so its almost impossible to find a parking spot. The IBC program I did with OU was an amazing experience, my group and I started a company through OU and all of our proceeds went to the boys and girls club of Norman. The money we donated allowed the children to be feed for months on end and also allowed them to get new equipment for outdoor games."
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman here at the University of Oklahoma and for the most part I love it here. Most teachers are very friendly and willing to work around your schedule to help you succeed. Pricing is not too bad either, but the housing and food prices will drive up your cost for your first year dramatically. Tuition though with fees is very cheap for the quality of education. The only reason I am really giving it 4 stars is because there are always parties which leads to loud hall mates late at night. Also the Norman area is okay, but beware of campus corner as that is where the most crime in Norman is."
Graduate Student,4,"Good school. Beautiful campus. There’s gardens, statues, bell towers,  and fountains everywhere. Campus corner gas all the shopping and food you need."
Senior,4,"There is an amazing balance of academics and fun at OU. It has such a quaint college town feel, and the campus itself is stunning with intricate architecture. The sports are absolutely amazing, as OU takes football, baseball, gymnastics, and softball very seriously. The academics are also superb and professors and other students are so willing to help. 

If you are looking for a crazy party school however, this is not the one for you."
Freshman,4,I love my experience here because I've always dreamed of attending this University. The price is somewhat expensive but there is so much to offer here and the people are great. I meet new people every day and it feels like I've known them for years. I'm not in greek life but I think joining a frat would make the experience 5 stars.
Graduate Student,4,It’s got great environment and atmosphere. The people are friendly for the most part and I love the life on and off the campus
Sophomore,4,"I am a nursing major, in Alpha Phi, on the cheer team and working at Starbucks. This school is an amazing and inclusive atmosphere where I feel I can succeed and accomplish a lot with help easily available."
Niche User,4,Went to tour the campus and it was very fascinating! Saw many cool events around the school and many different people from all ages and backgrounds.
Niche User,4,I really like the people at the University of Oklahoma. Everyone there seems to actually want to see the best in you and the campus on Norman is actually beautiful
Sophomore,4,"I loved Camp Crimson, and how they try to include everyone. the teachers are very helpful and want to see you succeed. I'd like to see the school become more diverse."
Sophomore,4,"The university is physically gorgeous, the atmosphere welcoming, and the professors more personal than I could've expected from such a largely populated campus. You're constantly approached, emailed and informed about departments, research opportunities, and clubs from students and professors alike. My only grievance is that I wish I had been more informed on financial aid."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the University of Oklahoma so far has been what I thought it would be in ways and in other ways another learning curb. The atmosphere on campus is as good as it gets with the student life and the countless number of clubs that one could join. Onto the academics is what I expected it to be as well. It has its ups and downs as a student with the work from classes. Though it has its challenges, when you get the grade you wanted it makes the moment better because of the challenges being overcame."
Freshman,4,"As Colorado resident, moving out of sight of the mountains was a big change. But OU quickly became my new home because I felt free to pursue my dreams and highly invigorated by the classes offered. Home sickness was hard, but the quality of learning made up for it."
Graduate Student,4,Overall I had a wonderful experience! Professors were very knowledgeable about the Social Work masters program. The students were pleasant. Age range in the classes I took was approximately 25-55. This was nice because each of us had diverse experiences to bring to the table.
Freshman,4,"I’d like to see the cultural diversity improve, I’d like to feel more included in events as a minority. The overall experience has been great other than the lack of inclusion in events pertaining to minorities."
Sophomore,4,"There are good resources (from staff) to help one achieve your goals.  People are helpful and friendly.  Facilities and grounds could use some upgrading and beautification.  Overall, attending school has been a good experience and I've made many good friends over the past year and a half."
Sophomore,4,The campus life is great. The people are nice and passionate. The teachers care. The students are excited. People are always their to help. This semester was a little rough for me. My grades took a turn and I wanted to give up. I met with advisors and counselors and they helped me out so much. They told me not to give up and do my best. Without these resources available I don’t know where I would be at this point in the semester. They were such a great help and I am truly grateful to say that I am a student at the university of Oklahoma. I can’t wait to continue my academics at ou
Freshman,4,"The University of Oklahoma has a welcoming staff, a beautiful campus and amazing learning and job opportunities."
Freshman,4,The people are really nice and most of the teachers are really good! Make sure to read fine prints though.
Niche User,4,"The University of Oklahoma has a very beautiful campus which you can see anywhere on campus. I love going out and just riding the Lime scooters around the campus and stadium. There's a place called ""campus corner"" that's right in front of the campus and its a great hangout spot."
Freshman,4,"Even though I am brand new to this school, I have fallen in love with it. The campus is beautiful, the people are great, and there are so many ways to get involved on campus. The reasons behind the deduction of one star are the quality of dorms, and the lack in options of healthy food. The dorms are filled with mold, and the University is aware of this, but they do not take steps toward fixing it. Then for the food situation, there are a very few healthy options but none are very fresh or enticing to eat."
Freshman,4,The University of Oklahoma surprised me; it is actually a really great school. I would advise taking honors courses if you like an academic challenge because many of the courses can overly easy. The food is awesome!
Freshman,4,"University of Oklahoma is a public college, where the admission chances based on an overall GED above-average performance are very high. In terms of classes, the university offers a wide variety of courses. As a freshman, classes are relatively easy. Professors are generally responsive to student requests in terms of classwork, given that they offer frequent office hours. Besides that, all my professors have responsibly answered all my e-mails so far. However, due to the number of students at OU, it might take some time for them to answer. 
Besides that, the university offers on-campus jobs for international students, with the possibility of major-related career advancement. US Residents can also work off-campus. The jobs are relatively well-paid. However, due to the great number of campus students, it might take a while for the HR Office to get back with an answer, and you are not guaranteed to be offered a major-related job right-away (especially as a freshman)."
Freshman,4,"In my time at OU I've Enjoyed my time. There's always something going on, around the campus, so there's never a dull moment. Something I would like to see change is the accessibility to  health services, and medications."
Freshman,4,My first semester at OU was really good many of the professor help me when I had a question. OU is also a University that gives their students the opportunity to get involve in many activities they have different organizations where you can join and do fun activities. I feel like OU is a great place and I wouldn't change anything.
Graduate Student,4,I have enjoyed my time at the University of Oklahoma. The staff is understanding for the most part. I have found that  Communication at times is lacking.
Sophomore,4,I felt very welcomed at this school. Most of the people are nice but you have to be very pushy to get people to do things you need them to do like set up a meeting. Other than that the campus is great there are helpful advisors and teachers who truly want you to succeed
Niche User,4,The campus felt like a small campus when on it. The city around it was very neat and it felt like home. The people were very engaging and energetic. The inclusion made me feel wanted.
Junior,4,"There are a lot of things that I don't like about the University. Namely the culture and the atmosphere. It weird how people treat you there. People are nice to you if you look good but don't acknowledge you if you don't. I don't know, bothers me. There are a lot of good things though, we have good programs like our medical program and we excel in many sports namely football and gymnastics among others. Overall, I will likely benefit from my degree here but I feel a bit uncomfortable when I am on campus."
Sophomore,4,There are a wide variety of activities available on campus and an overall good diversity experience. Classes are challenging enough to keep students engaged while various amenities around the school keep students entertained.
Senior,4,"The University of Oklahoma offers the state's best education on a wide variety of skills, fields and interests. OU's top colleges are arguably the Gallogly College of Engineering, the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, and the Jeannine Rainbolt College of Education. Students are active participants and advocates for themselves and their community. There is a feeling of unity through our common struggles unparalleled by any other school of higher ed in the state of Oklahoma."
Junior,4,"Attending OU has been a dream of mine since early on. It fulfills the best of the college experience in all areas and provides you with academic rigor, 
connection with a network of talented peers that you'll carry into your career and professional and personal life. It provides you with a great perspective on how you can affect change for future generations."
Junior,4,The best thing at the University of Oklahoma the research facilities they have there. The professors are more than willing to have undergraduate students conduct research with them. The research facilities are state of the art with advanced machines to conduct the research. The campus is also ascetically pleasing with landscaping and traditional architecture.
Junior,4,"The University of Oklahoma is home to a diverse realm of students.  The curriculum is challenging, there's a lot of activities and organizations to be involved in.  Some of the most rewarding experiences of my life have come during my time here at OU."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my experience for the most part. Always very pretty and lively. However, Parking costs too much!"
Alum,2,"Classes were far too easy, professors were uninvested, terrible financial aid office, terrible communication, no concern for student, money hungry school not worth $30,000 a semester. Middle school is more challenging."
Niche User,2,More diverse than my high school and incredible opportunities for students club wise (everything you can think of) with amazing student tradition and school pride. However the classes are not challenging and greek life rules all. If you want to go to school with every girl you went to high school with and frat gods that think they are invincible go for it. Campus is beautiful and the food options are great but the student culture is dominantly run by greek life when the majority of students aren't even involved in greek life. Great alumni network
Alum,2,"The University of Oklahoma has a nice campus, and I was satisfied overall with my education. However, the student life is way too centered on greek life, and the diversity of student clubs and activities is poor compared with a school like UT. All of the student organizations at OU are run by Greek life members, so for students that are not in Greek life, I would not recommend it. The school is very expensive to attend out of state and there have been multiple racist incidents at the school just within the last few years. Most of the buildings are nice, but OU recently wasted millions of tuition dollars building upperclassmen dorms that there was 0 demand for, and now the university isn't renewing their lease on the buildings that they JUST built. What a waste of money!"
College Sophomore,2,It is quite an experience to live in the resident halls.  The rooms are tiny that you have to share with sometimes a stranger.  I feel as if there is not enough space in the dorm rooms and everything about the resident halls are outdated.
College Sophomore,2,There are bugs in the dorms and mold in the bathrooms
College Freshman,2,"I'm in a sorority and there is so much competition and cattiness among us and the other sororities (even frats). While nongreeks don't look down on Greeks, there is definitely a stigma if you're not Greek or if you're in a lower house. I do not believe the Greek life on campus is performing like it was created to. I wish there was less of an emphasis on Greek life here and more of an emphasis on just being friendly to each other."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, the price is way too high for what you get."
College Sophomore,2,"It's ok but they treat alcohol as if it does no harm, and you only get a citation and a little fine, but they treat the use of pot as if you are a sub human garbage who has no moral fiber"
College Sophomore,2,"All of the parties are at the greek houses. I don't party, but from what I hear they can get really out of control."
College Sophomore,2,"The school doesn't recognize independant students, so if you are your only income source OU will still make the assumption that your parents are paying more than 50% of your school costs, making getting proper aid a hassle and nearly impossible."
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of the tiny cubicle you share with another human is astronomical, rules are loosely enforced, and authority figures place blame on students causing conflict amongst peers.  I also found living here to be quite atrocious as my foreign exchange roommate was frequently threatening my life with no repercussions."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid is something that I have struggled with. My parents make too much money for me to qualify for financial aid but they have chosen not to pay for my college. I have spoken to financial aid many times and they respond with, ""there is nothing I can do for you."""
College Sophomore,2,"Fraternity parties are a frightening prospect, as many members seem incapable of resisting the urge to drink and drive. Otherwise, the party scene is nothing special."
College Freshman,2,"There are not man scholarships available for white people. If youre white, you better have really good grades because only hispanic, native american, black, etc. can get specialty scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,I have no tips just get in line and cry.
College Junior,2,My mom makes just enough to where I am not eligible for any financial aid which is frustrating. There needs to be Morris scholarship opportunities for white students and not just students of a different race.
College Junior,2,I love and hate Architecture. I feel like we spend the most money and have some of the worst facilities jjust because we don't have alumni donations.
College Sophomore,2,"If I were apart of the Greek system, I would probably say that Greek life on campus was wonderful, but since I am not, my response is negative. Although it may not be true, it definitely comes across as though students involved in Greek life have more opportunities than those who are not. The non-Greeks on campus generally see Greek students as snobby, cliquey, and spoiled."
College Junior,2,I applied for housing many months before arriving to Norman and they let me know that they didn't have a places for me one month after classes began.
College Junior,2,"Many of the individual colleges within my university have a variety of scholarships, but my college is not one of them. Furthermore, the amounts given out do not amount to much. When my tuition per year is almost $30,000, a $500 scholarship really does not help. So far, most of my tuition has been paid through loans."
College Freshman,2,OU Parking Services sucks. Tickets everywhere and appealing them just makes you feel like crap.
College Freshman,2,The dorms aren't the best and they are a bit run down. Living off campus is a better option.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life completely splits up the non-Greeks and the Greeks. The Greeks have their own life and seclude themselves from the non-Greeks. The social atmosphere is hard for non-Greeks because their are so many Greeks.
College Freshman,2,"There are so many students and too little parking spots. If you get to school a bit late, then there will be no spots and you will become really late. In the mornings are the best time to look because everyone is leaving. Finding a spot during the day is the hardest and you are always forced to park far away from where ever you are heading towards. Also at night, many people come to park after 9pm because you don't need a permit after 9pm."
College Sophomore,2,"On-campus housing is grossly overpriced. I haven't seen Headington Hall or the Honors dorms, but all the other dorms south of the South Oval are sweaty, sticky hells of mismatched personalities. I was stuck on the out-of-state floor of Walker my freshman year, and I was nearly suicidal some weeks. My roommate was the dumbest guy I've met who doesn't have an actual disability (as far as I know). I identified with nobody and was constantly kept awake by drunken animals and sports fiends. We are forced to pay exorbitant fees to enjoy the squalid, cramped corridors of Walker and Adams. You could at least employ some measure of personality matching to make people in the dorms more compatible."
Recent Alumnus,2,"always changing, very hot to very cold in hours"
College Sophomore,2,"This is the windiest, coldest place I think I will ever have to experience."
College Freshman,2,"Once again, the lack of culture and diversity appears blatantly. If it wasn't for the International students, this school would be even more white and protestant than it is now. Norman is definitely a pocket of semi-open mindedness in Oklahoma but regardless, the student body has fairly narrow ideas about the world (which to them is just OU)."
College Freshman,2,"This is without a doubt my biggest problem about the University of Oklahoma. Like I've said before, I love big cities or even medium-sized cities. I've been off campus less than 3 times because the school is everything. If you're not involved on campus in terms of drinking or partying, it's hard to find things to do. The lack of culture and possibilities of Norman have hurt my opinion of school."
College Freshman,2,It's definitely an alcohol-driven campus and no one has treated differently because I don't drink but there's no doubt that I've had to seek out more laid back friends because a good number of students drink on campus.
College Freshman,2,"This is a problem I have had, personally. I'm from Los Angeles and Dallas with a lot of family in Caracas and Madrid so big cities are home for me. The lack of culture and diversity of places to eat is disappointing. Definitely a draw back of ""college towns""."
College Freshman,2,"There really just need to be more of them, and have the non-library computers updated. The ones in the library are great, but there aren't many open in between classes for personal use. And the ones in the bottom of the dorm towers have keyboards that don't work well. Typing is a nightmare when every three or four characters you have to go back and hit the key a few more times."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of caucasian christians. But accepting for the most part, so it's not as if people are in trouble if they don't fit the mold."
College Sophomore,2,The on-campus housing is very expensive. You would be better off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Just this past year we had a snow storm and it was extremely cold and the only reason school was not cancelled was because there was a guest speaker and Boren did not want to reschedule.
College Sophomore,2,"If your parents make an above-average income, and you don't have any special qualities like being a child of an alumni or being a National Merit Scholar, the only scholarships you can qualify for are the very small Sooner Heritage Scholarships. Do not go here if you are not a resident of the state of Oklahoma because out-of-state tuition is ridiculously high, and there's nothing you can do to get your tuition lowered unless you go through the extensive process of becoming a resident."
College Freshman,2,"Oklahoma has some pretty god-awful weather. As I'm writing this, the university has delayed tomorrow's opening due to cold weather and snow. It also is right in tornado ally, just a few miles south of Moore, OK."
College Freshman,2,"I'm going to school almost entirely on loans, I may have to transfer to a cheaper school in the fall. Most scholarships are for over achievers so there's not much left for average students."
College Freshman,2,"It could be 20 degrees one day and 75 degrees the next, you just have to learn to adapt. The winters can be brutal, but I can only imagine that it's much worse up north."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough parking for the amount of students that go here, and there is too much faculty parking and ticketing is outrageous and very strict."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking sucks. There are never enough spaces (unless you get there extremely early) and the permits cost $200, which is totally ridiculous in my opinion. "
College Student,2,"As an out of state student at the University of Oklahoma, the second child in college, and living with one parent, I expected to have more financial aid that what I have received."
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little strictly merit-based financial aid, and my income bracket is largely overlooked."
College Sophomore,2,I bus to campus instead of driving because parking passes are so expensive and good spots are very hard to find. Sometimes the parking signage is a little unclear and I'm worried that I'll get a ticket even late at night or far from campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Permits are expensive, there is hardly any parking, ticket prices are high. "
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking is a huge problem on my campus. However, other drugs not so much. "
College Sophomore,2,The campus dorms are pretty terrible. They were built in 1965 and have had little renovation. They are small and have subpar connectivity to the campus wifi. Also the RA staff is not the friendliest.
College Freshman,2,The cost for a parking permit is ridiculous and if you do purchase one then finding a parking spot on campus during the day is near impossible. We are not allowed to park anywhere off-campus and leave our vehicle there unless you live in an apartment complex and leave it there in that parking lot. The walk from most of the parking lots is about 10 minutes from most of the buildings unless you are a professor.
College Freshman,2,"Being in the top 10% of my class, I expected I would receive more financial aid from the school than I actually did. Unless you are an international student or a national merit scholar, I wouldn't expect too much financial aid from the school."
College Freshman,2,"Parking could definitely be improved. I feel like OU has put a lot of money into other things such as athletics. This is great for the athletic program, but parking is weak in many areas on campus. Also, the parking service employees act as if they work for the FBI. They are very strict with ticketing and towing."
College Junior,2,I'm currently fighting for financial aid in order to stay in school. 
College Junior,2,"Business and Engineering get ample opportunity and resources, arts and science are put by the way side.  "
College Junior,2,"there is no application process, it's just a matter of declaring a major. "
College Junior,2,You basically have to have a car to get anywhere here but there's no place to park. 
College Sophomore,2,There is a pretty good variety of food choices but there could be better student discounts 
College Sophomore,2,There is a decent amount of diversity on campus. We have a large international student population and a pretty large LGBTQ community. There could be more diversity on political beliefs. 
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of transportation options but I do not use it often because it is somewhat confusing. 
College Sophomore,2,We have a great three strike policy that is enforced pretty well but many students still participate in drug and alcohol consumption. 
College Sophomore,2,The school has stricken guidelines for parking on campus that seem too stringent . It's difficult to find parking spaces sometimes and tickets are given out a lot. It's also strict rules about where you can eat based on where you live and that makes little sense to me. I stayed in the athletic for my Freshman year and my meal card would only let me eat there when other dorms could eat at all the campus restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is okay but it's more for hanging out and partying with a certain group. It's really now necessary to enjoy yourself and find a compatible group.
Alum,1,"The online learning experience due to COVID-19 was completely awful. I should have enrolled in my second grade cousin's online courses, those were far more challenging than OU. Terrible school."
Freshman,1,it sucked and i could not be productive because my professors sucked at zoom but lets be honest they were trying their best
Niche User,1,It SUCKS it is the wort collage ever the education is terrible and it was the wort experience of my life do not go here
Niche User,1,"Was on hold for 20 minutes with financial aid, only for them to hang up. So I had to walk 2 miles with a high risk pregnancy and a toddler to get any information, information they couldn't even give. Terrible management shows me it's a terrible university."
Junior,1,Please plan on rushing if you come here otherwise you will have no life. This is a southern greek school not much different from Alabama and Ole Miss the administration tries to sell the school as something else. If you manage to join a good house this school will he enjoyable otherwise look elsewhere for your own sake
Freshman,1,"The University of Oklahoma is a very mediocre university. I came on academic scholarship and highly regret it. The average population struggles with academics and the large scholarships they give to students with high ACT scores and GPAs, and especially to National Merit Students, are handed out to attempt to make the school look better that it is. Coming here for the money is one of the worst decisions I have made and paying more and taking on debt to go to one of the many better universities I was offered admission to was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Along with the mediocre academics, the social scene is also mediocre. Because school is not taxing, I often go out with my friends and there is no form of intellect when out at night. The university party scene is one of getting belligerently drunk and in a means that is not any fun and living in the dorms is like living with a parent watching over your shoulder. If you are smart and have the ability to go elsewhere, do so."
Sophomore,1,"Pretty terrible school in general. Buildings on campus are pretty but the campus as a whole is not that great. Greek life is very prevalent on campus and most parties are greek. Parking is atrocious and so are the permit prices. Many people in greek life seem snobby and pretentious and give off a high school clique vibe. Night life is very concentrated and minimal in the area and surrounding area is quite sad. City of Norman itself is pretty boring. Disappointing college town in general, especially compared to A&M/UT or other college towns. Academics are mediocre. Not much diversity and 90% of students are either from OK or TX so they all kinda seem the same. Dorms are similar to a prison. Food is alright though. "
College Senior,1,"I have not enjoyed my time at OU. The classes and professors have been incredibly disappointing. The workload for upper division classes is absolutely astronomical. I cant imagine a more stressful environment than the environment in class at OU. Administration does not care about you, you do not matter as an individual, and if you don't play football or basketball then your voice is not heard. OU has been nearly worthless."
College Sophomore,1,The hazing still exists. It's disgusting!
College Freshman,1,Dorms are very small and old
College Freshman,1,"They are strict about the wrong things. My suitmates used pot al the time and had liquor bottles in the bathroom and we reported them to my RA but nothing happened, but we had two people over after curfew and we got a citation."
College Sophomore,1,Hated it your room is about the size of a semi large closet
College Sophomore,1,I suggest going to another school if you want to receive the final aid you deserve.
College Sophomore,1,"The Residential Advisers do not do their job of keeping their floor in check. It's finals week, and the floor above are obnoxiously loud."
College Junior,1,The only care about enforcing their agendas. If you are a member of Greek life you are instantly profiled.
College Junior,1,"I only received a small amount of financial aid from my fafsa, and I cannot find any scholarships or any other type of financial aid to help me out. My total costs are calculated along with estimated amount of need, however my need is never fully covered by financial aid."
Recent Alumnus,1,they try to prevent any fun
College Senior,1,"Very preppy, snobby, disrespectful rich kids who pay for friendship by joining fraternities/sororities. They all dress the same, look the same in fear of being different. If you are not in a greek house or athletic team, good luck making friends outside of class."
College Senior,1,"Financial Aid is near impossible to work with, I have had multiple problems every semester, never seem to get the Aid that FAFSA says you will receive."
College Sophomore,1,"Oklahoma has crazy weather, so it's something different every day. "
College Sophomore,1,I am a good student. I never partake in anything that violates campus policies. But the campus security officers are extremely rude and always assume that you are breaking some sort of rule.
College Sophomore,1,"Not only are the passes overpriced, but there are never any spots open and the parking enforcement officers are incredibly stingy and rude."
College Junior,1,OU seems to focus so much time and energy on greek life that if you're not involved you have no social or academic resources 
College Junior,1,The dorms are a joke. The rooms are so tiny it's like being in jail and for how much you pay you deal with noise and smells that are ridiculous. 
College Senior,1,"""D"" for don't even bother... Permit costs do not even come close to making up for the hassle... Although, I guess it's that way for pretty much all larger universities..."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is ridiculous. The lots that are available are almost a 15 minute walk, depending where your class is. If you get to the parking garages passed 9AM you can forget finding a spot, you'll be late to class. Buses run from apartments and Lloyd Noble center down the street. I hate public transportation though, it takes 30 minutes longer than it should. Which is a long time when you have a lot of stuff to do. Especially if you forget something in your car. They sell too many parking permits and they're way overpriced. The parking police are brutal. The fines are high, and there's an entire level in the garage for ""special"" parking that you can pay WAY too much money for but no one else can park there."
College Sophomore,1,"At least $250 a Year – for a parking pass, you have to pay $250 a year. For $1000, you can reserve a parking spot for yourself, but I don't know of anyone who has done this. I could never spend that much on a parking spot. Parking pass doesn't guarantee a parking spot. Too many cars and not enough parking spots. It's a nightmare. If you don't get on campus by 9:30 am, good luck finding a parking spot!!"
College Freshman,1,"The campus is very large. The parking available to commuter students is limited and leaves you with a lengthy walk to your classes in rain, sleet, or snow."
College Freshman,1,"When I first applied to OU, I was told that there is a biomedical engineering option for chemical engineer majors. This is true, hoever, it is not what I expected. I've altered my life plans according to my new major, but if I had known this were to be the case, I would have never attended OU."
College Freshman,1,It either gets really hot or really cold and never really gets comfortable
College Junior,1,"Not enough parking, and they over sell the permits so there aren't enough spaces and people are literally fighting over them. It's horrible."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is very difficult to find. If you're not there early in the morning or right when classes are getting out, you will be very lucky to find a place anywhere near campus."
College Senior,1,There is NO WHERE NEAR enough parking at OU. Particularly for commuter students. You have to get there at the crack of dawn to be able to park ANYWHERE close to where you need to be. It really sucks.
College Senior,1,The parking is minimal and expensive. I believe this is one area where OU can show some improvement.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a NIGHTMARE!! You can hardly ever find a space
College Junior,1,I haven't got any scholarships from my University yet. :(
College Freshman,1,The parking especially at the Towers is awful! There is no where to park at all. Parking permits are very expensive and they do not necessarily guarantee a parking spot. It gets way to crowded.
College Senior,1,"Commuter parking is a major pain. The university sells more permits than actual available spaces.. and for whatever reason EVERYONE feels the need to be on campus ALL DAY for about the first couple weeks of class. Lack of parking made me late and even miss a class or two my freshman year. Then I had to get wise, take early morning classes, or be about an hour early to campus to make it on time.."
College Junior,1,"Although the University of Oklahoma is a dry campus, the parties (especially greek) are anything but dry. If a student wants to get a hold of drugs, there is little stopping them."
College Sophomore,1,Everyone Is the Same – The majority of the people I met my freshman year were all the same. Greek life is very big and it seems like people judge your instantly depending on what greek house you are in or if your not in a greek house. Diversity isn't that big at OU there are very few minority groups.
College Junior,1,Need More – OU needs to make it easier for those who need scholarships to receive them. They need to offer more and give them to those who need them. It's way too difficult.
College Senior,1,Weak and Cliquey – Campus Corner simply offers a couple of actual bars and the rest are restaurants that turn in to late night hang outs.  Pretty terrible...  BOOORRRRIINNGG
College Freshman,1,"Not My Thing – I'm a non-Greek student here, and I definitely KNOW it. The sidewalks are dominated by beach blondes wearing Nike shorts, Northface jackets, etc. Greeks tend to hang out with Greeks and so on. I really can't stand the cookie cutter frat life that many of the Greeks here symbolize."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is horrible! The university sells more permits than they have parking spaces so to ensure themselves revenue on tickets. And permits are too expensive!
College Sophomore,1,Greek Gods – Greek life seems to be the center of everything and gives students a big head. Make themselves seem more important than they are.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is huge, too huge. ""Lets all buy our friends who make us do idiotic things like dress in sheets and throw rocks at each other before we can be friends with them."""
College Freshman,1,"People here are too obsessed with sports, that is all anyone cares about."
College Sophomore,1,I've heard it was awful and I didn't want to buy a parking permit. They are really expensive. I live in Traditions West and it's fine to ride my bike to class or take the bus. We get to park in Traditions for free or it comes with the apartment so that's good.
College Sophomore,1,"I was disappointed in FAFSA.  they use my parents income when I am having to take out loan in MY name.  therefore, i am rich and must pay back loans for the rest of my life.  I am average kid, no scholarships for the average honest joe.  scholarships also few if you are undecided in your major.  I don't like colleges basing scholarships on the ACT either.  I make all A's, but only scored a 22 on ACT and I get nothing.  that doesn't make me stupid or less likely to get a good career, but they sure make you feel stupid, and i paid for it... 3 times..."
College Senior,1,Not Involved at All – greeks are very set apart and frowned upon because of the drinking and partying and hazing.
College Junior,1,"The Towers Are Awful – The Towers on campus have horrible air circulation.  If you are in the least susceptible to asthma or illness, you will catch everything from every one of your neighbors.  You can hear your upstairs' neighbors music like they're in your room.  Some of the elevators are frightening."
Recent Alumnus,1,No Aid for Me – I did not recieve any financial aid when I applied for it.
College Junior,1,"Its a rather large campus, and if you don't live in the dorms parking is a nightmare when trying to get to class. Without a ridiculously expensive parking permit there are literally no public parking spaces in reasonable walking distance, and if you have a parking permit...good luck finding a spot."
College Freshman,1,"I came here from Boulder, CO as a Pre-med Major. Nobody from Colorado knows much about the Greek system since there are so many other things to do there, so I had no clue about rush or greek life. The frat parties I did go to were nothing special, about the same if not less exciting than the parties I went to in high school. Almost every guy and girl dress alike in typical frat/sorority outfits, and only hang out with those in their house. After everyone rushed, I found there was nothing at all to do for a ""GDI"" on the weekends besides drink and eat. Outdoor activities, sports besides football, and anything non-Christian is not valued or cared about here. If you are solely concerned with getting into a Greek chapter, then this is the place for you. If you care about anything else, including the party scene, don't go here."
College Sophomore,1,"Awful, Simply Awful – This year, the University decided to require a permit, which costs $195, for hundreds of students in a location that had never before required one. They gave notice of this at 8:00 a.m. the day classes started. Parking is horrible. Very limited number of spaces, and there's no hope if you get there after 8:30."
College Sophomore,1,"Inside Scoop – Really the only thing I can think of that sets us apart from other schools is our music and English programs, and our library."
College Sophomore,1,Policies Affecting Social Lives – The new person they put in charge of the InterFraternity Council (IFC) put a lot of restrictions on Greek life. The policies she implemented made it impossible to not only have parties at frat houses but also for sorority girls to attend them without punishment.
College Sophomore,1,Network Reliability – While living in the dorms the Wi-Fi network was extremely unreliable. From about 8pm until around 11 pm it was incredibly slow and sometimes wouldn't work at all.
College Freshman,1,"I've lived here all my life so I'm used to it, but the Oklahoma wind is almost unbearable when you have to walk half a mile to class...Also for those coming from out of state Tornados usually hit Norman rather hard.."
College Sophomore,1,Limited Parking Space! The university annually sells more parking permits than parking spots available on campus. A complete waste of money and efficiency! Find parking close to campus or walk.

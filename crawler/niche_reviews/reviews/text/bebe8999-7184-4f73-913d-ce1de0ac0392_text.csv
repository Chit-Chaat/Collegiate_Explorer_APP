Junior,5,Great Atmosphere! Very nice students. Small Classes where professors get to know you and want you to succeed!
Niche User,5,"Dakota Wesleyan University is an amazing college. It's a smaller school, but a great environment. Professors have stronger bonds with students and its an environment where everybody knows everybody."
Sophomore,5,"It is a smaller campus which makes everyone feel like a big family. The campus itself has very pretty scenery which makes going to school a lot better. They have trees all around campus which makes it very easy for you to go out and hang your hammock if you want. The cafe at DWU has gotten so much better in the last few years, they just got a new catering staff and they do such a good job."
Alum,5,"My education was absolutely relevant to what I wanted to do after I graduated.  So instead of graduating with a list of classes, I graduated with a list of experiences that helped me get a great job right away.  It is a small, but filled with opportunities!"
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at Dakota Wesleyan University. For the most part, the professors were kind, helpful, and humble. They always helped whenever I asked."

Sophomore,5,Amazing school to teach you about leadership and service. They also help you grow your relationship with god.
Junior,5,I love the small campus at Dakota Wesleyan. There is always a friendly face to say hi to. I also love how nice the professors are. They care not only about your success as a student but also in life.
Freshman,5,Dakota Wesleyan University is a great college that allows one on one time with the professors. The academics are excellent and everyone treats each other like family.
Freshman,5,DWU is great! The teachers are very helpful and want you to do great.  I am in football and the teachers do an awesome job of working around your schedule. The campus scene is really cool as well. New buildings are in the new future and DWU continues to grow each and every year.
Sophomore,5,I think DWU is a very nice school. The staff is so nice and friendly. They will help you with any problem you may face while in college.
College Freshman,5,"The safety on campus is great, it is when the students go off campus that the problems occur"
College Freshman,5,Dakota Wesleyan is small and almost every student is involved in some way
College Junior,5,Our gen ed classes have 20-25 students. Depending on your major there are class sizes of 5-6 students. The small class sizes holds the student and the professors more accountable. It also assures we can slow down or speed up the course depending on the students needs.
College Junior,5,"We do a lot of hands on projects, where we integrate what we are learning in the classroom into a project in the community. I love the opportunity of getting to work with organizations in my field of study. I am very confident I will find a job post graduation or at least have a quality enough resume to get into graduate school."
College Junior,5,"Perks of a small town and a small campus, Dakota Wesleyan is a very safe space to be. I still lock my car doors at night, but I can leave my door room unlocked and never fear walking home from the library at midnight."
College Junior,5,"Staff and faculty will go out their way for you. The don't treat you like just another student paying their paycheck, in no time you become family. The faculty goes out of their way to make it to sporting events, musical concerts,and theater performance."
College Freshman,5,"Throughout my time at Dakota Wesleyan University, I have seen sicknesses come through the dorms, and have even seen death visit the dorms. However, it is of paramount importance to point out how these unavoidable things were dealt with. They were dealt with professionalism and speed. Campus security is tight as to provide safety but not so tight as to restrict your lifestyle. The police are always ready to come and take care of a situation if the need be, but in the end, it's not needed because the community of the college regulates itself."
Alum,4,My dad works here and when i was little he would bring us to work with him. I have fallen in love with the campus.
College Freshman,4,My Accounting advisor is very active in helping students
College Freshman,4,The professors all have great credentials for their topics
College Freshman,4,"Almost every student that attends Dakota Wesleyan is involved in some sport, sometimes multiple."
College Junior,4,"The vibe of the freshman dorms are amazing. Doors are open, there are always opportunities to socialize. Upper classman dorm, it is still clean and welcoming, but doesn't have the same freshman energy.."
College Junior,4,"Basketball and football games are great to go to, both teams are fairly successful. Some of our more successful sports on campus don't draw a huge fan base, but they bring in a lot of wins - golf and track."
College Freshman,4,"Although the buildings are not all the newest, they have been maintained nicely and provide - surprisingly - nice living quarters. The housing helps to cultivate togetherness among the residences of the halls and helps to make a family out of them. Campus Housing also forces you to learn how to deal with others and how to get through trying situations."
College Freshman,4,Athletics is an important part of the Student Body of Dakota Wesleyan University and the school has responded to that. A great multitude of sports are offered to students and brand new facilities are being opened for the betterment of the teams and of the students. What is even better is that Athletics does not dominate the entire school. Most activities are viewed in the same light and generate similar attendances.
College Sophomore,4,nothing bad has happened on campus since I started
College Sophomore,4,most of the teachers are great except for one
College Sophomore,4,new building for science courses and labs
College Sophomore,4,DWU is big in sports and supports them
College Sophomore,4,"Great small school, classes are easy to find, most teachers are understanding and helpful"
College Junior,4,DWU has turned out to be a great fit for me.
College Freshman,4,"Large variety in different places to eat, with ranging price. My biggest complaint is the limited late night options."
College Freshman,4,"Its your average dorm size, love the fact it has AC and heating."
College Freshman,4,"The quality of internships really depend on the major you have. There are great athletic training, nursing, psychology and Christian leadership. A few years ago the school really began developing its internship program so in the next few years they should all be at the same level. Some are more time consuming than others, but none I have heard about at least have been extremely difficult."
College Freshman,4,"I am a psychology major. The program as a Freudian emphasis but fairly represents other psychology perspectives. One teacher is amazing. The teacher will bring the best out of you if you apply yourself to the assignments. The other teacher is mediocre. He does a good enough job at teaching the material, but he won't push you beyond your current level to grow as a student. Also, if you aren't a boy and/or athlete you will never spark a connection or bond. If you are interested in clinical psychology this is a great school. In the Mitchell area there are places you can get internships and jobs at places that aid with drug abuse, alcohol abuse, sexual abuse and special ed programs."
College Sophomore,4,"Entry into the Education program is difficult, but not impossible. They are looking for motivated, capable students, because these students will be responsible for the education of the next generation. It is a huge responsibility."
College Sophomore,4,"We have awesome opportunities to get involved in the local school systems and gain valuable, hands-on experience"
College Sophomore,4,DWU has a reputation for great academics in an individualized setting.
College Sophomore,4,Mitchell is a great community to be in. We share it with one technical school that pulls in a lot of students. It is fair to say that our population shrinks every summer when college kids leave town!
College Sophomore,4,We get along great. Everyone has good friends among both genders.
College Sophomore,4,"Just fill out the FAFSA, and the financial aid office will do the rest!"
College Sophomore,4,"The whole school turns out for athletic events, and the mornings after a big game, no one talks about anything else!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love the individualized attention from everyone. I have a great relationship with all my professors, and they all take an interest in me personally. They are passionate and knowledgeable about what they teach, and it is a pleasure to sit in their classes."
College Junior,4,It has gotten better with the new student life staff.
College Junior,4,Everything is very challenging which will help me later on when I specialize in my degree.
College Freshman,4,The professors are really smart and seem interested in their students. the registration process is quite easy to handle. There are study options for school about every day of the week.
College Freshman,4,I like the curriculum at school. We have a good workload. we have food internships and job oppurtunities when we get older.
College Freshman,4,"I like on printing on campus, and we have enough money for the entire semester."
College Freshman,4,"I like how the college is safe and follows all the safety procedures to keep it a great atmosphere. Dakota Wesleyan always has activites going on that everyone can participate in. There are cultural events that are very fun to get involved with. There is a wellness center and weight room that is open to everyone; there are times when the gym and weight room are reserved for practices, but there is a recreation center in town as well. The local atmosphere of the town is very welcoming, everyone is very friendly and supportive."
College Freshman,4,The parking is very convenient and close to the campus. The permits are free and thee tickets are generally twenty dollars if you park in a restricted zone. There are always available parking spaces in the parking lot.
College Freshman,4,"The life on campus is anything but boring here at Dakota Wesleyan! The campus is small, but there are always fun activities and events planned for the students to do. The Rollins is neat place for students to hangout and do homework. Every Thursday there is chapel from eleven to noon. There is a new state of the art science building. There are lots of  organizations to join to get more involved in with college life."
College Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman so I don't really know what to expect but I am liking school so far and the faculty is really nice. The workload is not as much as I expected it to be but I am not taking very hard classes this year as I am just a first year student. There are lots of job opportunities for my major and I am looking forward to getting into the program, as we start it our sophomore year."
College Freshman,4,"It is nice to live on campus since it is a small one and I can walk to every one of my classes. Our dorms are very small and I like that I get to know everyone on my floor. The cost is kind of spendy so that is about the only thing that is bad about it and the bathrooms are kind of dirty most of the time, but other wise it is nice to live on campus."
College Freshman,4,"not many parties around here, alot of study groups"
College Freshman,4,"alot of great people hear, different type of people"
College Senior,4,Outdated Buildings – the school is remodeling and building new classrooms. much needed
College Senior,4,"Back in November, people broke in to many dorms and stole alot of items. DWU was on top of it. They contacted police and many of the items were returned back to the right owners. These people were charged with a crime and were kicked out of school."
College Freshman,2,Food is usually undercooked and most people just make themselves toast or cereal so they don't get sick.
College Freshman,2,"So Much Homework, Few Things to Do – Mitchell is a smaller town, with few sit-down restuarants and other activities.  It does have a larger high school and a technical college.  There is little shopping, but most residents seem to appreciate the positive affects college students have on the Mitchell community.  Mitchell includes the world's only Corn Palace, which is pretty cool if you have never visited it before!"
College Sophomore,2,"Dorm in Need of an Upgrade – The freshman dorms are in great need to some upgrading, especially the bathrooms. They should have more sanitary options like automatic soap dispensers and hand towel dispensers. The showers could also use remodeling."
College Freshman,1,"The Same Old – There are only a few options for meals, such as the sandwich bar, pizza section, and the casserole and hot meal area.  They typically serve the same thing every week.  There are other fast food places and sit downs around campus, such as McDonalds, Ruby Tuesday's, and Subway.  I suggest buying food for your room and a small meal plan."

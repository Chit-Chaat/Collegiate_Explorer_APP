Senior,5,"The history at CSC program was great. The professors were super helpful and nice. The campus is small but it did not bother me as I wanted a small campus. Internship opportunities are not that great, but use your resources such as your advisor. As of 2020 CSC is mainly a nursing/biology school which makes social science/humanities majors feel left out and unwelcome."
Freshman,5,"Colby-Sawyer is an amazing college, especially for first year students! The staff is more than welcoming and is beyond eager to help you through the entire process. My experience at Colby-Sawyer has been great. The professors are very accommodating and there are a multitude of resources for all students. There is no better college for someone who is looking to make a lot of new close friends. As someone who was weary about leaving home, Colby-Sawyer has provided me with a home away from home. I have no doubts that Colby-Sawyer is where I'm meant to be!"
Freshman,5,My experience has been wonderful. What I like about Colby-Sawyer is the small-knit community. Everyone is very welcoming and the college offers a lot of help for academics. What the college needs to improve on is the lighting on the campus. It has lighting but I think it needs more
Junior,5,I love my college and the experiences and opportunities it has presented me.  I have met some pretty amazing people here and have had great professors.  I am studying something that I care about and am learning a lot.  I believe that my school is benefiting my ability to succeed in the future.
Freshman,5,Colby-Sawyer has a good environment and is a nice place to be in almost all seasons. Winters can be rough but still very pretty. The community is small and very safe. The sports teams are very good and recruit from around everywhere. The dorms are nice and they have a lot of options. Classes are intimate and easy to ask questions in and talk to professors.
Freshman,5,"Colby Sawyer's quaint setting makes for an ""at home"" feel which is great for students, like me, that tend to encounter homesickness."
Sophomore,5,"The community there is amazing. It's such a small area, but one of the most diverse places I have ever been. The professors, staff, and students are all more than willing to help with any questions or issues you may have. There are great traditions there and activities for any interests you have. Nothing but great things to say about Colby-Sawyer!"
Junior,5,"My time in Colby-Sawyer college has enriched my life in many ways. It has provided me with the necessary tools to enhance my skills more, taught me valuable knowledge about this diverse world and people and concepts in general and eventually will enable me to hopefully become more successful in life when I finally graduate and get my degree. It also has stressed to me the importance of thinking critically and asking questions in many situations. All these aspects of college have also made me more well-rounded as a person. It has been easier for me to achieve these opportunities than if I lived in some other countries, especially third-world ones. These experiences are truly irreplaceable and I would not trade them for anything."
College Junior,5,The courses are very diverse and the professors are friendly. The small classroom sizes allows students to connect with their peers and professors effectively.
College Junior,5,"Everything is valued and there are many people here who are willing to help students one on one with their job search and internships, etc. There are many offices around that are dedicated to these important aspects."
College Junior,5,I personally feel very safe. They try their best to provide students with safety and other programs.
College Junior,5,"The liberal arts program at CSC are an amazing opportunity for all students to look into many different fields other than their own. The staff, students and community members are friendly and welcoming. There are many opportunities for students to go above and beyond and shine here!"
College Freshman,5,Having at least one internship is required in order to graduate from Colby-Sawyer. There is a very big emphasis on real-world applications and how to get a career both with and without your degree. The Student Learning Collaborative and other programs on campus that are like it help ensure your success both in the classroom and in the real world by helping you become a well-rounded person that would be a strong candidate for any job or graduate school.
College Freshman,5,Most of our teams are successful. Almost all sports teams so far have made it to post season. There is a decent amount of fans at almost every home game and people are very supportive in wishing other athletes luck before games. The turf field is beautiful with a view of the mountains and the field and track itself is nice. The gym is also much better than the one i use at home and nicer than i expected.
College Freshman,5,My school has awesome school spirit!
College Freshman,5,"I love Colby-Sawyer College so much. There is no way I would have been able to go if I didn't get such amazing scholarships, and what a dream come true! Colby-Sawyer is a small little school with a big personality, just like me. I love the small campus and small class sizes. If I had to do it all over again, I would chose Colby-Sawyer 100 times over. Colby-Sawyer welcomed me with open arms. To be honest, I get quite emotional when talking about how blessed I am to have found a school that fits me so well. This school is so perfect for me and for my personality. I am quiet, shy and humble. I love having a tight, close-knit community of friends and classmates. Going to Colby-Sawyer is truly a dream come true and I love it so much. I am so excited to spend the next four years of my life there, as I wouldn't have it any other way."
College Sophomore,5,"For me personally, I really enjoy the nursing lab to study in as well as the library because I do not study efficiently in my room on campus. The professors are always willing to help. The registration process does slag sometimes but it is efficient and more often than not you can get into the classes you want. The workload is what is expected at college."
College Sophomore,5,"Around campus, there are places where if you don't feel safe, campus safety will come and walk you where you need to. Campus safety are always helpful and friendly. I feel very safe on campus, especially knowing a lot of campus officers think of us as family and want to protect us."
College Sophomore,5,"I love colby-sawyer! However, if you don't like the small town vibe, this school is not for you. I grew up in a small New England town so I feel right at home on the beautiful campus."
College Freshman,5,They really want to give you money.
College Freshman,5,The psych program is pretty great.
College Freshman,5,"Easy to get in, hardest to get into is nursing"
College Freshman,5,So many people from diff. cultures to learn from
College Freshman,5,14% of our students are international. I am friends with some kids from Nepal and Jamaica. They are very funny and know how to have a good time!
College Freshman,5,Very safe school. Campus Safety does bust parties that get out of control and give out parking tickets if you are parked in the wrong lot. You just have to be smart about what you do.
College Senior,5,"We have many international students and students from across the nation that attend the school.  They tend to gravitate toward ""their own country group,"" but everyone is very friendly and hangs out together.  There is a PRIDE group that celebrates LGBTQ+ rights.  Any type of sexuality is accepted here.  There is great religious diversity, mostly stemming from the diverse populations that attend the school.  I'd say it's a liberal school overall.  It seems that everyone that attends the school is either very rich or poor, but there are definitely those of us in between."
College Freshman,5,they give a great amount of financial aid; almost a full ride.
College Freshman,5,Colby-Sawyer is really expensive before financial aid but after financial aid it was my cheapest school that I applied for. It was cheaper than any state school I could have gone too. As of the majority of the students here everyone received an extremely good financial aid package making it very affordable for everyone to go here.
College Freshman,5,"Very helpful with majors, FANTASTIC advisers, they will get you where you need to go."
College Freshman,5,"Diversity includes races, personality, sexual orientation, economic status, etc. Very wide variety of people often expressing an openness and acceptance towards one another, liberal"
College Senior,5,"CSC has a lot of financial aid options, in fact, most people that go here receive about 70% of tuitional aid. "
College Senior,5,"CSC is such an easy campus to live on, and enjoy."
College Senior,5,"Overall, the academics really are good. The staff is very knowledgable and always willing to stop and offer help."
College Junior,5,Colby-Sawyer is EXTREMELY diverse and that's what makes it such a great campus to be on!
College Sophomore,5,"Off campus housing is amazing and it gives rise to many new experiences, such as learning to cook on your own and learning to work on a daily basis. Land lords are awesome and are always around to help."
College Freshman,5,"Colby-Sawyer College is located in small town New London, New Hampshire.  Down Main Street there are some restaurants and stores.  The best part about the location of CSC is that is it surrounded by mountains.  During the winter, many students go down to Mount Sunapee to go skiing and snowboarding.  CSC students receive free season passes.  During the spring and fall students enjoy going down to a lake down the road for swimming and hanging out and they also go on hikes on the local mountains.  CSC is also only a half hour drive away from Concord, New Hampshire and West Lebanon, New Hampshire.  These both have shopping, dining, and movies that students enjoy.  The local atmosphere definitely had a large impact on why I chose to go to Colby-Sawyer College."
College Freshman,5,You never go anywhere on campus without seeing a familiar face. Some of the dorms are small enough where you are friends with almost every single person in your building.
College Junior,5,"For a small school there really is a diversified availability within the athletic programs. The main reason people seem to be dissatisfied with CSC athletics is fairly simple, low division, playing the same teams repeatedly, and lots of travel time. This is true though of any small school in a relatively rural area. The gym serves as both the on campus gym, and the local fitness facility. So, occasionally it will be busy, but there is almost never a time where you cannot find a space to do what you want to do."
College Sophomore,5,"EXCELLENT. Perfect mix of challenging while still allowing you to have a life outside the books... The Business Administration program is 2nd hardest (thats what students say) to only the Nursing one. So being a BA you get challenged a lot but if you like it, then you'll enjoy the challenge and thrive."
College Sophomore,5,"Absolutely nothing to complain about in this area. I wouldn't feel safer anywhere else... Campus Security is also SUPER friendly so it's definitely a plus. After all the shootings they have more lock-down practices, so that students are aware of the protocol for those type of situations - I think that's a nice thing. although the only real incidents on the campus are the occasional bears and deers."
Junior,4,"This is a small school with a lot of heart. However, during Covid times because it is so small it is hard to find safe activities to do."
Freshman,4,"As hard as it can be to finish school online, the professors do everything they can to include and prepare everyone for the same opportunities. My roommate for example live in California, her time is different then those in the East, being 4 hours ahead. My professor changed the time of class to a later time so she could participate at a reasonable hour, rather then 4:00am."
Freshman,4,Colby is a place to be if you want to have a real community. The staff and students are very welcoming and East to approach. When I think of Colby-Sawyer I think of how well they let the students know help is always available to help you succeed.
Niche User,4,"I liked that the staff is always ready to help. Also, they make a college education possible for those that cannot afford it."
Freshman,4,It is a beautiful campus with lots of hiking trails to explore. The professors at this college take their time in getting to their students and try to better the education they provide from the feedback they receive.
Sophomore,4,"My experience thus far with Colby-Sawyer had been pretty great. I enjoy the close-knit community not only throughout the student groups but the teachers and students as well. Some may see a small college and turn away, but this campus allows students to create better connections with their peers and their professors."
Sophomore,4,I love it here. I have had instances related to race at the school that weren't satisfactory but it wasn't the school's fault it was the students. Other than that the school is lovely and they teachers are very nice.
Sophomore,4,What I love most about this college is that it is like a small community where everyone cares about everyone. Each of the classes have no more than 25 students which not only allows you to know everyone on a name bases in each of your classes. But it also allows you to have a lot of one on one time with each professor and they know you on a personal level.
Freshman,4,"I love all of the people I have met here, and the professor's are truly kind and want to see their students succeed and excel in their classes. I would like to see the college incorporate more majors."
Freshman,4,"Arriving here on Campus for the first time as a student I was welcomed by so many wonderful people. Upperclassmen and other first-year students drowned me with offers to help bring my belongings up to my dorm. From then on, I have met so many people who push me to be my very best self every day. Colby-Sawyer College has given me opportunities that I wouldn't have had at other colleges. Within the first few weeks on campus, I was employed and became a member of the executive board for one of those four clubs.  I am a Biology major still deciding on what minor to enroll in. The good thing about this college is that you get a liberal arts education. No one is rushed into picking a major because there are so many to discover. Each student leaves here well rounded. My favorite thing about this college is how small it is. Every one of my professors has gotten to know me as a student and a friend. I am given the one-on-one help that I need to be successful."
Sophomore,4,I chose Colby-Sawyer because of the small size and location being a 1 1/2 hour drive from my home. The campus is maintained very well. I was able to make it as a walk-on on the basketball team and I like their athletic facilities. The college is expensive but their financial aid office is very helpful and friendly. The things I would improve upon there would be having a better food service in the cafeteria and having more events and night life things to do on campus.
Freshman,4,"The teachers, for the most part, are amazing and super helpful in all aspects. What I would like to see changed is to have better food and more vegetarian  options."
College Junior,4,"Sexual assault happens rarely, and I feel safe."
College Junior,4,"I opened up to people last year, so it's great."
College Junior,4,"There are many sports at which a student can participate in and you do not even have to have previous experience to join a team, everyone is welcomed to join and train."
College Freshman,4,"Crime on campus is typically limited to a few acts of vandalism by immature and rowdy individuals, but I feel it doesn't go much past that. Parking violations or violations of housing contracts are other common rule breaks, but these are settled by our Council on campus. The New London Police station is right next door, and campus security has a very fast response time, so I usually feel very safe walking alone."
College Freshman,4,I've really enjoyed my experiences here at Colby-Sawyer. I've found it very easy to get involved both on campus and in the community. I've begun to create ties with several teachers by having the opportunity to connect with them one-on-one. It was really easy for me to find a few close friends that I can see a long future friendship with and I'm very happy that I decided to come here!
College Freshman,4,Most of our sports teams do very well and often continue into post-season. There are plenty of intramural sports and clubs that anyone can join and our athletic building is constantly holding classes in varying subjects from yoga to an intense boot camp for students who want to get active without joining a sport!
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy going to Colby-Sawyer. During my first semester, I struggled and didn't know if it would be the right fit for me but after sticking with it for an extra couple of weeks I've become more confident and am excited to finish my degree here! They offer really good financial aid, despite their tuition prices being very high and there is a very big emphasis on getting out of the classroom here, which is a special characteristic that I've come to love."
College Freshman,4,I have not heard of or had any negative experience with the security on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I got lucky, with a large room with our own bathroom. Then had one roommate move out so i wound up in a quad with only three people so there is plenty of space for anything. A lot of my friends live in my dorm as well."
College Freshman,4,Our campus is very safe and I feel completely secure here.
College Freshman,4,Our school provides many opportunities for internships.
College Freshman,4,Classes are very small so your professors get to know you well.
College Freshman,4,"Whether it's Monday night or Friday night there  is always an opportunity to watch a game. More than half the student on campus are involved with an athletic team. It could be skiing, basketball, rugby, field hockey, etc. The teams can be intramurals or an actual team."
College Freshman,4,"Colby-Sawyer College provides a community-based environment with plenty of activities to do. Whether you are outdoorsy or artsy you will always find a place to fit in. Mt. Sunapee is about a half-hour away and you get free ski and snowboard passes, which is a plus. The professors and academic advisor are always there to lend you a hand, advice and their expertise. Colby-Sawyer Faculty goes beyond their job description to help us student get what we need."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of diversity on campus and many people who are willing to get involved in politics, which is great because we are a generation who needs to vote. Religion is not as present as much of politics, but there are options if you want to express religious beliefs."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors are enthusiastic about their work and help within their office hours. Depending on the course, some are difficult even if they are introductory, but with studying and use of professors, they are easy to succeed in. The class sizes are typically around 30 people which is nice, and there are many options."
College Sophomore,4,"The cleaning people are always nice and always trying to do their best to make us comfortable in our living situation. A lot of rooms are better than others, which room draw makes happen."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic training lab is very nice for those in that major, especially to take care of people. The only thing that isn't as good is some of the outdated machines and a slightly small weight room."
College Sophomore,4,The school is easily accessible to get help in a certain field. The library is absolutely beautiful and it's a very close-knit community where everyone seems to be nice.
College Freshman,4,I would choose it again! I love it here! It is great!
College Sophomore,4,I made amazing friends so far and the staff is very accommodating.
College Junior,4,The school I chose challenges me academically and I enjoy the atmosphere. I don't regret my choice.
College Freshman,4,Don't break the rules and you will be fine. They usually give you two chances and on you 3rd you get a serious consequences wen it comes to drinking. For drugs they are illegal and you will probably have do deal with NLPD and not campus safety.
College Freshman,4,This school is Amazing for being in the middle of no where the school does an AMAZING job of keeping the students entertained with different campus events .
College Freshman,4,"The hole in the fence is a great place to grab a meal, they use our student ID cards if we do not have cash or debt cards on us. PC is also a greta place to eat but may be a little pricey at times."
College Freshman,4,This school has a very big honor code.
College Freshman,4,I have not really been to any parties but i hear all about them. Everyone says that everyone has each others backs and wouldn't let anything happen.
College Freshman,4,Just apply for every scholarship that you can. Keep your grades up so that you can keep your school scholarship.
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love living here at Colby-Sawyer. I never expected to meet as many amazing people as I have here. The dorms are on the older side , but to me that is what makes this school even more attractive to me. The students and staff make coming here enjoyable just from friendly personalities and always willing to help others."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in the honors program, so I got a fairly good scholarship. However, it does only cover about half the cost, which does present a problem for such an expensive school. They give you advice about what scholarships to apply for but after you get a couple of scholarships you're on your own."
College Freshman,4,"For me, it's pretty nice. I have a lot of friends who are seniors so I'm usually invited to parties every weekend. A lot of people say it's a small party scene, which it is, but as long as you're outgoing you'll be fine. It's really just what you make of it."
College Freshman,4,"I live in a building that's one of the farthest away from the class buildings. Even then, it's a 2 minute walk to the dining hall and a 5 minute walk to the science building, where I have most of my classes. I got lucky this year and got placed in a great room with really nice hall mates, which definitely made my dorm experience a lot better. This dorm is generally pretty clean, even though it's one of the older ones."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of people don't like it at our school. It wasn't as big as I expected it to be, but because I know a lot of people on campus for a freshman, I know a lot of people at parties that I go to and I'm always outgoing. I believe it is what you make it to be."
College Freshman,4,"Good distance from the college, less stress than living in the dorms."
College Junior,4,its a nice quaint little old time town with a lot of small shops and diners
College Junior,4,"The school is very diverse and accepting, making everyone more understanding and nice when reaching out for help."
College Freshman,4,School gives many opportunities for scholarships
College Freshman,4,Most professors are friendly and helpful
College Freshman,4,I love my Child Development program
College Freshman,4,Isn't strict at all compared to other schools
College Freshman,4,"Some live in forced doubles, most rooms are nice"
College Freshman,4,Alcohol used more than anything - nothing too bad
College Freshman,4,"We have great teachers that graduated from Princeton and Datmouth,but our ranking for academics is low. It is mainly because a lot of kids come here that do not care about school at all and just want to party. Many drop out because they expected it to be easier. It is COLLEGE, it's not going to be easy."
College Freshman,4,"Living off campus costs just as much as living on-campus. The new off-campus housing they just built is extremely nice. It has its own kitchen, living room, TV, and every person has their own room. Usually 4 people per unit."
College Freshman,4,"There are almost always spots open, but sometimes you have to park far away."
College Freshman,4,"I am a bio pre-med major.Workload is moderate, but manageable. We have a new science building named Ivey that is extremely nice. You have to do an internship before you graduate for all majors."
College Freshman,4,"I am a biology pre-med major. I wish the program had more classes to choose from, but the teachers and advisers are incredible. The school has all the classes you need to get into med school."
College Senior,4,"The psychology program and professors are excellent, which is my program.  It is a liberal arts school, so you get a wonderful base education in multiple areas.  I have enjoyed most of my classes and learned a great deal from them.  Professors vary in toughness, but MOST seem fair- there's always a few that seem too harsh in every major."
Freshman,2,"The food served at the dining hall and the Lodge is decent, for about two weeks. It's very repetitive, very few options, and even fewer options for the vegetarians on campus. Safety? Definitely not one of their priorities, and if there's an issue, I wouldn't bother calling campo. I have had to report a couple infractions/situations, and campo never showed up to any of them. The public is allowed into the gym and library, which you would think they would discontinue due to it leading to a higher risk of COVID being spread. Dorm rooms are mediocre at best. There's nothing in the surrounding area besides hiking trails, and if you want to go outside of New London to do something, you'll have to drive at least 30 minutes. This is all fine and dandy, until you realize how expensive grocery shopping at Hannaford is, and want to go to Walmart or something for groceries. On the plus side, it's a small campus, which makes walking to and from classes easy."
Freshman,2,The food is a huge no-no. They really catfished us with that. The school is small and not what I first expected but it has become a nice place to live. Not much to do around the town or anywhere nearby though.
College Freshman,2,"I honestly do not enjoy the Cafeteria food on campus. There really is not a lot of variety and you will either go and think it tastes mediocre or go and think it is awful. The meat they serve is rather questionable. You can have 10 swipes of your meal plan a day, which certainly is plenty. The dessert options are always good. However, the fruit and vegetables really need improvment."
College Freshman,2,"Very small variety, pizza, subs, ice cream..."
College Freshman,2,"No nightlife in town, have to make your own"
College Freshman,2,"Winter months are horrible, very windy and cold"
College Freshman,2,"Don't have much in town, things are half hr away"
College Freshman,2,Very small town with not much to do. You stay on campus if you want to have fun.
College Freshman,2,"It's a small town, so there are few options. There is hole in the fence, Elkins, the Goose brew pub, pizza chef, a chinese place, and a few more. Graze is way to expensive for college students."
College Senior,2,"Dunkin Donuts and Subway are the only chains.  Everything closes super early (Dunkin Donuts is like 6 or 7pm).  Nothing in town is open past 9 or 10pm.  Pizza Chef is decently priced and gives a 10% student discount ONLY IF YOU ASK FOR IT SPECIFICALLY.  Subway may offer a small discount, again if you directly ask for it.  No where else does discounts.  Most restaurants are out of the college student price range (such as Peter Christian's, The Flying Goose, or Millstone at 74 Main).  Graze (formerly Ellie's) and Hole in the Fence probably offer the best vegetarian options- which is fairly popular at CSC, but are kind of pricey for what they offer.  Hole in the Fence has some deals on pizza during the week.  Pizza Chef will deliver to your dorm on campus."
College Senior,2,"New London is really small, so within town- use your feet or a personal vehicle.  Vehicle passes for on-campus students cost $100 per year, but sometimes it's really difficult to find a parking spot even when you have a pass.  Commuter students get free parking passes.  You can take the Dartmouth Coach bus from the park-n-ride on the other side of town to go places further away.  There are no taxis/buses/etc. in town.  The college offers free campus van trips to the airport  (which is 1+ hours away) at the typical end of semester/break travelling times and on shopping excursions from time to time.  Recently, there has been a rush for some sort of rentable ride-share car on campus... but I'm not sure if this is available yet."
College Senior,2,"We call New London ""Narnia.""  It is cold 80%+ of the school year.  There is a CONSTANT wind.  It snows a lot during the winter and is FREEZING- but you do get snow days!"
College Senior,2,"The male-female ratio is upwards of 30-70.  The ""look"" varies as there a slew of different nationalities, cultures, and regions represented in the student body.  There is an especially high international population (especially from Nepal).  There is a big party culture for both males and females."
College Sophomore,2,There is limited parking and people don't pay attention to where the lines are.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many bars or clubs around so people usually stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,we live in the middle of no where
College Sophomore,2,"Winter is long. I mean long! and cold. summer and spring are nice, but short lived."
College Sophomore,2,"New Lomodn is in the middle of nowhere. You definitely need a car to get anywhere and the nightlife is not great, even in the next town over"
College Sophomore,2,We currently have sudexo and they are trying to make things better but not hard enough. Campus dinning is not good and everyone thinks so.
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot within a close walking distance 
College Freshman,2,It's in  a town that closes early not much goes on 
College Freshman,2,"It's very costly, and circumstances for me have changed"
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot of healthier options. The same thing is served repeatedly. Focus is more on presentation than taste
College Freshman,2,The wifi sometimes does not even connect to your device at all. When it does connect some pages do not load. 
College Freshman,2,The amount of varsity sports here is mediocre.  there is no football team or lax team but there is a soccer team.  I would say not many people attend the athletics and mostly everyone does intramurals.  in fact i have seen more people get into intramurals over varsity sports.  the gym is small but works for the size of the school and the equipment is good enough as long as you know what you are doing.
College Freshman,2,The girls here are not the most attractive and it is hard to find a good looking one never mind actually meeting them.  everyone wheres uggs and yoga pants per usual in the winter hahaha.  the guys that i know i cant stand.  they are rich snobs that love to show their money and are very cocky.
College Freshman,2,"there is nothing to do here and everything is closed by 8 o clock, unless you want to drive 45 minutes to the nearest walmart.  It is very remote and you have to enjoy doing nothing to come here.  I must say I do enjoy running off campus and it is a very safe environment."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They have regular hours and you can schedule an appointment easily. However, the staff are horrible at diagnosing anything more than the common cold. A friend of mine went there with an obvious concussion and they told him it was just a head ache, we had to take him to the hospital because we weren't convinced. My sophomore year roommate went to the health center and they told her she just had a severe cold, she went home to her family doctor and found that she had a kidney infection. They really aren't good for much."
College Freshman,2,"There are shuttles on weekends, and frequent van certified people willing to help out with events"
College Sophomore,2,The alcohol use is pretty common but it is not that bad. It s pretty common on thursday night because of Thirsty thursday.
College Freshman,2,"CSC's curriculum is a joke. The professors, although very passionate, practically hang out grades like they were bought and paid for. This ofcourse is because they were bought and paid for by the isolated, privileged student body population this school attracts. If you're looking to do busy work in return for a degree, CSC is for you. If you're looking to be engaged, challenged or even just have a decent conversation CSC is not for you."
College Sophomore,2,It is pretty cold down here. it always snows but they rarely cancel classes. I am forced to keep myself really warm when am in school. Classes are also far from the dorm which makes it worse with the weather. students love it when the weather is good.
College Junior,2,"The parking isn't the greatest, especially K lot. If you can get a spot that's great, but sometimes it fills up very quickly. The snow removal times are often inconvenient as well. They often admit too many parking passes than there are enough parking spots."
College Freshman,2,Again average. I'm a psychology major here and I find our program and class options limited.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of international students, many from Nepal. These students however tend to stick to themselves which makes our already lacking campus worse."
College Sophomore,2,Hardly any buses. they have to be scheduled by the school to bring student where they need to go.
College Sophomore,2,"CSC is a great school for art programs, business majors, physical therapy/exercise science majors, and writing majors. Any bio majors, environmental science majors, or any other science majors shouldn't consider applying here. I transferred from CSC to another college because their biology programs were HORRIBLE and I had MUCH better lab equipment in my public high school. 

Art majors: the resources/equipment/space they have for art programs are very outdated. They are in the process of trying to build a new arts center on campus but it's going to take them a while. The programs are still pretty good but just be warned that the Sawyer Center is a bit old (and also haunted, but then again half of the campus is haunted)."
College Senior,2,"Parking at Colby-Sawyer has changed a lot within the past few years.  All students are allowed to have parking, just as long as parking permits are available and you are able to snatch one up.  It's gotten very difficult to find parking because of the amount of students who do have vehicles on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Alcohol Is Attainable – Alcohol at Colby-Sawyer is quite evident.  Many students 21+ will host parties and provide alcohol to underage people.  However, there is a program on campus called H.O.P.E. that you can go to if you've had too much alcohol and Campus Safety will investigate any rowdy areas to make sure underage people aren't drinking."
College Freshman,2,"Cold and Windy – Coming into the school, you have to know that there's going to be a lot of snow and wind. The winter is very cold, it gets very windy often and the morning fog is usually pretty bad. There is usually a decent amount of snow, but the pathways are usually cleared fairly quickly. As it is a small campus, walking across in the cold isn't terrible, but it's definitely not a walk in the park when the wind picks up. On nice days, though, everyone sits out on the quad and it's a good time."
Freshman,1,"Luckily, my major only required one of my classes to be virtual (and that was per the professors preference). However, it's honestly awful. The professor is all over the place, and the group chat for the class always ends up texting each other at the end of class and asking if anyone understood what was ""taught"" that day. It is expected that notes are to be taken, but lectures and slides are gone through too fast for anyone to be able to get anything down."
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Senior,1,"The told has an extremely high elderly population so everyone in town is either elderly or in college.  There isn't much to do.  There are no places to shop.  There's one grocery store. All sports/recreation that you do are on campus activities.  Unsure about local attitude of the residents toward college students.  I think it's decent.  There don't seem to be many problems about it.  Extremely safe place to be.  VERY REMOTE.  Closest attraction is Mt. Sunapee for skiing/snowboarding, which is only one town over."
College Senior,1,We don't have a Greek life whatsoever on campus.
College Freshman,1,"There is very ltitle night life, just hanging out at the lodge or in dorm rooms. no local bars or underage clubs"
College Freshman,1,live in the middle of no where
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do here.  There are some duplex parties every weekend but you have to know someone to get in which is difficult because of the cliqueyness of this school.  There were less cliques in my high school.  There are no bars or clubs and everything is within walking distance but it sucks when it gets cold out.
College Freshman,1,"The food here is terrible and very limited.  They have an ok stir fry station which is what I get by on, but usually the main course meals are disgusting.  On the weekends the options are even more limited and I am usually forced to go grocery shopping.  If you are looking to stay healthy this is not your place.  I eat very healthy and I cannot stand this dining hall."
College Freshman,1,"This college is like a high school.  It is very cliquey and exclusive, so if you do not make friends right away then good luck (especially if you are a reserved person).  The academics and teachers are awesome, but the social life is a nightmare.  I am most likely transferring just due to the lack of parties and nightlife here."
College Senior,1,"The weather in New London is dismal. It's pretty common to hear that this is the pitfall of all weather systems. In it's defense, the nice days are really nice."
College Senior,1,"Colby-Sawyer is not a bad school, and A LOT of people really love it. But it's a pretty specific cup of tea."
College Senior,1,"Being in the woods, in a small town, with a large elderly population is actually painful."
College Senior,1,"This is a small school, in a small town, in the middle of the woods...you gotta make your own fun."
College Freshman,1,"There are only 3 restaurants in town which are not good at all and they are very small.  There are no chains allowed in New London, so it makes it difficult to go out to Olive Garden or Chilis or any other chain restaurants unless you have a car to drive 45 minutes to Concord."
College Freshman,1,The weather is usually rainy or cloudy and it is very cold from October all the way through April and the wind makes everything worse.
College Freshman,1,the social scene is awful.  Basically you can count on being ignored unless you're a 10 and on a sports team.  Parties pretty much suck and consist of music and sitting around drinking with the occasional beer pong table in the back.  Parties are also very exclusive so good luck getting in unless you're popular or have connections.  Everyone knows everything and drama is very common.  Rumors are spread like wildfire since this college is the size of a large high school.
College Sophomore,1,"The female population outweighs the male at a 70 to 30 percentage but don't let that fool you. The common joke around campus is the girls are either antisocial/international/gross or taken (dartmouth guys). If you want to find a girl for yourself, steal one. Best bet is to transfer Ivy. Adios Colby-Sawyer!"
College Junior,1,"CSC provides the most basic and most stereotypically cafeteria food you can think of. It's often over/under cooked, and variety is seriously lacking. Next to no one on campus actually enjoys the food - the dining hall is typically referred to as The Rot."
College Freshman,1,"Colby sawyer is in a little town full of wealthy people. it seems everything closes around 7 to 9pm. it is a quaint little town and exactly that quaint and little. To go to the nearest shopping area you have to go at least a half hour in any direction, and the shopping is not even that good."
College Freshman,1,"There are no local clubs around here, everything is a solid 30 min drive in any direction, all the local shops close between 7 and 9pm. If you are into parties  on campus there is always one to be found if you know where to look."

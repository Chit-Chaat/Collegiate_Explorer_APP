Freshman,5,"SAU Tech is a technically school, but it's more closely related to a family. Everyone wants you to succeed and help you out. Since the school is small for now, the teachers are more personal with the students. This gives you a chance to break out of your shell even if it's just with your teachers. I for one have had a good experience and I know a lot of my other friends on campus would say the same. You're bound to find a group of friends who you hang out with."
Freshman,5,"I usually take most of my classes in person (With covid safety pre cautions). However, the online classes I do take are easy and simple. You can talk to professor, email them, or even zoom with them if you need help.  However, with the lessons given online and being accessible anywhere most people can learn at their own pace and in the comfort of their own home."
Sophomore,5,I LOVE Tech. There is tons of student life activities along with sporting events going on. It truly is a great school. We have great basketball and softball teams.
Sophomore,5,"All of my classes were transferred to online due to covid, and the professors and staff handled it very well! They made it a great learning experience and still helped just as much as they did in the classroom."
Sophomore,5,My professors were all very understanding and helping during this crazy semester. Many checked in on me at least once a week and made sure I was up to date of upcoming assignments.
Sophomore,5,"SAU Tech is a great school. The faculty and staff really care about your success. It’s a two year school that gives you the tools you need to transfer to a four year university. It also has many technical classes such as welding, airplane mechanics, etc."

Freshman,4,I really like sau tech. One of the many reasons I like it is because of the great professors. Another thing that I like is that my schedule is flexible . Even though I'm taking a full load of classes I don't feel  over worked. The only thing that I would change is the diversity. From what I've seen it's not very diverse.

Sophomore,5,I really like being at College of Saint Benedict. They truly make it feel like a home away from home.
Sophomore,5,Love this school. Has a great sense of community and will help me get to where I want to be. Also has many clubs and activities I am involved in. The only downside for me is the location in the middle of nowhere but the school and the people make up for it!
Sophomore,5,"It was a little tough transferring online, however all the professors were very flexible and understanding with internet issues and other struggles related to being online."
Sophomore,5,I really liked the atmosphere here. I enjoy that it was a small city. But then I was still close enough to visit St. Cloud or even drive down to the bigger cities in MN. I felt at home. The teachers are very nice and I was able to find connections I never would have if I went somewhere else.
Sophomore,5,My teachers were very accommodating to us having online courses. They kept them fun and exciting while still giving us the opportunity to learn.
Freshman,5,"The College of Saint Benedict is a strong, community-centered college that focuses on instilling Benedictine values into all aspects of life. Currently, they are partnered with Saint John's University to provide comprehensive, challenging learning environments for all students."
Sophomore,5,"I really loved the home- like atmosphere, when you go there is just feels like home. The feeling of the Community is like a one big family you will never feel alone."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere at College of Saint Benedict is very friendly and welcoming. Everyone is willing to help and answer questions. If someone cannot answer a question you may have, they help you find someone who can and then even follow up with you afterwards. They go out of their way to help students feel welcome. It's not hard for it to feel like a second home.  There's always someone willing to help with anything you need whether it be writing a paper or finding a campus job."
Junior,5,"Although we joke about over-using the term ""community"" at St. Ben's, I still find that term to truly describe our campus each and every day. There is a well-rounded mix of students, professors, monastic life, and St. Joseph community members that all share the same goal of helping Bennies thrive. Women at CSB are consistently supported in their aspirations while on campus and for the rest of their lives."
Niche User,5,"This catholic, liberal arts college located in Minnesota has an amazing music program and has over 600 acres of woods surrounding the school."
Freshman,5,I chose CSB because of their community values and their alumni involvement. The alumni of CSB/SJU reach out beyond college into the professional world.
Sophomore,5,"I love being at the College of Saint Benedict! I have really enjoyed my time here so far and I can't wait to be here for anohter 2 years. The food is amazing for college food and I don't know what I would do without it when I have such a busy schedule. The professors are wonderful and care for each student individually and their success. I have made a lot of friends and have been able to build my own home here from showing up and not knowing anyone. I don't party and I'm not a huge sports person. I spend a lot of my time working as a TA and a tutor and studying. The gym facilities are amazing and I use them pretty much everyday. The campus itself is beautiful yearround. Getting to have to two campuses together is really nice to have one in a little town and the other out in the woods with lakes and trails. Overall, my time her has been amazing and I couldn't have seen myself attending anywhere else."
Alum,5,"St. Ben's is a college that truly values every student. Every department, from Residential Life to Campus Security, works to build relationships with students. The professors do the same - they often make themselves available to help students with academic struggles or even general life advice."
Sophomore,5,"Love it! if your looking for a small school, helpful teachers, and a great learning environment, iÔ∏è really recommend!"
Freshman,5,"It's an overall ""well - rounded"" type of school. You get a little bit of everything here. The campus, the people, not to mention the food and professors are all wondeful"
Sophomore,5,"I could not love this school more! The community aspect of this college is unlike anything I have ever seen and the connections are limitless. Both of my parents are alumni and had an equally amazing experience, which is proof that this school has always been an exceptional college and will continue to be."
Sophomore,5,"The College of Saint Benedict is the most welcoming and friendly community based campus that I have ever set foot on. The Sisters of Saint Benedict are the most kind, gentle, and patient women and they make great friends to take advice from on campus. I have never found it hard to join clubs or activities because there is such an abundance. I find it very easy to make great friends that will last a lifetime. The professors at The College of Saint Benedict care about their students and strive to see them succeed. The programs offered at The College of Saint Benedict are some of the most prestigious programs known in the state. It has been a blessing to be a part of the most whole-hearted community that I have ever been a part of."
Freshman,5,"The community is incredibly friendly and the professors care about your education. As a first year, the transition between high school and college was somewhat bad, but I know it would have been a lot worse if I had gone to a different college. People saw my struggle and did what they could to help."
Sophomore,5,"The College of Saint Benedict not only provides excellent academics but it allows you to grow as an individual through the clubs and organizations on campus.  The small, liberal arts campus has helped me excel in my academics through one on one professor contact and the opportunities provided.  Not to mention the people you will meet at CSB are some of the most passionate and down to earth individuals, and they want to help you with every aspect of your life!"
Sophomore,5,"It is an amazing school with great professors that really care about your education. The education you receive at St. Bens is above any other. They do not only prepare you for your future profession, but they prepare you to be successful citizens within the community. I will never regret choosing to continue my education at the College of Saint Benedict. It is truly the best of the best in Minnesota."
Senior,5,"Attending the College of Saint Benedict is the best decision I have ever made. The community and atmosphere on campus are special and I am so grateful for all the memories I have made and people I have met here. As a senior in my last semester, I never want graduation to come. I never want to have to leave this place because I love it so much here. The campus is beautiful, the professors are great, the opportunities are endless, and the cost is completely worth it. I would recommend this school to everyone. Once a bennie, always a bennie. I love CSBSJU."
Freshman,5,CSBSJU has the greatest community! You won't find this at any other school. CSB and SJU teachers and staff are very welcoming and accepting and some professors even invite students to their homes for class instead of staying in the classroom! The Saint John's Abbey Arboretum is gorgeous and there are many trails and lakes to explore. CSBSJU is amazing!
Alum,5,"I had an absolute blast during my 4 years at CSB. Saint Ben's is a tightly-knit community where you can explore any of your passions. I was able to study abroad, participate in an intensive internship program, work a student job, and play a varsity sport. Everyone is highly involved in campus clubs and organizations which is a great way to meet new people. The friendly, welcoming atmosphere is one of the things I miss most now that I'm an alum. "
Freshman,5,"The school is great because you get to know so many people, and especially right away, everyone is looking to make friends too. Dorms could use an update though. Not bad but not that good. "
Freshman,5,"The campus is great!  It has a small town feel, but has everything I need.  Everything is only a walk away.  The RA's help make everyone feel comfortable and answer all of my questions.  There is great food options for whatever mood I'm in.  My dorm is full of fun and nice ladies.  I feel very safe wherever I am at on the campus.  There is tons of fun stuff to do and lots of places to just relax or study, too.  I would totally recommend this college to anyone."
College Sophomore,5,There are many resources that can be used from saint benedict that will help you find a job
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are the best, my professors know who I am and sometimes even know what type of activities I am involved in and cater to my schedule"
College Sophomore,5,Our life safety does a great job of keeping students in line while still giving us the freedom we need
College Sophomore,5,The school is currently constructing new turf fields for softball and soccer so we can play sooner
College Sophomore,5,The school makes me feel at home and it made the adjustment from high school much easier for me.
College Junior,5,Our alumni network is amazing and I have full confidence that I will go into a job/career field that I am interested in after graduation.
College Junior,5,I have had awesome professors throughout my year at CSB/SJU. They are all completely engaged in the class and make the most of each and every class period. We don't have lecture halls so classes are discussion based which helps students get to know each other and the professor better.
College Junior,5,I have never felt anything less than completely safe on campus. Our campus security is seen all over and are willing to help at anytime if you are in need of assistance or feel unsafe.
College Junior,5,"As a collegiate athlete, I couldn't ask for a better support system from our athletic staff. Everyone from the head coaches to the student trainers are approachable and cheering you on every day of the year."
College Junior,5,"I would choose CSB/SJU all over again. I love the small, community aspect of the school and the amount of help we get from professors when looking for internships and jobs is unbelievable. You can tell that your professors really want to see you succeed both in college and after college in the real world."
College Junior,5,"I have highly enjoyed my time at St. Ben's as a result of the true, meaningful friendships that I have made there in addition to the wonderful education that I have received. The professors are very passionate about working with the students and challenge them to their fullest extent."
College Freshman,5,There is a huge network of connections to help students find jobs/internships/shadowing opportunities. There are always recruiters on campus and there are multiple programs that set you up for future connections and experience.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very welcoming of new students when someone wants to learn to play something. The facilities are awesome and offer a variety of activities to participate in and many group exercise classes are student taught.
College Junior,5,"I feel very safe on campus, and our on campus security is very helpful and available to students when needed."
College Junior,5,"The Bennie Johnnie Network is amazing.  In our Career Services offices, we have something called the ""Cane Files"" which is a database with contact information of Bennie/Johnnie alum who are willing to network with and help graduates trying to find a job or internship."
College Junior,5,"The Bennie Johnnie Network is amazing.  In our Career Services offices, we have something called the ""Cane Files"" which is a database with contact information of Bennie/Johnnie alum who are willing to network with and help graduates trying to find a job or internship."
College Junior,5,"Athletics really bring our community together. Johnnie football in particular is a big deal at CSB/SJU! We have a gorgous stadium where students, alum, family and friends gather to cheer on the Johnnies! 

Additionally, students enjoy attending other sporting events such as hockey and basketball."
College Junior,5,"I am so happy at CSB/SJU.  The small size and Benedictine background makes for two schools with a strong sense of community and awesome culture all its own.  Ever since my first day as a freshman, I have felt welcomed and at home on both campuses.  I truly cannot say enough about these schools! My two favorite experiences so far have been being an elementary education major, and studying abroad for a semester in Greece and Italy.  Being a part of the elementary education major is truly like belonging to a family on campus.  Everyone is actively working toward the same goal.  It's so rewarding to attend classes and spend time with people of a shared passion, and I'm sure other majors have simialr experiences. Because of the small class sizes, you really bond with people in the same field as you.  Also, CSB/SJU has award winning study abroad programs, with opportunities in 17 different countries around the world.  I had the amazing experience of going on the Greco-Roman trip, which was truly life changing.  

Overall, I would not want to go to school anywhere else! The campuses are gorgeous, the people are friendly, and the academics and extracurriculars are wide-spread."
College Junior,5,"I love our school because of how close you can become with your professors. They know you by name and are always open to offering help or even just chatting! Registration is really easy and advisers are quite helpful! I have become really close with my adviser and biology faculty, they truly care about the students and not just about their own career goals/interests. Teachers first, researchers second."
College Junior,5,"There is absolutely nothing I would change about my school or my college decision. I am getting more than the worth I am paying for. I am more the person I want to be, have a better understanding of myself, and have learned so much academically while at CSB/SJU. Class sizes and labs are small so you really get to know your professors and build strong relationships with them and your classmates."
College Junior,5,"I say unique to describe the school because of the truly unique relationship and dynamic that occurs between the College of Saint Benedict (CSB) and Saint John's University (SJU). You only live at and ""officially"" belong to one of the two, but you take classes and have complete access to both. Just being on a campus would give you no clue that they are technically separate colleges. I love the smaller size of our institutions (4000 people or so between both CSB and SJU) because it allows you to get to know your professors really well and develop relationships with them as well as your peers. I would pick this school again and again because it is everything I imagined college would be (growing up) and more. The only down side is that there are no graduate programs except for the School of Theology, meaning we all have to leave after four years. The people I've met and experiences I've had are well worth everything I've done to get to where I am."
College Sophomore,5,New technology and 24/7 on campus security makes me feel safe
College Sophomore,5,Best school ever. It feels like a family and is crazy beautiful!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,THIS IS MY DREAM SCHOOL. I spent the best four years of my life there.
Recent Alumnus,5,The sports are fantastic because everyone gets so competitive and supportive even though it is a small school
College Freshman,5,"So far my experience at the College of Saint Benedict has been great. It's a small school with a great sense of community. Additionally, the professors are amazing and I can tell that they really care about their students."
College Freshman,5,"I feel at home at CSB.  The people are fantastic, and the sense of community makes for a comforting environment.  The study abroad options, available financial aid and quality of education here make for a great experience."
College Freshman,5,Love the sense of community and the fun opportunities CSB has to offer.
College Freshman,5,"So far my experience at school has been great!  It is a small school which gives it a great sense of community.  I felt very welcome in my school from the day I got there.  I would choose to go to this school again if I could do it all over because it is a place where I feel safe and comfortable, and know that there are people there who truly care about me and my future."
College Junior,5,The community and openness are amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"The College of Saint Benedict is the definition of community. All of the students and faculty are willing to help each other out. I could not imagine attending another school for post-secondary education. The school offers a wide variety of FREE events. From experiencing different cultures at Festival of Cultures to the fantastic Johnnie games. If I could do it all over, I think College of Saint Benedict would still be my number one college pick."
College Senior,5,Great food. But CSB's dining services are definitely better than SJU's.
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics are very important here. Students, staff, and families come to games to support the teams and keep the school spirit up. The biggest sport here is football, and not only do students take great pride on their team and school, they enjoy the support from fellow classmates and family. Aside form the athletics, club involvement is also of major importance here. Clubs work together to provide a variety of events, ranging from multicultural events to social outings. Professors, staff, and other faculty keep the motivation going by encouraging students to work together for the best of the community."
College Sophomore,5,I love being involved! It is a great way to meet people!
College Sophomore,5,"It is the perfect balance, Not too overbearing, yet safe"
Sophomore,4,"College of Saint Benedict did hybrid learning, like many other colleges. However they adopted a block schedule rather than a typical semester schedule we are used to seeing. A block schedule allows students to take a single four-credit course in an intensive, 4-week block. The block schedule will give students the opportunity to dive deeply into a topic and build strong community with peers and a professor. Every four weeks or so, students will move to a new block with a new four-credit course. By the end of the semester, students will have completed the same number of credits they would within our typical academic system (four classes for 16 weeks). Four-credit classes will meet Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday."
Senior,4,"I love CSB. I wouldn't trade my experience here for any other college. The only two negatives I have are that because it's a small-town college, it's hard to get any local internships in the social science field such as sociology, political science, law, etc... It's also SUPER expensive. I'm excited to announce that I'll probably have $75,000 in undergrad debt."
Senior,4,I did take my classes online during this pandemic and the teachers had a smooth transition for the most part during a difficult time. Many of them prerecorded videos of them teaching the material so we can watch it as much times as we needed and also rewind the material if we missed something. Live sessions were also held to ask questions as we saw fit.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience at this school has been very good. The professors care about what they teach and are willing to provide help, so long as you ask. The food is stellar. The community is unparalleled as it is joint with St. John's University, providing both a separation and a larger community when wanted.

I gave this college a four stars instead of five because I can say with certainty that it isn't easy to make friends, especially if you are introverted like myself. Orientation does a good job of exposure to new people, but if you aren't outgoing, turning those acquaintances into friends is nearly impossible. However, if you join groups and clubs with high involvement you should be alright."
Sophomore,4,"When Covid-19 hit, we had to switch online on short notice. CSB took this in stride. I always felt able to reach out to professors, even more than before. The flexibility was better than I expected. I was able to maintain my 4.0 even in the midst of a pandemic, which shows how much the school cared about helping its students. I wish they gave us easier ways to communicate with other students, as it was more of a student-professor setup and not student-student-professor. Felt very 1-1 which was nice, but it was isolating to not know what my classmates were thinking."
Sophomore,4,"So far I am enjoying my time at the College of Saint Benedict. I have a lot of friends, classes that spark my interest, and awesome professors. It lacks diversity but hopefully that will change."
Niche User,4,"I liked the College of Saint Benedict, it is a good school for people who like a smaller community, but it was not my top choice."
Sophomore,4,I really liked how the College of Saint Benedict has a wonderful community of people. They are all very nice and the people in my major are all enthusiastic and supportive.
Sophomore,4,"I love all of the people I've met so far on my collegiate journey. This school provides great resources for advancing your studies, your career, and your social circle!"
Sophomore,4,"Coming to the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University was probably one of the best decisions I have made throughout my life. Both the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University have their unique qualities to them, thus I like them each for separate reasons. One major bonus of going to a smaller private college is that you get to experience things that those at a larger state school would not get to experience. Such as the professors at both campuses will actually make an effort to learn and know your name. as well as you will not be seen as just another number but you will be seen as a college student. Also, the fall is the absolute best time to be on campus because all of the leaves are changing and it is gorgeous everywhere you go."
Sophomore,4,"It‚Äôs a great small catholic school. However, it does not feel small at all.
Great outdoors campus tgat provudes make outdoors experiences."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere! You won't find a Bennie or Johnnie who doesn't love CSBSJU! The only downside is that the friend groups tend to be very cliquey. But you will meet very nice people along the way! Classes are always small and the professors are always willing to help.
Sophomore,4,"College of Saint Benedict has been a great experience so far and I would not change my experience. The only thing I would like to see change is a more exclusive nursing program because ours is very small and only accepts 54 students a year. The professors are great for the most part. I‚Äôve had some really great connections with some of them and just a couple that have been there for awhile that I feel should not due to unorganization and overall course work they teach. However, I‚Äôm sure all colleges have professors like that, but that is my only concern that I wish had some improvement."
Junior,4,"I love the professors here! They are very dedicated to their students and are willing to give in their time to help students outside of class. There are also many great opportunities available for personal growth such as joining clubs, studying aboard, and fellowships. The career service here is amazing as well. They help critique your resume for you and help you find internships during the summer. As for academic advising, they help you set up a 4-year plan of what classes you will be taking each semester and will adjust if you plan to study abroad. One thing I would like to see improvements on is racial diversity within the staff/faculty and nonfaculty members. I think it is important that there is diversity within professors and nonfaculty members because some students may feel more comfortable with a professor or staff of color."
Sophomore,4,"The College of Saint Benedict is extremely committed to seeing all students succeed. One thing the campus underperforms is encouragement and discussion of different political thoughts. If I express my conservative thoughts in class, I am mocked by professors while students who express liberal ideas are praised.Scholarships dedicated to political engagement are given to students who identify as liberal over those who are conservative."
Alum,4,Overall the community there is pretty nice. All of the professors are very progressive and understanding of student diversity and generally care about the students. The school makes efforts to be inclusive and listen to the students. That doesn't mean that the school is perfect. There are still a lot of room of improvement when it comes to diversity and inclusiveness.
Freshman,4,"The professors are there to help you when you need additional help. The academics are rigorous, but there is a lot of available help to make them manageable. There is also a wide variety of clubs and activates that everyone can be involved in."
Freshman,4,"College of St Benedict is a great school, academic wise. Both campuses are absolutely beautiful with their surrounding lakes and woods. The drawback of this school is lack of diversity. If this college was diverse, it would be #1."
Sophomore,4,"The College of Saint Benedict is a very friendly community. I absolutely love the professors, along with the students who attend. I also love how you can commute to Saint John's University as well. Overall, it's a beautiful place to be scenery wise and people wise. I highly recommend!"
Freshman,4,"I absolutely fell in love with the College of Saint Benedict when I first toured it after my junior year of high school. The atmosphere was amazing and both campuses were beautiful. The food on campus tastes so good, I even miss it when I'm back home.  There's so many activities and clubs to take part in on campus! The academics are challenging and interesting as well."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are challenging, but the professors always make themselves available to you, which is great. There are always activities on campus, but we're an hour and a half away from Minneapolis, so it's not the most exciting place to be. Campus activities does a good job of planning fun events on campus. The campus is predominantly white, which can be challenging for minority groups."
Freshman,4,"Saint Benedict is definitely the college to go to if you want a small classroom environment, involved professors,  and comfortable dorms. While I would not necessarily call it diverse, Saint Ben's takes pride in its community. Also, the President (Mary Hinton) is the bomb.com. Everybody loves her and she makes all of the politics going on locally and nationally a lot easier to swallow. 
I would not recommend going in as a Nursing major, as that is a very competitive department here and you don't have much room to breathe. However, most of the other sciences (except Physics, the department is both underfunded and small.) Saint Ben's more ""liberal"" majors are much better and students rarely have negative things to say about them. Saint Ben's pre-law and pre-physical assistant programs are also very well managed, and there are many resources for students who are looking to pursue such programs to get more information."
Junior,4,I really like most everything about the College of Saint Benedict. They do a really good job of getting students involved and invested within the community. I love most of the people I'm around and feel I'm becoming a better person every year. Taking a bus between saint Bens and saint Johns isn't too bad but only getting a diploma from Saint Benedict is a little sad.
Niche User,4,"I have heard great things about Saint Benedict, and my if my application process and/or visit to their campus is reflected on those I would have to agree."
Junior,4,"This is a very nice college. We have a beautiful campus, great events and a variety of clubs or organisations that you can join. Beside, class size is small so you get to know the professor and can build a closed relationship with them."
Sophomore,4,"Very welcoming community. Great academics. Professors actually want you to succeed. Located in a small town, but about 15 mins aways from St. Cloud."
College Junior,4,Great professors and small class sizes
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is awesome because you have all the resources you need and its relatively close to the dining hall
College Junior,4,Dorms and apartments are all very spacious and nicely kept. bathrooms can be a little under kept at times and the lottery system can be a hassle.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are nice and as long as you work hard, you will get what you deserve to get."
College Sophomore,4,There are people with different background.
College Sophomore,4,It is a big part in our school.
College Freshman,4,"I love Saint Ben's. Again, the only thing that is not completely excellent is the people. The students who go there tend to be brought up very wealthy and lack understanding of real world problems as well as diversity."
College Freshman,4,"I had a friend who was sexually assaulted on campus this year and our school was very active in the case and were not tolerant of the assaulter, as it should be. He was expelled and no longer is able to set foot on our campus."
College Freshman,4,"The only problem with this school is that most of the kids who attend it are very privileged and can become cliquy if you did not grow up in the same way that they did or if you don't have very much money. However, the campus is beautiful and the profs are wonderful along with the classes that they teach. Great success come out of Saint Ben's."
College Freshman,4,"It is pretty safe in here, except there may be two or three events reported in each semester."
College Freshman,4,"There are many opportunities for students, just don't hesitate to ask and remember to attend all activities you are interested in, because it really helps."
College Freshman,4,I am happy to be a part in this school.
College Freshman,4,"In general, professors are very nice and helpful, and that is really good for my study. Except study, there are also many activities that students can participate in, and this enrich my college life."
College Junior,4,"On campus housing is great, and really brings people together! Great options for freshman through senior class."
College Junior,4,"I have been to some parties, but I don't go to a ton. I think they are really fun to go to, but there are other things to do as well!"
College Junior,4,"Its what you make it, you can pretty much find stuff to do within all scopes. Drinking, other activities, underaged nightlife, etc. Transportation is the easiest because of the Link Bus that runs between campuses!"
College Junior,4,"Campus security/Life safety are great, I never feel scared walking across campuses along regardless of the time of night. I've even returned from hospital shadowing at 5 am and felt totally safe walking back from the parking lot to my apartment on campus alone. The same goes for coming back after being with friends into the early morning, very safe"
College Junior,4,"THE ALUMNI NETWORK IS EXTRAORDINARY!! Actual research at our school is limited, however the career offices and even professors help a lot with finding other opportunities for research and internships!"
College Junior,4,"HOUSING IS SO NICE!!!! Both dorms and on-campus apartments are great to live in and nice!! The great thing is that there is 4 year on-campus housing, so you are ALWAYS guaranteed a place to live on campus! 99% of people do live on campus all four years, you have to apply to live off-campus and very few people are approved because there is not a lot of housing off-campus due to the size of the town of St. Joseph"
College Junior,4,"I think, being division three, the athletics here are special because while you are an athlete it is not the only piece of your identity here. Regardless, everyone goes out to support our varsity teams, the Johnnie/Tommie games every year are ESPECIALLY HUGE!!! School spirit is definitely not lacking! Intramurals are also a lot of fun, with a variety of difference activities year round open to all skill levels. Playing outdoor, co-ed intramural soccer is always the highlight of my fall!!"
College Sophomore,4,"Space is obviously tight as it would be at any college, but I love living with my friends!! The rooms are beautiful and close to everything on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Awesome stuff available on both CSB and SJU for all students.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. You can always call security to escort you if you do not feel safe
College Freshman,4,Professors are very well educated on their topics and want you to succeed
College Freshman,4,"For a first year dorm, my roommate and I both have plenty of space"
College Freshman,4,It feels like a very safe place and after only being here for semester I already feel very comfortable. There are always resources and people that want to help you if you are struggling.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a self defense class offered to women every year and assault and protection is talked about often at our school. There is a lot of security and life safety driving around campus, it is rare to walk to a building without seeing an officer."
College Sophomore,4,There is access to all of the alumni form CSBSJU on a simple data base. The career center is always accepting appointments and they teach you the best ways to communicate effectively with employers and alumni. Networking is a huge part of CSBSJU.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are interesting and class size is small. Most professors are very accommodating to each of their classes and are willing to change their syllabus to better the interests of the students. Social life is good, there are always events being hosted, sporting games to attend and performing art shows to watch. Most students work on campus and make their own money. Students are willing to learn from one another, attend mass or not attend mass. There have been very nice people and overall the school gets better and better each semester."
College Sophomore,4,Housing gets better and better every year!
College Sophomore,4,They have different hours for just men and for just women to work out. Both campuses welcome both genders and each has very nice facilities! One of the highest attendance at a division 3 school.
College Sophomore,4,"Freshman year is very difficult and hard to adjust to. The two different campuses I thought would be a great thing, but it turned out to be a bit of a burden. Sophomore year has been amazing and I finally feel acclimated."
College Junior,4,My school is fantastic. I knew I would be a Bennie the minute I step foot on the College of Saint Benedict Campus. I was drawn in by the lovely community CSB has to offer. I felt very welcomed by the students on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love CSB, the people are wonderful and the campus is unbeatable. The only thing that stresses me out sometimes is that there are not as many majors to choose from compared with state universities, so it is important to know that CSB has a major you are interested in before committing."
Senior,2,Don‚Äôt come here if you‚Äôre looking for any parties or a social aspect. The cops really cracked down and are serious about getting students in trouble. I‚Äôm only here for job placement and the classes.
College Junior,2,"The housing is nice. There are a lot of options to choose from, if you receive a good lottery number for choosing. The residential life rules are strict, though. No males quests are allowed to stay in the female dorms past specific hours (and vice versa) and they are never permitted to stay overnight in any of the dorms or apartments. It's a very outdated, yet upheld rule."
College Senior,2,"So hard to live off campus, but fun if you can make it work"
College Senior,2,"Life Safety (SJU) often goes out of their way to get people in trouble, but Campus Security (CSB) isn't as strict."
College Sophomore,2,They dont let very many people off campus.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot of options to dine outside campus.
College Sophomore,2,"We are forced to live on campus, or have to apply to be off. Not the full college experience"
College Sophomore,2,"If you came from a big city, you'll be frowning for a while. Sure, the campuses has a lot of events, but most people don't really take advantage of it. You will, and that's what'll keep you going in class because the campuses are in the middle of nowhere."
College Sophomore,2,"It's bad because there is only one sorority. We don't have a fraternity. And the sorority earlier doesn't throw parties either (that's not the bad part, I just thought it was suppose to be a college experience). The sorority is pretty much like a more private version of a normal volunteer club/group. They throw two big dances per year."
College Freshman,2,It gets super cold during the winter time. It's the worst when waiting in line for the bus during a snowy or rainy day.
College Junior,2,"The parking is probably one of the college's biggest flaws. The lots were not very well designed, and they force students to walk almost all the way across campus just to return to their dorm from their cars. Additionally, despite being a fully enrolled student of College of Saint Benedict, and therefore Saint John's University, my parking permit does not work on their campus. Why does a school that has so much pride in their ""two-in-one"" system not grant me the same benefits the opposites school's students? I pay enough to go to this school to be able to park at Saint John's for an hour to go to the library without getting a $50 ticket."
College Sophomore,2,I feel like we are expected to act like adults but we are treated like children. What's especially annoying is how guys can't stay at St. Bens and girls can't stay at St. Johns. Of course there are easy ways around this. I just think we are adults that should be able to make our own decisions on how we chose to live our lives.
College Sophomore,2,The only bar is 21+.  18 and older clubs are in the next city (15 minutes away).  Students throw parties on campus as well as student clubs.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus security only really checks students who are extremely loud or throwing up on the bus.  They don't walk around dorm rooms.  They only come if they are called by your neighbors or RAs.  Depending on your RD or campus, you may get a talking to, garbage duty, a fine or a warning."
College Junior,2,"This school has a 4 year residency plan. Every student is required to live on campus all 4 years. You can appeal to live off campus, but only about 40 or so groups are accepted each year. The process is a lottery. With that being said, the on campus housing is great and much more convenient."
College Sophomore,2,Life safety and is very strict about parties and such especially if there is drinking.
College Sophomore,2,At times it is difficult to find parking and for the freshmen it is usually way out.
College Sophomore,2,"More Cons Than Pros for Me ‚Äì I actually kinda regret coming here. My favorite thing about going to this school has by far been the friends I've made and I suppose the nature aspect of it, but even that quickly grows old, being this isolated. I don't particularly find this place that welcoming and there isn't too much to do."
College Sophomore,2,"Depends on What You Want ‚Äì Well, the schools are really in rural Minnesota, quite a drive away from the big cities so there really isn't a club scene at all, in addition to that fact that off campus living is limited to veeeeeeery few people, so there isn't too much partying...at all. 
The church and religious air of the campus however, I find extremely refreshing to a have a strong spiritual presence on campus. The church is also beautiful. 
Another thing that I really like is the fact that although its has a beautiful nature element with the woods and the lakes. They give some elements of tranquility to the hectic school year. 
Also, there seems to be a bit of trouble with the mobility between social groups after freshman year. Certain groups just hang out with social groups."
College Freshman,2,"Hot, Humid Summers & Cold, Bone-Chilling Winters ‚Äì This year was unusual. Most winters are full of snow until May sometimes, but this year was relatively warm. Not common. The weather sucks when walking from the bus to class or your dorm, but getting to and from the cafeteria is the worst, especially on the dark winter nights. Keep food in your dorm!"
College Freshman,1,Can never get off campus
College Sophomore,1,Really hard to get off campus housing
College Sophomore,1,"Caucasians everywhere. Not saying that it is bad, just the truth. Although we have students from various backgrounds, it will be very difficult because most students came from the Midwest. They're not use to it. There's a lot of segregation issues (other than the obvious gender thing since we all live on two different campuses) that will agitate you."
College Sophomore,1,"For two years, girls are required to choose the 'unlimited' plan. Boys will be jealous, but it's super expensive. Plus, the meals are the same all the time. I'm sick of it."
College Freshman,1,We do not have any Greek life groups here! 
College Junior,1,"When you are a Junior living in the west apartments on campus, the only lot close by has about 20 spots... It sucks to park 1+ miles from your apartment if you just went grocery shopping."
College Sophomore,1,"We call the state Minnesnowta for a reason.  Sometimes it is painfully cold.  With the snow storms our school buses may not be able to run and classes can be cancelled.  Otherwise, its pretty when the snow falls.  Students find fun things to do.  We do have lakes on campus and students sometimes walk on the frozen lakes or skate on our home-made skating rink on the males' campus."
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are cheap, only costing $150. The parking, however, is horrible. First year students have to park at least a 15 minute walk from their dorms which can be difficult to deal with in the Minnesota winter. The school devotes gigantic lots to guest parking only, so students can never park in the most convenient lots. If you are in an incorrect spot for just 10 minutes, you can guarantee you will have a ticket when you return. There is little need for a car on campus because we have a bussing system that goes between campuses and into town on weekends."
College Sophomore,1,The weather isn't as well. It is quite bipolar in Minnesota. It take time to check the weather daily in order to dress for it.
College Sophomore,1,"The School Does Not Allow Students to Live Off-Campus. Students must live on-campus all four years unless there is a reason why the student must live off-campus. Being married, medical purposes, and having parents that live within ten miles of the school are a few reasons why students might be able to live off-campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing Hiding Here ‚Äì While you won't hear about it on a daily basis, there is definitely some drug use on campus, but nothing too hardcore. Alcohol, on the other hand, is very prominent and weekend events are discussed constantly."
College Sophomore,1,"Generally...The Parties ‚Äì The parties are already very few and far between. If parties are held at SJU, they must be registered, a lot of info have to be given and you aren't allowed to have more than 20 people in the apartment (really?). 
Then, if you want to party in St. Joe at CSB, the parties are typically house parties consisting of people just standing around listening to music and drinking. Dancing is pretty rare up here. These parties are also typically only for people invited so if you don't know the people who live in the house, you're screwed. 
Also, this will soon come to an end because of the new policy of not allowing students to live off campus. Also, if there is a decent party in st. Joe, they typically get shut down by the police before it gets really good."
College Sophomore,1,"First of all, I'm simply going to speak from my experiences with SJU Life safety. I really have no qualms with the CSB securtiy. SJU life safety are extremely intrusive, profile people and to overboard with their jobs as essentially mall cops on a campus. They feel they have the right to barge into anyone's apartment or dorm if there's an inkling of something they feel is being done against the rules. Also, there seems to be terrible record keeping, as I've had multiple parties shut down, due to the claims by officers that they weren't registered (which they were and I had emails to prove it.). Also, as an international student from the Caribbean, I personally believe they profile. There was an incident when another friend of mines from my country and myself were accused of smoking weed by them without any proof (we've never smoked in our lives). I personally just detest everything about the SJU Life safety patrol and find them extremely overbearing and obnoxious."
College Sophomore,1,Can't Live Off Campus ‚Äì no longer allow people to live off campus unless there are special circumstances.
College Sophomore,1,"Not much parties.  The most exciting place to me is 20 minutes away from campus but without a car, your screwed. The bar is the mot lively scene on the weekends but you got to be 21. For those underage students, good luck finding an upbeat spot."
College Freshman,1,"Well, it's Minnesota. It's cold for 7 months out of the 9 that you'll be here. Make sure to keep food in your room so that you can hibernate and only emerge for classes."
College Freshman,1,"Free for All ‚Äì Very lax policies. They might shame you for drinking out of a plastic water bottle or printing one-sided, but if you're drinking or having sex they turn a blind eye."
College Freshman,1,"Off Campus ‚Äì Well, there's a pizza place, a sub place, and a coffee shop.  Unless you drive to the next town... get used to campus dining."

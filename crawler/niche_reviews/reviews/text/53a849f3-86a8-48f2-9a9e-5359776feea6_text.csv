Sophomore,5,This campus is great and everyone is so accepting. This is a campus where anyone can feel at home and welcomed by all.
Junior,5,Goshen College has a special place in my heart because since the first time I went there I felt like it was home. Everyone treated me so well that I forgot that I was in a different country than Brazil. People there are awesome and are always available to help.
Sophomore,5,"Great experience, overall! There were some conflicts on campus among students but my personal experience was positive. I was able to meet nice people and I was accepted into the community."
Junior,5,The professors and administrators are extremely helpful and compassionate. They want to see their students succeed.
Freshman,5,Goshen has a great diverse campus. And the professors want to connect with you and are invested into your academic career.
Senior,5,"Goshen College is a small school, focused on community, and christ-centeredness.  Goshen was a great pick for me."
College Sophomore,5,"Goshen College is such an amazing place, and I am convinced more each day that this is the place where I was meant to be.  I have made such good friends, and I've already had many amazing opportunities in my first year and a half here.  The professors love their content areas, and they truly care about their students and want us to succeed.  My only quibble is the expensive price tag.  I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything, though."
College Freshman,5,"Goshen is great at giving scholarships - 99% of Goshen students receive financial aid, and the average aid package is around $20,000. The financial aid process is generally smooth and uncomplicated, and students tend to be very happy with the packages they end up receiving. Goshen gives generous aid for academics, and for international students, as well as for sports and music. Given the amount of aid, and the quality of education offered here, Goshen has very high value."
College Freshman,5,"I love the athletic community. It is tons of fun to go to varsity sports events and cheer on the teams. I also participate in a lot of intramural sports, which are a ton of fun as well."
College Freshman,5,"I love the dorms because of the community they provide. The rooms and buildings themselves are quite nice in comparison to other campuses that I've seen, and there are a lot of common areas with comfortable couches, TVs and appliances. People hang out in them a lot and it provides a great community experience."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is one of my favorite parts about Goshen. The small size makes for a great, warm community. There are always things going on, and the social atmosphere is fun, friendly and inclusive. The dorms are all part of one building, and there are lots of lounges and places to hang out in the dorms, as well as a great coffee shop called Java Junction on the first floor. Laundry is FREE. 

Cost is pretty standard, and the housing process is easy and generally goes smoothly. The dorms are conveniently located on campus."
College Sophomore,5,We have excellent security and all the students are very safe around each other
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is great and friendly because we all know each other
College Junior,5,"The work is difficult and pushes you, but the professors are very passionate about what they teach and are easy to communicate with. The school wants to challenge you but also wants to see you succeed. I am learning all different aspects of journalism, not just writing, and it's helping me be a well-rounded student."
College Junior,5,"The work is difficult and pushes you, but the professors are very passionate about what they teach and are easy to communicate with. The school wants to challenge you but also wants to see you succeed. "
College Junior,5,"Dining on campus is very diverse. If you like to cook, you have resources, but they also have a very large, diverse buffet style cafeteria. Every day there is a salad bar, a cold side bar, a sandwhich station, a pizza station, a grill, a main meal item, a fusion bar, and a desert stand. Every day there is also an option for vegans."
College Freshman,5,"A dry campus, so on campus is very good even if there is some drinking.  Off campus can be scary, but they also can't control that."
College Sophomore,5,Nothing Like a Menno School – Being a Mennonite school GC has some pretty unique things on campus. We often enjoy wild hymn sings or dance parties. You don't often hear about parties and drugs. The best thing is that they offer unique ways of teaching that is vital to our generation.
College Sophomore,5,"Small Town Living – I personally love living in a small town, where everyone knows who everyone is, and that is the atmosphere at Goshen."
College Junior,5,"Peace by Peace – We strive for peace, starting with our college community and reaching out to the city and the world. Peace by peace we will change the world, because we work together, though we are different races and ethnicities. Goshen College is full of peacemakes!"
Sophomore,4,I love the community that is Goshen College. I feel that some classes and professors could be improved or improve their teaching but other than that it is an amazing school.
Junior,4,"It’s a very open and accepting place, but sometimes people (like professors) have preconceived notions about students and that can make the learning environment difficult."
Freshman,4,"It's such a friendly environment, everyone from staff to the students are so sweet. When I visited before enrolling, the staff was beyond helpful through the entire process, they took time explaining everything to my family and me. I would recommend Goshen to anyone, I was worried due to my identity and race I wouldn't feel welcome but this college is the most accepting and friendly campus I have ever visited."
Senior,4,Goshen is a wonderful place to spend 4 years! There are many smiling faces around and you are guaranteed to know at least 1 person in each class. Class sizes are small so you get to know your professors and classmates very well. Goshen tries to cultivate diversity and tries to acknowledge its privilege. There is always room to grow in those areas but overall and the effort is made.
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Goshen College has consisted of meeting people from different countries all over the world. Here at Goshen College, we are very diverse and respectful of one another. What I like about Goshen College is that you do not go without a day that someone just randomly smiles at you and asks how your day is going. We are very friendly and caring."
Alum,4,Goshen College offers a Social Work tract for adult learners.  This format was excellent as courses were held in the evenings and the cohort consisted of other adult learners.
Junior,4,This is a good College to go to the students are friendly and can get to know the professors personally. It's a small liberal arts school that is good for anyone looking for a small college environment.
Freshman,4,Goshen College is one of the best schools in the country that is involved with its students personally and religiously.
Senior,4,"As a music major, Goshen College has phenomenal facilities! The concert hall is comparable to Carnegie Hall, and international names come through regularly to perform. Because the college is small, class sizes are often around 20 students, and professors are very accessible."
Junior,4,"As a nursing student, I like the experience of being a nursing student at Goshen College because they have a really good nursing program and the teachers are pretty nice. As an international student, i love being with other students from different countries. I am happy to be at Goshen, but the only thing that we can change is tuition. Too expensive. But I know that there are people who can afford it."
Sophomore,4,"As an International student, I have found a home in this campus. In this comparatively small liberal arts college, I can walk across the campus and see the familar faces. The professors are also very welcoming and are ready to work one on one with the students."
Sophomore,4,"I love Goshen's acceptance of all people, whatever their sex, gender, race, religion, nationality, etc. I've made friends with people from around the world to people in my home town that I had never met before. I'm a science major, and the sustainability efforts on this campus have amazed me, as well as professors that care about preparing their students for the work force or for graduate school."
Freshman,4,"I really liked Goshen College's passion for service to the community and to learning.  Also, there seems to be a strong sense of unity on Campus where everyone is treated the same and everyone gets along.  It is a welcoming place and a very peaceful environment."
Sophomore,4,It is a great school and for the most part the people on campus are very friendly. The biggest issue is with server errors (wifi going down) and sometimes following the menu in the dining hall.
Niche User,4,"Goshen College is a great small university that lets you have tight-knit relations with both your peers and professors. They allow you to be innovative, creative and best of all, they motivate you to do you best."
Senior,4,"I discovered my passion at Goshen College. When I began as a freshman, I was studying biology but was unsure of what career would be best for me. I quickly began to doubt that my calling was in biology. Thanks to a couple professors and a friend that I met at Goshen College, I was encouraged to change my major to broadcasting. It was in Goshen College’s communication department that I discovered my passion for journalism and TV news. A professor in that department saw my potential, invested in me, and even helped me get a job at a local TV news station. Goshen College is known for academic excellence despite its small size. The advantage of the smaller campus is that students receive more personalized guidance. The campus is also very diverse, with the population of Hispanic students increasing to almost 30 percent. I only wish the college had more black students, but the college is already making efforts to increase its black student population."
Junior,4,"From the application process to the first day of class, the follow right along with you. The staff and faculty take the time to know you and your interests. The college over lots of events for students and the community as well. The college is close to downtown and not far from local establishments."
College Senior,4,I feel that I am getting what I wanted out of college; a good education and good resources to help me after graduation.
College Senior,4,The college puts on quiet a few job fairs that are very useful in getting students internships that often lead to job offers.
College Senior,4,I haven't heard of any crimes occurring on campus before.
College Senior,4,I really like how my school has a community day each semester where students go out into the community and partake in some time of community service. I feel that it is nice that we are given opportunities like this to give back to our community.
College Senior,4,A lot of support to get internships
College Senior,4,My teachers are very supportive of my goals.
College Senior,4,"Great facilities to play sports, inter-murals, as well as work out."
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed the last three years at my school. I have been presented with so many opportunities and I have learned so much. The school works hard to be open to all students regardless of sexual orientation, gender, race, etc and I really appreciate that."
College Junior,4,There is always security walking around or driving around 24/7. I feel very safe on this campus and am not really ever concerned with my safety.
College Junior,4,I am getting my degree in ASL Interpreting which is extremely valued in the real world.
College Junior,4,Overall the professors here at Goshen College are extremely involved and dedicated to their work. The class room sizes are relatively small making the relationships between professors and students stronger. I believe that the education and professors here is definitely one of the biggest things this school has going for it.
College Freshman,4,"I don't see crime on campus so I genuinely feel safe. The security guards are always driving through campus, even late at night and everything is fine."
College Freshman,4,Living in the dorms is pretty great. The rooms are pretty big with lots of events all the time to get to know more people.
College Freshman,4,The school is very supportive of their sports team. Especially the soccer team.
College Freshman,4,I like this school so much because of the community it promotes. It is very welcoming and full of diversity.
College Junior,4,I am in a associates degree of nursing to a bachelors degree in nursing that meets at my place of employment.
College Freshman,4,"Goshen has teams in baseball, basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, cross country, track and field, and volleyball. Soccer games are the most well attended, and being part of the fan section is a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"The campus administrative policies are in place to improve students' experiences here at Goshen. Since Goshen is a Mennonite institution, there are pretty strict rules about alcohol and drug use, and upholding community standards. RAs do most of the rule enforcement at the dorms, and they're generally effective but understanding. Our security guards are friendly and helpful. Punishments for breaking rules can be heavy, especially for repeated offenses."
College Freshman,4,"I have no problems with it. I don't go off campus to eat very much, because the dining hall is very good, but it is nice to have the option for late at night, and I am always very satisfied."
College Freshman,4,"There are usually a few parties every weekend at Goshen. Goshen is a dry campus, but not everyone follows this rule, of course. Parties take place at off campus houses (or when the weather is warm, in the woods with a bonfire), and are usually pretty great. Since we're a smaller school, you're very unlikely to be in any kind of dangerous situation, as often happens at bigger schools. People often drink or smoke weed, but there isn't much of a scene for harder drugs here. 

The best thing about the party scene here is that it's not mandatory, nor exclusive. There are plenty of fun things to do on weekends if partying is not your thing, and if you'd like to go to a party, there's no pressure to do anything you're not comfortable with."
College Freshman,4,"I had a really good experience with financial aid, but I do know that I got one of their best packages. I'm not sure about other people. They do have a lot of different scholarships though, and it is very easy to apply for them."
College Freshman,4,"There is a fairly diverse selection of food. It is always good quality and I don't have any problems with it. The cafeteria staff are very nice, and they respond to any suggestions you have very quickly."
College Freshman,4,"For such a small school, food at Goshen is pretty great. Westlawn Dining Hall (affectionately known as the Rott), is our only dining hall. There's a salad bar, hot entrees, sandwiches, tea/coffee, a deli, pasta, fusion, desserts, plenty of drink options, and soft serve ice cream. There are a good number of vegetarian options, and most anything can be made gluten free by request. The Leaf Raker is another dining option, which is more like a diner. The food is fantastic, and students can pay using  normal money or Munch Money (we're given munch money each semester depending on our meal plan). Java Junction is the coffee shop in the dorms. The coffee is excellent, and there's tons of options (including smoothies, milkshakes, pastries, bubble tea, and bagels/snacks)."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are older, but tolerable. Upperclassmen apartments are new and really nice."
College Sophomore,4,They are strict when they need to be
College Sophomore,4,You have to have a 2.7 GPA to be in the nursing program
College Sophomore,4,For a small campus there are a lot of great things about it. You can take a blanket almost anywhere on campus and just relax.
College Sophomore,4,It's a small town that you can get used to very quickly. There aren't a lot of places to hang out but when you find one it becomes a regular hang out.
College Sophomore,4,I really like getting to know the people on campus on a personal level since we don't have very many people. And it's really easy to get involved in school activities.
College Junior,4,Network reliability is good.  Speed is good.  Great idea to provide students with their own iPads as well.
College Junior,4,Goshen has a great support for diversity on campus. The only thing that I would point out is that sometimes they are so supportive of the diverse aspect that they cannot accept those who are not of a diverse lifestyle/origin.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Goshen College is located in a great part of Goshen, Indiana, and while there are many different attractions and options withing walking or biking distance, it is also very scenic."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Just like any school, if you are looking for it, you'll find it. However, if you dont want to be involved in all that, then it is not too hard to avoid it."
College Freshman,4,Soccor is the biggest sport on campus. Either that or baseball! Everyone is so passionate about it and the games are always exciting to go to. It's a lot of fun seeing everyone getting all rallied up!
College Freshman,4,I have never felt like I was in any danger on campus. I even leave my doors unlocked because I'm not concerned to much about anyone wanting to take things out of it or if anyone would. All the students are polite and decent enough although I know that not everyones perfect. The school itself has given security numbers to every student and if I were afraid to walk across campus by myself I know that I have them to call and they'll walk with me.
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe and secure, but I am also not out late off of campus, so I'm not sure how good the escort services might be.  I keep my door locked, but there has been no theft in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"The health is really good, there are alot of options for people to eat. They also have the rec center which is open for excersise. The good thing is that it is a drug free campus so we have no alcohol, or anything like that. The security is really good to because we have cameras all over and there is always someone on the look out checking for any abnormalities. We have not had any crimes or anything, so I feel really safe there."
College Freshman,4,"The college does a good job of having computers always available. We have a lab open 24 hrs and it is easy to get in with your card. Our class actually recieved ipads so that helps us out alot. The network if fast, the only thing is that there are not printers everywhere."
College Sophomore,4,You Will Get Kicked Out of School – This is something that you dont often hear about because you can and will be kicked out of school because of this. If there is drug use it will be off campus and very hush hush. Not many people would even consider bringing it up because the school will not go easy on them.
College Sophomore,4,Beautiful Campus – Though GC is a very small campus it is very pleasing to not only the eyes but also the soul and brain. We have everything from top rated music halls to buildings that are rich in college history and aged to perfection. There are so many things to do that it's hard to be bored. With the many sports going on and jam secessions there is something for everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"An Interesting Place – There are a lot of activities going on every weekend, many chances to get to know more people on campus, and people here are friendly."
College Sophomore,4,"Many Available Spaces – We  have many parking lots at the college. We have a lot by the apartments, by the dorms, and visitor parking by the Music Center. Theres also some parking by the classrooms. It doesn't fill up to the full capacity unless we have a special event."
College Junior,4,Helpful but Not Enough – I got a decent amount of financial aid and it was a smooth process but it just was not enough to cover all the cost.
Junior,2,"Some good people and beautiful campus, but once you’re here you might as well stay because credits from Goshen College hardly transfer. Also, far-left politics are shoved down the students’ throats."
Sophomore,2,What I like that everyone is welcomed but what I don't like that they do not give a lot of scholarship to others that live close. Not a lot of opportunities and its a really expensive school with the little that they offer. It should be a public school instead of private.
Freshman,2,"This is a school that praises diversity, and peace throughout the community regardless of your background or views, but the campus itself could not be more wrong. Goshen College is very diverse in race, however if your political views do not match those of the school, students and staff will do everything in their power to make your experience as difficult as possible. Beware, if you are a conservative you are not welcome here"
College Junior,2,Overall the teams are not very successful nor are they very well funded.
College Sophomore,2,Its a very small school so it is far from a party school. The parties aren't that great.
College Sophomore,2,It's difficult to get good financial aid
College Junior,2,"We don't have a separate 'Greek' life. There are no sororities or fraternities. No matter the ethnic background, students are generally non-judgemental."
College Sophomore,2,"Average. Very slow, and kind of old.  My laptop that is two years old works better than the ones here."
College Sophomore,2,Lost in the 90'S – Our labs are very low tech and used a lot. The closest labs that people usually use only have three/ four computers in them and one is often not working. The computers themselves are also very old and tend to slow down at peek use hours. There is also a lab that is open 24 hours but it is across campus the farthest from the dorms you could get.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Great Selection – Either the off campus apartments are too far and expensive, or their close and cheap, but not well maintained. If you searched hard enough, you may find one that fits you, but most you'd want to have a couple roommates in on the deal."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Tasty – We have the West Lawn Dinning Hall and the Leaf Raker on campus. I am not a fan of either places, but I prefer the Leaf Raker. The Leaf Raker has fast food types of options whereas the dinning hall has more ""home cooked"" meals. The food at both places isn't flavorful and there are not many options."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Options without a Car – If you don't own a car or know someone who will lend you a car, you're gonna have to bum rides or hoof it."
Sophomore,1,"Goshen College is just not well organized. There is staff leaving last minute before school starts and trouble finding staff before the school year even starts. The college doesn’t help with financial aid and don’t want people to really live off campus. They have certain rules in order to be able live off campus.  Like other reviews, if your political views and overall views don’t coincide with the college they breathe down your throat and make it very hard on you and your personal views. Overall, Goshen College is just an unorganized institution."
Sophomore,1,"It's not a very good value. The school is incredibly expensive, and the school has little to no name brand recognition. Student life is awful for those who are not Mennonite. There is someing on campus known as the ""Menno wall."" This is the divide between the Mennonites and non Mennonites. Professors are all from the same background, and the agenda of the school is obviously in one direction. If you disagree or go against the mainstream college views, you will be called out and penalized by staff as well as other students. Please... save your money."
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life at Goshen College
College Sophomore,1,We don't have a greek life but I think it would be cool to start one.
College Sophomore,1,"Lets Hope You're a Good Kid – GC has high standards and they expect for their students to live up to them. Being a religious school they have values and morals that they want you to follow and if you don't the outcomes are harsh. Drinking on campus is a huge No no and even off campus drinking can result in being kicked out of school. Along with various other actions. If you're a good kid, you don't have to worry. But if you like to party and have a crazy time- Maybe GC isn't the best choice."
College Sophomore,1,Not an Option – Goshen College does not allow its students to live off campus unless they fall under certain categories such as if the student is married or living with their parents.

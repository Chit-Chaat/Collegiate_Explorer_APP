Freshman,5,Although I'm not on campus this semester due to COVID-19 I am fully online. I feel as if I am part of a family while I am attending Albany. I love it and I accnot wait for years to come.
Freshman,5,"When the Pandemic came during the month of March, all classes were implemented to online and it was seamless.  I was able to maintain my grades and the Professors were always prompt with getting back with you of you needed assistance."
Freshman,5,The Professors and Staff here really seem to care for students.  The environment is like a big family which means a lot when you are far from home.
Freshman,5,Culture is like no other. Teachers and staff are very supportive. School pride is great. Food is good.
Sophomore,5,This is a great school. There will always be someone that makes you feel welcomed away from home. The staff is very understanding.
Freshman,5,"This is my first year attending Albany State University and I can say it has a good experience. Although, Covid-19 has impacted and interrupted my full experience at the school, I will say for the two months that i was on campus it was really fun. The campus was nice and everyone is friendly, they have good food and it is overall a very nice school. There are always student events going on and this school is heavy on student engagement."
Freshman,5,Although the Covid-19 had came around and mess up my tour on visiting Albany State University. I have meet people that that will be attending the same time as me and I think Albany was a great choice. Everyone that will be attending their in the fall are very out going and full of adventure. I don't believe choosing Albany was a mistake. This is probably the best choice for me.
Junior,5,Albany State is a great HBCU. The professors and leaders at the school truly want the beat for you. The student leaders are always engaging and have something planned for everyone. The city may be small but you can always find something to do. It’s overall a great school.
Junior,5,Albany State is a great HBCU. The professors and and leaders at the school want the best for you. The student leaders are always engaging with everyone and always have something planned for everyone. The only thing is that you have to pay attention to the classes that you need and not depend on your advisor to plan everything out for you. Look at your degreeworks and tell them which classes you want to take in the upcoming semester because some of them will try and make you stay longer than needed.
Niche User,5,"Albany is to be told a great school with an awesome learning environment. There are many activities and programs you can be in, so there will never be a dull moment."
Niche User,5,I will be attending the school in the fall however on my visit I enjoyed how welcoming the students were. Albany has a wonderful environment with a lot of history. The class sizes are similar to high school classes.
Niche User,5,"Your real true self may be hiding so in order to find yourself you have to look within. In order to figure out what you want to do with your life, you may have to go through some things to figure it out. It's going to be difficult but it will be worth it in the long
 
	On this occasion, I had to look within myself back to my beginning years to find out who I am. I have went through a lot of things that made me a better person in and out of school. The person I am today has aided me throughout this whole school year. Being myself and staying positive has helped me achieve a lot."
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely AMAZING! The staff are friendly! The food is amazing and they get you the help you need in a timely fashion!
Junior,5,"When I first entered Albany State University, I was very overwhelmed with the large amount of people on campus. Due to my bad experience in high school, I assumed that a lot of people at this university would be the same. However, I was quickly surprised to find out just how nice my fellow classmates were. Furthermore, the staff members were also really great as well. It took some to adjust and change my mentality, but I managed to make a family that I will never forget."
Sophomore,5,I like how every student around campus don’t judge they help and get along with everybody so well. I enjoy meeting people and being out with others from down areas. The counselors and directors are helpful they don’t stop helping by any means necessary. They have transportation to take you to two campuses and the Tam spirit is awesome.
Freshman,5,My experience at Albany State University has been amazing. The professors try to work with the student to help them pass the class. I would recommend this school to any student that is considering going to Albany State.
Freshman,5,The things I like about Albany State is that everybody is like a family. The professors want to see you excel at anything you're doing if it's academics or athletics. Something I would like see change is the campus safety. With all the kidnappings going sometimes I don't really feel safe with the lack of security on the campus.
Freshman,5,I love my HBCU it’s a great college. They have a lot planned for students on campus. The food is great is like a good home cooked meal. Everyone is nice and friendly. Everyone also looks at each other’s as family. The only down fall is that it’s in the middle of no where there’s nothing to do down there. Otherwise i love Albany State University.
Senior,5,Albany State is where I have been able to grow into a man and fully be able to express myself as well as learn myself and others around me. For the 2018-2019 academic year I served as Mister Albany State University and had the honor or representing not only the males at our institution but the institution as a whole. It really is a family orientated university that wants its students to succeed and be able to grow. The career services team is outstanding in its efforts to provided the means necessary for one to be able to be successful post graduation. I love my HBCU.
Sophomore,5,It is a great HBCU and university. All walks of life and acceptance is here and thrives here. Everyone has there own talents and shares and uplifts the community.

The professors really do make sure that the students are successful and they are willing to work with you. The dorms are great and the housing staff is wonderful, they are extremely welcoming. The students at Albany state are very involved on campus, you barley see anybody just hanging out in there room all the time. On campus there are a number of things to do and plenty of clubs that you can become a part of.  At Albany state, they do take safety here very seriously and whenever something is happening on campus that is out of line, ASUPD is very quick to respond but usually you don't have to worry about anything because overall this is a safe campus."
Junior,5,My overall experience at this school has been very good.  I just entered into my OTA program and I love it so far.  The instructors are very thorough and hands on.  This program will teach me to be a better person not just an Occupational Therapy Assistant.  There will be growing pains I'm sure but I am ready.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to Albany State, the students that go here are friendly and straight forward. The dorms are comfortable on both the east and west sides. My first year was nothing but great . I started my college life in a great hotel the school put me in because i was on the waiting list. The classes i started with were a great start to college life, spaced out a very good degree so i can socialize and get my bearings. My overall experience at Albany has been pretty good."

Albany state is a very diverse school i really don’t have nothing to change about the school .
Freshman,5,My first time on Albany States campus was not only an Amazing experience but also a cultural experience for me. Getting to see students who were just Like me and not ashamed to be themselves was such a heart warming feeling. My Advisor was not helpful but she genuinely cared about my success and comfort at the school. Everyone on Campus for the most part are very hospitable and will go out their way to help you around campus. In all the school is a great school.
Sophomore,5,Albany State is a great first experience school and I suggest to all upcoming freshman to attend my wonderful HBCU
Sophomore,5,"I loved that the professors took out time to help students that needed more assistance with hesitation.

I would change the admission requirements, tuition, and fees."

The teachers are very friendly , and committed into teaching their students. I enjoyed living on campus because I got to learn how to be independent.

I would recommend any young fresh out of high school student to enroll here. I would also recommend for high school students to try dual enrollment as well."
Freshman,5,"I wanted to start off close to home and Albany State has given me a great start with an at home feeling . Classes has been challenging and the instructors have been very helpful and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this university to any student. the city itself is very small and the crime rate is high but my advice is to surround yourself with positive, good people and stay in areas that you are familiar with. The campus is beautiful and newly renovated. The dorms are very nice and there are a lot activities offered on campus . So I would definitely recommend this university."
Junior,5,"SUNY at Albany is a great school which I am extremely excited to be attending in the fall of 2019. UAlbany has many great programs to get involving like , arts, sports, and clubs.

Freshman,5,"I love how the professors make sure every student understand before moving to another module. The students are very nice and friendly. There is a very welcoming environment and the class ratio for student to teacher is amazing. The class size is large enough to make new friends but, small enough for a student to get enough help for the teacher and teachers to help other students as well."
Freshman,5,The school has plenty of things for you to do so your four years their wont be stressful. You will make plenty of friends and some of them may end up being longtime friends that you have. It's up to you to get involved and show your school spirit just remember that
Senior,5,Teachers are excellent and make it fun to learn. The food on the campus is great and the parties at the school are epic.

Freshman,5,"I love Albany I’m just trying to get back, I wish the finacial system wasn’t like it is because it’s causeing a huge drop out rate ."
Sophomore,5,Great nursing program! The admissions and academic team were very helpful. They went above and beyond to help me and my friend get into the school.
Junior,5,Albany state really help me find myself and come out my shy shell. I learned so much about just being vocal and they make me very comfortable with myself. Every here is like a big family we all help each other. The athletics here are amazing I love to go support them and they never let down. The food is great and definitely on fried chicken Wednesday we have done of the best cooks
Sophomore,5,I like the environment. the students and instructors are very friendly and helpful. but one thing I would like for them to change at the school is the acceptance rate. they accept way too many people that there isn't enough space in the housing provided.
Alum,5,"Albany State University gave me the foundation for my success. Everything I have accomplished I owe to Albany State University. Not only did I depart ASU with a college degree but a Commission in the US Army as well. ASU gave me the foundation to earn both a master's degree and a doctoral degree. After teaching for 24 years as a college professor I am now doing postdoctoral work at Princeton (PTS). I have traveled the world and enjoyed occupying spaces that otherwise would have been unimaginable had it not been for the foundation laid at Albany State University!  I am and will forever be indebted to ASU.           
Dr. Larry Covin, Jr."

Freshman,5,"I think Albany state is a great school to further my career and education experiences. In August I will be attending this university as a upcoming freshman majoring in mass media/communications. I just really excited to attend this school and meet new people. Also because this school allows students to realize their potential. Student are able to gains many qualities, skills, and techniques that can use once they move from college to the real world. Also ASU is a small campus where students are able to get tutoring session, quality time with professors, and network on the campus."

Professor.com before Registering for a course to review teacher ratings"
Freshman,4,"There’s many things I love about Albany State including the campus itself , the sweet people around campus and the overall love at the campus. Although there are many things I don’t like about the campus including the dorms being so far away from campus or having to travel from one campus to the other and also not being able to have the bus running on Sunday’s . But other than those things the campus is really great !"
Sophomore,4,I would love to see middle class students have the opportunity to get more access to their funds due to financial aid services
Sophomore,4,"Albany state university helped me find myself personally. I am now a sophomore here at the unsinkable Albany state. I am so thankful for the people I met here. They some what made me who I am today. This place taught me to do whatever it is I dreamed of and not to let distractions stand in the way. Also, that it’s all up to YOU. Take steps to better yourself so you can better you self. Procrastination is your biggest enemy once you master that the world is yours."
Freshman,4,"Albany State University is truly a big family. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The staff treats you like you're their own. The professors work with you and make sure you get the best grade possible. And the food is great! There are plenty of groups and organizations for everyone, everybody is welcomed."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my first semester of college everything has been a positive experience in my college career
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it is a good institution. The only thing that you may have problems with are the people in the financial aid office."
Senior,4,"Albany, Georgia has a high crime rate.  Albany State University keeps me informed when something is going on through texts and emails.  I feel safe in my classes and around campus.  

In my program of study, the teachers are excellent and go the extra mile to work with and help students.  I also have an great group of students that are in my cohort.

Two areas needing improvement are the Admissions and Financial Aid Departments.  They both struggle to answer basic questions and pass you on to the next person who then passes you back to where you started with no answers.  It is so frustrating dealing with them."
Freshman,4,A lot of friendly people you can meet. A lot of parties. The professors are really good. You can email them or go to their office without any problem. The food is okay but it’s the same thing every week.
Sophomore,4,"I like Albany State University because first of all it was close to home . They need to be more organized though it’s a big problem if though they have a lot of traffic.people are gonna stop liking the school and then no one would want to come . It’s a great school and all Really is chill environment just get your work done  and it should be a piece of cake. Don’t forget about tour financial aid either that’s real important. I would like to see a Healthier Environment. With obesity rates rising, we've all heard calls to make the school environment healthier and More Life Skills Classes"
Freshman,4,"Here at Albany State University, there are many ways to connect with and meet new people. My experience so far at the University has been great!"

Junior,4,"Being an incoming freshman almost three years ago, I just knew college would be everything I imagined it be. Albany State University gave me a great HBCU experience each year. I am now a junior and I still love my school very much. However, every place has its downsides. I would like to change how things are organized and set up at school. It can get a little hectic from time to time!"
Freshman,4,My first year of college was very challenging and interesting. the school work was very different than it was in high school. the school needs nothing to change
Freshman,4,I like  knowing that I am safe on campus. I really like the diversity on the campus. I want start until August 2019 but I have gone to the campus twice for information.
Sophomore,4,"When I first came to Albany state university as a freshman I didn’t like it at first, but things changed for the better through out the course of the year. Things look like they were smoothing out  everything started to go right. The class rooms are not to big the professor should know everyone’s name in the class. Class average about 30 to 40 people or even less than that depend on the classes you take. Professor want you to succeed that push you. They give you a lot of work practice and examples"
Freshman,4,"My experience with Albany State University is one of pride. I am so proud to call myself a Golden Ram! Albany state has such a diverse set of aspects that come along with it. On one hand, the education scene can be compared to that of a ivy league university. On the other hand, there are so many organizations and fun activities that know how to give your mind a break from your school work. With all this being said, I wouldn’t change anything about my university. Go Rams!"
Freshman,4,I enjoyed most of my professors at Albany State University. They were considerate and made the my freshman year enjoyable. Being a college student at Albany State taught me discipline and responsibility. However i do feel like improvement can be made in leadership.
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Albany State University for two years, and most of my interactions with staff and fellow students have been professional and pleasant. In some cases, I consider some of my professors and advisers as mentors as they help me further my education."
Sophomore,4,My experience here has been very good so far. Everyone is welcoming and very helpful. I have been enrolled for only a short time but i look forward to the rest of my time here at Albany State Uiversity!
Senior,4,"Albany State is a diverse and great school. The academics, campus, athletics, professor and the area is a great place. I would recommended this school to people that like to go big school with a variety range of people."
Freshman,4,I’m currently a freshman here at Albany State University! My decision to attend this school was really because I’ve heard how good of a school it was from many people so i thought why not give it a try! It’s a very good school! So far so good I’m in the spring semester and it does get harder but that’s what the resources around us are for. I Love my HBCU i recommend.
Alum,4,I enjoyed meeting different people from various cities. I had many professors who cared about my well-being and growth. The change I would like to see is more alumni participation in funding and supporting the school.
Senior,4,What I liked about Albany State is that it has become a well diverse place but yet still holding onto its rich history. One of the greatest HBCU n the country ASU has evolved into a leader in higher education. This helped me to become knowledgeable in my field of study. The way that my Instructors delivered the course was amazing. If there was anything that I would change or make better is to add more online classes.
Junior,4,"What I love about Albany State University is that the food is amazing here, and it also has a pretty campus. What I do not like about Albany State University is that   it has very poor diversity."
Freshman,4,"Albany State University is a university located in Albany, Georgia. It is formed by two campuses: West campus and East campus. The East campus is located in Downtown Albany, and the West campus is located in Pretoria Road. The East campus is the main campus, it is bigger and offer more classes and courses than what the West campus does. The teachers are really good. They are always available for the students. There are not to many students from other states, pretty much everybody lives in Albany and surroundings. The school has a really good Baseball and Baseball team. The cafeteria always has a variety of meals like: pizza, chicken, beef, salads, and they also have a Starbucks on the East campus. I would not change anything of it, because each school has its own characteristics which make it unique and different from the rest. The professors, the student life, and the environment are going to make anyone have an awesome experience there that they will never forget."
Senior,4,Overall Albany State University is a great school ! The student to professor ratio is amazing ! The people here are great its like a big family. The campus isn't too big so that's great because you will not get lost. We have a variety of degree programs and certification programs. Lost of activities on campus and room for more to grow .  We just merged with Darton State College so we have 2 campuses (East and West). I would recommend anyone to come to ASU for a great college
Sophomore,4,It's a good college overall but they can do better with admissions and financial aid process they are very slow when it comes to helping you.
Sophomore,4,"I had a great experience at ASU, peiple there are so nice and friendly, there inviting and theres always things going on around campus. It has a gorgeous campus with some of the best campus police officers in the world. The Unsinkable Albany State University isnt perfect but shes my alma mater and I would recommend her to anyone looking to acheive excellence"
Sophomore,4,When it comes to students and campus living I give this school a 5. You meet very enthusiastic students and there is a very positive aura within the environment. Classes and faculty get a 3. Having two campuses to get to in one day for classes can quickly become a hassle. If a “one campus for classes” system was put into place I think it would make the campus better.
Sophomore,4,"The Academic part of the school was pretty decent. I really enjoyed my classes and first time learning experience. The diversity was poor but of course it is a HBCU. The campus is nice kept well cut and clean. The athletic part and party scenes were A1. My professors were okay, some were hard to understand but that happens in college there are people from all over the world teaching. The dorms are decent depending on how you dress them up. The food is good it just gets old after a while. Campus is open nothing serious ever happened so I guess the safety was decent."
Sophomore,4,"I love that the academic advisers are so helpful and want to see you succeed. The housing is very great, but just make sure when you are applying you get everything turned in ahead of time because admissions office and financial aid office moves so slow."
Senior,4,What I enjoy about ALbany State University is the wide range of diversity. I like how each student of every background is included in different events held on campus. I like how each faculty and staff member is knowledgeable on the happenings of the campus.
Senior,4,"The college is close to my house, is easy to reach not to big of a college, safe 
would like to see the students in the financial aid to be more knowledgeable about financial aid."
Niche User,4,what I like about Albany State University is the great diversity between characters and personality. I love how complex the diversity is between male and female.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Albany State University is a great college. We have two campuses and bus transportation that takes us back and forth. The two campuses are not the same.  Whatever help anyone needs, can go to either campus to receive assistance. Although the cafe food is terrible, there are other spots on campus students can get food from."
Junior,4,The professors there are organized and answer their emails in a timely manner. The campus is easily accessible because there is a east and a west campus. Overall the school is pretty good especially for nursing.
Niche User,4,Albany has a wide range of academic courses to choose from along with athletics. The walk around campus was warm and friendly and the diversity blew me away! The only change I want to experience at Albany would be to see me attending classes in the Fall of 2018!
Niche User,4,i like how the campus is and like the people around. they are really friendly and all of them get along with each other
Freshman,4,"from when i have spoken to people at Albany state they are very nice and made sure all my questions were answered, only problem is that it takes forever to get into contact with them."
Freshman,4,When I first stepped on Albany campus its was so much excitement. The way they greet people and help is so wonderful. The dorms are nice and clean.
Sophomore,4,Can find fun and entertainment on and off campus. Much help provided for classes. Various study sessions and library opportunities that are easy to locate and attend.
Senior,4,"Albany State University is more than just a university, its home. ASU just recently merged with another local college, Darton, and the population has grown tremendously. The student population is a huge family that supports one another. This university has taught me responsiblity and proactiveness. I love my HBCU!"
Senior,4,"Albany State University is a great HBCU! From freshman orientation to move-in day, I've always felt as if I were in good hands. The housing staff, professors, and school staff are all very helpful, friendly, and family oriented! Professors are very thorough with lectures, learning material, and what is expected. Study groups are a plus! With the awesome interaction between peers and countless ways of communication, study groups are highly encouraged at ASU, and proven effective! Also, there are many tutoring sessions. There is no reason students should fail. Parties are awesome and anything to imagine! Campus life is amazing; however, some greek organizations are not on the yard. I love my HBCU and will definitely recommend to anyone to attend."
Junior,4,My experience at ASU has been very fun and beneficial. I've been able to network with many people that's in my field of choice towards my career.
Sophomore,4,ASU has its ups and downs such as many other universities. I believe that Albany is a good university . The ratio of professors to students and very great in my eyes. The professors actually care about theirs students and want to see us succeed.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the environment, values, academic excellence, and opportunities. I am currently on the cheer leading team at ASU, and enjoy being apart of  the squad. However, I would like to see a greater variety of food offered in the school caf and more social events where ALL students can get involved."
Niche User,4,"My work experience at ASU afforded me the opportunity to meet some of the best people in the world; students and co-workers.   Co-workers that are now friends and students who have become family.  

I wish the best for the New ASU and certainly pray that leadership earnestly focus on investing  in the employees who are the oil of the institution.   Likewise,  employees support leadership so that the mission of educating our ""future"" is not compromised."
Freshman,4,"Currently Enjoying the school as a freshman. I got to have a personal relationship with some of my professors, I met a lot of outgoing people, and I was overall pleasantly surprised with my experience."
Sophomore,4,"Darton is a very fun and helpful school. I hate that we had to combine with Albany state and change our school name. As of this year we have lost almost all of our sports teams, that is what makes Darton a four star school and not a five."
Graduate Student,4,"Darton is a pretty good college to attend. It is a two year and in a pretty safe area, professors are nice. If you need anyway help there are different labs and professors to help you. I attended Darton because it was close to home and affordable."
Alum,4,I love the atmosphere of this small Historically Black University. Anyone can find their niche there because it is something for everybody to do. The only thing I would change is the community that ASU is in. The community isn't very supportive and mislabel the University. Any student who attends know how much of a hidden gem ASU is
Junior,4,I do like Darton State College so far. The experience has been very well. I would like to have closer parking for nursing students.
Junior,2,"There are many good teachers at this school. However, the response of some of the teachers during COVID has been to barely teach, and throw piles of work at you. Violence on and around campus has increased drastically this year. Try somewhere else."
Niche User,2,The nursing department and staff are great. The rest of the entire school especially the financial aid and office staff are poor and not very helpful.
Sophomore,2,"This was my first college experience. I wanted to attend an HBCU for my own personal reasons, Albany State is a good school in certain areas such as parties,diversity and  the food. The housing wasn't that great unless you wanted to pay a greater sum of money than before. The academics were average and the professors were alright. The school is what you make of it honestly, a lot of people have their own opinions about life at Albany State. Mine was average and Ok."
Sophomore,2,"The set up for housing is terrible. In order to be sure you're going to get a room, you have to apply for housing early the day of the housing portal open. The professors sometimes don't really help you with your work. The financial aid help is terrible. Be sure to have all of your money for the school in order or you will have an issue every other day."
Senior,2,What I like about Albany State is that its an Historically Black College. When I first came it was very professional and I enjoyed the people that I met and the parties that I use to go to. Now with the merge the students has become horrible and the setting of HBCU'S has a horrible. Maybe the experience has been bitter sweet because I am ready for graduate school at an Predominantly White Institution. I have learned a lot of life lessons here at Albany State University but now its time for a new change of scenery
Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid lacks quality costumer service, the campus is too open, food is not good. They need to work on renovating the dorms as well as the older buildings. The professors are either a hit or miss, you could get a great professor or a professor that doesn't care about your education."
Sophomore,2,I have had a lot of trouble with this school. They lost my social security number costing me two sets of class credit and a lot a stress. As well they rarely are able to answer questions in a timely manor.
College Sophomore,2,Can not depend on professors
College Freshman,2,"I often see people come in the dorms high or drunk.  Most of the times, the hallways smell like straight marijuana."
College Sophomore,2,There should be more faculty members that care about the success of the student.
College Student,2,The teachers are very inconsiderate.
College Sophomore,2,Most of my prior years of college did not transfer; due to a differing systems.
College Sophomore,2,There are no jobs worth staying here for.
College Student,2,This is just a community college so there are not any post grad classes. I don't know a lot about the alumi network.
College Senior,2,I have had no interaction with anyone in the Business Administration program and I'm not even aware of any internships that are applicable with my area of study.
College Senior,2,"I'm not even in the business program yet and I'm supposed to be getting an Associate's Degree. Yet, I am still enrolled in core classes and I haven't even started any classes closely related to business administration except for Statistics."
College Sophomore,2,the office is always packed and it takes soo long to receive help and with all the trouble they do not extend deadlines as much
College Freshman,2,"My first experience with the financial aid office was bad. I was a new freshman who didn't know much about applying for aid. instead of receiving a nice person willing to help me, I was met with an attitude. They lose forms and blame you. They take their time seeing students when the office is filled with people. They will quickly drop your classes after the deadline has passed and you are still waiting for aid. My advice would be to have the forms filled and submitted before the semester begins. I also recommend making copies of the forms and remember what day you submitted them. After everything is submitted you will receive aid within a week."
College Sophomore,2,"The people didn't want to answer the phone, and it took numerous attempts to get my financial aid straight"
College Sophomore,2,I would not suggest living off campus for safety purposes
College Junior,2,It still feels like highschool.
College Junior,2,None of my financial aid experiences were good.
College Junior,2,Campus PD are just jerks to kids. Regular Police don't care as long as you're not acting reckless. Not strict about drinking at all and only warnings are issued for marijuana. But they're always searching rooms. There presence is very known but they don't do much when you get caught.
College Junior,2,Only school that gave me 0 aid.
College Junior,2,"Lot's of things to do, but it's not a very pretty city. I feel less safe here than in a typical college town."
College Senior,2,"Most parties were at the clubs. Most were packed and full of teens and underage drinking. The parties was not a positive impact for students. It just condoned to sex, drugs, and alcohol."
College Junior,2,they have bad attitudes and always losing something.!
College Junior,2,"outside of the campus. its mad boring. i mostly go home on the weekends. when football season is around its cool because you got some Saturday night football. but yeah albany, ga is boring."
College Junior,2,"dude, everything closes at 10pm here.! only thing open late is waffle house and i believe applebees till 3am. this town is so small everything closes so early. it's worst on the weekends. you know its a small town when they haven't heard of a 24 hour McDonalds!!!!"
College Junior,2,"As far as expenses and other things in that category, I really don't know because I've never moved off campus. In other words. I'd be lying if i say Albany is a safe place. I don't feel safe especially during homecoming weekend. I am currently a Junior now but my Freshman year that wasn't a problem. When you mix the locals and students, bad things come about. AVOID THE HIDDEN OAKS APARTMENTS. A LOT OF SHOOTINGS HAPPEN THERE!"
College Senior,2,They come late to the scene of the crime
College Senior,2,We don't have many internship in my major.
College Senior,2,The campus staff treat students like infants.
College Junior,2,As far as transportation for the most part if you do not have a car it is best to become friends with someone that has one if not getting around the city will be difficult.
College Freshman,2,There is support for football and basketball but there isn't much school wide support for track or baseball. We don't have a soccer or swim team even though we have a new indoor pool. The largest support even for football and basketball are really only around homecoming.
College Freshman,2,There is a very strict rule on co-ed visitation for freshmen. Even the students who are 21 years of age and older are not aloud to have alcoholic beverages in their rooms.
College Freshman,2,The only nightlife activities are involoving the students. There aren't really any outside interactions and all the parties are thrown at clubs during the week mostly. There are hardly parties on the weekend that are popular.
College Sophomore,2,Some of the administrative people are terrible. As well as the officers. You can't say hello to some of them without them catching an attitude. It doesn't make you feel safe sometimes. Last year and officer told a student she would shoot them.
College Sophomore,2,"Albany, Georgia isn't the best place to be for school. It's very remote and boring here. I don't really enjoy it. The mall doesn't have much of a variety you also need a car to get wherever you want to go. "
College Freshman,2,"I cannot get the money that I need to actually attend school. My parents are out of jobs and they have no money for my college expenses. One thing that people don't understand is that I'm actually trying to go to college and better myself. But, I need help doing so. If I get the money I know that I can complete school earlier than I am supposed to."
College Freshman,2,The students would get away with it if they didnt come to class drunk and high. Its almost as if they actually dont care whether the teachers know these things or not. It's actually embarassing. I have tried to change a few of my peers who actually partake in these actions visual about the situation but they just overlook it. 
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is hot and can be very humid, and also is not very consistent. Though with all these negatives, it could be worse."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid is veryyyy unorganized. Most people absolutely hate it. I have encountered a few problems with them but they were solved, not in a timely manner though."
College Junior,2,"The cafe gets tired out. However, we have chick-fila, Einsteins, Pizza Hut, and Subway"
College Junior,2,"Albany State University has a broad group of students, but most are trying to fit into the in crowd, so there is a lack of individuality."
College Sophomore,2,"The classes are pretty flexible as long as you are not in a program. After you are accepted in a program at Darton College, you will mostly have little time to complete assignments and they have to be done by a certain deadline."
College Freshman,2,There arent that many variety of majors at ASU. I am currently a Biology major and thats only because ASU doesnt have a specific sports medicine major.
College Sophomore,2,The campus parking is terrible there are more reserved parking spots for the faculty than it is for the students. So if we so happen to run into traffic and we may be a tad bit late to class trying to find a parking spot will make you extremely late
College Senior,2,"This is one thing that Darton College is missing from other school. A sence of individuality. Something that makes Darton Standout. It's hard to think of something that is completely unique about Darton, there is no real symbol of Darton."
College Senior,2,"They have two very large computer labs that are open to any student through out the day. The wireless connectivity and speed of internet is the worse atribute of Darton College. It's almost a guarantee that the wireless internet at one point will cut you off from online. If for some miraculous reason you are able to stay connetced for more than 10 minutes, you will still be waiting for 45 mins to watch a 1 minute video."
College Sophomore,2,Apartments Are Expensive – i am recently trying to find and apartment so i can help my mother save money and my friend who was abused and couldnt come back to albany state because of her tuition if i get this scholorship i could help her
College Sophomore,2,Rare to Be Found – There are scholarships avalible at Albany State but they are very rare to come across and if your not asking  or inquiring about them the scholarships are not talked about. It becomes a hassel.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Life Needs Improvement – There are very few activities on campus getting the students involved. There needs to be more interactive programs students could join. The school does not have a football team, so campus life is very vital."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Too High of Tuition – For the Albany area, the tuition at this school is rediculous and so is the enlongating tiring process of trying to apply and get financial aid.  the entire process makes you not even want to go anymore."
College Freshman,2,Hard to Find – Many places off campus are too far from the school but they are better to live in. Housing close to the school tend to cause or be in too much trouble.
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus – Staying off campus is easier for some, but since I am from a different state I don't know anything about how the apartments in Albany. I am sure if I had the money living off campus would be cool, but then transportation is involved which I do not have."
College Freshman,2,"Having only been at Albany State University for 3 weeks, I've already seen and heard of tons of drug and alcohol use among students. So The drug and alcohol scene here is high. The only drug that I hear of anyone doing here is marijuana and I also hear of a lot of the students drinking. Peer pressure isn't high here so you do what you want, when you want, with who you want without feeling forced to do so."
College Junior,2,"Wonderfully Dangerous – The cost of living in Albany Ga, is very low so finding a one bedroom apartment was easy and affordable, however, the crime rate in Albany is high. Living off campus is a risk that I had to take."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities at Albany State have gotten better. The gym is decent, however, a majority of the equipment needs to be fixed and the administration could use some help. A new student center along with two new dorms were just completed and opened in August 2011. The new students center is very convenient and much better than the old student union. It has more options for fast food, looks extremely welcoming, and has areas where students and guests can either play games or just sit and enjoy themselves (the old student center didn't have the previous listed). The two new dorms consist of a mini-theater, campus store, fast food restaurant, and dance studio. However, the location of the dorms is in a location that inconveniences the students, thus not allowing the students to be able to enjoy these amenities."
College Student,2,Unique Things – i rate it a c cause im the type that sticks to myself so im not really into going out or doing really anything. im a homebody and study and plan to take things more serious and have fun later on.
Sophomore,1,"Personally, I dislike online classes. Professors and students don't have reliable communication when having class online."
Niche User,1,I wasted a lot of time enrolling and was lied to until they had my money - or so they thought.  In hindsight I'm very glad I cut all ties and found a legit school. Since then many have told me that ASU degrees carry no weight outside the immediate Albany/Dougherty environs.
Freshman,1,"I currently attend this sad excuse for a school and for starters im put into a dormitory that I have a email from them telling me that is ""temporary"" the hall is called Gibson hall and the RA's or whomever is in charge is SO rude for no reason which is probably why nobody take them serious. I went to the housing and residence life office and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned living in Gibson hall was temporary. I actually balled my eyes out when I moved into Gibson Hall because of how nasty and old everything looked, plus the Community bathrooms with females who do not know to clean up after themselves. Mind you there is a housing overflow at this school which is so annoying and sad. Everything is unorganized and majority to all of their food options are closed or lacking something everyday. Never consistent. Worst decision I ever made was coming here, I pray every night for a miracle."
Graduate Student,1,The campus is small and one side floods during heavy rains. The newer buildings are on the east side of campus and the older ones show water lines from past floods.
Freshman,1,I literally have nightmares about being at this school. It has been a horrible experience. cccccccccccccccccc ffffffffffffffffff rffffffffffffffffff
College Freshman,1,I can always hear a lot because the walls are so thin.
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no greek life at school
College Senior,1,usually don't eat off campus but mostly everything is fast food
College Junior,1,"No point, I did not feel like I was learning."
College Senior,1,The financial Aid is the worst department at Albany state university.
College Freshman,1,Our internet connect is very weak and the lady that sits in the computer lab acts like she hates her job and has an attitude when you ask for help.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid department is horrible 
College Sophomore,1,The wireless here is terrible. When signing up for classes it is terrible not reliable at all. 
College Sophomore,1,It's bipolar weather. We can receive every form of weather in one day. The rain is by far the worst. 
College Sophomore,1,The cost of printing is high.
College Junior,1,I really don't care for it much. It's really not my scene. Plus the fights are constant thing at times so they end up getting shut down early at times.
College Sophomore,1,"Many bars have recently been shut down due to a high amount of fake ID's being caught as well as a 3am curfew that causes most bars to close at a specific time now each night. Another thing is Albany is a high crime area and it's hard to go out because it's not safe to walk alone, etc and cabs are costy for college students and most bars are downtown."
College Freshman,1,The isnt any diversity at ASU mainly due to the fact of it being a HBCU but there are different races on campus but not that many.
College Freshman,1,I am an athlete at ASU and my personal opinion towards our athletic facilites is poor. We share our gym with the general population and the weight and locker rooms are subpar
College Junior,1,Public transportation from the campus to other locations is not great. The buses do not run as often as they should and there is not a very well known alliance with the university and city transportation. There are no shuttles on campus or shuttles that run from campus to local businesses. Without a vehicle or friend who owns a vehicle it is almost impossible to accomplish anything in the city of Albany.

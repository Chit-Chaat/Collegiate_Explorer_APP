Freshman,5,"Everyone is friendly and there are so many clubs and activities! The people in admissions help you out in every way and they are always there every step of the way. The professors are helpful, caring, and they take the time for questions instead of rushing everyone and they make sure you understand the material. They also take the time to know you on a personal level. You meet new people everyday and it's nice to experience new things and go out of your comfort zone."
Alum,5,"If I could do it all again I would stay all 4 years at PSNK, and never gone to PS Main Campus.  The teachers are so wonderful at PSNK, and I only had an issue with one grad student/teacher.  She was a fill in for some odd reason, and she was the only issue I had there.  Anyhow, I think the campus is beautiful for its size, and has the potential to be a bigger sport involved school.  The only thing that it lacked was students interest to join club sports, but the funding is there to create them! The school resources are excellent, it's no different than PSU Main, just different landscaping.  My diploma from Penn State got me an excellent job working Forensic Investigations for Allegheny County, Thanks PENN STATE, and PSNK CAMPUS is my campus of choice since I experienced both PSU Main and PSNK."
Sophomore,5,"Although many would think that branch campuses wouldn't offer a very enriching experience, this university proves those people wrong. Penn State New Kensington puts in a tremendous amount of effort to make the college experience as enjoyable and educational as any other campus. They continuously have exciting events going on around campus that help people to connect. The small classroom atmosphere helps students have a direct connection with their professor, which results in an enjoyable curriculum. They provide a success center where there a multitude of tutors for every class on the campus. The best part is it's all free to a student of Penn State. They also provide all adobe apps for students to use, for free, throughout their time they spend at Penn State. Everyone around you is willing to lend a helping hand."
Senior,5,I love everything about Penn State New Kensington. The whole environment is so welcoming and the academics are great. I have learned so much since I have been here.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, everything feels very home-y. We get along with each quite well because it is a small number of us and we constantly bond through academics, club activities, and social gatherings. The equipment is modern and the professors try their best to make their lectures fun and interesting."
Junior,5,"Overall, my experience with Penn State New Kensington has been positive. The faculty work well together and everyone is extremely pleasant and helpful. This campus network of students and employees alike is very much liked a family. Small class sizes are also ideal for student/professor relationships. The instructors know you by name and do everything in their power to help you succeed, not only academically but personally as well. WE ARE!"
Sophomore,5,"Penn State New Kensington is one of Penn States smallest Campuses, as a result of this, students get much more one on one education from professors and have much more of an opportunity to learn and ask questions. It also helps create tighter bonds between students, because we all have the same classes together. The nicest thing about Penn State New Kensington is that most students commute, which helps many of the students in this area who want a high level college education and are also in financial need. This campus has some of the nicest faculty, who care about their students and will help them get through their courses however they can."

Sophomore,4,Penn state is a great place to advance your education and meet new friends along the way. They offer great amounts of help allowing you to do so.
Junior,4,"Penn State New Kensington is a great college, especially for students that attended small high schools. It is a very close and friendly community. It is also a great starting campus for those who intend to transfer to Penn State Main Campus but also offers several majors that can be fully complete at he campus itself."
Sophomore,4,"I was drawn to he fact I can save money by completing my first 2 years there, and continue at a larger campus.
Im frustrated however, that all the courses are not offered every semester and it is difficult to stay on track to graduate in 4 yrs."
Freshman,4,orientation helps everyone get prepared. all was very nice and helpful to those that need the extra push.
Sophomore,4,"Because it's such a small school, making friends is easier than it was when I went to a larger school. Classes are nicely scheduled around one another for my major, but oftentimes classes are only offered in either the spring or fall, not both. There are even a few classes that are only offered once every four semesters. Plus, our entertainment equipment (i.e. the pool table) is in such bad condition. The Professors, both part-time and full-time are amazing all around, and I really enjoy the campus."

College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my school very much. It may be small, but it has a lot of great characteristics. The professors are helpful and the one-on-one aspect that the school can offer is incredible. You can definitely get the help you need by meeting with the very well-known professors. The small classrooms allow for more involved learning and participation, you feel like you're getting your moneys worth at Penn State New Kensington. The curriculum is also challenging and will help to prepare you for whatever other steps you decide to take later on."
College Sophomore,4,Most students at this campus still live at home because it is a commuter college.  There is no real reason to find off campus housing.  There aren't many students that come here from around the world that would need to find housing.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus doesn't need a lot of enforcement because it is so small, but if there ever is a problem, it is taken care of."

College Freshman,4,I love Nurse Elaine. She walks around or stays in her office in the athletic center but is always available during normal class hours. She'll hook you up with snacks before a work out and always has a smiling face.
College Freshman,4,"I think i saw my campus officer less than ten times this past year. We do have security that works the door, rarely, but they are all really nice and fun to talk to."
College Freshman,4,I grew up here so it tends to get monotonous but once you get into Pittsburgh there is a lot to do. I even find things to do when visiting some other local towns.

College Freshman,2,"Most people drive, so weather is an issue."
College Freshman,2,there are not any options
College Freshman,2,there's nothing too close to campus
College Junior,2,The housing is pretty terrible. The RA's do nothing about noise. We have very loud people living under us and they do nothing about it. The rooms are also not that great. The building itself has a stink bug problem at the moment and a water leak. I also do not get along with my roommates and would love to get my own apartment somewhere off campus.
College Junior,2,Campus really isnt strict about anything. Everything is pretty free flowing. The people that live under me constantly play their music so loud that it shakes our couch and no one does anything about it.
College Freshman,2,"Most are average, and everyone else is an adut learner."
College Sophomore,2,My Friend Andrew â€“ My friend andrew had chest pains and a tight chest and he went to the nurse because heart problems run in his family and the nurse wasn't there.
Niche User,1,"The school is not a safe environment for students that graduate early. The college does their best to create a rift with parents by constantly telling them that they are emancipated and even convincing them to fill out the court papers. They will also have adult students dating these minors and don't seem to have a problem when these controlling guys leave bruises on your child. They will also block you from getting information about the safety of your child. Basically, they want parents that care about their child out of the picture. The dorm they created constantly reeks of marijuana and has numerous underage drinking parties."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life. Sometimes we all think about starting a greek life scene as a joke to see if anyone would actually participate.
College Freshman,1,"I Do Not Like It â€“ I honestly feel like this campus is something akin to a community college. While some courses are harder than others most classes are very easy, and I do not fell like they are adequately preparing me for mt transfer to University Park."
College Freshman,1,Because of the nature of what this campus is nightlife does not exist. The campus is almost all commuters therefore after classes are over so is everything else.
College Sophomore,1,We Dont Have Any â€“ All we have is off campus apartments that is only for students.

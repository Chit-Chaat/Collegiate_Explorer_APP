This is a huge advantage and something I'm very thankful for."
College Senior,5,"I love that Cabarrus College is so closely tied to CHS! Being in the nursing program, this is a huge advantage over other schools. The teachers work very hard to make sure we are successful and develop the skills and working knowledge we will need to be a nurse in the real world caring for someone's loved one."

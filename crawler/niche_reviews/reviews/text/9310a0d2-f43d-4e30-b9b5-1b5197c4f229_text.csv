Sophomore,5,I love everything about Hastings in all honesty. The town is perfect and the people are great. The college itself seems to really care for the students and it has only proved to be a great institution so far.
Sophomore,5,"Online classes were overall very accommodating and easy to navigate. Under the COVID-19 circumstances, I wasn't really looking forward to online classes, but the school really made the transition easy. The professors were great about dealing with every difficulty and change during that time."
Sophomore,5,"Hastings College is an institution full of support, love and community. In my time at Hastings College, I discovered things about myself that I never would’ve known. The professors make you feel like you can ask for help at any time and this is because classes are as small as 3 people and as big as 30 people. The class sizes open up new opportunities for every student. One aspect I like about the college is that you can be a part of any club or organization offered on campus. You don’t have to know how to play an instrument to be a part of band because you of course learn and we always want to have fun. You can be on the tennis team while also being a part of student senate. The final aspect I like is how everyone on campus, even if you don’t know them, talks to everyone. This is a nice sense of community. Come to Hastings College if you want to experience and learn new things!"
Freshman,5,I like the block scheduling here at Hastings and I like how easy it is to navigate everything here. One thing that I wish Hastings College had would be a few more majors to choose from such as exercise science.
Freshman,5,"The overall environment at Hastings College is welcoming. So far, I have noticed that the professors are more than willing to help students given some effort at an attempt to answer a question was given. The professors are also very excellent in what they do. Instructions are clear and written on the syllabus. If anything is modified, students are notified on Canvas right away.
The staff at Hastings College are warm and welcoming, as well. The staff are always willing to go out of their way to accommodate the students the best that they can. There are always little events put on by staff or student committees to keep campus interesting.
So far from my experience, I am satisfied with my experience, so no changes have come to mind yet."
Niche User,5,What I enjoyed about my tour at Hastings College was their academics. They have just transitioned into a blocked scheduling so you will never have more than two classes at a time. It is a 14-1 student to teacher ratio and will definitely help students succeed.
Junior,5,I absolutely love Hastings College. The community of Hastings is wonderful and I have yet to have a bad experience. The faculty and staff at the college are all very helpful and will gladly help make the campus feel like a home away from home.
Niche User,5,"I have only visited Hastings, but I will be going there next year for school. I got to sit in on an education class, a band rehearsal, and a choir rehearsal. All of the students were really welcoming and loving. They didn't make me stand out like a visitor but involved me in the class."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful campus & spirit. I'm a bowler from Wyoming & will be on the Hastings Bowling team & I have a great opportunity to keep playing my sport throughout college, thanks to Hastings."
Senior,5,Hastings College is a small college that offers each student the opportunity to enjoy small class numbers. The student doesn't get lost in the crowd.
Niche User,5,"I enjoy the staff and professors , they are very kind and helpful. They really want you to have a great experience with college. The environment is very welcoming and fun-filled. "
College Freshman,5,Amazing RA who do amazing social events for the floor.
College Freshman,5,High school spirit and amazing fans
College Freshman,5,It is small and making and I wouldn't change my choice
College Sophomore,5,"I am glad I chose Hastings College, because of the small size and great atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,Helath and safety are always available and important to administrators
College Freshman,5,"If you live in Bronc or Babcock - full renovations after summer of 2014, just amazing!"
College Freshman,5,"Get good grades and a good GPA in high school and interview well, then you are likely to get a Crimson Scholarship."
College Freshman,5,"Some of the dorms are small, but no matter the size of the rooms it feels very homey. The kitchen is beautiful ever since the remodel, and having a fridge on each floor is very helpful. Spending time with people is very easy with the lounges on each floor, and we all feel like a family which makes it a very livable situation."
College Freshman,5,The staff worked well with me and put in effort to assure that I received all that I needed.
College Freshman,5,They provide a ton of scholarships academically or athletically that makes the school fairly affordable.
College Freshman,5,There are many scholarships available in different areas from academics to extra-curriculars to sports to departments
College Junior,5,I love this school for all they do. It doesn't need all the bells and whistles to be amazing.
College Junior,5,We have a very open and understanding campus with all walks of life
College Sophomore,5,"Parking is generally pretty good if there are no events going on in the school. Campus parking is free and so that's a plus for me, especially since I transferred here from a campus that charged me $360 for a year of maybe finding a spot somewhat close to the campus. That is not the case here, you can generally find a good spot to any building on campus."
College Freshman,5,The application process was quick and easy and I got both academic and merit based aid. The office worked with me every step of the way to ensure I got as much as I could. All I had to do was apply!
College Freshman,5,"They offer a substantial amount of Aid to make the cost of 32,000 dollars bearable."
College Junior,5,"I love my specific program at Hastings College!  As an education major, all the professors are very supportive, and open.  They do a great job of making sure we get into the classrooms early, and that they are a good fit for each student.  We have lots of opportunities to work with kids in a school setting."
College Freshman,5,"Athletics at Hastings College is everything. Most of the students at this college are athletes and we all go out and support each other. If  a game is ever too far we always have it broadcasted and even have watching parties. 
HC Fan Federation is what we call the population of our campus."
College Senior,5,"The process of getting into my Physics major was extremely easy.  The Physics professors here are fantastic.  They are here to help, and they want to help.  Just contact an admissions councelor, and they will get everything set up for you."
College Sophomore,5,"Absolutely Safe – The Security on campus is great. If for some reason you don't feel safe even walking a couple hundred feet, the security officers will come pick you up and walk with you. The town is even really safe. There is a very low rate of crime on campus!"
College Sophomore,5,"Good Ground Crew – There isn't any affect to my campus experience. Maintenance Crews get out at 3 in the morning and clear snow, and keep it cleared."
College Freshman,5,"Super Safe – I've always felt safe at Hastings. It's a small and friendly campus, and even on bad nights it's a very safe place to be. I can walk around with friends and leave my door unlocked and not fear for myself or my things."
College Junior,5,"Old Plus New Equals Awesome! We have several older buildings on campus, such as one of our dorms and our English/History building, but we also have more modern buildings such as our Science center. This is a great combination that gives all types of students an opportunity to enjoy life on campus. Nothing is too modern, but nothing is too old."
College Sophomore,5,Small Classes – We have very small classrooms which allows for a lot of extra attention from the teacher.
College Sophomore,5,Printing on Campus – Printing on campus is really awesome in the way that you can print for free by using the key fob given to you when you start at Hastings College.
College Freshman,5,"The reason I came to Hastings College is because it felt like home. After I started my classes, I noticed that all of the professors that I have had are great with the students. They know every student they have by name. I had the ability to eat lunch with one of my professors a few weeks ago and we had an hour long conversation. I'm not sure how many other students in college are able to say that about their professors."
College Freshman,5,"The Music Education program at Hastings is excellent, it's very busy, and a lot of work, but it is a solid and well respected program. The facilities are a bit out of date, but with funding problems that's to be expected. Curriculum is fitting, the faculty are great, all very skilled and knowledgable. It's a lot of work, but I absolutely love being a part of the Hastings College Music program."
Recent Alumnus,5,Printing System – I like the printing system at Hastings College because it is easy and convenient. Also it saves a lot more paper then the system we had before. I have never had a problem with system yet so it is also very reliable.
College Sophomore,5,"When the World Is Small, You Live Large – No matter what you do here on campus, or even if you take one of the opportunities to travel or study abroad, you will get the chance to live large.  Yes, Hastings College my have a relatively small campus, but if you are doing what you love here, this place becomes your world, and your world becomes your stage.  The faculty and staff do their very best to help you shine."
Alum,4,I didn't take any classes online through Hastings College but all electronic communications and services were great.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Hastings College. Growing up in a much larger city, I was hesitant to move to a small town but Hastings grew on me. Professors are attentive to individual students' needs and there were many opportunities to be involved on campus."
Sophomore,4,I came into the school as the we’re changing their curriculum so it has been difficult being the guinea pig class but overall it has been good.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the problems I had with online learning, were not because of Hastings College. Some of the better things were the professors. The professors and faculty did their best to make us feel connected even if we were far away from campus, through online trivia nights, club meetings, music challenges, and even through the class lectures. It was nice to still be able to connect with friends and students through often online meetings."
Sophomore,4,I like hastings college because the environment is always positive. Everyone is super supportive. People support athletics a lot and academics as well.
Sophomore,4,"Small town size that offers great support in athletics, arts and education endeavors.  Beautiful tree-lined campus with good security and lay-out.
Chapel available in middle of campus with organized chapel service on
set days."
Niche User,4,I am hoping to join the bronco life. I have been on multiple tours and meet some coaches down there. It is a nice campus and feels like home.
Freshman,4,Hastings may be a small college but they have so many things going on all the time. They make sure that the students are getting to know each other and are always doing different activity's. They make you feel welcomed and apart of the family and the culture that they have there. Sports are huge whether you are an athlete or no they still support you with whatever you do.
Sophomore,4,Fantastic Art Department!  State of the art glass blowing studio.  Campus is beautiful and well maintained.  In a small town so it feels comfortable and safe with good values.  I enjoy the small class sizes and the ability to connect with my instructors personally.
Freshman,4,I really like the college. The only issues with it are that there are minimal things to do in the town and the price of tuition.
Sophomore,4,I like the overall campus and the access to professors.  I am running track at the school and received very strong support from my coaches during an injury that required surgery.  I would like to see a better variety of food choices on campus.  Overall I believe Hastings College is a great college and I have recommended to my friends.
Freshman,4,Hastings college is a particularly great school in the sense of how great the people are. The reason being the teachers let you know what their office hours are and if you aren't able to get into those times they will schedule appointments with you. Then next the campus life they usually during the weekend they would have a event going on over Saturday and Sunday maybe like grocery bag bingo that ran by one of the frats or sorority on campus. The overall campus lifestyle is great and the people at the college are even better.
College Freshman,4,You can get a job anywhere you want
College Freshman,4,Not to big and enough one on one time
College Freshman,4,It is mainly for community service which is amazing
College Sophomore,4,"There is no Greek Housing at my school. Greek life has events that go on just for Greeks such as dinners and homecoming games. The dues paid are mostly to enjoy these activities. Parties are not thrown as a Greek body. Greeks effect the community with the events that they plan or the community service that they do in the community. Greeks often set up tables in the student union to raise money for other organizations or their own fun events. My Sorority did community service at the local pet shelter, but we hope to do more in the future."
College Sophomore,4,"For athletes this is a great school as 90% of the students are athletes and are recruited for that reason. I myself am not one, but I can see how many things revolve around them which can be bad for non athletes. Though many students are involved in sports the most viewed would have to be football. Soccer is viewed very little and volleyball has a relatively small outcome as well. School spirit is well supported by the cheer team and dance team.  Facilities are up to par."
College Sophomore,4,"Great classes offered and the professors truly get to know you by name, which is comforting."
College Sophomore,4,"Sports/athletics and the fans are great, but they are just as important as grades and school work."
College Freshman,4,Professors are friendly and there to help.
College Freshman,4,Health center is a good resource to use.
College Freshman,4,This is a small college in a small town.  There are not very many major crimes committed here.  If you do happen to feel unsafe you can call public safety for help.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are always small, which is nice because you receive individualized attention.  The small science classes are especially nice because we do not always have to share equipment.  Most professors are honestly here to teach."
College Freshman,4,There is a strong alumni network.  The advisors are knowledgeable and helpful.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are close to most of the classes.  The longest walk you will ever have to take is five minutes.  Having a good RA will make all the difference.
College Freshman,4,"I like the hands-on science program.  Professors are very involved in their teaching, and they want us to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"People do get helped in looking for oppurtunities for job prospects, although i dont think that those options are unique to every student, and everyone is usually given the same advice for this subject"
College Freshman,4,"Love my financial aid, but am in jeopardy of losing it all, and if I do, I won't be able to afford to continue to attend."
College Freshman,4,"I can sleep well without having to worry about noise, which was my main worry when starting college."
College Freshman,4,I have heard great things. I have yet to live off campus.
College Freshman,4,I would agree with everything that has to do with Hastings policies. The are fair and easy to follow.
College Freshman,4,"When going to HSU for lunch. It sometimes is a hit or miss. Now that they have been providing more options, it is starting to be more hits. I am really enjoying it!"
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed living on campus this semester. It made walking to class super easy and I also made quite a bit of friends on the way. Hastings College is filled with very generous people. That included both students and the staff, everyone was extremely helpful while pointing me in the right direction since I was a new student. Tuition really seems like a lot, but Hastings is really good with providing scholarships to reduce that cost and make it more affordable. I really enjoy Hastings and all that it has provided."
College Sophomore,4,Prices are usually better than the housing on campus and the population of the school somewhat forces seniors to move off campus to make room for the lower classes.
College Freshman,4,The school is extremely focused on their sports and their athletes.
College Freshman,4,It's pretty easy to find parties and everyone is really comfortable there.  Not a lot of pressure to drink but available.
College Freshman,4,The building's are all very comfortable and homey.  Although you're away from home it starts to feel very much like it's where you belong due to comfort of the housing.
College Freshman,4,In general it's very secure
College Freshman,4,"They are as strict as they have to be, but I feel many students can feel relaxed"
College Freshman,4,Staff is helpful with helping achieve goals
College Sophomore,4,Guys and girls at my school are great to talk to and very studious.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the students at Hastings College attend to play a certain sport. Our athletics are extremely important to the school and community.
College Junior,4,Just have to apply to the teacher ed program which isnt difficult at all
College Junior,4,Pretty easy to get your financial aid but you do have to follow up in subsequent years
College Junior,4,All professors are great. They really care about students and go out of their way to help you
College Junior,4,The education program is really great. From day one they get you involved in classrooms and working with kids
College Junior,4,The dorms are mediocre but the upperclassmen apartments are fantastic. Spacious and brand new. Maintenance requests are met quickly and efficiently.
College Junior,4,Teams are great and games have great energy and are fun
College Junior,4,It's simple and easy. Very friendly.
College Junior,4,This campus is very open to things in a safe way
College Junior,4,They were very helpful and it was not very stressful
College Junior,4,Everyone is very laid back and there is little peer pressure
College Junior,4,We always know when an event is going on and there are perks for going.
College Sophomore,4,"Communication between the financial aid office and the students varies. For me personally it takes a few visits to finally get my aid right. I was able to go talk to them to get a little more aid than what they originally offered me. Overall, they are good at giving aid."
College Sophomore,4,"Aside of when there's a lot of people online at a time, the internet speed is usually fast. You don't need to bring your own computer but sometimes it is handy to have it with you. No charge printing is definitely a plus, considering I transferred here from a college that charges 10c  to print something, this is huge. There's computer labs and printers in every building and you can go from building to building to print something off through the network."
College Sophomore,4,I feel right at home here. I transferred here and I could not be happier with my choice. There's no feeling of being left out and everyone is open to talk and get to know you. It's a very welcoming campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Other than occasionally not having anything to do and the bi-polar weather, this town is very quiet and definitely has its small town charm. The community is very welcoming and it just takes some work to find something to pass time by."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are everything in this school. A lot of athletes tend to get passes on their courses or professors are quick to look the other way, as in other schools. But, I don't think that we are any worse at this than a lot of other schools so I personally do not see it as a big problem. Other than that, people here generally support our teams and love to cheer them on at their games."
College Sophomore,4,People are pretty accepting of other's religions here. People generally tend to look past that and they focus on other aspects of the individual. Those who have their beliefs tend to keep it to themselves and they don't go around shoving religion down the throats of others.
College Junior,4,"Lots of great restaurants in town and in the next town over, with a fair amount of variety."
Sophomore,2,Overall my teachers had to shift a great deal of what we actually learn to the back burner because these classes were meant to be in person and the college has a large emphasis on interactive learning so my biology class had less labs and activities and my Spanish class had significantly less meetings.
Niche User,2,"While Hastings College is a beautiful campus, it is not at all ethnically diverse, faculty and coaches are not particularly the kindest, and the financial portion of the college continues to rise despite its already high tuition."
College Sophomore,2,The only complaint I have about housing is the strict rule of living on campus until you're a senior. Most schools let you live off campus after your freshman year. Otherwise the dorms and atmosphere are great.
College Freshman,2,Academics are good social life is a disaster.
College Freshman,2,A very small Greek Life.
College Junior,2,"My previous college was very affordable, and i was awarded a full tuition scholarship. This worked out well, except for the fact that I personally watched my Music program die. It went from 20 students to just a handful in 3 years. The school itself did nothing to help the music program."
College Junior,2,"There isn't a whole lot of variety or good options. There have been major improvements in the last year and since I live in an apartment I dont use the dining hall often so I'm not sure of its current state but I'd still call it very ""nebraskan"" and ""cafeteria"""
College Junior,2,We don't have many options for off campus living. And the school makes you stay until you are a senior unless you have a loophole to slip through.
College Junior,2,The only mode of transportation is on the weekends you can call a free bus to take you anywhere safe. This is an awesome way to combat kids from drinking and driving.
College Freshman,2,"HATE THE FOOD HERE THE HO REALLY SUCKS. Sorry but they make us pay so much for some really crappy, Sodexo served stuff."
College Freshman,2,"VERY poor housing for VERY high pricing. If you come here later on in say Sophomore and Junior years, there are apartments available which are much better. But they are still way overly priced just as everything else in Hastings College"
College Freshman,2,"One of the worst things about Hastings- Not a lot to do and at night, most closes except for Jimmy Johns."
College Sophomore,2,"Really can't judge the weather here because its very bipolar. One day it's 75 and sunny, the next it'll be 45 windy maybe raining. Ultimately it's hard to say."
College Sophomore,2,"The college provides decent financial aid, however if you are having trouble covering the rest of your tuition they are so NOT helpful at the financial aid office."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of fried foods and limited options for healthy choices.
College Sophomore,2,"The college is fairly diverse, though not as diverse as they would like you to think. I think the college should do more to truely develop diversity on campus. While people are accepting for the most part, there will always be incidents of intolerance where ever you go."
College Junior,2,"the dining hall is boring and the selection is so-so. the staff is nice but the is questionable and does not look and taste good. Hastings College has all this money, use it to improve the food and kitchen."
College Junior,2,"the pros, are Hastings is a great town, safe for the most part but the cons, are that there is no apartments and many people don't leave the town so houses are hard to find and could be costly."
College Freshman,2,Hastings College doesn't allow a great opportunity to live off campus. However seniors can live in apartments that a few inconvenient blocks away from the college. The houses around the college are often rented out by groups of seniors and the cost is low. The availability of both of these are hard to come by.
College Junior,2,"Not There but Trying. There isn't a lot of diversity at Hastings College, but they are trying to make it more diverse. There's a lot of white kids that go there and most of the professors are too. But it's Hastings Nebraska."
College Freshman,1,Lived in Weyer Hall and Altman and hated them both.
College Freshman,1,Awful college with bad living conditions.
College Freshman,1,I feel like I only eat there in order to continue to survive my college life.
College Junior,1,"Hastings is not big enough to have public transportation. On campus, students have the option of using what is known as the Bronco Bus. This service is free with a student ID"
College Junior,1,"Meal plan is required for students in dorms. The dining hall on campus has good hours for breakfast and lunch, but not supper. The main entree and 'bar' change daily, but the quality is sparse. There is always a breakfast area, grill, deli, pizza and waffle station open. These options can get exhausted after two years."
College Sophomore,1,Everyone blacks out every night and do the same thing over and over. Bars are all lame.
College Sophomore,1,If you aren't an Education major or a music/theater major they don't care much about you.
College Freshman,1,"More Space – Not alot of parking, if Hastings wants to expand, then it needs to make more parking spaces. Also, there are one line roads in Hastings and its so inconvenient."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking on cmapus is bad for the dorms. There is not parking space around the dorms, around one of the girls dorms there is limited parking and most people have to put their cars on the street. A guys dorm is the only one who really has a parking lot and that isn't even that big."
Niche User,1,"If I could go back, I would never have come here – My experience so far has been pretty bad. If could go back, I would never have come here. I came out of Hastings after one year not having a single good/close friend. I had a few people that I could talk to at classes and at lunch, but that was all. I wish I could've known how bad my freshmen year was going to be because I would not have come to Hastings College. "
Niche User,1,"Nebraska weather is completely unpredictable. One day it can be sunny and 95 degrees and the next we will be up to our eyeballs in freezing, icy snow.  As far as clothing for our awesome weather, dress like you are going to Antarctica and the beach! You will experience every kind of weather situation imaginable except for a Hurricane, even though sometime it feels like we are getting hit by a hurricane with Nebraska wind."
Niche User,1,Wind never stops – The wind blows constantly.
Niche User,1,"If you don't have a car, bring a bike – I didn't have a car at college until my last J-term, and it was difficult to go places. I relied a lot on my friends and roommates. Hastings is set off from the main road, which makes it out of walking distance to most places. If you don't have a car, the best alternative would be to bring a bike."
Niche User,1,"Way less diverse than I'm used to – The campus is way less diverse than I'm used to because my family was military and always lived in military towns. I'm used to schools and other things being very diverse, so being at Hastings is a little weird for me."
Niche User,1,Hastings College is definitely not known for its diversity.
Niche User,1,Not that great – Campus food usually isn't that great.

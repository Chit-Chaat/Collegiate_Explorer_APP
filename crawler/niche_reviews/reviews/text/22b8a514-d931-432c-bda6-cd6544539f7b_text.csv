Junior,5,Online gives you a chance and a break from the classroom and relax and get your work on your own time and the professors are right there with you to help you out.
Junior,5,My experience at Culver is that it is nice and small and everyone has a chance to communicate and it helps a better chance to get to talk to all alumni and the president of the college. Plus the activities you can do around campus are awesome it is well organized with stuff to do and what the people in charge can come up with also the IM games they make are awesome it gives people who don't play sports to get out and be active in any way. Then if you want to be put in a family I would advise to join a fraternity or sorority it is a great experience and you would love it.
Freshman,5,"I am so happy I chose Culver Stockton.  I like that I am able to receive individual attention from my professors and am not just a name on a piece of paper.  My teachers know me and I know them.  The school has a family vibe which I also love.  Everyone is connected and I feel like I am part of a big family.  Everyone helps everyone else whether it is with school or sports.  There is always someone to help.  I love 12/3 semesters and the ability to enroll in the 3/2 program where I will earn my bachelor's degree in 3 years and my graduate degree in year 5.  I play sports and feel very supported by my teachers during season and during period of heavy travel.  I feel that Culver puts me in the best position to make my stamp in the world.  Overall, I am so happy I chose Culver Stockton!"
Freshman,5,Went for a visted with my parents and the school and staff are great . My family and I really love it . Cant wait to be apart of the football family .
Freshman,5,It’s a really great college and it is very welcoming and I would recommend if you don’t want to big college but want to get a good education.
Freshman,5,They haven been great to work with during the registration process. They are very helpful and understanding. And very interested to my opinion and thoughts.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the education here! The professors get in touch with their students to make them feel welcome and help understand the class work. I’m very far from home but I know I’ve made my best choice with Culver-Stockton College!
Freshman,5,"If you are used to a small school scene, Culver-Stockton is definitely right for you. You will get to meet a lot of people on campus and they all will try to get you to explore clubs and be apart of them. You most definitely will get to know all of your professors and advisers on a personal level. Most of the time you will turn to your professors in bad situations, and they love to talk to students and get to know them."
Niche User,5,I am planning to enroll at Culver-Stockton College in Fall 2018 and I have only had positive experiences with it so far! My admissions counselor has gone out of her way to assist me with my application and answered all of my questions quickly and thoroughly.
Freshman,5,The things I like about this school is that we are all a big family even the community. We care about one another and almost everybody knows you and your name unlike big schools. The professors care about you and they will email you or do anything in their power to make sure you stay on the right track. Everybody has the same goal for you and that’s to graduate on time.
Freshman,5,It is a smaller campus therefore there is always a familiar face and welcoming smile.  The teachers are astounding and the academics reflect that highly!
Freshman,5,At Culver Stockton i really liked the campus. The size of the campus was perfect and the class sizes were great too. I really like both the coaches there. The baseball field was amazing .
Freshman,5,I absolutely love this college. It was the best decision I have ever made. I am lucky to be attending such an amazing school. The campus is a very happy and diverse one. The faculty and students get along like we have known each other our entire lives.
College Junior,5,Get involved in activities across campus its the best way to meet people!
College Junior,5,"When I chose to change majors my advisor who was on of the current teachers of my major, helped me through the whole process. I don't know where else you can find someone that is willing to do that. The experiences in the classroom are great and the people I have met outside the classroom are just as phenomenal."
College Freshman,5,They are all so willing to help no matter what the problem is. I have yet to meet a rude professor.
College Freshman,5,Love the people and the location
College Junior,5,My professor helped me get an internship.
College Junior,5,Greek life is one of the reasons I stayed at Culver.
College Junior,5,I'm very please with my education
College Sophomore,5,"I've had a wonderful time at Culver. The people there are great and enjoy their company. The food's alright, and I like the professors there, too."
College Freshman,5,I always enjoy going to party with friends after a long week of school
College Freshman,5,Everyone in the town is very supportive and sweet to the college students and it is a beautiful and fun community where everyone cares about each other and how each other feels.
College Freshman,5,The academics at my school are great. There is such a variety of things to learn and study here and everyone gets involved
College Freshman,5,The frat houses are a great place to spend time and the people there are great
College Freshman,5,It is proven to be one of the best schools with computers and labs in the country
College Freshman,5,The athletic environment i awesome whether you play or are in the student section
College Freshman,5,    Everyone is very sociable and nice. There are people on campus for everyone to get a long with and hang out with.
College Freshman,5,      Everything about this Campus is wonderful! Nothing needs to be fixed at all!
College Freshman,5,     The teachers are wonderful. They are very approachable and friendly. A Majority of teachers have their doctorate so they are very knowledgeable in their field of study.
College Freshman,5,    Transportation is not needed. the campus is small and the town is small as well. Everything is well within walking distance even if you have a job outside of campus. 
College Freshman,5,"    You never have to worry about technology at Culver. There are Compute Labs all over the campus. The network has some bugs, but not a lot. Each student gets about 300 prints a semester free and they roll over if you don't use them all."
College Senior,5,"Campus police at Culver-Stockton College are always willing to assist at any moment, even in the middle of the night. They assure everyone of their presence throughout the days and nights as well as make sure all students have the campus police phone number programmed into their phone."
College Freshman,5,"I was very nervous going into a community style living but I am glad I did. I feel comfortable enough to walk around barefoot! My neighbors are very considerate and friendly. CA's in my residence hall put together A LOT social activities for the whole hall to get together and connect. CA's are also always available to talk it you have any issues with other people in the dorms, your roommate, school work, and pretty much anything. "
College Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman but so far I find the program very helpful and look forward to the future. My plan for after college is to open a business with my older sister. If life throws something more exciting or more beneficial to me, my monitors and advisers at school would have no problem helping me with making the right decision.  "
College Freshman,5,I find it essential for people of diversity to interact; it improves communication and costumer service skills 
College Freshman,5,"There are computer labs all throughout campus, not just in the library. There is a 24 hour lab in the Student Life Office. The school has laptops available for check out. I find is helpful to have my own laptop but if I didn't have one, I would not be at a disadvantage because there are resources I can use."
College Freshman,5,"Each department is very different from one another. With that being said, our campus is so small you can NOT go unnoticed. Professors and administrators are constantly checking on you and are always available. Our faculty work endlessly to help you achieve your goals and ensure success. "
College Freshman,5,"Each student must complete general education courses including history, speech, religion, math, science, and arts. Each major has specific courses you are required to take. Internships are also required. Professors and advisers work endlessly to match you up with a company and help make the process go smoothly. Study abroad and Multidisciplinary seminars are available each semester and during the summer. Generous donors to the college provide scholarships and other income opportunities so that no student is left behind due to money situations. Clubs and organizations are also available in different majors. "
College Freshman,5,"I received an academic scholarship based on my high school GPA and ACT score. After that, the school helped me get a grant.
I applied for 22 local scholarships from my high school but did not receive any. "
Junior,4,"It's an amazing campus, with amazing programs and great faculty/staff. The only problem is parking, and some of the buildings aren't 100% handicap accessible."
Junior,4,Culver-Stockton is a great college for those who love the small town feel. I personally adore the fact that I made so many friends so fast and that I know almost everyone on campus!
Junior,4,"My favorite thing about Culver-Stockton is the friendly environment. The school is only roughly 1,200 students, and a lot of students are friends with everyone. For me, being on the Cross Country, Track and Field, and a part of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity, I have come to make many friends throughout the school. If there was one thing I could change, however, it would be the location of the school. Located in Canton, Missouri, a small town of 2,000 or more people, there is not much to do. The closest mall, movie theater, and even McDonald's is 22 miles away, a 30 minute drive on highway 61 and across the Mississippi River. This is a hassle for having to make this trip for thing's to do and to have to make a Walmart trip."
Freshman,4,"Since this is my first year in college i don't really have anything to compare this college to, but i will review just how my experience is going.  First of all the campus is very beautiful. The only problem i am having trouble with is that they are building new buildings, when a lot of the students can barley afford the tuition as is. I feel like the students should be allowed more than one scholarship within a department. Also the art department needs more funding,  and a new art studio."
College Senior,4,This school does a pretty great job of helping students find the right type of job they would excel with on campus.
College Senior,4,"The classes are pretty interesting and the fact that over 90% of the classes are small with a maximum of at least 30 students, it makes the learning environment easier to pay attention in. And the professors definitely care and will take the time to explain and help when needed."
College Senior,4,"The campus itself is gorgeous, and the classes aren't too far away from the main dorms. They are about 7-8 minutes away depending on where your classes are. For the most part, the campus' environment is beautiful. There's not a lot of trash just sitting around. Yet, when it comes to the rooming lotteries, this school could do a lot better."
College Senior,4,"It seems like the atmosphere is pretty decent. Joining Greek life can go one of two ways: Either you fit in really well, or you don't. Either you genuinely like it or you're just there. However, I will say that the community service they do is very nice."
College Senior,4,"I would have to say that I have enjoyed being at Culver so far. The professors are amazing and you can tell that they really care about your education. The only complaint I have is in regards to the way they choose to place students in dorms. Other than that, this campus is pretty to look at and it is relaxing."
College Freshman,4,Glad to be apart of a great team
College Junior,4,"I joined the Sigma-Kappa Sorority last year and love it. I would say about 60% of the students are involved in greek life and the ones that are not involved don't think anything different about the ones that are involved. I went to school without thinking about joining a sorority but I'm glad I did and I have met several friends through the sorority. The sorority life at my school isn't all about parties all the time either. All the fraternities and sororities are involved in charitable functions and community support. All the fraternities and sororities have a house on campus that you can stay in if there is enough room. Fortunately, this Fall I will be living with my two best girlfriends at the house."
College Junior,4,"I have friends in all the sororities and all the fraternities. I personally am not a member of Greek life, I have nothing against them. Our Greek life atmosphere is amazing on campus."
College Junior,4,As a sports management major I pay major attention to sports. Some sports receive more attention and funding than others. Overall the sports are well supported by our student body.
College Freshman,4,I think it's pretty safe.
College Freshman,4,Everyone I know doesn't regret being in Greek life
College Freshman,4,I love it everyone is so nice.
College Freshman,4,Freshman dorm bad with no parking but others are nice
College Freshman,4,amazing professors but so expensive
College Junior,4,Campus security is there fb you need help
College Junior,4,The cost is expensive. Living in the seriotity house is nice.  Need more dorms or living quarters.w
College Junior,4,Fan supports and team spirit are the best.  The facilities lack but they are working on them.
College Freshman,4,Campus security is very willing to assist anyone who may feel threatened or scared.  They take their job seriously.
College Freshman,4,The staff works with the students in helping them attain their degree and offer a wide range of opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"Almost all professors are friendly and helpful.   Most are understanding and easily approachable.     There are a variety of courses offered, but the school does not accommodate all areas of study.   The class sizes are great, you are a person not just a number."
College Freshman,4,"It is a smaller campus, you do not have miles and miles to walk to get to a class.    Love my room, everyone is friendly and helpful.    it is all in what you make of it.     Small community, however within 30 minutes to larger community.     The worst thing is the parking for some of the dorms.   Some dorms have very limited parking."
College Sophomore,4,"I'll admit I'm not much of a fan of anything athletic, but it seems like they love their sports here in Culver."
College Freshman,4,"First semester was overwhelming, but they truly care.    I think for anyone once you get passed the first year jitters it works out.     Being a smaller school, the classes are easy to get to , everything is within quick walking distance.  Classes and instructors are great.     Lots of help, community involvement.   Small town, that offers lots of amenities, but a larger town is within 30 minutes drive time.

It is all in what you make of it.   It is up to you to fail or succeed."
College Senior,4,There is a/c and heat for all seasons. The halls are pretty inside and out.
College Senior,4,"I am not in a Greek house, but I know about the reputation of fraternities directly and indirectly. It adds a dynamic to the campus that satisfies a lot of students."
College Senior,4,C-SC has become a second home to me and I would not trade my experience in Canton for anywhere else!
College Senior,4,C-SC offers a state-of-the-art faculty that has professors who are deeply interested in the learning environment on campus. Opportunities for leadership roles and other essential student organizations wait for students who want a distinct undergrad experience.
College Senior,4,Nearly all of the professors at the school are great and truly care for their students and their students' education.
College Senior,4,Living in the Greek houses provides generally nicer accommodations than most of the dorm halls.
College Senior,4,I love having the 12-week/ 3-week split semesters so that I can travel and study abroad in the 3-week without worrying about missing other classes.
College Sophomore,4,My experience here at Culver has been great! The professors here are great and very loving and concerned about their students. I would choose Culver again if I could do it over but first I would go to a Community College first then transfer here.
College Sophomore,4,The college has a tendency to favor one fraternity in particular when it comes to discipline.
College Sophomore,4,"We are about to get a new wellness center, so I hope that's going to be good."
College Sophomore,4,"I petitioned to keep my scholarship after I left the volleyball team, and they rewarded me 75% of it."
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus, but the school is growing. The school keeps putting more students in rooms that are already small."
College Freshman,4,There is a wide variety of food selections around campus
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the soccer program on campus and enjoy the teammates im with
College Freshman,4,i am personally pledging to TKE and im very exciting to be a part of the fraternity
College Freshman,4,the school health and safety are great. We have campus safety officers that are round 24-7.
College Freshman,4,Our athletics are great at getting the fans involved and interested and they are very exciting events
College Sophomore,4,Culver offers many computer labs and free printing.
College Sophomore,4,Just have to find out as soon as you come to Culver.
College Sophomore,4,"It was pretty painless getting accepted into Culver Stockton. I got more than enough scholarships, even though now I'm paying for it on my own I wish I had more."
College Sophomore,4,"Again, I love the split between three week and twelve week curriculum."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being at Culver-Stockton College. Thus far my experience has been enjoyable. I'm playing the sport I love and getting an education at the same time. Professors work very well with student athletes. The class size is perfect in my eyes. Instead of having hundred some odd students in one classroom, there's about twenty. It allows one on one conversations and help."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the curriculum at Culver-Stockton College. The twelve week, three week split up  is so convenient and stress free for me as a student. It allows me to focus on core classes I need during the twelve week and during the three week I can take a course that needs more focus."
College Sophomore,4,I work well with our campus safety gentleman. They are always there if I need to discuss problems with them.
College Sophomore,4,Every sports team on campus is very supportive of one another. The student body is always supporting our Wildcat teams.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of scholarships available here
College Freshman,4,This school is great for business
College Freshman,4,They are creating new housing all of the time
College Freshman,4, I don't drive so I really don't have an opinion
College Freshman,4,"    There are 3 locations to eat.: The lab (specializes in coffee, pastries) The Cats pause (Sandwiches, fries) The cafeteria. 
The cafeteria, has a variety of food and 3 different bars to choose from."
College Freshman,4,"    There is a lot of Aid from Culver. I barely had to pay anything out of pocket to attend. I would have to say apply for as many scholarships as possible, school supplies and dorm supplies are important to pay for too"
College Freshman,4,    Every campus has some kind of Drug or alcohol use. It's really not a Huge deal at Culver. A lot of students just don't do it. The ones that do are responsible about it 
College Freshman,4,    I'm personally not big into sports but a lot of people really are. It's cool to see so much school spirit in one place
College Sophomore,2,"Limitations on number of clicks per day/week are unnecessary. We should be able to use our clicks as many per day as long as we have them. Diabetic friendly foods/drinks are extremely limited. ex: whole grain bread, light yogurt, sugar free drinks, and consistently correct food labels.

Meal plan should be like a debit card. That way you pay for what you get and it is a students responsibility to watch their credit value for meals."
College Sophomore,2,"We live in a small town, but the worst thing about it is that none of the places deliver. From a business stand point living in a college town with few options to eat delivery could be a good investment."
College Sophomore,2,I have never been made aware of the possibility of living of campus.
College Sophomore,2,there is not much to do on the weekends; all the parties get shutdown be campus security.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no variety, and the quality is rather low."
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene at Culver-Stockton College is very big. I feel like most students at Culver are using drugs, whether it be alcohol, weed, or pills. If you go to a party at Culver, you will find over half of the people using drugs."
College Senior,2,"There is only one computer lab available for students 24/7. The Greek houses have a few each, but the internet sucks badly!"
College Senior,2,"If you don't have a car, you're kinda on your own. The school will sometimes make arrangements to drop you off at the train station in the next town, but that's it."
College Senior,2,Expensive and No Where to Live – The surrounding housing off campus is too high and not in that good of a shape. Stay in campus housing!
College Senior,2,"Culver has a poor choice for parking, it has no room to expand since its in town. You either park on the street or down further in the ARC parking that requires you to walk for every or if your lucky you get the choice of parking on campus. Most of that parking though is saved for teachers."
College Freshman,2,"Drafty and Small – The room I stayed in freshman year had a horrible draft in the window on my side of the tiny room, so on a cold windy winter day or night, I got an icy wind rolling through my room, knocking pictures over I had standing in front of the window. The two person rooms are pretty small. The walls are paper-thin too. They are maintained pretty well for the most part and secure."
College Sophomore,2,"We're Having This Again? Although the cafeteria offers 3 lines of food with a salad and deli bar, students get tired of having the same choices every week.  The food is not that bad, but having the same thing more than once a week, or three times a month, it gets old.  Maybe offering healthier choices or changing up the menu so the same meal isnt served twice in three weeks will make the food more appetizing."
College Junior,2,Small Town – Canton is not a very attractive town I must say. The roads are all bumpy and every year there is always seems to be flood. There are not that many apartments to rent (one must live on campus). The things to do in Canton is very limited.
College Junior,2,"The students try to make athletics as fun as possible, but when you get a different coach every year for you sport it is very hard to understand what is expected of you and to learn about your coach so you can work together. Athletics do not get alot of money on this campus so we are getting the bare nessesities when we travel or do anything. We work very hard but do not get much appreciation."
College Freshman,2,"I think that there are taxi cabs available and no buses that I am aware of, but other students travel a lot so if you do not have your own car, someone you are friends with most likely does. Other students are typically more than willing to give people a ride to whatever store they need to go. However, having your own car is a good idea if you can afford one."
Junior,1,"This school this is good and would’ve gotten 5 stars but it got knocked down to 1 star because of the mailroom.it’s run but the students there and I can’t count how many times they lost my mail, I even got a package sent to me and it was expensive and it showed delivered, but the people in the mailroom LOST my mail! 100$ wasted!"
Junior,1,"This school this is good and would’ve gotten 5 stars but it got knocked down to 1 star because of the mailroom.it’s run but the students there and I can’t count how many times they lost my mail, I even got a package sent to me and it was expensive and it showed delivered, but the people in the mailroom LOST my mail! 100$ wasted!"
College Sophomore,1,We have so many students not we need it
College Freshman,1,They gave us a long online course and have an optional 9 hour course that wont help us stop it if it happens just helps us try to keep it from happening
College Sophomore,1,"If you do not own a car or have a friend with a car, you will be walking everywhere."
College Junior,1,Parking depends on where your dorm is. The parking lots are in terrible condition and are not close to the dorms. There is a parking lot by the Arc that is free but most students prefer not to use it because of how far of a walk it is from the dorm. Ticketing is fine because the first time you violate a parking rule they give you a warning.
College Junior,1,Johnson and Wood are the only dorms that I feel are worth paying tuition for. Shannon and Weldon are by far the worst due to vandalism and overall uncleanliness. Zigler may be the best dorms but the fee is something a lot of students won't be able to afford. I don't know much about the Greek houses on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Culver-Stockton college is in a small town with a whopping population of 1,000. In order to have any communication with the out side world, you have to drive a little over 20 minutes to Quincy, IL."
College Freshman,1,"Unfortunately, there is nothing near by. All we have is a couple family owned restaurants, and two food chains, where you do not receive any kind of discount for being a student. If you want to eat anywhere descent, you have to take over 20 minutes to drive to Quincy, IL, where you can get your grub on."
College Junior,1,"Closing Time 9:00 P.M. Canton is a small ""city"", where the college makes up most of the population. There are only a few restaurants that all close by 10 p.m. and do not deliver. The nearest town with anything is Quincy, IL, which is about 20 min away. Still,everything there closes early there too."
College Senior,1,HAHAHA Thats a Joke – The only nightlife at Culver is at the Frat Houses. Try DU =]
College Junior,1,"There are only a few parking spots by resident halls, but since most of the residence halls are right next to each other you hardly get a spot. Most people have paid for the parking permit to park right next to the dorm but have to walk all the way across campus to part because they resently made a parking lot into a grassy area so parking is bad."

Senior,5,"Holy Names has small classes that allow for student input. The campus is in the beautiful Oakland Hills. The teachers are smart and the staff is friendly. The students are diverse and accepting of others. All races are welcome at Holy Names University. The local area has many good places to eat and imbibe in alcohol, if you care to do that sort of thing. The parks and hills surrounding the campus are conducive to long and wonderful hikes in areas covered by the leaves of trees.  I have personally found Holy Names University to be a wonderful experience. It is surely a place I would highly refer to any student who would want to advance their education."
Niche User,5,Friendly Staff and wiling to assist. The staff seems to go out their way to help regardless of who you are. It feels good when you can reach out to all. I was able to speak with three different staff in the same period a half and hour.
Alum,5,"Holy Names provided great care for their students. The small classes helped me be able to get one on one tutoring with my Professors. Every Professor at Holy Names challenges you. The career service is amazing! They truly want to see you succeed. The counselors help students prepare for applying to jobs, give us tips, and they even offer mock interviews. The scheduling advisors are very helpful and knowledgable. They make sure every student is on track. They make sure students are taking the coordinate classes for their major."
Niche User,5,"I am a parent of an Alumni Student who graduated in 2014, with her bachelors in Psychology, and now my youngest daughter is getting ready to attend as well in the 2019/2020 school year."
Niche User,5,Holy Names University is a good and small school compared to others. Holy Names has good programs and a nice campus. I would not change anything at the moment.
Niche User,5,Holy Names is a great school. I am a senior in high school and I have taken multiple visits to the school. I am very excited to be attending there next year!
Junior,5,I like that Holy Names is a small inclusive college. The class sizes are small so you are able to get to know your classmates and professors a little bit more than you would at a big campus
Senior,5,Holy Names is a great place to learn grow and develop. I have grown to a critical thinker with knowledge and confidence. I am very grateful for the experience that Holy Names has offered me.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very welcomed and comfortable at school. This school is well known for its' diversity.
College Sophomore,5,Every time I have a question or need help there is always someone available to assist me. I love how our professors know our faces and it is easy to contact them outside of a classroom. I am greatful for evetyone who works at HNU because they make the college experience amazing!
College Sophomore,5,"Our RA's, staff and security at the front gate are always protecting us the students. I haven't heard of any sexual assaults on campus."
College Freshman,5,The security at Holy Names University seems to be in great condition. There's a security gate where everyone is checked with an ID if you enter the campus.
College Freshman,5,Holy Names University being a private university gives students a better expirence of going into a University.
College Freshman,5,Our school makes it a priority if something like sexual assault happens
College Freshman,5,No one can enter our campus if they don't have a parking pass or were called in from a student. The front get makes sure that no strangers enter the campus making me feel extremely safe.
College Freshman,5,"In the several months that I've been on the campus, I have yet to hear of any events, past or present, that would compromise the safety of students or their belongings."
College Senior,5,"The courses can be extremely challenging.  There is a significant amount of reading, written papers, research assignments and presentations required.  With the class sizes being smaller (10-15) there is a large amount of group activities and presentations.  With this, there is easy access to staff for questions, problems or guidance."
College Senior,5,"The school is small, class sizes are small and the faculty know each student personally.  You can create a bond to the faculty which works well when questions arise or a bit more added direction is needed."
College Junior,5,"There hasn't been any crimes committed so far. My campus is very secure, they won't let anyone in after 9pm unless one of the residence calls you in at the front gate."
College Junior,5,great quality of courses and professors. The class sizes are small but thats what I prefer.
College Junior,5,"Everything at my school revolves around athletics and the student athletes. My school is very small and a majority of the students are apart of the sports teams. My soccer team has improved so much this year. We won more games this year than in the last five years. The fan support is huge, with large groups of people showing up to watch our games."
College Junior,5,"I love the learning environment and how the teachers are always there when you need them. They make class very enjoyable and fun to learn. I look forward to attending each class due to the effort my teachers put into their jobs. I also play soccer for my school, and that has been an amazing experience thus far. Getting to travel all over to play soccer, including Hawaii this year has been unbelievable. I am very thankful for the opportunities my school had provided me, and if I could choose my school again, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
College Freshman,5,it's a small private university where the teachers and students are supportive and encourage me to succeed
College Senior,5,bay area is so diverse you can choose form many
College Senior,5,berkley is the spot to be
College Senior,5,we are number one in the nation for diversity
College Junior,5,"Not a week goes by where there isn't at least two events being put on by the school and the clubs/organizations. As a Catholic university that was founded in the 1800's, there are many traditions throughout the year that we partake in."
College Junior,5,"The financial aid department is really there to help students get the aid they need. When it's all said and done, costs are over $45,000 a year. The department has helped me get enough aid to attend. The school, directly, has even given me $16,500 this year alone in grants and scholarships. While it definitely isn't a one step process with them, they have walked me through everything I need to do to ensure I receive the maximum amount of aid I am eligible for."
College Junior,5,"My largest class I have had at HNU had 24 students. And that is considered ""large"" here. Each class is very intimate and the teachers truly care about their students. Not only do they have a passion for teaching, but they are also compassionate about their students' well-being. At such a small school we have truly become our own community. I have eaten lunch with professors in the dining hall and have stopped by former professors of mine's offices just to chat. You can really tell how much the instructors here care about their students, and not just the work they turn in in class."
College Senior,5,Holy Names has one of the most diverse campuses in California.
College Junior,5,To be honest college is what you make it.
College Junior,5,I am currently a psychology major but I am also taking science courses to fulfill medical school requirements. The only concerns I have after graduating is what medical school I will be attending.
College Sophomore,5,Holy Names is extremely diverse in many aspects which is so awesome.
College Freshman,5,"The school is very diverse. We have people from Hawaii, Cuba, Croatia, the Middle East, etc. The school is Catholic but I barely hear anyone talk about religion, except if they have a project due for homework. Sexual orientation is not a problem either. Especially since we live so close to San Francisco"
College Sophomore,5,There is so much diversity. There are people from all over the country as well as the world. 
College Sophomore,5,"There is so much diversity on campus, but I don't think that all the diverse group mix very often. "
College Senior,5,"I love the discussions that we have, the interest in supporting young people of color, and the attention to making it better."
College Sophomore,5,excellent for the most part they are all macs so the technology is up today. the computers do get crowded somewhat  during finals but not as much becasue everyone has a laptop.
College Junior,5,This campus is filled with computer labs and available computers!
College Junior,5,Its very hard to find a program that offers Forensic Psychology as a concentration in a Master's program.
Graduate Student,4,I like the small classes and how the professors are very skilled at creating assignments that help us learn
Freshman,4,What I liked about Holy Names was the small school environment and classrooms which allow for a better one-on-one support from the professors.
Freshman,4,The professors here are very nice the resource they here are very helpful. Very small and try to have as much school spirit as possible.
Sophomore,4,"My experience here at Holy names has been amazing so far and the diversity of the school makes it very unique in a way. Also, with the school being in the Bay Area in the Oakland hills, there are many things to do and many things to explore outside of the campus. On campus the professors are great and the classes are small so they really can take the time and help the student be able to be successful."
Junior,4,"My experience at Holy Names has been quite pleasant. Though I’ve only been there for 2 going on 3 years I can honestly say that the university is both diverse and cultured when it comes to student body. Holy names has a wide range of students from different countries. These students countries are represented by their flags which are located inside of the public market. I appreciate the school for trying to include everyone, and having those educate us on their experiences outside of the U.S. One thing the university can improve on is bringing more educators of color to teach classes. The school is located in one of the most diverse areas of the Bay Area.  When ethnic study classes are being taught, it’s best that they are taught through the lens of someone who is of the same race and background. This will make the classes more engaging because the instructors can bring a lot of real life experiences to the class."
Freshman,4,Holy Names University has a beautiful view. They also have advisors and teachers who are willing to do anything to help you out.
Senior,4,"This is a great university with amazing diversity in both populations: athletics and academics. The classes are small and personal,People just know each other! The only problems I can find is schedule conflict when signing up for impacted classes, missing one class one semester might mean not seeing it for the following or even years, and the campus is not handicap friendly."
Sophomore,4,"My freshman year was an easy adjustment thanks to my coach and the staff.  I have great teammates and friends.  Classes were tough at times, but made it though."
Sophomore,4,"Holy Names University has a great community and good education, however, due to the university having such a small community, it lacks activities and stuff to do."
Freshman,4,I love how the classes are small and easier for me to learn one on one with the teachers. Amazing campus so pretty and the community is so nice and open to everyone!
Junior,4,I like where the school is located. Since its a small school the staff are more helpful. on average there are usually no more than 30 students per class at max!! there are even classes that have 1 student. This makes it easy for one on one with professors and students. great to be a student.
Niche User,4,"Something I like about this university is the campus. Also, everyone is really friendly and nice. I've had several good teachers."
Sophomore,4,"Holy Names is a gem in the Oakland Hills. The school is small and everyone knows each other, which to me was a cool thing. Holy Names offers many events for students. The faculty and staff will know you by first name after the first week! Classes are small so professors will know you well and will help in areas you are struggling in. Also, free tutoring is offered on campus! HNU offers many resources, it is up to the individual to use them! Everyone is very helpful in leading you into the right direction! The school is very diverse, and the students are very understanding and welcoming! It is very safe here, we have one entrance and exit onto campus and its guarded by a gate and security! Their is so much to do in the area, also very close to downtown sf, just a short BART ride away!"
Niche User,4,"I went to visit Holy Names University and I immediately fell in love with it! If you are looking for a small school, close friends, a great atmosphere, while also getting an amazing education then Holy Names is for you! It is located in a big city, Oakland and also only about 20 minutes from San Fransisco, but you are far enough for it to feel safe and at home."
College Freshman,4,What I see is great but will know when school starts
College Freshman,4,Just through my enrollment process so far excellent!
College Sophomore,4,This school is great at helping us find internships and jobs. I have two friends that have been hired to work for the school. I think that is great!
College Sophomore,4,I had an amazing dorm this year! I had a ton of space and my floor mates were all nice and friendly. Our RA was excellent on getting us involved and answering campus questions.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, the only thing I don't like is the size of the campus. The professors are great and so are the staff members. I have had the chance to meet the president of the University and he is such a charismatic and humble man. This University is giving me the chance to graduate early since I have never had a problem getting into a class of my choice and major."
College Freshman,4,The professors seem to have a great understanding in their field. Sometimes the teachers have different methods of teaching their students that could be difficult at times.
College Senior,4,Alot of fellow students were student athletes
College Senior,4,"My school is great. My learning experience has been personal. The class setting is intimate. I'm able to connect with fellow students, and my teachers more in depth. This school makes it possible to achieve my goal, and dreams. The adult program offers convenient class schedules. The course offering is at a speedy pace, which gives possibilities of finishing sooner rather than later. It has taught me many things in and out of the classroom. A great opportunity, and resource."
College Freshman,4,I love how your professor is more than a teacher. They are able to be your friends as well
College Freshman,4,My advisor is really into me picking my career and figuring out what I want to do for classes
College Freshman,4,Campus is very safe. You can walk around by yourself and not have to worry about your safety
College Freshman,4,Classes are small which allows you to get to know your professor's and develop a relationship with them.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are a good size but dorms could use updating
College Freshman,4,"I love the campus, it is small and has a great view. Professors are helpful and want to see you succeed!"
College Freshman,4,The safety and health of HNU is great. We are a gated university and anyone that comes on campus must provide their ID and be called in by a student. The health is also great and heal insurance is something that many people have.
College Freshman,4,My career prospects are in good standing as of now. I am an accounting major and my current professors as well as future ones have had a job in the field and are still in touch with some people. I feel like I have a great chance of getting a job right out of college because there are not many accounting majors at my school and it allows a lot more opportunities for the ones here.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at HNU is great. I discovered who I want to become, what my interests are, and what I am going to major in. I have made wonderful friends and built great relationships with my professors. The class sizes are small but I really enjoy that and I got my first job on campus. I had the best roommate I could ever ask for and I am so excited to see what next year holds."
College Freshman,4,"On campus housing is a new experience, but one you will never forget! The dorms are double's so you share a room with another person, however you do have the option for single housing if disabilities are presented. Living on campus makes attending classes a lot easier, and you are able to make new friends more easily. Its a great experience and a lot of freedom!"
College Freshman,4,"My school is located in the foothills of Oakland and has a million dollar view of the bay area. The campus is very small itself, but it has a lot of benefits. The teacher to student relationship is what I love most about my school. Professors are able to engage with students and give them the attention and help they need versus being at a much larger university."
College Freshman,4,I am thinking about being a financial advisor so I may want to minor in accounting so I can improve my knowledge on that subject. The career center is very helpful because they make you a lot less stressed and will take care of you.
College Freshman,4,I am enjoying business management and my experience with it so far. My professors care about me and are always willing to set aside time to help me. Classes are usually 18 students which is incredible and gets you more engaged in class discussions.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy living on campus because of my friends and roommate. The dorms are pretty old but we take great care of it and it is so easy to make friends.
College Freshman,4,"so far it's going pretty well, I think because I am on the school's soccer team making my experiences very memorable. it's small so we all pretty much know each other and I would come back to pursue my career in soccer."
College Freshman,4,"I love the professors. They're extremely easy to get a hold of, especially because the class sizes are so small. My largest class this semester is probably 25 people or so. The professors strive to build relationships with the students both inside and outside of classes. I appreciate that the advisers are so involved and easy to reach as well. I do wish however that the music program was a little more diverse than it is now because I think I may be one of the two African-American students who is involved in the music program."
College Freshman,4,"I got the opportunity to apply for a study abroad program which is 100% free, and since I got it, I will be going to Rome and Florence either this summer or next for completely free. My professors are extremely interactive and easy to get a hold of."
College Senior,4,I have formed connections with staff that will aide in my moving on to internships and employment once I graduate. The staff is very supportive in this regard.
College Senior,4,"Security is very good. Normal patrols, visibility and security standards for students."
College Junior,4,I love the Bay Area view from the school
College Freshman,4,"I understand why there are rules to follow, its all for the students' safety."
College Freshman,4,I get all the helps I can ask for.
College Junior,4,there are a lot of different people to encounter
College Junior,4,"really good, really easy and fast"
College Junior,4,Hard to find but assessable
College Junior,4,professors work with you to assist you in your education. they are also very supportive of personal situations and needs of the students.
College Junior,4,The teams are family oriented and really well organized.
College Senior,4,i love the bay area
College Senior,4,we are improving to be the best
College Senior,4,The professors have a close relationship
College Junior,4,"The career center on campus is one of the best I have experienced. Not only is the career center available for all students, but each department also assists students with searching and finding internships within their field while working toward a degree. The faculty really seem invested in assisting students in creating a bright future for themselves."
College Senior,4,I have had a great time so far. I like that the classes are smaller and its fantastic that almost everyone is involved in some sport.
College Senior,4,Everything is great about Oakland. The weather is fantastic and there is always something to do. San Francisco is only 20 minutes away
College Senior,4,Its great being close to class and to everyone.
College Senior,4,The thing that separates HNU is the great view
College Junior,4,Every program is open to incoming students
College Junior,4,There are many choices on off campus dinging but it's a little more accessible by car.
College Junior,4,Living in the bay area can be expensive. It's better to find a place off campus with friends. They have some good homes and some bad. It just depends where you are trying to live.
College Freshman,2,"they don't really win a lot and i do not really enjoy going to the games that much, but that is just my opinion"
College Freshman,2,This isn't the school I wanted to go to at all it was more like a fall back plan.
College Freshman,2,There are not many restaurant out here.
College Senior,2,There is not greek life at our school
College Senior,2,"There is only a basketball gym, no other facility"
College Sophomore,2,Our dorms are extremely outdated and tiny. Our bathrooms are also gross
College Sophomore,2,The athletics are not quite up to par. We are in a really low division so it's almost like high school sports. As a community we do like to support the teams but sports are not a huge factor in campus life.
College Sophomore,2,The only restaurant near campus is a Burger place. Its good if you eat burgers.
College Freshman,2,No school spirit. Some sports teams are close and bonded. Others are always arguing with each other or their coaches.
College Freshman,2,The food has gotten better over the years but it's still not that enjoyable. Edible but not satisfying.
College Freshman,2,need more parking spots on campus. Building some for next year.
College Sophomore,2,Small time program but active for those that are into it
College Sophomore,2,San Francisco is close but Oakland is not a real nice night place
College Junior,2,"The vans used at Holy Names University are not reliable whatsoever. We use them daily to get to and from soccer practice, as well as to and from soccer games. The vans have broken down in the past, doors have fallen off, and the air conditioning does not work. The vans at the university are hazardous and unsafe. In order for our team to travel to soccer games, we occasionally have to rent reliable vans. We should not have to spend money on something we should already have on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The campus isn't that strict which is both good and bad. Good in the sense that you have the freedom to do what you want, bad in the sense that certain students get away with too many things"
College Junior,2,Still transitioning from NAIA to NCAA. The athletic department is on top of everything just need to be sure you are on top of your financial aid. Their office is very hard to reach
College Sophomore,2,"I do not feel safe in my area. It would be nice to be able to feel like you can take an evening stroll or job in the surrounding neighborhoods. Sporting events are available year round in the bay area, whether it's Football, Baseball, or Basketball."
College Sophomore,2,"Very Limited, especially by the dormitories. The parking lot is right by a forestry hill so the cars get covered in dirt and leaves."
College Sophomore,2,"The school does have a beautiful view, which sadly is probably one of the best things about attending here. Since it is a small campus, making friends isn't too hard, but students party every weekend and take part in events in which may be frowned upon by the administration. So if you don't like to be in that kind of crowd. You may find youself bored at HNU on nights and weekends. You are pretty limited unless you have a car. Since HNU isn't in a very safe neighborhood, public transportation may not be a likely option for you. However, if you and a few friends can catch a ride to the bart station during the day, you will enjoy a trip to the city or even Berkley. Also, the professors are very helpful and understanding. They really make themselves available if you need extra assistance."
College Junior,2,"Around Holy Names there is not much nearby besides a Safeway. Also the exit before Holy names has a older downtown shopping center where there's more attractions. 
But on campus there is lots of activities to do"
Freshman,1,"Holy Names University can claim itself as the best(61th place) regional university from the west, but this school sucks 100x worse than any State university or any community college. Professors are fine at teaching , but they're limited to teach. Students fall behind and don't even show up to class, but they still manage to pass class. School is so small. The highest math class you could take is Pre-Cal or Statistics. There has been a case when a professor from Washington State University sued this school for its horrific academics. I feel bad for these students. In conclusion,  don't be fooled by their trickery, aka their scholarships because they may make look good, but I would rather spend my money somewhere that is worth my money and my education. Another thing, this school is more flexible towards those students who stay and dorm. They don't care for their commuter students."
College Freshman,1,"we do not even mention greeks at all in my school, so i have nothing to say about this subject"
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life so it sucks
College Freshman,1,I don't party so I don't know what it is like.
College Senior,1,we dont have any help finding off campus housing
College Sophomore,1,It is the worst because at HNU we dont have any type of Greek life
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any type of health center really for the students which is ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,You have to drive almost 20 minutes to get anything that is not pizza or fast food. 
College Sophomore,1,There is no college transportation help. If you want to go somewhere you have to find a way yourself. 
College Sophomore,1, My major really gives me a handful so I rarely party. 
College Sophomore,1,"The nearest Dining places are Taco Bell and Sparky's. The school is located in an area where there is not a great amount of places to dine or for distraction after a long studious week. By taking a bus ride to the closest Bart Station, there are a couple of small Mexican Restaurants. But, even then the buses do not run often."
College Freshman,1,There are not enough computers and they are not fully dependable.
College Sophomore,1,"There is often no hot water in the dormitories, even in 40 degree winters. The blinds are constantly breaking. The dorms need a serious upgrade, they just aren't aesthetically appealing. The gymnasium only has bleachers on 3 of 4 sides, and they are very small at that. The cafeteria is nice, but the meals are often unappetizing. Parking near the dorms are limited. It just isn't worth the cost of attendance here. There isn't much to do off campus if you don't have a car. Public transportation isn't too safe."
College Freshman,1,"We have a cafeteria on campus and you can choose form one, two,three meals a day."
College Sophomore,1,"The only school policy that can really affect students are their parking policies. Students already pay a great amount of money to attend the school, but yet, they only offer limited amounts of parking spaces for commuter students and if you park at a non-student designated space, you can get ticketed by the school."

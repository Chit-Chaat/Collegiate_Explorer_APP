Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman here at SUU and I really like the teachers. They're professional, but still approachable. They've reached out to me several times to ask if they could help with anything."
Freshman,5,I'm doing most of it over Zoom because of the pandemic. It's gone completely fine so far. Everything is available to me online. I can pretty easily take an entire class without even stepping foot on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I haven't taken any classes online yet, but the advisors are great at helping you find the right classes and I am excited for this coming semester!"
Sophomore,5,I really like the professors. They are there to help you! I also like all of the social events there. I know I will make many friends! No changes that I can think of!
Freshman,5,"The online experience I have had with Southern Utah University has been wonderful. I am aware of all deadlines, needed materials, and assignments before hand. I have wonderful teachers who are working hard to adjust to online or who have been doing it for years. Both of which are doing a great job. Tuition is reasonable and the experience has been overall exciting and not too stressful."
Sophomore,5,They have done really well with covid and they actually have a lot of majors that you can complete all online. The professors are quick to reply and they hold online office hours if you are struggling to communicate your concerns through email
Freshman,5,"SUU has a wonderful academic program with personalized instruction and a clean, uplifting campus life. Professors and students work together and the level of education is high."
Freshman,5,"Online experience was a breeze, Southern Utah continued to help students every step of the way. Classes were accessible as well as professors and students were encouraged to reach out at any time for additional help. Similarly, academic advisors were ready and willing to help at all times."
Alum,5,Very simple and easy to use. Good communication with professors. I really enjoyed the platform that they used for classes.
Alum,5,Small class sizes and personal professors made the experience incredible. The cost of tuition was reasonable and campus was great.
Senior,5,"Choosing to attend SUU was the greatest decision! They offer a good wide variety of high quality courses, activities, and resources. It has a great campus and the surrounding community is very supportive."
Alum,5,Perfect school in a small-town with faculty that cares for student health and well-being. The administration and professors have shown so much support through many current issues our world is facing!
Alum,5,Southern Utah University took great care in working with students as they transitioned online. They have communicated well and are concerned about the needs of students!

Junior,5,"Learning online was a bit difficult since I'm used to learning in person, my professors worked with me and made my experience good."
Freshman,5,i have not taken an online class but i am registered for one and I'm excited to see how it works and if its easy!
Freshman,5,the entry process has been very stress free and everyone is so kind and helpful. Im very excited to start the school year!
Sophomore,5,"SUU has small classes which allows for better learning. It is a pretty small college, but not too small. It makes me feel like home. Everyone is so friendly and inviting. The professors work with you and help you towards success."
Freshman,5,Having to go online because of COVID-19 made school kind of boring but the classes themselves were still interactive.
Freshman,5,I love SUU! The campus is beautiful and the professors are very nice. The sports are my favorite part of SUU. Cedar city is such a cute town and is filled with supporting small businesses. We have a starving student card that helps feed students and has amazing deals for the local restaurants. I can’t wait to graduate with my friends and join the work force with my dream job with biology major! Go thunderbirds!!
Junior,5,I loved Southern Utah University. The class sizes are small and very helpful when it comes to knowing your professors and classmates. Life on campus is always a fun time as well!
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the welcoming staff and students. I feel that there are a variety of valuable resources available and the small class sizes allow for the professors to get to know you and help you more individually.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a couple of classes online and everything was always easily accessible and planned out well.
Alum,5,What makes Southern Utah University really great is the small classroom sizes. Most classes are not allowed to go over 30 students. This makes it really great to get know your professor. Southern Utah University has a very beautiful campus as well.
Niche User,5,I have visited and loved SUU. They have a wonderful atmosphere and are always offering scholarships and way to make your education more affordable! The application process is super easy to do and doesn't take to long because they understand how busy life is and are just trying to make easier for you!
Freshman,5,Although Southern Utah University in in such a small city they off big opportunities. I have been helped so much financially. The truly do love their students and only push for you to continue to attend and graduate from here!
Freshman,5,I loved the Red Riot event and can not wait to attend school there in the upcoming year. The Southern Utah University campus is absolutely beautiful and the walk from building to building is short and pleasant. The weather is great considering I am from Southern California where the temperatures are over one hundred degrees in the summertime. The hospitality of your student guides is amazing and I hope to be one of them in the future.
Sophomore,5,"It's where I grew up and there are always campus events to go to get students involved. They have really great professors, super easy going and willing to work with all different types of students. I haven't taken a class where I didn't enjoy the professor.  They have tutors that like to help students learn and make creative ways for students to understand what they're learning about."
Junior,5,"All the professors are very willing to work with you. It has been a great experience, there is always something to do and cedar city is a beautiful place to live."
Freshman,5,Southern Utah University is a great college. It has so many resources available to students. Also the campus is not too big yet not too small! The professors there really do want to help you succeed and will work with you to help you with anything you need. There are so many great events that occur on campus.
Junior,5,All the professors are so nice and willing to help me individually. I learn a lot and my experience was wonderful!
Junior,5,This is a great school. I moved here ( Cedar City) from the Mid-west. As soon as I landed here it  felt like home.
Freshman,5,There is absolutely nothing I would change about SUU! The staff will do anything they can to help you succeed and the students are so friendly. Cedar City is in such a great location and it isn't big so it won't overwhelm you. I am definitely going to spend all four years here!
Freshman,5,I loved the campus. The campus is absolutely breathtaking. The people who work there are very helpful and make you feel welcomed. SUU also has the career I want to go into. SUU also puts me right in the classes early so I don’t have to wait till I’m a junior and realize I want to do something else. SUU wants me to succeed.
Sophomore,5,Southern Utah University is a great college and has a great environment. The teachers are great and helpful. Library is so peaceful and perfect place to study. Utah is such a beautiful place and you can go hiking and so many other activities so close to campus.
Freshman,5,"I love Southern Utah University for many reasons. First of all, it is a perfect size. The campus is smaller than many others I've seen, but I like that because it isn't so overwhelming. Not only is the campus a great size, but so are the classes. There are enough students to learn and grow with over the semester, but not so many that the professors can't know everyone by name. All of my professors knew my name which made me feel like they really cared about me, which made my experience even better. If I could change one thing about SUU, I would  change the amount of clubs. It would be great if there were even more. Overall, Southern Utah University is an amazing school and I am so glad I chose this college."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Southern Utah University. I'm majoring in Outdoor Recreation, Parks and Tourism and there isn't a better University for it. The classes are small, allowing for better professor/student relationships. The professors are very approachable and more than willing to help every student. The classes themselves are interesting in their subjects while still getting the requirements. For example, my Geology 1050 focuses on the National Parks, helping me for my future career as a Park Ranger. The small campus makes for timely transportation  between classes. Additionally, it's known as University of the Parks because it's less than a 5 hour drive to 5 national parks. Not to mention it's proximity to local canyons, lakes, trails, and other national features. The campus life is big enough to have many activities to choose from daily, but small enough to recognize people and make friends."
Niche User,5,"Southern Utah University is in my home town and I have enjoyed participating in it's activities with friends and families. It is an amazing school in an amazing little city and it is one of the top nursing degree schools in the state of Utah, which is why I've decided to enroll here."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Southern Utah University. The class sizes are very small, which makes it a lot easier for your professors to get to know you. They are very personable with you and typically know your full name by heart. I would like to see the type of students at this school change. Most students are LDS based and it seems a little uncomfortable when you are not."
Senior,5,"I love the outdoor opportunities that are given and made available. The nursing program is very personable and strives to help students succeed in their schooling. The teacher are very willing to help each student and care about their achievements and success. The university as a whole is small in size, growing in population, and is continuing to raise the bar. Being an student at Southern Utah University has been such a great experience overall and I would recommend going here to pretty much any one looking for an amazing university."
Freshman,5,Southern Utah University is a wonderful option for students that would like a more personal classroom environment. All of the professors know you by name and want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE SUU! It is such a cute town, and all the faculty and professors really want you to succeed. I really feel loved by the people at SUU. This is definitely amplified by the incredibly small class sizes. My largest class that I am in currently has about 25 students in it. This really allows me to get to know my professors, as well as makes it really easy for students in general to get to know their professors which in turn improves our grades!"
Sophomore,5,"This is an incredible school. The area is very safe, there's always something to do on campus, and the professors really care about students understanding the course material. I can't recommend this school enough."
Freshman,5,I love the support they offer their students and how willing they are to work with you to get you set up for classes
Freshman,5,"The classes sizes are awesome, and the professors are happy to help all the time. There are tons of fun opportunities to get involved as well."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman this year at Southern Utah University and I have had the warmest welcome. The students and staff are so nice to everyone. The facilities are new and nice. I am very pleased with this college and would definitely recommend it!
Sophomore,5,"I’ve really enjoyed SUU so far, it’s got a great environment. Everyone is really friendly and helpful.  The faculty and staff work really hard to make sure all of the students (especially the new ones) are settling in well and doing ok.  The professors are also super nice and helpful and try their best to know and help all of their students, it’s been good."
Freshman,5,"Southern Utah is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to go to a big school. I came from a Northern Utah private school of 180 students (9-12) and my graduating class was 50. I feel right at home and forget that I moved 4 hours away. It's easy to find your way around campus and cheap compared to other colleges. Everyone at SUU, from professors to RAs, wants you to succeed. I have had a hard time transitioning, but I feel comfortable reaching out for help, and now I'm getting the resources I need to continue on my journey. GO T-BIRDS!!!"
Freshman,5,There is great people and teachers. They truly want their students to succeed. I am a freshman this year and have been welcomed with open arms. Everyone is willing to help and cares for each other. Wether you you are living on or off campus there is always a place for you. There is off campus housing that is affordable and really close to the school.
Sophomore,5,"The school is small, homey and a great place to spend your college experience. You get a very personal experience with the professors. The classes are small and well structured. Tuition is very cheap and there are a ton of financial aid options."
Sophomore,5,"At first, Southern Utah University wasn't my in my top 3 choices for a college to join. But it has been the best decision I have made for my education. This college is remarkable. As I took a campus tour and looked at the opportunities it offered I found that this college is really a diamond in the rough. The class sizes are a bit smaller so the professors can help you more. Many of the professors will bend over backward for you to succeed if you talk with them and put in the work. There are so many resources to be connected with job opportunities after your college experience, so the school isn't about just the here and now but it is truly looking forward to the success and happiness of the students who go there."
Sophomore,5,"The Jumpstart program and teachers were amazing. All the faculty I have ever communicated with were kind and helpful. The staff are so caring, especially when it comes to injuries that require special circumstances. As far as changes, it would be nice to see more food options on campus for people with food restrictions."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus! It's large and beautiful during rain or shine. It's not unusual so see people outside chilling in hammocks or playing with friends. My professors are all lovely and take an interest in you individually. With all the clubs and events, it is so easy to make new friends and get yourself out there."
Niche User,5,"I loved Cedar City, and I really enjoyed school at Southern Utah University. I especially appreciated the students involvement in politics and their support for diversity in the school. All of the professors I had cared about the students and their success, and their teaching reflected that."
Sophomore,5,Southern Utah University is the place to receive your education!! Great place with amazing National Parks surrounding it!
Sophomore,5,"From the minute that I arrived at the school, I felt at home. I was immediately surrounded by so many people who have been nothing but supportive and loving from the start. I cannot see myself being this happy anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"everyone is so helpful in making you feel comfortable applying and joining the T-Bird family! There are so many people around willing to help you out the best they can, they have amazing professors that have the availability to help you one on one if you need. There is also a lot of new people that attend the school so you have the opportunity to make tons of new friends each and everyday!"
Freshman,5,"SUU is a Great school to be a part of. It seems like they are always having dances and other activities. 
Your money will be put to good use Academic wise. They are up there in the return on investment ratio and the professors are truly knowledgable in their field."
Niche User,5,"These people are so encouraging and helpful! I even had someone personally call and talk to me on the phone for a long time! The website and emails are easy to use, and I can't wait to be a T bird!"
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful with a variety of weather that allows you to experience the mountains in all seasons.  There is plenty of outdoor adventures.  The school is diverse yet communal.  The professors are helpful and challenging.
Freshman,4,"Southern Utah University has a wonderful atmosphere for students and faculty alike. Reasonable tuition, great professors, and amazing students. I have made friends with almost everyone I have met here. My housing is fair for the amount I paid, I have a generous scholarship and am loving classes. It is also one of the only colleges near my hometown with my degree plan. The only thing that has caused me problems has been communication with the school."
Sophomore,4,"It’s small so the professors give you a lot of help, even in the General Ed classes. But they have tons of activities so that students can relax and forget about their stresses. The campus has lots of facilities for students to use for free. Even with covid it has been awesome"
Freshman,4,I am a current student in my first year and I am still adjusting to the college life.  so far SUU has made the experience wonderful by helping me to be educated on all my decisions.
Freshman,4,"This is my very first year attending Southern Utah University and I already feel like I am home! I haven't even met any of my professors but I have made many friends that tell me that SUU is the best. Even though I am only a freshman I have received ample support and opportunities to get involved that excites me about getting started. It is very clear to me that here at SUU, they want their students to love being here and to be successful."
Sophomore,4,The online learning was very hard. It is hard to engage in a class when you are sitting at home and not in the classroom. I had a very hard time with it. The teachers put in a lot of time making lecture videos to try and give us the best resources which helped.
Sophomore,4,"The student environment is amazing and the professors and staff really care about your success. All of my professors have been genuinely caring and supper helpful.  I've loved the time I've spent at Southern Utah university. They spend so much time building a community and an environment that is not only great for farthing your education, but also one that  you can make lasting friend ships and gain important life lessons. It's a place that I love and one where you want to stay."
Sophomore,4,Going to Southern Utah University has been a wonderful experience! The campus is small and has great teachers!
Niche User,4,I love the town of Cedar City and the  campus is very open. I love all the trees and fields they have around. I also love their theater programs
Freshman,4,I think its a great place to be down there its not too cold and not to warm the people are amazing and super nice
Junior,4,SUU was great until they changed to trimesters. Give it time and see how it turns out before applying
Sophomore,4,"I know many people really love this school. There are some awesome professors here, and a wide range of areas of study. Word of advice though: This is a very outgoing/extraverted school, so if you are an introvert, it may be a little rough attending here as a Freshman, as the 3-day orientation is very extraverted. But overall I like the area and the professors."
Sophomore,4,I love how small the classes are and how caring the professors have been. It is a outdoor focused school which is amazing.
Niche User,4,"I love love the social life, and campus. The town is small enough to want to go out and do things in."
Sophomore,4,"Southern Utah University is a pretty good university! Campus is very safe and inviting and from what I've experienced, most of the professors are great!"
Freshman,4,"The university sits in a small, open city with mountains to the side. Around the city are many good hiking trails with great high altitude exposure. The campus itself is easily maneuverable, with maps stationed at critical areas and an overall smaller campus size. The campus food isn't amazing, but the are is very pretty with the bluest sky you will ever see, red rocks in the mountains, and just about 45 minutes from the social aspects and beautiful parks of St. George."
Freshman,4,I live off-campus and love it!! This is my first semester at SUU and I'm kind of an introvert which is perfect because I can hole up in my apartment with a really good book.
Freshman,4,"Southern Utah University is a great school. They have unique opportunities that no other schools have. The professors and advisers really do care about each student individually and their are so many activities around campus that anyone can find a spot for them. People here are so friendly and so welcoming. The campus can be freezing so make sure you bring warm clothes, but it's comforting to know that just a half hour away is a nice warm retreat. Cedar city is really beautiful and they have well manicured biking trails for outdoors people. I believe anyone can really enjoy this institution if they apply themselves to their studies and into finding a club or extracurricular activity they believe in. I really love my professors and I'm excited to spend the rest of my undergrad experience here."
Niche User,4,"I liked their ability when there were only a few students they would make sure that they were able to be educated and make sure they have had their moneys worth. The food was also a great thing, rarely have I been to a college that prepares perfect home cooked meals to thousands of students."
Alum,4,Southern Utah University is an excellent school. The programs offered are top notch and the faculty are extremely competent and care about the students. The University has a vast array of clubs and programs to involve students which creates a good feeling of community.
Junior,4,I love the small town feel. And the campus is so beautiful and easy to navigate.  I love that you have smaller classes and the chance to get to know your teacher.
Sophomore,4,The campus is very diverse and the on-campus activities are very fun. The teachers will work with you if you need help. The campus is small enough to walk around and that you can get to know a lot of people here.
Junior,4,"SUU has a beautiful campus and wonderful professors!  It's in a good part of town, and there is a lot going on a lot of the time."
Junior,4,I love the location of SUU. Southern Utah is beautiful with a great community around it. Counselors will gladly help with your path of education with suggested classes you need. There is such pride with everyone soaring as a T-Bird from athletics to academia.
Freshman,4,"This is my first semester at SUU. I enjoy the campus and the staff. The class sizes are small and the professors care for the student's success. Campus is really small so it is easy to walk everywhere. Permit parking is limited, but the free parking lots are huge and are just off campus, making the walk a little bit longer. The on-campus food options are very limited and the lines can get a bit long sometimes, but overall it is good food. The library is a great place to study with lots of places for group study sessions or quiet study by yourself. Cedar City has a small-town feel and that is something I like, being from a smaller town. There is a lot to do for outdoorsy people and creative minds. All in all, the pros outweigh the cons for me."
Junior,4,Southern Utah University is a very welcoming school. The professors are patient  and are very single-minded towards students are their goals. There is a lot of outdoor activities and is a great place for outdoor recreation majors.
Junior,4,"Southern Utah is a small town university that, in many fields, is recognized at a high level. Job placement is great leaving SUU and overall it is a great atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"I love how small the campus is. Not only does it make getting around easier, I feel like it also increases the social experience. Since it's so small you can see the same people all over campus, which makes making new friends so much easier!"
Sophomore,4,"I currently attend Southern Utah University, as a whole I love the university. It is a small town that is almost all college students. There is not much around, it takes traveling 30 minutes to an hour out of town to get to anything overly exciting. The professors almost always know your name, the class sizes are no bigger than the ones that I had in high school. They try to make your academics a large priority."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience has been pretty good. The only complaint I have is that I am an online only student, and the online courses fill up very fast. It would be better if they created online classes that were strictly for those students who aren't close to campus and need online courses. Their student to student mentorship is a great way to connect with other students and get another student's advice on courses and professors, as well as campus life."
Freshman,4,I like how small the campus is and how the professors know you by name. I would like to see more students come here that are interested in more than fine arts and athletic programs.
Junior,4,"Great professors who care about you and your grades. Many of the professors understand what it is like to be a college student so they help you out when they can.  Small class sizes make the class more interactive.  Great University in general, only issue, is the town it's located in, is small."
Freshman,4,The university has a very welcoming atmosphere and everyone is super friendly. The classrooms are smaller than most universities so students get to really know their professors.
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, nice administration and faculty. The classes are small which is great and feels like the professors can get to know their students"
Junior,4,I have been at SUU for two years and it's a great school. Everyone here is really nice. The professors care about the students and the class sizes a small. It's a great school for theatre majors because of the connection with the Utah Shakespeare Festival.
Sophomore,4,I really liked the environment of Southern Utah University. The campus is the prettiest university I have ever seen and the faculty and student life is very active. There's always something fun and supportive going on.
Junior,4,"I love how SUU is close to several different state park and outdoor activities. The teachers encourage student to visit them during their office hours, whether it is for help with home work or just to talk about their field of study."
Freshman,4,"Southern Utah University is a great school as far as academics and the people you come in contact with. The only thing about it that I don’t like, is how small the town is that it’s in. You’re very limited in options for shopping, food, and other liesure activities."
Sophomore,4,The university is pretty nice! It is not to big and not to small either. The students are very nice and you can definitely make friends. The only thing is that there is not much to do in the cedar city which can be very boring.
Junior,4,SUU is a great school! If you are planning on attending this school do not stay in the dorms. The RA's are rude and act like they are superior to everyone. There are a lot of other student apartments near campus that are way cheaper than staying in the dorms too. The professors are great and are really invested in helping the students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere on campus is amazing. There are always school sponsored events going on, and plenty of things to do in the community. It has many outdoor adventures just waiting for you to explore, and many new and friendly people to meet! With St. George just a 40 minute drive away, more adventures are out there as well!"
Freshman,4,"I did the Campus tour and also attended the Red Riot Weekend!  It was a blast.  They have a great campus, advisors, teachers and the food was great too.  The campus is close to a lot of outdoor activities.  I'm going into Business and my advisor was great help, to get me signed up for the right classes.  I can't wait to start at SUU this Fall."
Sophomore,4,I love the school. The professors know what they are teaching and are very helpful. The only down side is the town. Kind of boring with not a lot to do.
Freshman,4,"Southern Utah University is a beautiful place to study at. People are very nice and it perfectly fits for anyone in love with the mountain. The Athletic Teams are getting better each  year, the diversity is also improving with more and more international students. The fact that is a small campus permits to have small classes and better interaction with the teachers. Living on the campus is peaceful, it is a dry campus and it is pretty safe. The thing I will try to improve is the food at the cafeteria on the weekends. The campus is located almost in the center of the city which is really nice to go bowling or to the theater or to go get food at Walmart for instance. It is definitly not the best spot if you attend college to do party every night but for me it is a very nice place to study in a peaceful environment and be able to visit different parks each weekend."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the school. It is a smaller campus, and that makes getting from one class to the next easier. The professors are genuinely interested in what you are doing with your life. They want to help you figure out what fields of study you would like, or what could be best for you. They really encourage one on one time if a student isn't grasping something that is being taught. The University also has great faculty and staff. The faculty members really help the students answer questions they have from finances to anything about the campus or classes. The University also has a great advisory staff that help to make sure that you are doing everything that you need to be doing to be able to graduate from the school, and to help you any way they can with making sure that you are doing what you want to do. The University also helps out with the community, and they encourage involvement for everyone. It is a great University."
Freshman,4,I love it here at Southern Utah University.  I have only been here for one semester but I am enjoying it.  There are great professors who are willing to help.  The academic advisers are very helpful.  The life on campus is just positive and nice.  I've never felt uncomfortable on campus which is a reason why I am choosing to stay down here fore a while.
Senior,4,"I transferred from another Utah University, and SUU has been a better overall experience. The campus is great, and if you like outdoors Cedar City is AMAZING to live in. It's a really good school.  If you want an awesome social scene, probably not the best fit though."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere at SUU. It has small classes which helps me learn and it is in a small quiet and peaceful town. It is near a lot of out doors recreation which means lots of fun any time of the year.
Junior,4,"SUU is small enough to be comfortable, but large enough that it has some diversity. The professors are great, and genuinely care about their students success."
Freshman,4,"It has friendly,cooperative and encouraging faculties who help you in every way possible. As an international student, I feel really comfortable studying here in Southern Utah University. The local people, fellow students, everyone are really warm and welcoming. They will try to help you in your problems. And if you walk past them, they will always give you a smile and greet you."
Freshman,4,It is very diverse and that is a good thing for this school. Everything is pretty good here but the town itself is small. There is not a lot of things to do and that is the main reason I am moving.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus so much. It is beautiful with old buildings and good landscaping. There is a fairly large variety of majors, programs, and courses. I didn't have the best experience with some of my professors, though."
Senior,4,"My experience has been good because of the professors who are really interested in me succeeding in their classes. Every is very helpful, with a lot of programs that can help you have a great experience at the University; like the Writing Center, Tutoring Center and the Student Center. I have enjoyed my time here."
Freshman,4,"I have loved being at SUU it’s an amazing school. The class sizes are smaller and makes it easier to learn and get to know your professors. All the faculty here care about your education. The dining hall is not that great and living on campus is a little expensive, so I would recommend living off campus, but overall SUU is a great place to get a college education."
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience at SUU for the last two years.  Students and staff here have all mostly been helpful and agreeable to deal with.  I would like to have more class times available for certain classes and possibly having more parking areas nearer to campus would be better
Sophomore,4,"I really like the school overall, but they could have a bigger variety of classes and times to take them. The professors are helpful and care it you succeed."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful! There is a big variety of students who attend. The facilities are always clean. The professors work well with you.
Niche User,4,"I haven't actually been taking classes at the school because I am still in high school. So far though they have been really good to work with me while I decide where I want to go to school. I love their campus, it is very pretty."
Freshman,4,"SUU is an amazing school and you really feel connected to campus. Professors care about you, and the education you receive is outstanding. Having a small campus is great, but there hasn't been enough preparation for larger classes of incoming students."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time at SUU. The weather here is great, and there is always something going on around campus. There are so many different clubs that you can join and the staff is excellent. So far everyone has only wanted to help me succeed here."
Sophomore,4,"SUU is great, I love the campus and the environment. All of the professors are very nice and really try to get to know their students. The class sizes are small which make it a great learning experience."
Sophomore,2,the cashiers office made it so I was dropped from my classes for a semester due to them NOT placing my grant on my account so my semester was paid for.
Sophomore,2,I hate learning online because I don't get all the information I would have in regular lectures. To me there is more information that I can get in physical lectures rather than primarily online courses
Graduate Student,2,"I'm doing the Masters of Public Administration ONLINE and if you are considering it because they say that they are geared for the working professional, DON'T GO HERE. While I have learned and some of the professors are great (Ravi Roy!) Most of them have experience working the field, but have no idea how to teach (if I wanted to just read textbooks, I wouldn't need class) AND have little to no consideration of the schedule constraints of those working full-time jobs.
I've had multiple classes only open assignments for less than a week, and won't let you look at them a head of time. This prevents students from working a head, when life permits, in order to accommodate when life doesn't. As a teacher, the end of these classes is the same time as the busiest part of my teaching schedule, I work a head to prevent overload and subpar work. When professors say, ""Online classes are not to be confused with home study courses."" They show how little they care. Go somewhere else."
Graduate Student,2,"I'm doing the Masters of Public Administration ONLINE and if you are considering it because they say that they are geared for the working professional, DON'T GO HERE. While I have learned and some of the professors are great (Ravi Roy!) Most of them have experience working the field, but have no idea how to teach (if I wanted to just read textbooks, I wouldn't need class) AND have little to no consideration of the schedule constraints of those working full-time jobs.
I've had multiple classes only open assignments for less than a week, and won't let you look at them a head of time. This prevents students from working a head, when life permits, in order to accommodate when life doesn't. As a teacher, the end of these classes is the same time as the busiest part of my teaching schedule, I work a head to prevent overload and subpar work.

College Junior,2,I haven't really heard anything about Greek Life
College Freshman,2,"housing is expensive and not good. Since a meal plan is required for the dorms, living on campus is not worth it"
College Freshman,2,Without a car you're lost in this small town.
College Sophomore,2,"See, the Greek life here is terrible because we only have two sororities and two fraternities."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Cedar Hall South and practically want to rip my hair out. The space isn't that small, but merely impossible to keep clean. Although we have quiet hours, they aren't enforced nor does any disciplinary action take place when needing to be enforced. The thermostat takes a year and a half to change, and by then the weather is different."
College Freshman,2,"We are a small town, with not a lot to compete with, and yet we don't do very well. Except for gymnastics. Go gymnastics."
College Freshman,2,"Hardly any variety, usually cold"
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is full of kids that their parents obviously thought they still needed a babysitter. Most are very immature, I have lived in both the Cedar Hall and Eccles dorms and have not had good experiences in either one. They are way overpriced and not worth the value at all. Cedar Hall makes you buy a meal plan, and the food is nasty, and also way overpriced. I would not recommend living on campus to anyone unless they do indeed need a babysitter."
College Senior,2,Gymnastics is our best sport. Football team isn't great but getting better. The PE building however is new and has some pretty nice facilities for students.
College Senior,2,"It's difficult being in such a small town. The restaurants are not as close as I would have liked them to be, but fast food is still within walking distance. The only late night options are Denny's and the mexican food place."
College Freshman,2,You're mainly going to eat fast food. There's not much else in a small town.
College Freshman,2,"The city itself is really boring. Sure it has a cute main street and all, but most of the fun here is found in the wilderness. If you want shopping and dining, then you better prepare to drive 45mins to St. George."
Recent Alumnus,2,school prices keep raising with no kickback.
Recent Alumnus,2,"bad to okay.

living on campus is extremely limited. food/atmosphere/hangouts.  you name it, this school lacks it"
College Sophomore,2,I have been trying to find scholarships since my senior year of high school with no luck. My dad makes enough money that I do not receive financial aid and my parents are only going to be able to help me for 1 more semester. My schooling has put a great financial strain on my family. It is very difficult to get scholarships once you are enrolled in college and it is even more difficult especially if you are not part of a minority.
College Sophomore,2,Not much in little Cedar city! Students who chose to come here shouldn't expect that though. I personally don't mind.
College Sophomore,2,"It's Utah, what can you expect?"
College Student,2,"Here if you do not go to a ward you are shunned by some people some people are accepting though 50,50."
College Student,2,I don't know I really don't want to be a Greek.
College Student,2,Overalls only eat at two places on campus
College Student,2,Concerning health there is nothing. But we do have campus police.
College Freshman,2,The greek life at SUU is not like other schools. No parties and not as big of a deal as other larger schools. Its expensive to be in Greek life for no benefit.
College Sophomore,2,Not much nightlife at all. I song hear of many parties and theres only 2 bars in town
College Sophomore,2,Almost everyone is Mormon and pretty religious.  Church is a BIG thing in this town.  I didn't know this before coming here
College Sophomore,2,We don't have any means of transportation. A public bus would be great.  Or even a bus to St George which is a bigger town south of here.  But besides that a bike is just fine in the summer or when its not freezing and snowy.
College Junior,2,"I would not choose the program again. It's a total mess, and almost impossible to graduate from in time."
College Junior,2,You apply. They ensure you a pulse. You get in. The prestige of the program is incredible. :/
College Junior,2,"There is no diversity - the entire town has been whitewashed, except for the housecleaners, and I don't even know where they live, because it's no anywhere in town. Also, LGTB kids be warned, acceptance is low."
College Junior,2,"Most people are pretty hardcore Mormon so its hard to be something other than that at times. But also there are really cool people as well that are pretty accepting, but mostly judging mormon people."
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have transportation options at our school
College Freshman,2,"I was going to be a communication major, but that didnt turn out."
College Freshman,2,Small town but spread enough you need a car to get places but no public transportation.
College Freshman,2,I would recommend having car. You can walk places but its definitely easier to you to have your own personal transportation.
College Student,2,It is nothing like the greeks that they show in the movies.  It is complete different.
College Junior,2,there aren't enough businesses to supply the demand for internships. you need to look far and wide.
College Junior,2,people go to other peoples' apartments to hang out. some people have game nights which include imaginative games but the town is barren of nightlife entertainment.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think it is very diverse in any of these areas.  
College Sophomore,2,weather as of late has been very cold.  It takes a matter of minutes and you are frozen. Walking across the campus in this type of weather is difficult.
College Freshman,2,I have to eat in the dining hall and it is not the best food in the world. 
College Freshman,2,"Nobody is willing to help me through it, they just direct me to different websites and sources. "
College Sophomore,2,The Greek Life doesn't really exist when you compare them to larger universities.
College Sophomore,2,"Very little diversity, considering that Cedar City and the state of Utah is largely white and Mormon. However, there is a good minority of Saudi students at the school, and I spend quite a bit of time with them. SUU has improved their diversity in the span of a year. Still needs improvement, so that I can experience a variety of people and not just a single, dominating belief."
College Junior,2,There isn't a lot of drug use that I notice on campus but every once in a while you can smell it.  
College Junior,2,I think it's ridiculous how much they charge for parking when there are so many other fees we have to pay for participating in school.
College Freshman,2,Most of us just get a ride from friends.
College Freshman,2,I'm not apart of Greek life and do not care to be.
College Freshman,2,"Never been, it kinda dangerous to walk mainly if you are going alone."
College Freshman,2,The dining halls food is way too greasy. 
College Freshman,2,Apply for loads of scholarships.
College Freshman,2,There could be some better shops.
College Freshman,2,There could be more spots to park.
College Freshman,2,The second week living on campus my roommate and I had some money stolen. But when we went to the Police they were EXTREMELY helpful and willing to listen.
College Sophomore,2,"For a Utah school, Southern Utah University is pretty diverse. There are many different religions, races, political views, etc., but in comparison to schools in other states, it isn't very out of the ordinary. The fact that it is a small school makes it slightly more difficult to find a lot of diversity."
College Sophomore,2,"If you live close to campus, you don't need a parking permit, just walk.  Off street parking is free."
College Sophomore,2,"Run down, maintenance is poor, availability is okay, convenience to campus is good, parking can be tricky, cost varies."
College Sophomore,2,"Cafeteria food is average, there are a few places to eat on campus, not something I would want every day."
Sophomore,1,"SUU has completely disappointed me so far. They advertise WUE on their website as 150% of resident  tuition. My acceptance letter said I got the WUE scholarship. A few days before school I was told I actually had to pay out of state tuition. THEN, SUU’s financial aid office lost one of my scholarship check, which I know was sent to them because I spoke to the scholarship organization. So I had to set up a payment plan just so my classes wouldn’t be dropped & I’m still waiting on them to get my scholarship check. They completely screwed me over & I moved here from Hawaii & set up a lease before I figured out what happened so I can’t move. I would not recommend SUU to anyone after going through this. Also, other students have told me that the financial aid office lost their scholarship checks, too. This is ridiculous & something needs to change. I’m asking for a refund."
Senior,1,"I hate SUU! They are terrible with their students! Force all students to take an online class for 3 semesters and don't tell you about it until you are registered, change policies without letting students know, and won't work with them at all! I would suggest go to a different school!!"
College Senior,1,i am sick of all of the things that they do. Annoying fraternities and what not.
Recent Alumnus,1,they are very cliquey and superficial
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall was terrible. When I toured for while still in high school I thought it was good. After being here you realize the days that they have big high school tours the food quality is increased a lot. Food is often undercooked or overcooked, and definitely not worth the money you pay for it. Also if you were to buy a meal plan for lets say 15 meals a week. If you only use 10 of those meals they will not transfer to the next week, they will not let you swipe your card for someone else even though you paid for the meals. They say that they accept feedback and are continuing to grow but, its still the same crappy food. You are better off going to McDonald's or eating top ramen every night."
College Student,1,"Campus is never open late on the weekends and the Birdhouse is always shut during the weekends. Therefore it leaves students with hardly any place to study during the later hours of the evenings, let alone the mornings on the weekends."
College Junior,1,"I tried to get financial aid many times but I do not qualify because I'm not either married, have any children, or in any military service."
Recent Alumnus,1,no parties ever... and when i started a club and tried to bring more dances and parties we were met with HUGE negativity and almost all our events were shut down
College Student,1,It's cold and windy. I'm not going outside with that type of weather.
College Student,1,Nothing really goes on after 9 except movies.
College Junior,1,"There's so much of a focus on the outdoors that the town forgot to add anything else. And it snows six months out of the year, so unless you feel like snow-shoeing for the millionth time, it's extremely limited."
College Junior,1,"Not a lot of school spirit, not a lot of involvement. Intramurals are more popular than the actual sport teams."
College Junior,1,"I'm from Vegas. Cedar has a last call. What is that? In all seriousness, there isn't much nightlife, public transit is almost non-existent, and there are two bars in town, unless you count Applebees. The only ""parties"" are hosted by churches - this is the most Christian public school I can even imagine. It's horrible."
College Junior,1,"There are two bars in town, and then everything else closes at 7."
College Junior,1,"Pretty much winter 6 to 9 months of the year. And a pretty cold winter at that. But the summers are super nice, but then again most people leave over the summer..."
College Freshman,1,We are rated as the worst basketball team in the nation.
College Student,1,Not much to do in a small town
College Sophomore,1,I say it's the worst but only because these spots don't exist as far as I know. If that is what students are wanting they need to attend somewhere else.  This doesn't bother me.
College Freshman,1,"I hate snow. Yes, I have lived my entire life in Utah and chose to stay in the state and in a city that gets a lot of snow, but if you like warm weather Cedar City is not the place for you. "
College Freshman,1,"Live on or near campus, or get a car. Cedar City is so small it doesn't really have a good bus system."
College Freshman,1,"This wasn't an issue for me last year because I lived on-campus, but parking at SUU is definitely lacking.  Spaces fill up FAST, and it seems that the students with vehicles definitely outnumber the parking spaces."
College Freshman,1,"There isn't one.  There's two bars (under 21 but I've been told they're not all that great), and that's about it.  Parties can be found, but you have to seek them out and make friends with the right people.  In Cedar City you have to make your own fun.  I've played more night games since coming to college than I ever did as a kid."
College Freshman,1,"I was never went Greek, but the for the most part they seemed to have a lot of drama.  At the end of my freshmen year the Greeks caused a lot of issues in my building."
College Freshman,1,"I lived in the dorms my first year and had to get a mandatory meal plan- it was a waste of money because the cafeteria was so hit-and-miss.  There were days when I would literally eat a bite of food and then just lose my appetite.  On the bright side, the freshmen fifteen were not a problem.  You can always find at least ONE thing to eat, but it's pretty much guaranteed to be sub-par.  Sometimes they do theme dinners (we had CLUE night and Mediterranean Cruise and things like that), and those dinners were always good."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus fills up fast. Make sure to show up at least 15 minutes before class or else you may be late from looking for a spot. Also, don't believe every sign... I parked in a spot that said students living on campus could park there and ended up getting a ticket."
College Freshman,1,"it was horrible trying to get financial aid, and the school doesnt give financial aid to those who really need it"
College Sophomore,1,"They say that there will be all these activities when you are in on campus housing, but I don't know anyone from any of those activities. Of which, there were few. Also, on campus housing is way too expensive! I looked off campus and I would have to pay less than half and get all the same amenities and my own room. Also, when I tried to move out they said that I would either have to leave the school or just move to other on campus housing. They wouldn't even let us try to sell our contracts."
College Freshman,1,"There are a number of Asian and Middle Eastern exchange students, however, the majority of the school's population are still mormon caucasians (this is Utah, after all).  I'm pretty disappointed with the school's lack of focus on assimilating their foreign students into our community here."
College Freshman,1,"The cafeteria is ridiculously overpriced for the quality of the food.  They have the staples like pizza, fries, burgers, and a salad bar.  There are other options that change daily, and these are very hit-or-miss.  It's very hard to be a vegetarian at this school, as most veggie dishes offered are, well, nasty. Of course, even as a meat-eater options are few.  However, if you like carbs, this food is perfect for you..."
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no nightlife in Cedar City. There are a few bars and maybe one club in town. It's up to you to make your own fun.
College Sophomore,1,Miami to Utah – Coming from Miami to there is absolutely no real nightlife at SUu. Really just those few kids who throw parties at their apts. just to get trashed.
College Sophomore,1,"First and Last – I went to one Chi Phi party while I was at school, and it was a complete s***-show. My friend and I ended up cleaning vomit off the couches and carrying boys to beds so they would fall asleep and stop picking fights."
College Sophomore,1,"Ther is really no public transportation on campus, and Cedar City isn't very big so you kind of need a car to get around the town."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Garage – There are plenty of permits that students can purchase for parking, however, there are not enough parking spots around campus to fill all of those orders.  There are many students that park off campus and pay for permits who have the impression they will have somewhere to park.  They desperately need to build a parking garage.  The cost of a parking garage would be regained after a few years of purchased parking permits.  All of the non-permit parking lots are a few blocks from the campus.  The guarantee here is that many more students would purchase parking permits if they had somewhere on campus to park.  Not to mention that all of the locals would regain the parking in front of their homes that they reserve the right to use, but students take those too (because there is no parking).  My suggestion, walk, carpool, or have someone drop you off."
College Sophomore,1,There is few racial or ethnic background diversity. There is a lot of diversity in sexual orientation.
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Are Lost – Our school only promotes Greek life when there is a charity/event that costs money. Otherwise, we never hear about them."
College Sophomore,1,"Apartments Not Cheap – There are various apartments available for students, but most are very old and expensive. The newer apartments are better looking, and less expensive, but they are mostly only female/male housing, not co-ed. Not a friendly atmosphere for newlyweds/fiance's/couples/really close friends."
College Senior,1,"Not Much – There are only to bars in town so the night life if your over 21 is lacking. There are alot of house parties but they get bust most of the time, and it doesn't matter if your over or under 21 in Utah you'll probably get a ticket of some kind. Then everything closes early so if you want something do at 11 pm its pretty much go to dennys or walmart."
College Student,1,"Worst Deal on Campus – The experience in the cafeteria is overpriced and low quality. The menu is very repetitive. It is very easy to grow tired of the lack of variety. If a meal plan weren't required for student housing residents, I'm sure students would eat elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,Not Much Choice – There are only two fraternities and two sororities. All houses are located right next to campus. The Greeks aren't a big deal at SUU mostly because their events are only open to Greeks. They try to be exclusive.

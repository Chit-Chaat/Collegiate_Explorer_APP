Junior,5,"During this time (the pandemic), almost all classes are online. I think the professors are doing a great job adjusting to this circumstances and transitioning all their materials to online."
Sophomore,5,A great learning experience overall. There's great professors and the campus feels like a second home.
Sophomore,5,The online experience was very good. The professors managed to coordinate the classes very professionally.
Junior,5,"I’m actually about to transfer to BenU from MacMurray college. MacMurray closed this year due to financial problems and the current pandemic did not help the situation either. Im applying for as many scholarships as I can to help make tuition a little more affordable. The tuition price from Macmurray to Benedictine is a little out of my price range but I’m hoping to be able to bring that down even more. I’m super excited to transfer to BenU, everyone has made me feel so welcomed even though I haven’t been on campus yet. BenU really stood out to a lot of my friends from Macmurray which is why I would really like to attend in the fall. I’m still debating whether or not I will play basketball this year, that all just depends on how much I have to work to pay tuition"
Junior,5,"I have not had to take any classes online at BenU yet, but trying to transfer during a pandemic has not been easy but the staff at BenU has made it possible. The professors and counselors have helped me so much to create my schedule, answering any questions I have and always being there to help you when you need it. It’s he’s not visiting a campus before deciding but the staff at BenU have worked really hard to provide video campus tours, they will join you on Zoom if you have any questions and they have all around made this transfer process a lot smoother 
."
Freshman,5,"Benedictine University is an amazing university that is full of opportunities, great professors, and staff that are always ready to help."
Freshman,5,"Benedictine University is an amazing school for business and healthcare professionals. There are many things to do, and the school is a very fun environment. The dorms do need a little bit of work especially the boys' dorm. It is by Downtown Naperville so ordering food is accessible. The cafeteria food is not the best, but there are many different options. It is a very diverse environment to be in, and it is a great school. There are small class sizes which is one of the biggest things I love. The professors are all PhD's so they are very experienced."
Sophomore,5,"Benedictine University is a very diverse school with an average sized campus. Everyone knows everyone, everyone is very nice and the professors are very helpful most of the time."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the atmosphere of Ben U, instantly I felt welcomed by all staff, and the students I have met throughout my first year at Benedictine University. I enjoy the atmosphere of the classes as well because they tend to be small, and you are able to have a one on one relationship with the professor."
Freshman,5,Benedictine University in Mesa is very helpful and close to home but in my opinion the housing is more on the expensive side. Majority of the staff are very friendly and have no problem helping you out when you have questions.
Junior,5,"I love Benedictine University! The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Also downtown Naperville is a couple minutes away with many stores and restaurants. I play lacrosse there and know the athletic department is helpful and friendly to everyone. The campus is small but beautiful with clean, chemical free landscapes and a quad for everyone to use. Some teachers are better than others (like every campus), but it’s easy to learn about each professor through students or even rate my professor."
Graduate Student,5,I was interested in this institution because it offered and excellent dual degree: Master of Science in Nursing /Masters In Business Administration program. The admissions staff members were very knowledgeable about the program curriculum offered. They were very committed to working with me to ensure that the correct documentation was submitted and were readily accessible when I had questions or concerns related to working and pursuing my advanced degrees.
Freshman,5,The campus was nice and small. Benedictine is easy to get around because all the buildings are connected. The majors offered are great to choose from.
Graduate Student,5,I would highly recommend Benedictine to anyone! There nutrition program is amazing and I learned so much while at this campus!
Junior,5,The campus is up to date and welcoming for all students of all ages and everyone is always opening up opportunities for you to fit in some where that you belong. The campus is beautiful as well and such friendly people
Junior,5,"I love to BenU Mesa branch campus! Such an awesome private school experience. It is a small campus but filled with a great environment for students. Located downtown Mesa, a fun little place. It is a great private school investment, with great programs, majors, clubs, and NAIA athletics."
Freshman,5,"I love this school. It has a big feeling for such a small campus. Everyone knows everyone and it is so friendly. There is no crime on campus that I have heard, I fell very safe. There is nothing I would change about the campus. If you are looking for safety, good education and want to know your professors know you by name, this is your place."
Sophomore,5,"I love how close everything in the campus is.  Students are friendly, staff is willing to help you whenever you need it.  My advisor has been awesome and love the small community."
Sophomore,5,I really love this school and what it has to offer. The professors are friendly and willing to help and guide you through the course.
Alum,5,"Benedictine University is one of the best small  Universities a student can choose to attend. It has a new, state of the art business school, an extremely favorable professor-student ratio and a wide variety of quality academic degree programs. Its close proximity to Chicago gives students an outstanding choice of potential internships. Over 80% of fortune 200 companies employ a Benedictine University alum  and that is an impressive statistic by any reasonable measure. I would recommend this fine University to any student seeking a uniquely enriching academic experience."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Benedictine my sophomore year and I immediately felt at home. The staff is nice and understanding, classes are enjoyable, and I think I will be staying at this school."
Freshman,5,"Benedictine University at Mesa, AZ is a university that has what a volleyball player is looking for. For example, scholarships, small classes and great schedules."
Freshman,5,"I love the size of the campus. Everything is easily accessible and convenient. The overall campus vibe is cool and releaxed, very great place to be."
Graduate Student,5,Online program for graduate school is very manageable while working full time. Requires balancing and plan but only focusing on one class at a time is helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Benedictine University at Mesa is great, it's is a nice small school and the professors are amazing. The faculty and staff ensure your success is high and help any way possible. All around great school."
Freshman,5,"This school is really for me. I love the faculty, students, and the amount of people ready to assist me in my studies or finance. I am having a great college experience, thanks to Benedictine!"
College Freshman,5,Our campus really does everything they possibly can to their abilities to keep their students safe
College Freshman,5,accepted me on the Spot!
College Freshman,5,"Benedictine University has one of the best athletic program in all of NCAA division 3. I am a firm believer of that because Benedictine offers a wide range of sporting events that most division 3 do not have. Sporting events at Benedictine are always on the rise every year. But we do not get enough fan support to cheer on our sports teams. So far, our basketball team is undefeated and is ranked number 6 in the nation. Our  athletic facilities are state of the art. You could not find a better facility in the state. I am very thankful that i have this benefit. Benedictine University is made up of 75 percent of athletes. This means that majority of the school is filled with athletes. This is a good think because many students are involved in the activities."
College Sophomore,5,Living close to the campus in an apartment teaches young students to live like an adult.
College Senior,5,Great for what I need!
College Senior,5,"Love the online program, but wish I didn't have to always answer to why I was not able to take a class every qtr."
College Junior,5,"Job fairs are held on campus regularly throughout the year by our Career Development department because they want us to be prepared for our life after we graduate. That department is in charge of finding internships for students, working on resumes and applications, and preparing for life outside of college. They are extremely helpful and want to see students succeed.

The value of a degree from Benedictine is extremely high because our college is known for its challenging learning environment.

There are always opportunities for alumni to visit Benedictine and almost all of the students come back because they had an amazing experience here."
College Junior,5,"We are known as the safest college campus in Illinois, so safety is never an issue on campus and the campus police make themselves very available and open."
College Senior,5,From what I have personally observed the school has acquitted Heath and Safety support on campus.
College Senior,5,For the most part any science major is going to be a heavy workload and a rigorous schedule. The liberal arts and business programs are much more laid back then the sciences.
College Senior,5,"Being a Political Science major is awesome! It's a small student body but the department is continuously hosting events, guest speakers and community service projects. I feel that it is the most involved major in the school."
College Senior,5,The financial aid process is no different than any other university.
College Senior,5,"I am a commuter student so I have no personal experience with finding off-campus housing. But, I know many people who life off-campus who have never complained about it being difficult on them."
College Senior,5,Most of the majors are vary easy to get into unless you are apply for a specific program that requires a special application process. If you get admitted into the university you can basically get into any major you want.
College Senior,5,I switched majors last year and I am so happy I did. The Political Science department is small and pretty much like a family. The faculty and administration actually care about your success and are willing to mentor and advise you every step of the way.
College Senior,5,"The facility and staff are warm and inviting, they are always willing to help a student if they need extra help. Class sizes are small so you get a lot of personal attention in class and all professors know your name. There is always school event going on to get student to interest with one another. There is always a big crowd for sport events and a contagious school spirit for Benedictine sports. There are many facilities around campus to do homework meet with study groups or research on a topic. The librarians are always willing to help student find resources for their projects or studies."
College Senior,5,"The small classroom experience allows your professor to get to know you as a student, which helps in the long run when you are looking for recommendations for graduate school. Every summer the school has BenFest which is a concert lined up with well know artists. There are other social traditions like Benofficial which gives students something to look forward to each year."
College Senior,5,Many students are Muslim. There is a lot of diversity and acceptance school-wide.
College Senior,5,"The premed program at Benedictine is outstanding. Most of the professors are really involved and care about the success of their students. The lab work is high quality and many resources are available at our use. For Anatomy, we are one of the only remaining universities that do extended cadaver work."
College Senior,5,The professors in all departments are motivated and involved in student success. Small class sizes make professors more available.
College Senior,5,I've never had a bad interaction with police.
College Senior,5,"I live off-campus. It is easier to get around Lisle, IL where Benedictine is located if you have a car. Most students living off-campus have cars."
College Sophomore,5,"They are many students from different walks of life. We all carry ourselves through our defined characters. Whether we practice the same beliefs or not, we are respectful to one other. We do not judge nor demonize another person. This is applicable to political beliefs, sexual orientation, and more. We welcome diversity."
College Freshman,5,"Benedictine has a accredited police force on campus. You can see them patrolling the grounds on foot or in a police car. The police station is located in an accessible place (the parking garage). Moreover, the police officers are extremely sweet and willing to lend a helping hand. We also have a police patrol dog named Sophie who can be seen every night. I've never had a concern about safety on campus."
College Junior,5,There never has been an incident on this campus. Everyone knows one another since the campus is so small and the police drive and walk around campus all the time and are willing to help at any time. I lost a pair of keys and they were immediately available and calling all different areas of campus and watching my car in case anyone tried to steal it.
College Freshman,5,Benedictine is very diverse and accepting of everyone.
College Freshman,5,I really like this school. It is diverse everyone is so friendly and nice and the courses are challenging and enjoyable.
College Freshman,5,"I am in the undergraduate physical education program.  This is what my father has and the has been very successful in his career.  The most important aspect of this major, is that I can complete a minor in sports management or sports marketing, which would broaden my fields of career choices.  I have many avenues to investigate.  I could teach/coach.  I could work for an athletic company (NIKE, Adidas, etc.)  in marketing.  I could work in the health fitness club areas."
College Sophomore,5,The admissions advisors were extremely helpful in the application process.  They called me often to check in and make sure I did not need help with anything.  I appreciated it but would understand how others might find it a little abnormal.
College Sophomore,5,I love my program!  I have high hopes for my future and have learned A TON since I started.
College Sophomore,5,"So far, I love it.  I am only a few weeks into my program but the more I learn about it, the more I know it will be a great fit for me."
College Senior,5,"our school is pretty conservative, and strict so I feel very safe on campus. there isn't much of a party scene."
College Senior,5,"it is an easy process, you fill out your fafsa and apply for scholarships."
College Senior,5,"wireless internet is free, and easily accessible. lots of computers can be used here."
Freshman,4,"Pretty smooth and lots of resources. Zoom is the main platform, but everything is working well. Office hours still available!"
Freshman,4,"Good school. Small classes, welcoming environment. Very safe and close knit. Would recommend!  Visit campus if you attend."
Sophomore,4,"I felt like benedictine allowed me to express myself with feeling judged. I'm used to feeling so much pressure on every aspect in my life. But benedictine has brought comfort in my life. It  They offer so many resources to succeed at the school. Hence, when I feel at lost I have someone like the staff and students who are willing to take the time to get through tough situations. One of the advisors that worked at benedictine always had the right information for me to flourish my career in school and out of school. These close connection had left me with a weight lift off my shoulders because I will never feel alone when I have questions about classes, technology, school loans, books, and career option in and out of the school."
Sophomore,4,"During my spring semester at benedictine, half of the semester was moved to online class. This was such a different aspect to work in. I personally don't have a lot of resources at home, and I had plenty of distractions with four other kids living in the household. Making this transition a very difficult. Overtime it became easier to do online. Thankfully to the amazing professors who put in a bunch of work for us students to work around a schedule that fits us best. I felt like being at the university working with the professor. They were very patient and understandable with our limited resource, and worked their hardest to make us succeed in their course."
Junior,4,"During the pandemic it was a smooth transition with e-Learning. We used different apps, the teachers & IT were very helpful and hands on"
Junior,4,"Need more options for class times & more teachers but overall a good school. I think tutoring center needs more tutors. I like the campus atmosphere, I like how hands on teachers are. I like student activities. I like how school gives the students opportunities to see what can be improved in the campus. I enjoy small class setting."
Senior,4,I really like the school environment beaucse it gives you the college feel without making you feel over whelmed. I personally prefer smaller school environments where I’m able to have class sizes that range from 15-30 people and i enjoy being able to have one on one interaction with my professors. Also i enjoy that they have a cafe that provides Starbucks drinks for students as they are able to enjoy a drink! Some improvements the school can change as a whole i better space for studying areas. There isn’t much space for students to find a quite and spacious area where there able to study. It is pretty limited to kindlon center and if they expanded or created more areas for studying it would benefit the students greatly. Also i believe that they should open more food centers within the school so students are able to pick up snacks or a lunch in between classes. Lastly another improvement they can make is parking. I feel that there is a definite need for more parking spaces.
Sophomore,4,Benedictine University does a great job at providing a safe space for its students and the community surrounding it.
Freshman,4,It's been a pretty good experience so far as the faculty are mostly caring and can make a great number of friends.
Freshman,4,What I thoroughly enjoy about Ben U is that because its a smaller school it is easier to obtain help in each of your classes. Also because it is smaller it seems you know everyone. What I would change about this school is the living facilities as well as the food this school is lacking significantly in both of these areas.
Senior,4,"A little pricey, very nice and knowledgeable faculty and staff.  The campus is clean and safe.  Overall a good school with good programs."
Junior,4,"Benedictine has become my second home and my second family. Despite it's quirks, I fell in love with the school before I even started. Students and staff are always here to be there for you and help you out no matter what. It's a very relaxed and calm atmosphere. There's nothing but support here from the staff and your peers. Yes it's expensive, but it's worth every penny."
Senior,4,Wonderful school with a very hands on education. Most of the teachers really care about you and your education and will be there for you as long as you take the initiative to help yourself first. The only reason I give the school 4 stars out of 5 is because of the financial aid office. They are incredibly slow about adding aid to your account and they never answer the phone which can be a little discouraging. Otherwise this school is a GREAT school and I would recommend it.
Sophomore,4,Benedictine has amazing academic program. Since it is a private school the classes are harder than normal college schools but it better prepares you for the future. Their on campus living I don’t suggest though because it’s very expensive and not the cleanliness.
Sophomore,4,Benedictine is a great small private school. Great for students who want to ask questions in class and have one on one time with professors!
Sophomore,4,The school is small but has a large range of resources.  Very friendly staff and qualified professors.  There could be more variety in food options.
Freshman,4,I love the smaller school atmosphere.  The faculty and staff are really invested in the community and really take the opportunity to get to know the students. There is a very strong emphasis on personal growth in all areas- not just education which is what I think really makes Ben U stand out.
Freshman,4,"Benedictine University is a very unique college. From the diversity to the friendliness of others, each day made my experience there better. The staff at BenU are very understanding and helpful to make their students succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I like Benedictine University because of how small the class sizes are. Every professor knows me by name, and it's easy to get a hold of them. The campus is beautiful, and everyone here is so friendly."
Freshman,4,"Very good professors, dorms are fairly rundown/haunted. Food is very hit/miss, but you'll meet some of the most loving, caring, and sweetest people in the world here."
Junior,4,I really like Benedictine but the tuition is a lot. I find that discouraging for students. I'm in my junior year and have been very involved with the school. I have been on the Men's XC and track teams for the past three years. I also have been working at the museum since my Freshman year where I am the Chair on the student advisory board. I have been on the Deans list all four semesters. I apply every year for scholarships under my major and get denied.
Senior,4,"The Hallmarks at Benedictine represents the morals and values that the University reinforces through each course, which are all great in every aspect of a persons life. Socially, psychologically, spiritually, and physically helps with the development of a healthy way of life and well-being for students."
Sophomore,4,"Very small college but a very close community; also, working on improvements to come. Many great programs to study here, but the size of the school has it's limitations."
Sophomore,4,Benedictine University is known for their diversity. All of their students are respectful and treat others with respect no matter of their race. The professors are well educated and very professional. It is great school to develop yourself as a better person because everyone around are great. It will definitely change you as a person and as a student.
College Senior,4,My experience has been good. The instructors are passionate about what they are teaching. The online students have access to various learning tools to gain a better understanding of the  course material. Benedictine University is a great university because of the many opportunities that are made available to help students get the best education.
College Senior,4,The student prospects vary depending on the field that you are in. For example the business has a variety of different areas of study. I am pleased with my field because it offers options that I can utilize when I have completed this course of study.
College Senior,4,When observing the sports and activities the students seem to engage in sports which speaks volume for the school. In my opinion if students can feel comfortable enough to not only take classes but involve themselves in sports to show support of the school is clearly a good indication that the students can build up the morale of the university.
College Senior,4,"My overall experience with the school is good. I currently take online classes so I have not had much face to face contact with a professor my interaction  and communicate is  through student engage. I enrolled in a math class last year that required me to go on campus and that experience was good. The instructor explained the work assignments I detail, and showed examples giving step by step instructions. She was very passionate I carrying out the mission to assure that students understood the work and also that each student would accomplish his or her goal to understand the work and pass the class with a greater understanding of the work concepts. So I would say based on my experience Benedictine University is a good school to attend."
College Sophomore,4,I feel like this school will help you get prepared for life.
College Sophomore,4,Very safe and no violence.
College Sophomore,4,I was on the Benedictine Men's Basketball Team that made the Final Four and reached the National Championship game. It was a great experience.
College Senior,4,"The classes are convenient, but challenging. I wish that some of the online instructors were more available, but I still do well.  I'm am in the nursing program and I enjoy"
College Sophomore,4,I would have to say that our athletics are pretty great.
College Sophomore,4,I would say that my school is definitely one of the best in the region.  My school is all about helping students succeed and they help you in growing professionally and personally.  We are very diverse in terms of academics and student body.
College Freshman,4,I very much enjoy this university its all ways busy with on going activities making being on campus a fun experience. The professors are mostly excellent. This University overall a great experience. I would be fun if they allowed the Greek Life back on campus though.
College Freshman,4,The University provides a number of research projects students may become a part of. Along with internship to apply from on and off campus.
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facility is huge with tons of equipment for both people who are in athletics and for students who just wish to work out. The facility is always extremely clean, as well as no bad odors are present. The athletic teams on our campus are good but not considered the greatest in our state. That still does not stop the student from showing up to support their fellow eagles"
College Freshman,4,"In Benedictine University, they provide tons of activities for students to take part of. These activities make commuters feel more part of the campus life. As well as this university provides endless help and support from faculty and student in the completion of your program. Asking for help is always and option and the professors are more than willing to make the time to help the students."
College Junior,4,"I love Benedictine University. This school, has connected me with people who I am so glad I met, and who have afforded me amazing possibilities to further my education, and learn from the best lesson I have, which is real life experience."
College Junior,4,"I had a great time going to school in the South. Although I loved it down there, I am an athlete and I have chosen to be close to home again by following my coaches to attend a new school. I enjoyed the culture shock and getting to know the traditions of all of my teammates. I got a fabulous education and plan to attend PA school to continue my education."
College Junior,4,"The school has great professors, the classroom sizes are small, and the teaching styles are very interactive. It is easy to get involved in activities as well."
College Junior,4,"As a student taking online classes, I have completely enjoyed my experience."
College Freshman,4,Administration is very kind and helpful. They are strict when they need to be - but usually very nice.
College Freshman,4,Financial Aid from BenU was helpful but actually being able to pay for the school was touch.
College Senior,4,My online experience has been great!
College Senior,4,"Since our school enacted the zero tolerance for alcohol, I believe the community has grown closer and that safety on campus has increased significantly."
College Senior,4,"I had an internship at the Plant in Bridgeport, Chicago. It did not pay, but I had more responsibilities than the volunteers did. I did water testing, germination for seeds, harvesting plants such as lettuce, transplanting, working with volunteers, and feeding the tilapia. I worked at the Plant twice a week."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus police is always monitoring the grounds.
College Sophomore,4,Very thoughtful of its demographics.
College Sophomore,4,"Teacher are all pHD holders, and are excellent at their jobs. They encourage asking for help."
College Sophomore,4,"It is really great because there are a variety of programs and resources to academically excel, such as the student success center."
College Sophomore,4,The school is very accepting and for high achievers they reward you with scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"An internship for a premedical student is usually research related or a job at a medical office. It is not hard to get either, but it requires a proactive personality. The career center at school can help you."
College Sophomore,4,"People are friendly and there are plenty of places to eat. There is a pretty town nearby, Naperville, and the students are genuinely welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,There are students from all walks of life.
College Junior,4,"Within the classes for your major, the faculty are extremely helpful and amazing at what they do. However, when taking general classes toward your degree, there can be some very great teachers that will allow smooth sailing through the class and challenge you as a student, but there are teachers that are not at all helpful and should have never been hired in the first place. Therefore, class styles differ. However, since Benedictine is a smaller school, all class sizes are small so there is an opportunity to be more than just a number in a classroom and gain a close relationship with your teacher, which makes the overall class easy to learn from and more enjoyable."
College Junior,4,"Bendictine Unviersity is right next to the suburb Naperville, which is lively town filled with restaurants and night life options to take part in. There is never nothing to do around the area."
College Senior,4,There are a ton of restaurants in downtown Naperville which is only 15 minutes away.
College Senior,4,I have had a great experience at this school so far and am happy with the decision i made to come here.
College Senior,4,The campus is vary diverse and allows many opportunities for people with different backgrounds to work and interact together. The school encourages integrating with people who have different backgrounds then yourself.
Alum,2,"Mediocrity is the word to describe this school. There are a handful of excellent professors, but that is the extent of the school's excellence. The few professors that I have had are the only redeeming qualities of this school. There is nothing unique about this school, so they compensate with diversity as their only outstanding feature."
Alum,2,"this school was not the best. this school is definitely for you if you don't really care about partying, having a sense of community, or having fun. Also, if you are a commuter this is the perfect place for you because literally nobody lives on campus. I lived out of state so I couldn't go home on weekends, but everyone else did so I was alone most of the time. the administration doesn't care about sexual assault, the police shut down every party because they only happen in one apartment. this school was not good. the only good part was my psychology teacher."
College Senior,2,There are elevators and handicapped buttons on doors.
College Senior,2,There is no social life on campus because everyone basically commutes to my school. Living in a dorm is on exisistent for out of state students.
College Junior,2,"The cost of parking is really not much however, because of the growing population there is very little parking and is always a battle to find one unless you come in early for class before 10am. Most of the time you see people creating their own parking spots and get ticketed 20 dollars as a fine but there is nothing else to do."
College Freshman,2,"The school will not help you find off campus housing.  As young as we are, most of us have never rented, and do not anticipate some of the problems.  Parking is usually first com, first serve.  You have to split an apartment 4 ways to afford it and that is why I think the landlords jack up the prices.  This is difficult  if students do not want to live on campus, but cannot drive home.  The location of most of the  housing is convenient to school, but not to general stores for personal supplies."
College Freshman,2,"A few chain restaurants like Panda Express and Subway, which are not healthy.  If you go to a restaurant, there are many bad ones that are over-priced and the good ones are over-priced.  None offer a student discount, which could help us struggling students.  Hard to get to if you do not have a car.  Cannot walk to anyplace since the campus is very isolated, which accounts for low crime.  The only good restaurant is Pizzeria Bombola."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Chicago and there is not much of a ""local atmosphere"" here.  You need a car to get anywhere and most underclassmen do not have cars."
College Freshman,2,It is a very isolated campus and you definitely need a car.
Recent Alumnus,2,They offer supplements at Krasa that aren't regulated.
Recent Alumnus,2,Small school doesn't require transportation options throughout the school
Recent Alumnus,2,It could be better due to lack visibility seen .
College Freshman,2,"Not very many options. Old buildings, poor lounges with no kitchen areas"
College Senior,2,"the student body keeps growing, so the parking spots become more limited every year. They built a parking garage, but that fills up quickly. it is hard to find a parking spot at school if you come in the middle of the day. it is better to arrive early."
College Junior,2,There really is no bus or shuttle near the school so having a car definitely makes things easier. Restaurants and places to hang out are only ten minutes away by car but parking at school is also quite a hassle considering there never seems to be any empty spots
College Junior,2,My dorm is small and laundry machines suck. They need to update internet the rooms and add appliances to the rooms.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a 24/7 campus police site and they can be very strict when there is rowdy behavior and will issue tickets to students, even if it is their first offense. However, the majority of the tickets issued are not paid at all. Instead there is an option to do community service to pay off a ticket."
College Junior,2,"The nightlife on campus is alright, beside the fact the cops on campus are power happy people and do not allow fun. When the campus police aren't being strict the parties that are on campus are fun just will be a little cramped."
College Senior,2,Downtown Naperville – Downtown Naperville is about the only off-dining there is.
College Senior,2,Not great parking. It's kind of weird where you can park and some of the streets are one way but most everything is close.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek Life
College Senior,1,"There is no greek life at Benedictine. Probably because it is a Catholic university. But, I am not sure why."
College Freshman,1,"Cafeteria food is the same and inedible.  Dining area is not comfortable but nice view.  There is no variety and it all tastes the same...bland.  For what you get, the cost does not merit it.  They do have the on campus cafe Coal Ben, but it takes forever to have it prepared and timing in between classes is important."
College Freshman,1,The school is so isolated there is no nightlife nor anything to do on the weekends.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I wish I had been eligible for work study, which I applied for."
College Junior,1,Do we even have one???
College Senior,1,I haven't noticed any Greek Life on campus or frats.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The offices are very very poorly run. Trying to get an response on something as simple as ""when do Fall classes start?"" is like pulling teeth. The professors for online courses are just as qualified to be teaching as the students themselves. Tuition for the MBA program is much cheaper than most local alternatives, but it comes at the price of your mental sanity. When the business school is poorly run, you have to question how much you are really learning from these people about running a business."
College Senior,1,"parking at the school sucks, if taking classes in the morning, arrive at least 15 minutes early"
College Sophomore,1,There really aren't any transportation options other than calling a cab for yourself if you do not have a car. Many people who stay on campus that do not own a car walk or ask others for rides to places.
College Junior,1,"If you want to get arrest for having 5 people drink at your place, this is the place for you"
College Junior,1,"The night life isn't particularly exciting. At best there are a few film nights, some gaming. There are occasional symposiums held by the school for particular departments which can be interesting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Benedictine is located in a suburb that is very, very far from Chicago city where most of the action is. In order to get to the city, it is really important to have your own car. There is a taxi service, but that can get really costly if used regularly. Long distance transportation is a must if you need an internship. The nearest fast food restaurants are not walking distance away, it is crucial to have a car!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Benedictine University is a private-Catholic university so there is zero tolerance for underage drinking. The on-campus  housing is located very close to the University Police department. 
Parking violations are very easily caught and punished due to the fact that the campus is very small. The new garage has provided many new parking spaces and saves a lot of students from parking fines. 
Everyone on campus really dislikes the librarians because they are very strict with their silence rules. There are specific floors of the library that do not allow talking, so it really becomes frustrating when you have to do work in a group for a school project with a computer. The greatest number of computers are on the floor where talking is not allowed. Constantly being told to be quited really disrupts group work and studying."
College Sophomore,1,There is really not that many if any transportation options around Benedictine. There is a close bus stop near the school however having a car is the best option otherwise your always stuck trying to get rides from friends. Otherwise you can probably also get a taxi.
College Sophomore,1,Hidden in the Shadows – The only way you know someone is greek is if you are a greek otherwise you are like any other student.
College Freshman,1,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible place but the social life is lame.  You're better off just going in dorms and playing video games than getting ticketed for drinking because it is so noticable and the campus police aren't exactly the nicest of people, they take it way to seriously.  The people are really nice probably because it feels like we are all staranded at the dorms and meeting new people gets hard considering you will see the same people everyday, and everyone pretty much knows everyone.  I like that factor but at the same time, it'd be nice to meet new people all the time so I guess it feels more like high school then the college experience."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking can be very limited and tough to find especially during winter and peak hours (at least close to the school). Although they are building a parking garage, it doesn't open till early next year. But overall they have too many commuters and not enough spaces."

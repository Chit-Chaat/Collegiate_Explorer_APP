Alum,5,"I have graduated back in 2013 and already I have seen that there are changes taking place in the art department after I graduate. I majored in Drawing in the Fine Arts department. The professors treat you like a student - never a number and I loved every single one. 

They made it easy to approach them and ask for assistance on the many projects you are working on.  I am still connected to the professors now and I found out that they allow their art students to rent Wacom Intuos Cintiq 16's for their work. It is amazing to see the continuous stride to push their students to success. 

Recently, veterans of the gaming industry are hired to be professors for the Video Game Development majors and have established their first Eleague team a couple of years ago. As a graduate, I highly recommend going! It is a tight and close community that will make you feel like you are even more than a student - you are family!"
Freshman,5,"I have been in online school for several years now, and so I decided to start out with online college just to continue and help myself adjust.  The teachers are great, though the classes I take don't have pre-recorded lessons so it's really a teach-it-to-yourself kind of class.  However, if you need extra help the teachers are always there to assist."
Freshman,5,"I have only been attending Shawnee State for a semester, but I have been visiting it for several years now.  I love the campus, the teachers, and the town that it's located in.  I'm currently an online student, but I hope to move to on-campus classes soon so that I can fully enjoy the college."
Senior,5,Online classes are great. Most of the professors I have had for online classes are organized and make sure to have each week displayed on time. Thankfully they do not post all the assignments at once and make the class more scary. I reccommend taking online classes at Shawnee.
Senior,5,"Shawnee is a very small campus. I like that you are able to communicate with your professors and they get to know you. You are not a last name or number to them. Overall, I am thankful that I was able to take my journey to Shawnee State and futher my education there. I think I would be completely lost without some of my professors that I had the honor of meeting and learning from."
Alum,5,I had an overall excellent experience at Shawnee. I had wonderful professors who were always willing to work with me whenever I needed help and faculty went out of their way to help--even if I wasn't their student at the time.
Freshman,5,"Shawnee State University is a small college.There are around only 3200 students.That is why the classes are not big and feel intimate.I easily engage into a discussion and can always get my questions answered.My professors know me, so the campus feels very friendly. Shawnee State has a lot of great resources to help its students to be successful, for example, Success Center with free tutoring and advising, Math Lab with free Math tutoring, Necessity Pantry with free food, hygiene and school supplies for all students who need it, Clark Memorial Library with free research resources and more! The programming board always holds many different fun on-campus events, such as monthly BINGOs, discounted movie and bowling nights, workshops and more. Also, in Shawnee State there are no dorms, it offers apartment style housing, which was recently renovated. The meal plan is great as well because it is a buffet style and offers a big variety of food accommodating for special diets and allergies."
Niche User,5,"I love Shawnee State University because I have grown up in this area my whole life. The campus feels like home and the professors know exactly what they are talking about/ has a passion for their career. Also, the tuition is very reasonable."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a transfer student here at SSU, and I""ve found that in one semester alone I've gotten way more involved than during the year at my previous school. There are almost always things to do on campus such as various clubs, bingo, bowling, movie nights, and more. Living on campus has proved to be absolutely amazing, with comfortable dorms, accessible services, and getting to become great friends with your roommates.
 Outside of fun and living situations, classes and resources are abundant. There are numerous free tutors, a writing center, as well as a multitude of other ways to get help and succeed."
Freshman,5,I enjoy going to Shawnee State. It has been a good first time experience college. The dorm aka apartments are very nice we have are own freedom there. The campus is beautiful and welcoming. It’s small but big enough like a little village . The bear den is comfy just wished it had later hours. The professors are really nice and helpful. They are all willing to help and are not judgmental of your opinions or worries. My peers in general are very helpful and nice. The RA I have is the best she’s always there to help with any issue and is just a awesome individual in all. All in all my first semester in college has been challenging but enjoyable at the same time.
Freshman,5,"The things I like most about Shawnee State University is the small class sizes and how affordable it is compared to other colleges in Ohio. Plus, the students are all super inclusive and don't discriminate others."
Freshman,5,Love that I can commute from home. I have had great Professors so far.  Its a small campus which fits into my life style.  Its overall a great place to be!
Sophomore,5,"They were extremely helpful getting me admitted into the university, and very understanding about my circumstances"
Freshman,5,Very helpful with a lot of tutoring and the dorm life is like house life. Everything is set up to have you prepare for the real world
Sophomore,5,Very close relationships with professors is common at SSU. That is very nice because you can easily get help if you need it.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE Shawnee State! From the faculty to the academics,  every aspect of this University is fantastic. The community of Portsmouth is also a great small college town in Ohio!"
Freshman,5,"I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to attend SSU! The academics are top-notch, the faculty are super friendly and helpful, and it has one of the best game design programs in the state!"
Freshman,5,"Shawnee makes me feel at home. They are a great little community, and are very friendly. They help you. They guide you into wherever your heart takes you. You can be yourself and still strive for greatness and your future life."
Sophomore,5,It is public university price but private university feel.  The staff provide a personal and professional touch to college education.
Sophomore,5,I love how it is a big family but massie Hall needs repairs. The teachers all seem to care and really work with the students. There is lots of places to go to relax and study or computer labs to use
Freshman,5,"Shawnee is a cozy campus, but a great place to reach your academic goals! Amazing professors that want each and every student to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Shawnee State University's campus is about 5 hours away from where I live now. Recently, we drove down to visit, as I wasn't sure if it was the right fit for me - the area is absolutely beautiful! The campus is right on the edge of a river, and beyond that foothills roll into the distance. I love it, and I'd recommend looking into this college if your major is available. Aside from the aesthetics of it, their staff are extremely helpful and will never leave you without an answer. They will make sure you have all you need and more before sending you off to achieve success in their top-tier programs."
Sophomore,5,"I love Shawnee State University. Located on the border of Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, I have been able to learn in a diverse environment. I feel that SSU accommodates to students who are first generation college students which is great due to the location of the college. Many students who attend Shawnee are first generation college students and SSU creates an environment where those students feel prepared, supported, and motivated. I also enjoy SSU because of the affordability. Being from a middle class family, I had to keep cost in mind when choosing a college and Shawnee has been the perfect fit."
Freshman,5,I began my freshman year at Shawnee State University and the professors worked very well in helping the new students through the transition from high school to college. The professors are friendly and will do their best to work with students one on one to help with any questions or confusions.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at SSU and have thoroughly enjoyed my time here thus far. Shawnee is my home away from home and I have formed life-long friendships with fellow students, through my involvement in on-campus clubs and the Resident Assistant position."
Freshman,5,As soon as I walked on the campus I fell in love. The teachers and students are very nice and i have heard so many good things even before I went to go see the campus . Going to Shawnee is a dream come true for me. I hope to be going there for 4 years to study social sciences and be on a bowling team
Junior,5,"I love the small class sizes and the teachers/professors. Since the classes are so small, there is a more one on one level. I also love the campus size - you can get to your next class in five minutes or less even if it is across campus."
Freshman,5,"What I like the most about Shawnee State University is the academic freedom, as I feel like I have so much control over my schedule and courses prior to the start of each new semester. 

In addition to that, all of the teachers I currently have are really helpful and diverse; just like the student body. 

Diversity plays a significant part of Shawnee State, as most people feel extremely comfortable being open with their sexualities, religious beliefs, etc. People from all over the world are a part of Shawnee State, so students and faculty are able to discover new perspectives and beliefs.

The campus is clean, easy to navigate, and has the latest technologies to improve learning. The fine arts building has a 3D motion capture studio for students majoring in Game and Simulation Arts or Digital Simulation and Gaming, along with other supporting studios!

All in all, great public university, especially for students interested in working in the video game industry!"
Sophomore,5,It's a great college with very welcoming and inviting people who are willing to help you learn the material if you ask.  I'm glad I've chosen this college for my future career.
Junior,5,Shawnee State University is a great college and I like that the professors go above and beyond to teach their students.  My only dislike is my travel in order to attend.
Freshman,5,"I love Shawnee State University. The campus can be considered on the smaller side, but still is very pretty. Very tight knit community. "
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a history major with minors in religious studies and anthropology, and the sheer diversity of classes just in those areas is astounding. The professors I've taken so far are extraordinarily knowledgeable in their fields and more than willing to give help if it is asked for. Class sizes are small, and that helps add to how approachable the professors feel. Class styles vary professor-to-professor, but I've not come across one yet that I haven't enjoyed and learned something valuable from in the process."
College Sophomore,5,"I love campus security to bits. They're an extraordinarily nice group of people always willing to lend a hand if you need it. There are places set up around campus where you can page security at any time if you feel unsafe--even if you're just uneasy walking around at night, they'll come walk you to your dorm or car. I'm friends with two rather large guys (I'm a tiny, 5'3"" girl for comparison--both my friends are at least a head taller than me). There have been several nights where they've walked me home from their dorm after a movie or game night and security officers have stopped just to make sure everything was okay. The worst crime I've heard about on campus was someone stealing out of an unlocked vehicle, too, which helps with the overall feeling of safety."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus itself is rather small compared to most other colleges, so proximity of the dorms to other features isn't really an issue, but they're reasonably spaced out. They're apartment style, and private rooming options are available, though they cost more. It's usually four to an apartment with the exception of some Bridgeview Court (where there's two) and University Townhouse (where there's eight) options and the housing department does a wonderful job in trying to make sure everybody is roomed with someone they're likely to get along with. The full kitchens are a godsend for people like me who tend to have late classes and don't feel like getting food from the school's convenience store, or just for anyone who prefers cooking their own meals."
College Sophomore,5,"I love it. The professors are great and students amazing. Small class sizes make my professors seem even more approachable. I'm involved in Model Arab League, like Model UN, and it's been an amazing experience so far, one I doubt I would have had with another university as MAL isn't as common as MUN. I'm hoping to use Shawnee's partnership with the Kentucky Institute for International Studies in order to study abroad during summer semester next year, as well--it's something I'm greatly looking forward to."
College Freshman,5,They have a 24-hour security and safety team around campus so I feel 100% safe
College Sophomore,5,I'm in the BSN Nursing program and the local hospital hires students before they graduate to offer them experience that they need. There are many different employment recruiting officers on campus every semester. Internship prospects are posted all over campus. I believe the career opportunities available on campus help graduates find jobs after graduating.
College Sophomore,5,They offer many different courses and majors.  The professor's take pride in teaching and show how much they care for their students success. I love this University and take much pride in wearing their name. I advertise the University's name on my clothes and vehicle daily. I would recommend this University to anyone who asks. The BSN nursing program is excellent and I am proud to say that I am a current student in it.
College Sophomore,5,I have been attending this University for 1 and 1/2 years now and there has been zero crime on campus. There is security patrol daily on campus including patrolling vehicles on campus. The campus has their own police and even offer training for protection against violence.
College Sophomore,5,"I attended another college prior to transferring to this one, where instructors didn't teach and I am out quit a bit of money for courses that I wasn't successful in. Shawnee State University has been a god sent. I have been on the dean's list and presidents list since I have been enrolled here at Shawnee State University. The professor's have passion when they teach and show that they care about your success. If I had the chance to go back to 2011 and start over I would choose Shawnée State University first and will choose to return for further educational purposes."
College Sophomore,5,It is an amazing campus.
College Freshman,5,"Easy to take care of, and they are always there and helpful"
College Freshman,5,The administration want the best for all of the students. They are very strict over alcohol and drug use with anybody.
College Freshman,5,"I for one have never been to a party so I wouldn't be able to tell you where a good one is at, but my college has a rule when it comes to parties on campus. It can't be too loud and cannot have anything that shouldn't be one campus, like drugs and alcohol."
College Freshman,5,Financial aid was not hard to receive at all. They work with you so that you may get as much as you can as quick as possible.
College Freshman,5,The dorms are amazing because you get to have one all to yourself and they are pretty good in size. The social atmosphere is almost like something you would feel when you are around home and your family. Cost is not terrible but it is manageable.
College Freshman,5,All the housing is apartment style with a range of 8 to 2 people per apartment unit depending on the type.Go for the Campus View singles if you can afford it! I have my own room and the four of us in the apartment have a good size living space and kitchen. There are two bathrooms so you only have to share two to a bathroom. I'm right across the street(it's closed so there are only cars like once a month if that) from the library and a less than one minute walk from any building.
College Freshman,5,The dining hall is great. Theres a good buffet and theres also a small café for coffee or lunch too. Theres only one dining hall though.
College Freshman,5,"It is a small school so your teachers really know your name in each class. The bookstore is great, it is easy to make friends, and it is easier to focus since its in my home town. The school is unique because of the campus. It is a very nice campus. I wouldn't choose a different school because this one is perfect and close to home. It offers same curriculum as any other university."
College Freshman,5,The Game & Simulation Development Arts major is awesome. The professors are highly educated and are great to work with. Shawnee State is #8 in the country for best game development schools.
College Freshman,5,I have never had a problem on campus. Every nook and cranny is lit up and there are security cars always on patrol.
College Freshman,5,Advisers aren't Nazis but there are expectations to be met. Accountability is the most strict component.
College Freshman,5,"I've heard that Shawnee has some of the best housing, if not THE best housing in Ohio. Whether that is true or not, from what I've experienced from the housing here, I'd vote for that being true. All of the housing options are nice, spacious, and best of all, they are apartments, not dorms. All of Shawnee's dorms are homelike and allow good opportunity of sociable fun."
College Sophomore,5,"To get into the post secondary program, you must take a test requiring you to score a certain rank to be accepted. I agree wit this, because you must be ready to transition out of high school. You cannot jump straight into classes."
Recent Alumnus,5,It is great and it helps you get your degree to better yourself. I do enjoy the special education program because you are with people that will help you every step of the way.
Recent Alumnus,5,Its easy to meet new people and many people are willing to help you if you need it or become your friend.
Recent Alumnus,5,Many students take part in socialized drinking but it isn't to a point that it would hurt people.
Recent Alumnus,5,The security is great. They escort people if they feel unsafe and if your car breaks down they are there to try and help you fix it.
College Sophomore,5,"Academics are a challenge. The classes do not come easy and professors expect us to work for our grades. But, if we show that we are willing to work for it and seek out help when needed Shawnee State has a variety of optios from teachers to provided tutors to help us along."
College Sophomore,5,Shawnee State provides many degree options and help us excel not only while were in school but also help us find jobs once we graduate! Its an excellent school!
Junior,4,This is a very affordable college. my credits transferred wonderfully from another university! my experience so far has been nothing short of positive!
Junior,4,This is a very affordable college. my credits transferred wonderfully from another university! my experience so far has been nothing short of positive!
Freshman,4,"Currently, I am a freshman at Shawnee State University.  In high school however, I took dual enrollment classes that gave me credit hours at Shawnee.  They provided great opportunities to allow students to obtain degrees in fewer years."
Freshman,4,"Shawnee State offers small to mid-size classes which allow students more faculty time if needed.  It is a smaller university with a diverse student population.  They offer several programs including art, medical, and engineering."
Junior,4,"I have had good experiences thus far at school, but some administration could be improved. I have been trying to get a hold of someone to know if a couple of my transfer credits that didn't automatically count towards equivalent courses at Shawnee State can be counted as other credits and have still not gotten a response, after attending this school for almost a full year."
Graduate Student,4,I attended Shawnee a long time ago and it may be very different from now.  The campus is nice.  The town is small but there is enough to do as far as entertainment
Freshman,4,It’s a small university and professors will help whenever because there’s not that many students. It’s a good place to stay focus and still have fun on the weekends.
Freshman,4,"Shawnee State University is the highest rated video game development college in Ohio for a good several reasons.  First, they have an inclusive, hardworking, and friendly staff. They provide scholarships and support to minorities, and LGBT members all year round.  In addition, A financial adviser is assigned to each student, who can be emailed at any time for study planning, or financial counselling.   In terms of education quality, SSU excels.  Only approx. 3000~ students attend SSU each year.  This means a much higher professor to student ratio, and more personal tutoring is much more readily available.  There's a great deal of rooms for dedicated tutoring, and other student assistance - whether you're studying physics, calculus, or writing a paper!  There's several reasons I'm attending this college, but to sum it up - I'll be a freshman at SSU for higher quality education in a comfortable, supportive environment."
Sophomore,4,"I have been to different colleges and this is by far the best. very nice people, have everything in order. There isnt alot of confusion. it is straight foward."
Freshman,4,"I'm soon to be starting my second semester in the Game Engineering major, and so far I've only had one teacher I didn't like. There isn't much to do in Portsmouth, but the grocery stores are close and the school makes up for the lack of fun things in town with a lot of on campus activities and clubs. The food can be hit or miss, but there have been some new interesting things, and generally the food is good, if nothing spectacular."
Sophomore,4,I love Shawnee. Most of the professors seem to be interested in what is working for you to learn. I do not completely feel safe on campus. I would love to see more security in and around the buildings
Junior,4,The atmosphere is a very comfortable setting.  Professors are friendly and care about your education.  The facility is clean and the opportunities are abundant.
Sophomore,4,I have loved attending Shawnee State University. The professors make learning easily assessable and want you to succeed. The whole campus has such a sense of community and school pride. The best part though is how affordable and accommodating they are.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus feel and vibe. This is a  prefect space for people who do not want a large campus that will confuse them. It is very laid back and chill, though they do have lots of events and dances going on during the school year. Most people are extremely friendly. I personally love the library staff, they are extremely helpful and great for new students."
Freshman,4,"I love the size of Shawnee especially the campus and the size of the classes. It allows you to connect to the professors and learn better. Most of the professors are good but the advisors aren’t that good, I don’t feel that they are there to help you. The academics are good but I just wish they would offer criminology and social work as majors and support them especially since they are so needed in an area like scioto county. I think the college should focus on the minors and majors that attract students. The students are friendly and I have never fortunately never had a bad or negative experience with other students."
Freshman,4,"Shawnee State University is a place where people are always available to help you. They have many free resources for students. They have free black and white printing, a math lab where you can get free help from tutors, and a writing center that does the same. Shawnee always tries to make sure their students have these tools at their disposal. They also have a Bear Cave where student can go all hours of the night to get stuff done and work on their assignments. Their food is better on the weekdays than the weekends. On the weekend they have much less meals options and variety. The professors all have office hours in which you can meet them and they can help you one on one if you are struggling in their class. I recommend Shawnee to those students who might need a more personalized approach to their academics because Shawnee has so many extra resources to help accommodate as many students as they can from all walks of life."
Sophomore,4,"This school is best for affordability, great professors, and unique degrees such as game engineering and game design. A perfect choice for those wanting to learn to create games but afraid of crippling debt."
Junior,4,Shawnee is a small college which I find to my liking. Due to the small nature of the school all of the professors have a vested interest in their students. I have no real complaints about the school academically both with the professors and the classes. Nearly all the professes are extremely knowledgeable about the classes they teach. The only complaint I have about the school is the amount of late afternoon classes and night classes in the computer engineering major.
Junior,4,"A cheap gem if you play your cards right- If you desire to get educated, the ability to do so is available to you on campus. While we don't have the resources of a larger university, the small campus makes for a quick commute between classes,  professors are very accessible and open to conversation with students, there are healthy options in the cafeteria, opportunities for study abroad, reasonable athletic facilities, and never a lack of computers for students to use for assignments. While the surrounding area is not a thriving metropolis as some universities might be able to tout, there are nevertheless some unique experiences that reside within walking distance or a short car ride."
Sophomore,4,It's a good sized college that isn't too big or too small. The classes are small and the professors can pay specific attention to each student.
Freshman,4,"It's a great college to stay at with a beautiful view and small classes with most teachers who are reasonable. Some of the higher degreed teachers grade harshly and may cause a harder time on class. The overall time I have been here , most of the people are friendly and great to get along with."
Freshman,4,"Shawnee State University is a very friendly college. The professors their like to take the time to get to know each student individually and learn about what they like to do in their lives. The student count in each class is typically below 20, which allows for the professors to help those who need it. The other students are friendly as well. It's very easy to make new friends and find new study buddies to help you. The only downfall to Shawnee is its location. It is located next to the Ohio river, and blocking the river is a giant flood wall. There are also occasional sounds that sound like gun shots in the distance. Other than those two factors Shawnee is a terrific college. I would recommend this college to anyone."
Freshman,4,Shawnee is a great college with great students and professors. Professors understand our problems and work with us hard.
Senior,4,I like that the classes are small.  I think the professors are very helpful and eager to assist students.
Junior,4,I like the fact that the dorms are set up in apartment style because it lets you have your own space. I have mixed feelings about the professors that I've had so far. Some of them seem actually interested in how the students are doing in their class while others are stuck in their own ways even though half the class is failing.
Sophomore,4,Shawnee State University is a small and intimate campus. You are able to have real relationships with your professors and other faculty here which is really nice. The campus provides different events like Homecoming and even special themed nights for the students which gives it that college feel without being overbearing. Shawnee does have sororities and fraternities but they are not the horror stories you see in the movies. This campus is overall a good campus if you like a small and intimate college campus. There are a couple things that I would change and that would be more of a focus on Shawnee's academic achievers. Students that are in merit based associations do not get the recognition I believe they truly deserve. But my overall experience here has been a great one.
Senior,4,"What I really love about SSU is the emphasis on leadership and diverisity. The administrators, faculty, and staff are all so welcoming and inclusive, and the students are incredibly diverse for such a small, rural-town university. Overall, they aim for quality professors, and the administrators are extremely helpful. It's easy to get to know people, as well, since the student population is only roughly 3,500, and you often will know other students and the faculty and staff by name."
Freshman,4,Shawnee always has plenty of supporters and people there for you when you need help or to hear you out. they have your best interest and want what's best for the students
Sophomore,4,"Shawnee is a very amazing school, the staff and faculty are all amazing a nice. They do a very good job at making you feel comfortable going to school here."
Freshman,4,"You get what you put into it is a key saying when it comes to shawnee state. The professors are willing to help, most of the students are commuter, but there are many ways to get involved with a great diversity of things to do."
College Sophomore,4,"The fact that it's small allows for it to be more tightly knit within its different groups, and allows for an easier way to make connections."
College Junior,4,"Honestly, I really enjoy the class sizes! When I was taking the gen-Ed courses my freshman year the largest class size I sat amongst was roughly 40 people. It was rather big to me coming from a small high school class. But, I quickly realized that was rather big for the typical Shawnee class size as well. The rest of my classes were between 10-20 people, and 20 is pushing it. This may seem boring to some, but if you are seeking one-on-one time with a professor it is a blessing! Plus, you become friends with your peers very quickly. I have only had one professor that I didn't not care throughout the past two years. She was just a rough grader, but the rest were very knowledgeable, helpful, and understanding to our needs. The classes are mostly lecture based, but what I find as something very special is the amount of field work Shawnee requires when it comes to your major. Having time spent in the field (my major being Education) truly helps you decide what you want to do with your life. Overall, I find Shawnee as a very attractive college."
College Junior,4,"Every year Shawnee offers a day for the students to meet and greet with local companies for a mock interview! My friends who have went through this process really appreciated it because it have them a heads up as to what will be asked during the real deal. Also, it allowed these companies to be introduced to possible candidates for a position. This is great because it may get your foot in the door to a future place of work. Also, there is a lady on campus who continually sends emails to students regarding places around Shawnee that have open positions. This really helps students out when it comes to looking for job placement after college. I feel that Shawnee does the best they can to ty and offer its students opportunities to get their name out there. They also try their best to offer students professors that are willing to equipt students with the most valuable knowledge."
College Junior,4,"I have had multiple late night sessions in the library, some of which I have been alone walking to and from the building. I always notice the campus security waiting outside, even when I gets really late! They are always around to make me feel secure. Also, within every single stall in in Massie there are signs that point you to an emergency contact number if you ever feel uneasy."
College Junior,4,"At first, I did not want to go to Shawnee because I live near the school. I was looking for a fresh start that I thought would only be granted through a college far away. Come to find out, I met tons of new friends and acquired the new start I was looking for. Shawnee isn't as small as you think! Yes, the class size is. But, that is what makes the learning experience worth while. Small class sizes equal quality time with professors. As I look back at my final decision being Shawnee I would not change a thing. I'm proud to be attending such a lovely campus."
College Sophomore,4,"A degree from Shawnee isn't looked at any differently than a degree from anywhere else, though I imagine in some places it could be for the simple fact that it's a small school and perhaps easily overlooked. They do have a number of internships available to students, however I have to admit to not having a lot of knowledge on this aspect due to not having much experience with it."
College Freshman,4,"Other than lack of information or communication from some staff or faculty, the professors and classes are fantastic if you take full advantage of them and research them beforehand."
College Freshman,4,There are many people of different backgrounds and there is no discrimination that I have seen. The school is primarily in the Bible Belt.
College Freshman,4,I feel really safe on campus but if you walk off campus at night make sure you are walking with someone.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are great I really don't have anything to complain about them, it depends on where you live. Campus View private dorms are nice. You get your bed room to yourself, but you share the bath with one other person and you share the living space with everyone. It was enjoyable."
College Freshman,4,The school is great. What makes the school unique is that the people who work there are friendly and willing to help you with everything. I would definitely choose this school again because it is a perfect fit for me.
College Sophomore,4,The professors on campus are always very helpful during office hours and during class. They are professionals in their field of study and are very knowledgeable about different topics. They love to share their knowledge and are always excited about new students and are always excited about helping students in the classroom and in their future. All of the courses are relatively small with a great professor:student ratio and it helps give the students more time and help from the professors. All of the available courses are relatively easy to get into also.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing on campus is great! I have lived in the dorms known as campus view for 2 years and they are the newest dorms on campus. They are directly across the street from the campus and the road in front of them is blocked off so no traffic can go down the street. The dorms are an apartment style so there are 4 people to an apartment with either 2 rooms (a double) or 4 rooms (singles rooms for each person), 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen and a living room area. I have lived in both types of these apartments and they have been awesome!!"
College Sophomore,4,I have not been to many varsity sporting events at Shawnee State but the few that I have been too have been great! The student body is always there to support the teams and they are always full of school spirit and cheering the teams on no matter what the outcome is.
College Sophomore,4,"I have been at Shawnee State University for 2 years and I have had an awesome experience! The student body is very helpful, friendly, and positive about the school and they are always excited and full of spirit at the sporting events. The professors are amazing and very helpful in the classroom. They are professionals in the fields that they teach and are very approachable with any questions about the class or life in general. The school is amazing, relatively good price, great environment, amazing scenery, and amazing people!!"
College Freshman,4,"Portsmouth is more dangerous than campus, although walking alone at night is still not advised. Campus is generally safe, however."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are experts and enthusiastic about their subject, being very helpful with your work if you have questions. Some are less helpful, however."
College Freshman,4,The housing is great if you are in a good building with many programs going on. Sometimes it is hard to enforce rules on unruly or loud neighbors.
College Freshman,4,"This school is small and accessible-- if you need something, you can immediately seek it out. However, this college is quite young and often you find yourself unable to find something because the people you ask are not sure or you cannot find the information."
College Freshman,4,They are nice and outgoing teachers
College Freshman,4,They have so many fields we can go into
College Freshman,4,I heard we have a really good track team for my school
College Freshman,4,The diversity at my school is good. Most everyone gets along with another.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus has been great for me so far. Mostly everyone fellows the rules. When they don't then they are enforce.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't live on campus, but several of my classmates do and they don't have any complaints. The housing is appropriate in the cost, clean, and convenient. Plenty of room in each unit with appropriate rules to follow."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't particularly get involved, but several of my classmates are and I hear a lot about it. They are exceptional athletes and are very happy with the University and it's sports programs."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe walking around at night, if that counts"
College Junior,4,its great if you have good roommates
College Freshman,4,Professors are almost all very well educated and knowledgeable.
College Freshman,4,"All of my professors were very helpful and understanding. They care about your education, not just test scores."
Junior,2,"Shawnee State is pretty cheap compared to most other colleges but that is where the quality starts to go down. The art department lost it's ceramic and photography majors within one year because the school didn't want to bother hiring new professors to take on the classes. The student teaching program does not have as much hands on teaching as it should, not being able to do anything in a classroom until junior and senior year. The information on websites is outdated and sometimes a required class is even changed into something else and you wouldn't even know until you email your advisor about what happened to the class."
Junior,2,All they want is your money. They put little to no investment in your education. your advisers barley contact you if at all. people often do not graduate on time due to poor advising and the way they have their programs set up
College Freshman,2,I really don't see underage drinking
College Freshman,2,The parties aren't that good
College Freshman,2,I haven't heard of too many parties on campus or around town
College Junior,2,"The food doesnt taste bad, but being on a restricted diet, they didnt do much to help me get food sutable for me, So i still have a meal plan and the food makes me sick."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally don't take part in many parties, I've been to roughly 5 in two years and i rarely even hear of others"
College Senior,2,Most houses surrounding the campus look like places drug producers would live.
College Senior,2,"Not very many parties, especially ones that are announced."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing Portsmouth. There is a lot of poverty and the only way the town  is hanging in is through a few industrial factories in the city and nearby. No shopping besides Walmart no fun activists to do except there is shawnee state Forrest which is beautiful and huge with a lake hiking trails campo grounds hills for miles and a great lodge. This so one the best aspects and most redeeming places of Portsmouth, Ohio"
College Senior,2,Portsmouth is dangerous away from campus.  You have to drive to get to any malls or Hobby lobby's or anywhere but kroger or walmart.
College Senior,2,"Basketball, soccer, and tennis are the only actual sports."
College Senior,2,"The food kinda sucks.  There is a nice thing for to go lunches by the cafeteria and the nursing building so you can grab food and go to class, the cafeteria itself is pretty nice.   It's cheaper and tastier to buy food from kroger."
College Senior,2,"A few off campus housed groups will have parties, but on campus parties aren't very common.  At least not traditional ones.  Lots of the groups host events for people, so there are events for people to go to, but not necessarily typical parties."
College Freshman,2,My program is veterinary science and it is not available at Shawnee.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life at this school is poor because it is not very big and it could be bigger and funner if their were more activities and things to do.
College Freshman,2,I rarely see parties except for an occasional off-campus party or the ones they hold at the Tau Kappa Epsilon frat house. Nothing gets too out of hand and security keeps a close eye on them.
College Freshman,2,I have heard that it is bad although I have not participated. I am pretty sure there is not much variety.
College Senior,2,Nothing really here except bar scene
College Senior,2,Same old stuff around here
College Senior,2,"There really isn't any transportation to and from home, other than ride sharing or driving your own personal vehicle. Shawnee State University could definitely benefit from adding some transportation options for students."
College Senior,2,"With an ever increasing amount of students and no additional parking created, its extremely difficult to find a parking spot, especially for those of us who are primarily art students. The one tiny lot directly across the street from the Verne Riffe Center for the Arts has limited spaces, and students are constantly battling for a space. Too often, we are forced to park further from the arts building, which makes it hard to transport all of our art supplies and our artworks. Occasionally, we have to risk parking in an unauthorized space and risk being ticketed or towed."
College Senior,2,Parking is free for students but in very short supply. The amount of enrolled students keeps getting larger however Shawnee State University has not added a real parking lot to accommodate the increase. I'm sure that students would not be opposed to taking on 20$ on their tuition if it mean more parking options.
College Senior,2,"There are mostly dive bars in the area, but there is one very run down club, another decent club, and an Irish pub."
College Senior,2,"There is very little to do in Portsmouth, Ohio. There is enough to keep you mildly entertained, however nothing too exciting."
College Freshman,2,"Depends on where you are in the city. Some places just don't sit right and are really sketchy. Other places aren't as bad, so you can luck out. Some of the people aren't the nicest, it can be just a hit or miss."
College Freshman,2,"There is not a whole lot to do outside of school, unless you are willing to travel a long distance. "
College Junior,2,"The process of getting into the Occupational Therapy program is very hard. You must be willing to put on your time and effort into studying and you need to make straight A's in order to get in. You come against many challenges especially if you are a psychology major who is not so well at biology since biology classes are requirred. In order to get into the program you must enter the psychology or Biology program, which are both pretty easy to get into after the four years in one of these programs you will apply for the Occupational Therapy program, which is very hard to get into. If you are entering this program make sure you feel that it is worth it and that you will do well in every course."
College Freshman,2,There is one bar right next to a group of dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"Shawnee State is not very big on sports at all, the only sports that I know of at this school are baseball, basketball, soccer and volleyball. However, it is a pretty small school, so I wouldn't really expect a whole lot of sports. Even though there aren't many sports, it seems that the student body is very active in the ones that we do have, i'm constantly seeing athletes walk around campus/in classes/ at lunch, so I would say that students are pretty active in sports, though I'm not sure how many people attend the games (i'm not the type)."
College Junior,2,The dining hall can get old really quick however there are meals to go when you are hungry and running late for class. The dining hall closes at 7pm which can be a bummer if you have a late night class/job. There are some places off campus that are not bad but a lot of them are not walking distance.
College Junior,2,Portsmouth is a small time you sometimes have to make your own fun. Try and get to know a good number of people at the beginning of the school year.
College Junior,2,Since I'm an out of state student I do not receive a lot of aid. It is also hard to find any scholarships for out of state students. Most of the tuition was out of my mother's pocket and that is hard to bare. I wish that Shawnee state university had more scholarship opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I feel like security is lacking.  They have just ""upgraded"" the security situation by adding a few actual police officers to the payroll, but at times, when I have tried ringing the blue light around campus for assistance, no one has come to help."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are not that large at Shawnee. While they do have soccer and basketball teams, they are not all that large, with more focus being given to academic programs and student-run clubs and organizations."
College Junior,2,I got very little financial aid but the scholarships I recieved seemed to go through okay
College Junior,2,"There are two, maybe three Greek houses at Shawnee. The few there are, do not do much, and it doesn't seem to make a difference as to whether you are in a Sorority or fraternity. So while there are a couple options, it doesn't make a difference even in party life. There may be a Greek house, but most people live in the regular dorms, and go visit the house, or wherever the meetings and whatnot are held."
College Junior,2,"If there is University provided transport, it is not advertised, nor is it found on the website. However there are pick up stops for the Portsmouth buses, and the taxi company is fair priced, so getting around town is not really a problem, especially since most places are close enough to walk to."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the people i have seen while in college are into some kind of drugs.
College Freshman,2,"The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it"
Freshman,1,"The academics and teachers vary, depending on your major. You could have the best quality you could ask for with the nicest teachers, or you can have a broom closet with a teacher that caused a lawsuit. (True story)

All the student events are overhyped. 

Don't expect too much financial help. All the costs have been cut from this school. 

The food is 50/50. Can you stomach it today? Let's see with the first bite you take. 

The dorm wifi is god awful. You have to wait 3 hours for 10 minutes of wifi.

Job chances are poor. 

Athletics is a bad idea if you're in an academic major. 

The mental health here is awful. I was almost hospitalized instead of listened to. 

Almost all the students here are depressed and upset at this school.

In the words of an actual professor here: ""It's good on you that you're transferring. This place is becoming a dumpster fire."""
Freshman,1,"Hard to meet people who have similar interests as I do. Many of the people I would enjoy spending time with are commuters and aren't on campus outside of classes. The scenery is gorgeous, but Portsmouth is boring and SSU definitely doesn't have a party scene."
College Freshman,1,This isn't an going party school
College Junior,1,Its horrible by the dorms and the health buildings.
College Senior,1,Highest rated drug use out of all Ohio counties. Very low in amenities. Just simply not a very thrilling place.
College Freshman,1,There really is nothing to do and you need a car to get anywhere but the local krogger and off campus usually isn't that safe either so if you don't have a car make friends with people that do
Recent Alumnus,1,Financial aid is  a joke. They messed up my financial aid and now I cant go back to school without scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,1,The landlords are awful and the houses have many things wrong with them.
Recent Alumnus,1,The computers at my school is slow and unreliable. They crash all the time when you're in the middle of a test or working on an assignment and then you have to start all over or cannot finish an online timed test.
College Sophomore,1,I commute so it takes a huge toll
College Junior,1,"It is very hard to find financial needs at Shawnee State University, but if you qualify they will help you. There are certain loans you can fill out and a few scholarships provided."
College Junior,1,Portsmouth Ohio is not a place I would plan on living for the rest of my life since there are few jobs here and it is a clustered town. There also is not much to do here unless your in the mood for one nice place to dine and a few shopping places.
College Sophomore,1,"The atmosphere is overflowing in fun, but the real problem is lack of structure for new freshman to avoid all the pitfalls. The RA's allow anyone in the dorms, co-ed problems, and the religious proliferation and recruiting on and off campus is unreal.  It's very easy for anyone to get caught up in a cult here. The entire town is ensnared in a huge religious following. Before you know it, students cut off their families, change majors/plans and drop out."
College Sophomore,1,Were not big on Greek. I'm sure it has some cultural events but were not big on the whole Greek thing mostly everyones together.
College Sophomore,1,There's not much public transportation in the Shawnee State area!
College Sophomore,1,Majority White – Most of the students who go to Shawnee State are Caucasian!
Recent Alumnus,1,"You need your own car to get anywhere, especially anywhere away from Portsmouth. There is one grocery store within walking distance of campus, but unless you like carrying all your purchases back home by hand, you need a car. Walmart is about 3 miles away, again you need a car. There is a taxi company in town, but it's expensive, slow, and unreliable. There is NO bus station in town. The closest airport is about 2 1/2 hours away."
College Freshman,1,Stay FAR Away. Shawnee State is an absolute joke. They have no standards. You apply - You're in. It definitely shows.
College Freshman,1,"Almost Nowhere to Park – You need to arrive an hour early to find a spot, unless you plan on walking several blocks. The school boasts about increased attendance numbers. Yet they never add more parking lots for students."
College Freshman,1,"Not Much Choice – Shawnee State only has one dining hall - The Bears Den. Food is lackluster, at best and doesn't offer much in the way of variety."

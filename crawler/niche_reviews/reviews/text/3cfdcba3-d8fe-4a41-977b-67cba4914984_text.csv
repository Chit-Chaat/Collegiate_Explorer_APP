Freshman,5,"So far, I have enjoyed my time here at UK. My classmates and professors are nice and understanding. They offer a lot of opportunities for students to be involved and active. Through sports, clubs, fraternities, and much more. Even though the pandemic, the university focuses on keeping the students, faculty, and staff safe and healthy. They offer free covid testing for students. Also, they provide many ways for students to get help in course work and professional development."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at this college have been great. I have met a lot of interesting people and learned several new things that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. While living on campus, a student will never have an excuse for not having somewhere to go to study, meet people and get opportunities for a job or something important to them. Because of this pandemic we are all going through right now, things are obviously getting a little harder for students and faculty. I can say with confidence that every single one of my professors try their absolute hardest to make sure their students are understanding the course material presented to them, that is one of the things I love about this college. The diversity is amazing, you can meet people from all over the world just by walking around on campus. I can not think of anything that I would like to see change here, it is a great place to be."
Sophomore,5,"Like I said before, the professors will do everything they can to make sure the students thrive in their class. Every session, my professors remind the class that they have open office hours welcoming anyone who is confused with course material or if a student just needs a little extra help. Although we can not attend in-person classes at this time, UK tries their best to make online classes easy to access and enjoyable as possible."
Freshman,5,The professors have adapted well and the university has provided faculty and students with multiple resources in this uncertain time.
Freshman,5,The campus is big enough but not too big and is conveniently located around downtown lexington. The students work hard and are welcoming as well as the professors.
Niche User,5,I liked the campus and people. They were very pleasant and nice people. All of which were highly helpful in my academic process.
Alum,5,"I lived on campus the first two years, off campus but very close by the next two and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. I liked that there were such affordable housing so close to campus and that I could walk everywhere so I did not have to purchase a car. The restaurants around campus were diverse and first rate and student life was fun and exciting."
Alum,5,"Many of my classes used Blackboard to organize content and facilitate communication, which was helpful."
Niche User,5,"I haven’t taken any classes personally, but herd great things about it from my Peers and cousins, who have taken the classes."
Niche User,5,I’m a senior in highschool but I have herd great things about the college from my cousins and peers.
Senior,5,It was fantastic lots of people were available for questions during the transition and they were able to accommodate to our needs.
Senior,5,"Best college experience and education you can get! Campus is all redone, dorms are brand new and it feels like home."
Sophomore,5,Classes online were mandatory after the Covid-19 lock downs were implemented. The school was communicated thoroughly and all my classes were converted to online.
Sophomore,5,The campus is very modern and clean. The people are welcoming and friendly. The staff has great communication with the students.
Sophomore,5,I love the university of kentucky so much! The environment and pride that the students have while attending UK is phenominal. The class room sizes can get big but the professors always manage to be attentive. The only thing I would change would be parking :)
Sophomore,5,I was forced to take online classes due to COVID-19 yes it sucked...but i dont think the university could have done any better they were very quick to respond and help with what i needed.
Freshman,5,I am a college freshman and although I have not attended any classes yet UK has been extremely helpful with the college transition and the advisors are always right there when I need them.
Freshman,5,I haven't taken any online courses there yet but my online orientation went extremely well. They were organized and made things as clear as possible.
Freshman,5,"Everything is new and updated which makes you feel safe and homey. Professors are hit or miss, I've had really great ones but also sucky ones. I knew UK was the right place for me because it just felt like home when I took my first visit."
Freshman,5,"Online schooling was in the middle, for my theater class we had weekly zoom meetings as lectures but for my Biology class we just watched pre-recorded videos. Professors were really understanding with the whole situation of the pandemic. For example the wifi at my house went out one day so I had to email my professor saying I couldn't complete the homework for that day and she was really understanding and made adjustments for me."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Kentucky sustains a strong and inclusive learning environment. With courses created with students in mind, opportunities are available to help students succeed in their academics and future careers. UK is home to world-renown fine arts programs and sports programs alike. A degree from the University of Kentucky is held in high regards by both graduate school and employers, and UK offers many programs at home and abroad to allow students a greater chance at being accepted into their future career or school opportunities."
Sophomore,5,The University of Kentucky is a great school because of the opportunities they give each and every student. They have countless resources to make that you are on the right track towards success and they genuinely want to see you succeed. They don't only want to see you succeed academically but also in your social life. The school gives different ways to grow in the area of social skills.
Alum,5,I loved my experience at the University of Kentucky. If they offered a fully online Master of Social Work degree then I would absolutely return to the University!
Alum,5,"I did not have a ton of experience in taking online classes, but those that were went very smoothly."
Graduate Student,5,"Have enjoyed my time at the University of Kentucky! My professors have been knowledgeable of the subjects presented in courses and available to aid students. The university offers many different activities for students to become involved in, so anyone can find their place at Big Blue!"
Junior,5,"I transferred to the University of Kentucky as a sophomore out-of-state student beginning in the Fall 2019 semester. I have had the best experience at this school so far. The classes and professors are knowledgeable and accommodating. The large campus has a ton of school spirit while still feeling like a small community, especially when cheering on the Wildcats! There are countless opportunities to get involved, whether that be in greek life, student government, volunteering, intramural sports, or any of the other hundreds of clubs and organizations on campus. Lexington is the perfect college town since it has both the opportunities of a big city while still being small enough to have a small town charm. I truly believe that there is a place for everyone at the University of Kentucky. (P.S. The residence halls on campus are EXTREMELY nice!)"
Sophomore,5,The university of Kentucky is a very safe and modern college. I’ve had many opportunities at this college. It also provides many campus jobs for students which is amazing
Sophomore,5,The university of Kentucky offers many great things and has amazing dorms. The student life is very active and there’s something to do everyday. Most classes are in nice buildings And there’s a lot of opportunity to do great things.
Sophomore,5,"I really like the University of Kentucky. The school is a good size and in a good city. The dorms are amazing and very nice, so are the dining halls, and food places. The people are all so respectful and its easy to make friends. It feels like you're in a great community. The sports are also great and fun to be at. Soccer, basketball, football, and volleyball are all my favorites. The academics are also great of course. Professors are pretty good overall and all care a lot."
Junior,5,"UK is truly the best place on earth. I have experienced so much more than I ever thought I would have, and I still have two years to go. My school has every resource you could ever think of, so take advantage of them. My experience at UK has been nothing short of incredible. One thing people always hear in high school is that ""college professors don't care"" or ""they won't help you"". This is so wrong. All of my professors have guided me clearly on a successful academic path. The staff of UK is an amazing group of people who love being there just as much as I do. This has been the experience of a lifetime, and I am so glad I get more time there."
Freshman,5,UK has so much to offer to every type of student that attends and they are continually building brand-new buildings so the campus is absolutely gorgeous!
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus. Destined to find good friends. Overall focus on academics is important. People are kind. Dorms are amazing, big, new, and clean."
Freshman,5,"I love the people and the staff. they are all dedicated to their work, to the school, to the students, to the community; I could go on and on but that would take all day. the school shares such a community that you don't get anywhere else. the amount of blue I see on the daily walking around campus brings a giant smile to my face because unifying with that color and white that pride of the school and the grounds we walk on say so much about our attitude toward our school."
Niche User,5,"The University of Kentucky has all and everything anyone  could ever want. Every building is beautiful and brand new due to their ten year (in the making) renovation. Living in the dorms there is like living in luxury with your own space and being able to choose where you live. They also have a Pre dental school, which I will hopefully one day attend."
Niche User,5,"A beautiful campus and amazing people, they are the definition of southern hospitality! Once you step n campus you already feel like a Wildcat! The small class sizes really show how much educators want to connect with their students!"
Niche User,5,I have visited multiple times and i love the campus and everything about the college. Great environment to spend your four years.
Niche User,5,I love how inclusive UK is! There really is something for everyone. I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"It is a very beautiful campus. The faculty are devoted to seeing students succeed, which is what it should be all about. Professors are very understanding and help all students that ask questions."
Niche User,5,"During my visit in January, I was impressed by all the options UK had to offer. From academics to activities, even to food options. I felt like it was a place where I would feel at home and, the proximity to Lexington, KY was a bonus. If you're not buried in your books, there always seemed like there was something to do-all withing walking distance."
Niche User,5,Love the atmosphere - the people the closeness of a big school with a small feel.  The dorms are very spacious and updated and everyone makes you feel welcome.
Freshman,5,"Transitioning into college can be very tough, believe me I know. Here at the University of Kentucky that transition could not be easier. They really make you feel at home. I love the energy of this campus and I could not imagine myself being anywhere else."
Alum,5,"The University of Kentucky is a great place to earn your degree. The campus is beautiful and is constantly improving. The campus has many great restaurants for students as well as a beautiful library. I also appreciated the local area. It had a lot to offer such as great restaurants, frequent concerts, public art, etc."
Niche User,5,Any time I step foot on the University of Kentucky's campus I fall more in love then the last time.  When you step foot onto the University of Kentucky's campus you will feel like you are at home.  Every student and teacher at this university is very nice and cares about each other.  Every person on this campus is at this school to help each other which is what sets the University of Kentucky apart from other university not only the state but the country .  It is like a home any from home and you can always count on someone at this school to help you.  Which is truly amazing.
Freshman,5,I enjoy Kentucky atmosphere and how friendly everyone is. the parking and dorms are not ideal and very expensive.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Kentucky and everything they have to offer. Their classes are taught by wonderful professors who are very willing to help students. Campus is extremely safe and inviting.
Sophomore,5,The Kentucky experience is great. I feel like it's home away from home. The campus is beautiful and well maintained. The housing is contemporary and modern.
Sophomore,5,"Many people think a ""high acceptance rate"" has something to do with the quality of the school, but it really doesn't! The University of Kentucky is the best college in KY, hands down. It's a big state school that has students coming from all across the USA and the WORLD, so of course they'll take people! They need that diversity and give everyone a chance. What you don't see next to the acceptance rate is how selective they are with financial aid, scholarships or the honors college and etc.  Like any other school you're going to have the people that want to succeed and those that care, but from what I have seen the mass majority of students DO care and will end up being one of the best, if not THE best wherever they end up.  It's what you make of it, simple as that."
Sophomore,5,"I really love campus life, campus itself is so beautiful! The people are so wonderful, I’ve met the best people. I’m a stem major so class are obviously difficult but professors are always willing to help and there are so many resources on campus to help tutor and teach people something they might not understand! There are a bunch of things to do on campus, one of my favorites is comedy caravan Wednesday nights where they have a full on comedy show and although there have been a few bad comedians most of them are sooo funny!"
Senior,5,"I have loved my time at the University of Kentucky. As my time at UK comes to an end in December, I reflect on the amazing experiences this university as given me. I have had the opportunity to have a fun college experience while also pursuing my life and career goals. Lexington was able to give me the feel  of city and rural life all in one. The people here are welcoming, kind, supportive, and some of the most selfless people I have had the pleasure of meeting. The university is challenging in the best ways possible and provides a comfortable learning environment for all its students. Although some professors have their flaws, I have found many that would go out of their way to see their students succeed. Overall, this university has been my home and I am sad to have to leave, but I am confident that it has given me the skills and tools that I need to be successful in not only my future education and career goals but also in my personal life as well."
Freshman,5,"Have had such a great time here. Connected with people from all over the world. Although people look down on the academics here, I feel as though I am just as prepared as any other student. As an out-of-state student, I was a bit worried that I wasn't going to be comfortable here. However, I was completely wrong and am beyond excited to head back."
Junior,5,"Even though UK is a huge campus with over 20,000 students, it still feels small in ways. The Living Learning Programs for incoming freshmen creates a wonderful smaller network of students with similar interests. These LLPs also host a few social events to create opportunities to meet other students. The student activities board hosts all kinds of fun events across campus. 
The campus is very well maintained, beautiful landscapes, very clean facilities, lots of dining options."
Senior,5,"Couldn't have chose a better college for myself. This is an innovative and upcoming university. They are always trying to better their entire campus and academics. Most of the professors I've had have been incredible and compared to other universities the pricing isn't horrible. They have a wide range of dorms, facilities, and sports."
Freshman,5,"Very diverse campus. Lots of options for activities, food, and majors. Dorms are very nice and clean and there are always things to do on campus"
Junior,5,"University of Kentucky is a diverse campus with lots of activities for students. The campus is beautiful, especially in the fall when the leaves turn. There are tons of resources for students, and plenty of quiet places to study."
Sophomore,5,I love it here! Everyone is super nice and accepting! There really isn’t too many negative things about the university the faculty is super understanding and helpful. Professors are willing to work with you on things when asked.
Sophomore,5,"I am a big fan of the mutual and open communication that the university has. If there are problems to be found, the university is willing to listen to students and negotiate or discuss the best way to fix the issue. This makes it easier for minority students to feel more welcome in the environment."
Niche User,5,The people there were very friendly when I visited their pharmacy building. I couldn't seem to find the correct building and it was very cold outside so they had a security person unlock the doors so we could walk inside instead of going outside and around.
Freshman,5,"I love it here! Everyone is so nice and helpful! They offer many studying and tutoring to the students here to help them get the grades they want. The food is also very good here, I love the nachos!"
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Kentucky has many opportunities to offer students including many types of degrees, research opportunities, as well as employment. There are many resources available to help individuals have a successful experience within and outside of the institution."
Niche User,5,The University of Kentucky has a beautiful campus and a wide selection of majors and programs to choose from!
Sophomore,4,"I love this campus. The people, resources, and general setting all promote a good community. RA's reach out to you, professors are mostly kind, and the sheer number of places you can go for any form of help whether it is academic, emotional, or financial is overwhelming. This college does it's best to make sure that, despite it being a large campus in a large city, every student is a valued individual. During Covid-19 the campus has felt quite lonely, but the college is still doing it's best to create a safe socially distanced community among peers."
Junior,4,"When touring the campus we were well informed of the different areas on campus for each specific major.  Loved our specific tour of the Agriculture College, we got to speak to counselor that outlined my next 4 years and what classes I would take. 
Overall a beautiful campus!"
Junior,4,Kentucky has a very nice campus and campus life. There are many ways to get involved in the many different student organizations. Mostly everything around is campus is fairly new or being renovated or had been recently renovated.
Niche User,4,They respond right away and make sure they answer questions thoroughly. They were engaged and involved especially with prospective students.
Sophomore,4,"The experience online was great. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all classes moved unexpectedly online though professors were very understanding and helpfull and willing to help with any questions on classwork."
Sophomore,4,"In my experience, the University of Kentucky is a great institution. Many of the professors are very caring and are willing to help if needed. They have many great programs like nursing, engineering, Animal Science, etc.  Academic Advisors are happy to help with anything involving your classes and are very caring and easy to talk to. There are many on-campus events such as movie nights, game nights, karaoke nights, etc. The campus is always well maintained and very clean. Overall, I have thus far had a great experience at this institution."
Junior,4,I have met many people through events and the resources throughout campus. Our classes provide a great opportunity to meet people along with clubs and sports. The University of Kentucky has been a blessing to me since the beginning and I’m looking forward to my next two years.
Junior,4,"While the majority of my time at UK has been great, the constant construction is what keeps me from giving it 5 stars. Specifically the construction on Ag North, one of the main building for the college of Ag students. There were many days that the construction was outside the classroom, and made it hard to concentrate during class. Outside of this, the who experience has been great."
Junior,4,My online experience during the last few months of the spring semester wasn't bad at all. My professors were actually able to adapt better to the new learning environment and I was able to as well.
Junior,4,"First and foremost, I love the variety of food options that are available on campus and outside of it. You'll never run out of different foods to eat. I also enjoy how modern the campus is. The dorms are very nice and there are renovations going around campus to make it more 21st century like. The only big thing I would change would be how the campus busses operate. At times, I find myself waiting too long for a bus and I'll have to end of walking 22 minutes to class"
Junior,4,"I have taken online classes at the university and they all ran very smoothly, the teachers graded fairly and in a timely fashion."
Junior,4,"The University of Kentucky has been a pretty good experience overall, if there were things I would change about the institution it would be for it to be more inclusive of their minorities and to make programs/clubs more accessible to its students"
Junior,4,"Chemistry department is awful, but I have had mostly decent professors in other areas. Wish the professors would learn how to teach to students instead of trying to trick kids on exams or having them teach themselves."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning for this school is easy, classes seem to mostly use the Canvas app and Zoom so that is helpful. It is hard to do online courses but it has not been challenging for me."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a relatively positive experience, the campus is very large and most of the buildings are very new and well kept. The courses and professors are generally good- and the best part about University of Kentucky is that they have a lower cost of tuition compared to other state schools."
Graduate Student,4,"Have taken minimal online classes with the university, but the courses presented virtually have been thorough in teaching the topics presented. Many online classes have in class reinforcement of subjects so learning and understanding is ensured."
Junior,4,"While switching to an online learning environment was difficult, my professors made a sincere effort to continue to be available when I had any questions I needed answered."
Sophomore,4,"Our professors recorded lectures and posted them onto Canvas, some exams were on lockdown browser, others weren’t. Not really difficult to get through."
Sophomore,4,"The things I like about UK is that there’s always someone available to help you when you need them and how fun the sports are to watch, however there is a lot of construction, Greek life is emphasized there a lot, and there is very little diversity."
Alum,4,"My academic program was small and professors were engaged in students's academic journeys. I was very involved with extracurricular organizations, which also enhanced my learning experience. Fantastic study abroad options with tons of scholarship support."
Sophomore,4,"Very big sports school, great academics, and phenomenal residence halls.  Very open environment and supportive staff."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Kentucky is amazing! UK has so many opportunities for academics, extra curricular activities, and local area to make friends! The campus and housing are so beautiful. I strongly recommend UK!"
Freshman,4,I really like being at UK. They offer pretty much anything a student could need and they are updated. Dorms are close to basically all classes and UK really cares about its students. They want everyone to be as involved as possible.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at the University of Kentucky. It provides a good degree and a strong network without charging a financially crippling amount. It does what a good state school should. My advice for anyone interested in the University is to be proactive. Go out and throw yourself into as many campus activities and groups as possible. This was hard for me, and it took me a while to find my place, but by the end of my freshman year I was hosting the campus comedy show, and my time at the university became infinitely more enjoyable. The university can either be something you interact with only when you have to, or a great network of opportunities and interesting people. Take advantage of your time and your youth, you will be glad you did later."
Junior,4,"What i like about the school is that the professors are often times very nice.when I have questions or concerns, they often times will try their best to help me."
Sophomore,4,"Food is decent, dorms are great but expensive, the professors are a mixed bag depending on your major. I enjoy my time there but I worry about the practicality of my degree."
Sophomore,4,The University of Kentucky provided an academic experience that warrants a ton of pride. The campus is beautiful and full of spirit. With very little ease you can find yourself an excited member of Big Blue Nation. I personally became overwhelmed with the magnitude of social/student life but to each their own. Most professors I encountered were more than willing to set aside time for students in class and office hours.
Junior,4,"I transferred to UK my junior year of undergrad. I am very satisfied with the academic resources they provide, all of which point to success. Social involvement is voluntary, but once immersed, it provides fantastic connections and lifelong friendships."
Senior,4,"Great university. It's very big, students have to be very responsible with keeping up with assignments, travel times, and graduation tracts. It is very easy to meet people and make friends. UK offers a lot of curricular groups and activities."
Freshman,4,My experience at the university of Kentucky has been overall good. There are so many activities to do and groups to join. This school has many resources and it’s what you make out of them. Schools great
Senior,4,My department was awesome but the general classes could be a mess. As long as you like your major classes you should get through it but it can be a struggle to get through the basics.
Freshman,4,I think the campus is absolutely splendid. It has an amazing environment.  There are plenty of things to do. Their are opportunities for every person there. The dorms are amazing and greatly set up. The cafe has great food and plenty of options.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the University of Kentucky because it allows me to fully be myself. It has offered me many opportunities to prosper.
Junior,4,Nice campus. Big student population. Diverse. Lots of academic opportunities. Variety of students w different backgrounds. High school spirit. Good sports teams.
Freshman,4,"Being from Ohio, I was excited yet a little nervous to make the trip down to Lexington. Going to a place where I didn't know anyone presented a lot of opportunity to grow as a person and make new connections, but at the same time the fear of maybe not finding anyone that I could really relate to and become friends with was a very real thing. During my second week of being here in Lexington, I decided to rush for a fraternity and it just may have been the best decision of my life. I have made all types of new friends of all different majors. I have people that are in my major which helps with my academics and having people to converse with about homework, lectures, and upcoming tests. I was nervous about making the move down here, but now that I'm here and in the groove of things, I can't imagine being anywhere else!"
Sophomore,4,"Uk is really a good campus it is really diverse and it has all the resources you need it helps anyone feel welcomed because it is all United. I am currently undecided and it is been a place where I can explore my interest with tons of things you can major with. If you are going there for sports the University of Kentucky is a great place for that our basketball team is always top 5 at some type of the year every year. The other sports is good as well. There are a variety of food spots you can go to around campus like chic fil a inside of the student center as well as subway and Panda Express and right by the student center is a papa johns,steak n shake and more. The only thing that I would change is the the parking prices because honestly I think it is outrageous how expensive they are."
Sophomore,4,"I wouldn't change very much about the university, it had a very welcoming atmosphere, friendly students and professors that cared about there students"
Junior,4,"My experience at the University of Kentucky started out a little rough. I did not make many friends my first year of college. Eventually, in my sophomore and junior year, I started meeting a good group of friends that allowed me to fully enjoy my college experience. Overall, the education I have been receiving here has been great!"
Niche User,4,"There are a lot of opportunities on campus and plenty of chances to meet people. However, because of its large size, it can often feel overwhelming to find that small group of friends. Sometimes, the academics can be a little on the easy side for a top student, but I truly believe that UK can get you anywhere you dream to be so long as you work hard yourself."
Niche User,4,Kentucky is a great school that offers everything a k\student is looking for. They give opportunity and hope to everybody.
Junior,4,"The education is good, and the teachers truly care about student's success. I do not live on campus, go to parties, or eat campus food, so I am unable to rate it with those aspects in mind. But, the places that I visit on campus are overall positive environments. The Johnson Center has a wonderful gym space that I frequent. Overall, the University of Kentucky is a gorgeous campus."
Sophomore,4,"I like how up to date everything is, and also how small the class sizes are. The University also gives students lots of resources to succeed inside and also outside of the classroom. If I could change one thing, it would just be that the higher level faculty could have a better relationship with students."
Graduate Student,4,"Kentucky provided the benefits of a large, public university with the programs and activities that allowed for smaller communities in which to connect and form close bonds with others."
Freshman,4,"This university provides a lot of courses and they have a good quality classes. The campus is very big and very safe for students who live on campus, dorms are very close to the classes. They also have a great meal plana dn they provide an awesome food for students."
Senior,4,"I like attending the University of Kentucky because it is a great place to feel included. Even though it has over 30,000 students in attendance, there are many groups and events to be apart of to find your home away from home."
Junior,4,"Overall it is a great university.  It can vary a bit based on what college/major you are in, though."
Freshman,4,Classes and professors are great! But as an off campus student I’ve found parking and accommodations for off campus students to be somewhat lacking.
Senior,4,"I am a minority on a predominately Caucasian campus. I do not always feel... included. Sometimes I am super away of my brown skin but I usually do not feel uncomfortable, just.. aware. But, in Kentucky, that is the norm. I feel as though I am receiving a quality education and I thoroughly enjoy all of my classes. I am learning a lot and I enjoy thinking critically."
Senior,4,"I've absolutely loved my time at the University of Kentucky. I've been blessed with the opportunity to work under some of the most accredited and distinguished social work professors and I've gained an incredible education along the way. My only issue is not with the University itself, but with the social atmosphere. Being a minority on campus can be extremely difficult just in the sense that I am a minority and there are few students and even fewer professors that look like me. I truly believe that UK is doing a great job at reducing the racial tension on campus, but it's still an important issue that UK must continue to dedicate resources to."
Sophomore,4,"Don't get me wrong, there have been times where I have not been in love with UK, but at the end of the day, I am glad I chose to attend college here. Overall, the classes and teachers have been great, and people have the ability to be as involved as they want in extracurriculars."
Junior,4,I love the emphasis my university has on health and wellness; we have so many events that help students stay active!
Junior,4,The University of Kentucky has been wonderful overall. Many of the professors I have had really do care about the students and make an effort to work with each person as needed. There is always something to do on campus when you are not caught up in school work. There are so many clubs that there is definitely something for everyone on campus if they take a close enough look. The amenities of the university are also fantastic and leave little to be desired.
Freshman,4,"Although my move in date is in a couple of weeks and I’ve visited the campus, I can say that it looks really clean and everyone is quite friendly."
Freshman,4,"I love the housing and overall campus of UK! It's a very safe and clean atmosphere. The people are open-armed and welcome you in instantly. Although parking is a pain I was still able to bring a car as a freshmen, which is uncommon. Overall I love UK and cannot wait to continue there."
Niche User,4,"I liked that the University of Kentucky has so many options for students with all different interests. There’s clubs, sports, Greek life, and much more! One thing that I would change is to have more diversity and better return on investment."
Graduate Student,4,"University of Kentucky is a competitive and highly rated school. Growing up near the campus I was fully aware of all the wonderful opportunities provided. Now, as a distance learner in a Graduate program with UK, I fully appreciate all that the school has to offer."
Junior,4,"I have worked for the University of Kentucky before and unfortunately I had to leave for school, but now that I am transferring to University of Kentucky I hope to one day work for the University again. Since I am majoring in Psychology, I have heard that the University of Kentucky  has a great psychology program. I have enjoyed working with the students when I worked there and I am excited to be considered a classmate now."
Graduate Student,4,I like the help that I got not only for my classes but also my career. One thing that would I would like to change is some aspects of the Disability Resource Center to allow for better accommodations for students that use it.
Junior,4,"I love the campus. It’s very open, there are chairs out everywhere so you can sit and study. Most of the buildings are beautiful. I love the dorms.
I have met amazing teachers, many have shown that they care about my wellbeing and that was something that I honestly didn’t expect. I had an issue on campus and I reported it, the university immediately took care of it. It’s expensive, but I don’t regret coming here at all. I wouldn’t change it for the world."
Junior,4,"Sure, the landscaping, the new dorms, and the new student center are pretty. But honestly, there's also so many buildings on campus with offices and classrooms that still have cinderblock walls, which can be pretty depressing to stay in for hours on end. At times, it feels like the university is trying to upgrade things that will attract freshman that don't know any better (like free ipads for all incoming students this year). I've only had two professors that I've genuinely enjoyed."
Sophomore,2,"I personally cannot learn solely online (my grades took a major hit). UK did everything they could with COVID being very unexpected and I appreciate it but, doing online felt too optional as far as work and projects. Also since I'm out of state I would rather pay a lower tuition to do in-state than pay UK's prices"
Freshman,2,"The academics and campus are wonderful, and I can't say enough good things about them. All my professors are great and my advisors have been good as well. However, it is hard to find a community at UK if you do not join a fraternity/sorority. If you don't plan on partying over the weekends, then there is not much else to do. It can get really boring at times."
Freshman,2,"I am going into UK as a Freshman this fall, but I over rating for the application and financial aid aspect they have not been very helpful at all.  I have had to struggle on my own with every step of my acceptance."
Senior,2,"Good variety of courses, but UKY does not care about the safety of their students. Some professors are completely rude while others make you find your passion for their subject. Just like with any school, there will be pros and cons. Find the school that best fits you and not just what others want you to pick."
Freshman,2,"University of kentucky is nice, if you're from the state. Coming from out of state you have a lot of trouble fitting in with the right people unless you use to being alone and bored. They (instate-ers) consider Lexington a big city but it really isn't. The only way to have a good time is if you're in greek life and if you're not and go to parties, its like you don't even fit in and people pretty much treat you differently. In general the academics here is so so. If you're positive you want to pursue nursing then UK is for you. They have a great nursing program but other than that, the school is very average. Its boring here and theres constantly construction. If thats your sort of thing, then uk is for you."
College Sophomore,2,Campus crime is a serious issue and about every week some new incident occurs.
College Senior,2,"There are frequent armed robberies of students near campus and I have verbalized the need to have the campus police schedule a regular patrol around the campus neighborhoods in the late evenings and early mornings, after a student was shot and killed last year for his backpack."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors only care about getting paid.

Not a lot of class times and a lot of people wanting to take that class, making it extremely hard to take the classes you want.

Buildings are old, bugs everywhere, bathrooms never clean, weird smells.

Classes are extremely large, not a lot of personal space."
College Sophomore,2,Needs a lot of work
College Freshman,2,I receive many emails about robbings and shootings around campus that i travel around abput everyday and that isn't good. Many steps have been took to make our campus safe however.
College Freshman,2,"Big part of the culture, but I don't see the point in it."
College Freshman,2,"The new dorms are amazing, but they cost more than luxury apartments, which is ridiculous. It costs over $1000 a month to live in the suite-style dorms. I have an apartment that is 3 times as nice as Champions, and I pay $500 a month."
College Junior,2,"If you like to be only around greeks and love basketball then this place is for you, but if you like a little variety in your life then this is probably not the best fit."
College Freshman,2,Getting a job has been a huge struggle for me this year to the point that I have given up because there is no one who seems interested in hiring me.
College Freshman,2,"I lived in the oldest housing available on campus, Blanding 4. Ive seen the other dorms and everything else looks very nice but their are always pros and cons to on campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,Ive never been to the career center but I have had many friends try to get internships through it and from what i've heard they are not helpful in the slightest.
College Student,2,"I lived in Blanding 1 during the first semester of my freshman year at UK. Now don't get me wrong, UK has built a ton of fancy new (and outrageously expensive) dorms through that you can live in if you are lucky enough and can afford them. I, however, was placed in the oldest dorm still available on campus. The RA's were great, my roommate was okay, and I won't go into detail on how bad my old dorm was in comparison to my friends' new dorms (little space in the room, paper thin walls, communal bathrooms.) However, I do know that UK still had to turn away a number of students because there simply isn't enough housing available. Maybe instead of spending so much money on revamping Commonwealth Stadium, the University could put a little more money towards building affordable housing."
College Freshman,2,Housing is a major unnecessary expense.
College Junior,2,"Students here are extremely racist and intolerant of ethnic/racial and socioeconomic minorities. I have been disrespected and disregarded on so many occasions that it is embarrassing for such a ""prestigious"" university. If you are religious and a liberal, people don't even attempt to understand your views. This goes for most cases. Students here seem to want to categorize everyone into who they think they should be, instead of em-pathetically trying to figure out who you are."
College Freshman,2,"After getting here, I realized I was not prepared."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a great fit if you love sports, want to go Greek, and love Southern culture. Unfortunately, none of these things apply to me, so I'm not having the greatest time here. 

That aside, my classes are too easy and most of my professors are jokes. I'm carrying a 4.0 in Engineering, which is generally unheard of. The food isn't as terrible as everyone says it is--I've had worse. The dorms are fantastic for the most part, and we have some great resources. I just wish I picked a more challenging school. Also, people can be terribly racist."
College Junior,2,The quality of the food is not very good. There are only a few restaurants I will eat at. The fact that I can't use a meal swipe at most places until after 4 is terrible.
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no healthy options on campus.  The food is poor quality.  Many places do not have any meal swipes, or do not allow meal swipes until after 4 pm, and the types of meals you can get with swipes are limited.  You also cannot get a meal swipe within 3 hours of swiping a prior meal."
College Freshman,2,Parties at our school is a drunken mess and I'm not into that scene so I party at the WF and CSF. Several people come and it's a great time.
College Freshman,2,I never feel connected to our administration.
College Freshman,2,"Campus food at UK is inconsistent. You may occasionally get a good mean, but its rare."
College Freshman,2,"They don't have a lot of options other then mcdonalds, chipotle, or pazzos."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process seems like a waste of time because they go off how much your parents make not considering the amount of things they have to pay. Tips for getting financial aid is to exceed in the classroom.
College Freshman,2,Serve the same meals everyday.
College Sophomore,2,"Received little to no finaid and should have, still dealing with it for two years"
College Freshman,2,"Only one traditional dorm option for girls, otherwise you must pay an extra $2,000 a semester to live in a Village house with five other girls.  Boys have many more options for dorm types: traditional, four person, Village house, etc.."
College Sophomore,2,not a lot of help seeking out scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It was pretty bad when I graduated, but they are redoing a lot of it now and it looks amazing!"
College Freshman,2,It's hard for student from Lexington.
College Freshman,2,The visitation rules in the dorms are very strict and very very annoying. One of the reasons that I want to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Kirwan Tower and Blanding Towers are very gross and are in very bad shape. The newer dorms are so much better, but I still will not be living on campus next semester."
College Sophomore,2,The party scene on UK's campus is not great at all. A person can only attend parties if they know a lot of people in that fraternity or if they are in that fraternity.
College Junior,2,"The dining halls and meals are pretty good there are several options.  The worst is the how meal plan together.   There are too many strict rules that makes it seem like a public school lunch.  It's silly.  We're adults, we can control our own eating."
College Junior,2,"I did not apply for financial aid because I do not ""qualify"" even though it is a struggle to make it though school and pay for everything, even though I do work a part time job and full time during summer."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many healthy options.
College Freshman,2,"Since UK outsourced their dining, well, even before they outsourced their dining, there have been huge problems with it. There are lots of rules for when you can use your meal swipes, and you can no longer swipe in your friends, like you can at most schools. My best advice for freshmen is to get the Champions 85 plan, which contains 85 meal swipes and $700 flex dollars. Most of the ""good"" dining places accept mostly flex dollars, and a lot of students complain about not having enough (besides the Champions plan, your only other options have $200/300). So, especially since you cannot swipe in your friends, a lot of students end up having a bunch of leftover meal swipes, and having to add flex dollars to their account. If you are not a big eater who wants a full 3 meals each day, get the Champions 85, it will give you a lot more options for a la carte eating."
College Freshman,2,"It is a state school in Kentucky, and diversity is as one would expect it to be. There are, of course, some minorities, but it is a primarily white campus, and besides the ""black"" sororities/fraternities, it seems to be difficult for a person of color to get a bid. In personal experience, though, those minority greek organizations are the ones with the best sister/brotherhoods, but they typically do not participate in the ""white"" greek events."
College Freshman,2,"They are very strict about alcohol/drug use in the dorms. There is a strict no tolerance policy, and good luck if you break it. They are also very strict about visitation. Most dorms now have 24/7 visitation, but someone can only spend the night 2 nights in a row, and 3 nights total in a 14 day period. I strongly believe that if I pay $4000 a semester (the housing cost in the new dorms), I should be allowed to have my friends/boyfriend stay over more than 3/14 days. If you are out of state, you could find this policy very annoying, because your significant other/friends won't be able to stay for even a long weekend."
College Freshman,2,"The workload is very manageable, and in my opinion, too easy; I may have 2 hours of homework a week at the most. You can hear from others that it is super hard and takes up a ton of time, but that is mostly due to poor time management skills/lack of learning styles. Academics really take a backseat to amenities and sports at this school, to the point where classrooms are decades old and some are falling apart, but tens of millions are being spent on a new student center to attract potential students. This is where you come for a degree, instate tuition, and a decent college experience, not necessarily an education."
College Student,2,I don't live on campus it cost to much.
College Sophomore,2,Very annoying and overwhelming for non-Greeks
College Sophomore,2,campus is in the process of opening all-new dorms
College Freshman,2,If you get into the Kirwan/Blanding complex consider your life over.
College Freshman,2,Lexington is a boring small town disguised as a big city using a few tall buildings.
College Sophomore,2,There's a lot of crime around campus and the victims are usually UK students.
College Senior,2,"For transfer students, you receive pretty much nothing (it anything at all)!"
College Junior,2,"If you're a minority, you'll receive a ton of money. If you're white, you won't. Pretty simple."
College Junior,2,Police only care about breaking up parties. They are NOT there to help you.
College Sophomore,2,Most of them are douches. Girls have better housing than the guys.
College Sophomore,2,Being any ethnicity but white will obviously help you.
College Sophomore,2,"The best thing about living on campus is how close you are to classes.  That's it.  It is expensive, constraining, and restrictive.  You share a tiny space with a roommate. There is no privacy.  You cannot make any decisions on your own. you are told who can visit, when, and how many visitors you can have (2, and between noon and midnight).  Parking is virtually non existent.  you have to walk miles to your car.  You also HAVE to use the meal plan which is twice as expensive as it would be for me to buy my own groceries."
College Sophomore,2,"I had to quit school because I did not receive enough aid.  their ""cost of attendance"" is $14,000 a year.  I calculated that between my tuition, books, room and board, my personal cost of attendance was $22,000. My rent is only $500 (less than dorms!) and I do not spend much on food! I spent $1,200 in books for one semester (used) and $2,000 in supplies. I am going through appeals right now over it."
College Freshman,2,"A quaint sardine can, crumbling and aromatic at best, all for the price of a few thousand dollars. Words can not properly express the rage and disappointment of student housing at UK, especially in comparison to other options."
College Sophomore,2,"The University of Kentucky does not have many financial aid programs, or any ways to help you pay for college.  The financial advisers are never available for help.  The faculty does have office hours to help, but can be very cruel and impatient when a student does not understand a subject.  UK has many study aids, a great campus life and many restaurants to help students on their college journey.  All of these things set UK apart from other colleges. However, due to the lack of support and financial help, the University of Kentucky does not have the best rating, in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"Try as they may, students are going to continue to do drugs and use alcohol in college. Students talk about it all the time."
Senior,1,None of the professors knew what they were doing. Online learning is completely disorganized. None of them had schedules set either so they just gave us work whenever they felt like it. My online learning experience did not contribute to my education at all.
Senior,1,"I transferred to UK my sophomore year of college thinking that I would love it. Since being here, I have met with nothing but disappointment. Professors do not care about their students, and all the school wants is money. They are cold-hearted and I wish I never came here. Financial aid was non-existent for me so I'll be paying back over $20k in loans for a degree that I don't even want anymore from this place."
College Sophomore,1,Campus housing was very strict and the process of having guests was very long and annoying.
College Sophomore,1,"I lived on campus during my freshman year. I was placed in Kirwan Tower although I only applied for Haggin, Central, and Baldwin. Living in Kirwan Tower was the worst experience of my life. The dorm was at least 30 years old and deteriorating from the inside out. Illness was extremely common. The community bathrooms had mold. An entire floor had to be evacuated because of bed bugs. The elevators broke constantly. All of this compared to my friends living in the new dorms of Haggin and Central with their own private rooms, private bathrooms, separate kitchens, along with other amenities was extremely disappointing."
College Freshman,1,Greek life does not benefit the university. These students are only blinded from their education by their environment.
College Freshman,1,"There are extremely nice dorms on our campus; however I was placed in the old dorms, from the 1960's, and it was the worst living experience I think I will ever have to deal with."
College Freshman,1,I am still trying to get financial aid
College Freshman,1,Greasy is all I have to say!
College Freshman,1,Very outdated system with rude staff that are not help
College Sophomore,1,"They offer scholarships for freshman based solely on your ACT score. You're only granted one scholarship from UK, so there's now stacking of scholarships or combining multiple ones. There's hardly any options on campus for scholarships if you're middle class, not a member of the ""diverse"" crowd that UK throws money at, or from a far off county in Eastern Kentucky. Scholarships at UK are awful."
College Sophomore,1,stingiest school in the state. not enough aid
College Sophomore,1,Everything about the scholarship process at UK is terrible. Its very biased.
College Sophomore,1,Scholarships are very limited and have unreasonable deadlines.
College Junior,1,"UK treats underage  drinking like it's the biggest problem in the world. Meanwhile, students are getting robbed, beaten up, and stabbed because the police are focused on parties."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid is nearly impossible at the University of Kentucky.  The advisers are never present and does not explain what you can do.  The financial helpers give pamphlets that you can read to apply, but does not go through steps or take the time to explain what you can do.  I received a ridiculously small amount of aid that has helped me hardly at all.  I think that UK could benefit from any help in this department and should learn to work with students better."
College Senior,1,It is expensive and far away from classes and the university.
College Junior,1,Every single year I have had the WORST financial aid help
College Freshman,1,The weather is constantly changing.
College Freshman,1,K-Lot is far away and there's hardly any spots.
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks carry themselves higher than everyone else.  The first question to be asked when you meet someone is what fraternity or sorority are you in, and for me that is annoying because I am not in a fraternity because I do not have the additional money to add towards a fraternity for 4 years.  That means I would have to pay for 8 semester of fraternity dues, which could be on average $700 a semester totaling $5,600.  For someone like me who is cutting coupons to make ends meet a fraternity lifestyle is not in my future."
College Freshman,1,"You only see campus safety driving around in their cars, you never see them actually walking around campus. Theft is also a huge issue! I got my bike stolen twice last semester, campus police did absolutely NOTHING. There are a lot of security problems, I see so many homeless people walking around the basement of Willy T at night, makes me very uneasy."
College Freshman,1,"UK NEVER shuts down for weather! We have to walk to class in rain, and snow. The weather changes instantly too! Yesterday it was almost 70, and today it is snowing!"
College Freshman,1,"I am in a sorority, and I am very displeased with it. They are very cliquey, and only focused on money. During rush they give you this rehearsed speech about how their sisterhood is amazing, and once you're in, they want over $2000 a year for doing absolutely nothing!"
College Freshman,1,"You only qualify for academic scholarships if you have a 28 or above on the ACT, and if you have ONE bad semester, they take away your financial aid."
College Freshman,1,"The rooms and restrooms are in terrible shape, they smell bad even after being ""cleaned"" and they cost more than they are worth."
College Freshman,1,Internet in the dorms is soooo slow
College Freshman,1,It's such a headache and most of the time not very helpful.
College Junior,1,They're building new dorms now though.
College Freshman,1,There have been days that the sidewalks were extremely icy and it was unsafe for students to walk and drive to class but there were no delays or cancellations in order to give the students a longer time to account for the unsafe conditions.
College Freshman,1,"ALL of the buildings are really old and really run-down. Considering the price, they should look and smell a lot better."
College Freshman,1,You literally can't do anything if you're not involved in greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,"UK is stingy and does not give hardly any money to the students.  For a 30 on the ACT and being in the top 5% of my class in high school I receive 1,500$ per year.  The other scholarships that have to be applied for are very difficult to find and UK doesn't tell you about them or how to find them at all."
College Freshman,1,"Sure, the athletics teams are great and all, but they seem to be the only thing the school and most of the students care about.  All of the athletes walk around with all of their UK gear, all of which was given to them because you can't find it anywhere else, and their ipads and everything else the university gave to them.  They instead could use that money to pay towards my tuition rather than funding some kids athletic dream."
College Freshman,1,Having to park half a mile away from campus is not ideal.
College Freshman,1,"Doggone awful.  The ratio of students to parking spots is such that there are more cars than there are spots, the parking lots are very far away from everything important, and the university keeps digging up parking lots to build even more dorms"
College Sophomore,1,"Being a minority myself, sometimes I walk through campus wondering if I'm the only minority within a mile radius. It's something the school is working on, but they honestly need to work harder. "
College Sophomore,1,There are absolutely no free parking areas. Just in the first semester I have had my vehicle towed twice at very expensive prices. Finding parking is extremely hard and the towing is far to harsh. 
College Freshman,1,"Parking at UK needs a lot of work. It's horrible. Permits for the whole year are around $250, but the parking lot is about a 35 minute walk from my dorm. I didn't bring my car for this reason. The parking is at the stadium, which means that every time there is a football game everyone has to move their car to a different place or get a ticket. The parking services are very ticket happy, and it makes parking a hassle. "
College Junior,1,"I'm pretty sure they sell out more parking permits then there are spots to park. So if you have an afternoon class you are pretty much out of luck and forced to park outside your permit zone, and you get ticketed pretty much immediately."
College Freshman,1,"Parking sucks if you're in K Lot, it's about a ten minute walk from everywhere on campus if not more.  Gets pretty old if you have to walk there if you want to drive anywhere. "
College Freshman,1,"I am a vegetarian/organic enthusiast and let me tell you, the on campus dining has very very little options in that area.  The food is a rotation of the same stuff every week and it gets old quickly.  Ovid's is alright if you're looking to be healthy.  "
College Freshman,1,"NEVER choose to live on campus.  I live in Donovan Hall and it is like being in prison.  You have the check guests in and out, there's only one entry and exit door, and the facility itself is so old.  The bathrooms are often gross and the rooms are nothing special.  Unless you get one of the new dorms, like Central, choose to live off campus.  It's not worth paying $10,000 a year to live in a prison cell. "
College Junior,1,Parking in Lexington is terrible
College Sophomore,1,"The food sucks, they don't have many options all together. "
College Sophomore,1,"Dorms are horrible, living in an apartment would be excellent."
College Sophomore,1,The idea that someone could come into my lecture where there is two hundred and fifty students and do something completely scary and devastating. 
College Sophomore,1,As a muslim growing up and following strict rules on the type of meat that I am allowed to consume going to the University of Kentucky practicing seems to be very difficult. 
College Sophomore,1,"The computers and the printing is a very good tool for students, they are good."
College Sophomore,1,Good student life is fun for many kids. They find it helpful and a good way to meet new people.
College Sophomore,1,I don't participate in any of these activities so I couldn't write anything about it. 
College Sophomore,1,The weather is so moody it's always changing and is never really consistent. The campus is sloped on a hill so during the winter its very cold. 
College Sophomore,1,Drugs are everywhere as a student I have friends that smoke and do drugs just like I do my everyway things. They don't really care and find it as a normal thing. 
College Sophomore,1,"They are tough, campus police think they have too much power."
College Senior,1,There is almost no parking on or near campus. It is awful. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"The bus system is too confusing, so 90% of students never even bother learning how to use it. This isn't NYC; it's Lexington. You walk, bum a ride, or shut up."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is awful. You WILL get multiple tickets whether or not you're parked in a totally legal spot, or horizontally in the f***ing middle of the street. It's way too expensive for a pass. Very annoying and it will never improve. It was bad from day one until my very last day."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Long story short: The Lex is awful and Newtown Crossing is so-so. Those are the two most popular apartment complexes. Red Mile isn't bad, but it's not walkable. Angliana is okay as well, but once again, unless you like to walky-joggy to class every morning, just don't do it. If you're ever running behind, you'll never make it. It happened to me multiple times when I lived at The Lex, even though it's only like, a 15 minute walk to White Hall. The other apartment complexes involve you using transportation and they're too expensive. Those are the ones in which the rich kids inhabit. Off-campus housing is still pretty awful. Solid D, though."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Please, see my previous review on Local Atmosphere."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Boring city with nothing to do on weekends, but smoke hookah and get intoxicated. It gets super old."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No one cares. There is the VIP Center, but they don't do anything. Campus police are nowhere to be found. That's about it... In your email, you'll get safety updates, but no one pays significant attention. There was the UK foot stabber / ankle cutter at Willy T. Young. It's some guy that would stab girls' feet at the library and run away, never to be found. Men like to show their penises in public to women. 

Overall, you're as safe as you try to be, so I suggest you sit in your room and do nothing."

I am appreciate for everything they are doing to stay open while maintaining the proper level of excellence.
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed how helpful the entire faculty is. Whatever questions I have had, they are always there to make sure everything is taken care of. I also really appreciate how many resources they have to offer. They make all programs very available. Lastly, everyone responds to emails is a timely fashion. It is very easy to get a hold of anyone you are looking for. I would say the biggest thing this school has to offer is availability and a focus on the students. They make sure you are taken care of and want to see you succeed."
Junior,5,West Coast University is Fast Pace. They have great professors that will take the time to help you. You do need to put in the effort to pass though.

Junior,5,This school really helps you reach your goal of becoming a nurse. It is tough at some times but the professors and staff are always there to encourage you. The only thing that I would change about this school is the parking. The parking can be a nightmare sometimes
Sophomore,5,"I will be starting West Coast University very soon, so far I have interacted with staff members who are extremely helpful. They are willing to listen to what you have to say and always allow you to ask any questions you may have. They give many opportunities to discuss anything with them that you may not understand and do their best to communicate and explain things to their knowledge."

Freshman,5,"I feel that this school really sets their students up for success. From the student affairs, career services, professors, etc. I believe they are perfect at motivating and encouraging their students to do their absolute best. I would recommend this school to anyone considering."
Sophomore,5,I honestly do not have one bad thing to say about this school. I feel like West Coast sets its students up to win. I am in the accelerated BSN program and will graduate in 2021.
Freshman,5,Fantastic Environment with very friendly staff. I always enjoy walking through the door. I feel I will get a quality education and go on to be a successful nurse.
Junior,5,"It is a 3 year program. Although it is expensive, it is definitely worth the price. I have been able to accomplish my goals through this program."
Freshman,5,"I love it, no wait list on classes which is great! You only take the classes you actually need for your BSN, 10 week terms so you finish faster than at a community college or a state college and did I mention, NO WAIT!
I honestly think it's great especially if you're tired of being on the wait list or on the lottery for Nursing programs!"
Sophomore,5,The organization of the university is great. High NCLEX score. Fast enrollment. Friendly staff. The only negative for the university is the cost that is why I’m looking for grants and scholarships to cover the coast.
Freshman,5,West Coast university is a school that provides for the students. There is always available resources for anything you need depending on if its studying or talking to your financial aid advisor there is so much help all around and overall a wonderful school
Freshman,5,"Im really new here, dont have a lot to say about it but the staff seems loke they are really there for the student success!"
Sophomore,5,"They have good customer service, and the staffs are polite, and friendly. I always wanted to go to the school to get my degree."
Sophomore,5,Since I have shown interest the school has been there for me and helped me out with anything that I needed. They stayed consistent and have helped me figure things out financially. The nursing program is very hands on and helps prepare people for their nursing career. You also don't have to worry about fighting for your classes because they have availability and you don't have to worry about not taking any of the classes that you need.
Freshman,5,"Everyone made the process very easy. The staff is always very helpful and most important are willing to explained step by step. Its an overall great experience, and would recommend this school to everyone interested in continuing his/her education."
Freshman,5,West Coast University is a nice school. The state of the art equipment eases my nerves when it come to interaction with real life patients. I love how fast they are with all my documents and information to get me started for class. When ever i have a question I can always reach someone to help me.
Freshman,5,"A few things that I enjoy about West Coast University is that it is a fast paced program and there is no wait list. Something that I do not like is how courses are blended. Some teachers still lecture and help you understand the concept, however, some teachers do not lecture and leave it to you to teach yourself the material."
Junior,5,"Great school, a little pricey but worth the accelerated program. The general ed classes are go by quickly and help prepare for the Core nursing classes. I am currently in the fundamentals portion of the program where we begin rotations and clinicals. It is difficult but very helpful in preparing for the field. There have been great professors and very few poor professors. The environment provided makes it easy to create relationships and trust with the faculty as well as your peers. I have made many friends and helps with studying for study group purposes."
Sophomore,5,"Great resources and professors. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Challenging, but certainly doable if you put in the time and effort. The fast pace is ideal for those who like a challenge and can keep on top of their work."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love West Coast University & by far the best decision I have ever made regarding my education & my future. West Coast is known to be the “expensive” school that everyone talks about when it comes to nursing. Sure, it’s intimidating when it comes to money, but there is no price limit when it comes to the kind of education & dedication the students & professors put into the program. What you put into the program is what you are going to get out of it, & if you don’t put in any effort at all the program won’t feel sorry for leaving you behind. As a student, you have to want being a nurse & take the program seriously. Being a nurse isn’t just a normal profession with good pay. The profession is about caring & understanding that it is up to you as a nurse to change a patient’s life for the better."
Freshman,5,So far this seems to be a wonderful school. They are very proactive and pleasant to work with. The counselors are very helpful and are quick to respond to emails or questions you may have in the enrollment process.

Niche User,5,So far so good. I went and took a tour of the college and sat on the nursing seminar. The most interesting thing that I really liked was the fact that the school has a simulation center. The entrance exam that I took seemed like a standard test. The Admin personnel and Financial Aid are all nice and very supportive.

College Senior,5,West Coast University is one of the best schools I have been to. Everyone from administration to professors have been very helpful. I do like the pace of the school and how fast it is going. A down fall of the school is cost of tuition. Other than that I would do it all over again.

College Freshman,5,My specific major is Nursing. West Coast focuses on medical degrees. The facilities are top notch and clean.

College Senior,5,"With an accredited bachelor's degree there are few limitations with what I can do, education or career wise."

College Junior,5,"As I mentioned before the staff is great. They are so helpful and seem to make everything work so quickly and smoothly. The professors are always there for you when they are not teaching. They want you to succeed and are willing to set up tutoring time.

Senior,4,This school is very fast paced and will allow you to be an educated RN. Every student is given the academic tools needed and simulation experiences. The clincals take place at different hospitals and the instructors are amazing
Junior,4,"Nothing is worse than virtual learning.  Ever since COVID hit, the professors have been really great at helping us with the transition.  It is very different taking exams, and learning but it is doable.  Nurses should be able to adapt to change, and this is a perfect example."
Sophomore,4,"Accelerated program. Lots of online at home studying. Lectures online even when classes are on campus. Very fast paced, but staff are always willing to help aroundoffice hours with helping and try to make it for everyone."
Senior,4,Fast paced program that well prepares you for the NCLEX. The school has talented staff that are available to students. Classes are small but provide a good ratio of faculty to students. The university has updated systems and have modern technology to help with learning.
Sophomore,4,Professors and staff are always around to help students in need. West Coast University also provides many opportunity to help us succeed. Tutoring and office hours are available everyday.
Junior,4,It is a great fast-paced program with a semester divided into two terms of 10 weeks each. It is a for-profit school and so is quite expensive. The schools have many departments which help students and one if the best one is career services. I would only recommend this school to people who can solely focus on school and stay away from the rest. It can be very difficult to work and attend school so you have been warned.
Freshman,4,"It's fast-paced. They have many ways to help study & promote time management through workshops and courses (FYS). Most teachers are friendly & will reply to e-mails & questions about the course or assignments or any other issues. There is a lot work to be done with each class, on-ground and online. The campus is located near an international airport, so there are many place to eat and shop at nearby. It's located off a busy interstate. Wish they sold coffee or fresh food, not cafeteria food, on campus."
Freshman,4,"I liked the process of applying, the advisors and finical aid staff were very helpful through out the whole application process. They provided recourses to help me find a private loan and helped me with my FASFA application when I was having trouble with it. The whole campus is beautiful and clean, I feel very safe there and I know I will get the best training here and I have high hopes to get a great career with their help."
Sophomore,4,WCU-Ontario is my prime choice of a college to obtain my B.S.N.  I've only been to the campus twice now for pre-admission procedures and the staff has been exceptionally helpful.
Junior,4,"My experience has been pleasant. Though the campus is small, I have been able to find quiet spaces to study."
Sophomore,4,The purpose of this school is to finish your BSN quickly. It's fast paced and if you can't handle 12 week terms then this might not be the school for you.
Senior,4,"Great professors, top notch simulation center to practice nursing skills and care, and faculty devoted to hearing from students. Curriculum is good, rules are fair. They’ve added clinical partners for us to work at. They are military friendly. I’m still in the reserves and they have worked with my schedule. I’ve had some issues with the student/career services not having accurate info on available scholarships, work study programs, and programs outside the school, but I understand there are many hospitals and lots of people to keep up with in those networks. The school is insanely expensive. There’s a room to eat but only has vending machines. It’s a career college, so don’t expect a lot of student involvement. The campus is nice overall. There are no athletics."
Freshman,4,"This is my second term at WCU, so far I am excited as the terms are flying by. I enjoy the fast pace of the accelerated courses."
Sophomore,4,West coast has a great NCLEX pass rate. They're goal is to make sure students pass the NCLEX on the first attempt. The nursing training involves realistic dummies before clinical.
Junior,4,West coast so far has been a pretty good school. Most of the teachers are pretty good and they have tons of options and resources to help ensure you pass your classes. Admin is very helpful and sweet and questions get answered pretty promptly. I start fundamentals for nursing in April and I hope the experience stays the same.
Freshman,4,I just started going to West Coast University and the school is so clean and nice. The staff and students are friendly to everyone. The school is a fast paced school which I like. The teachers are very friendly and will help you with anything you need. The location for the school is kind of bad because it’s righy next to the freeway but overrall a great school.

College Freshman,4,"The have job fairs often, you are thoroughly prepared for clinicals and most students are offered jobs from clinical sites."
College Freshman,4,Heavy heavy workload. You will definitely need to be extremely organized and disciplined. But the education and time frame you won't get elsewhere
College Freshman,4,WCU fits what many people need. The hardest thing is the financial part. You will have to work or take out personal loans to be able to do this.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school so much. However, sometimes the 9 week courses are a lot of pressure. I have been at my school for over a year and I am still getting used to it. An added bonus is that I will be an RN by the time I am 22 though so I think the pressure and stress is well worth it."

College Senior,4,Very helpful and always willing to help.

College Senior,4,Career fairs and resume assistance are great.
College Sophomore,4,I think having a RN license is going to be great
College Senior,4,"there is a wide range of diversity as far as race and experience, background of the student body, it enhances the learning experience."
College Senior,4,The school hosts job fairs and helps with resumes. They also help with internships and job placement.
College Senior,4,"The education is provided by intelligent articulate instructors, information is up to date and hands on teaching is very applicable to real life."
College Senior,4,"The information, although fast-paced, is comprehensive."
College Junior,4,career services is great we have job fairs every term.
College Junior,4,I am still in the program but it seems that they do their best to help place students into careers.
College Junior,4,"My experience with the financial aid office has been wonderful they are always very helpful and accommodating of my schedule. The only thing is that I wish there were more loan options for example, more banks to choose from would be my biggest issue. The one and most important tip for getting financial aid at my school would be to always be punctual with due dates and keeping a clean credit score."
College Junior,4,"I really do like the experience so far. Almost all of the staff has been extremely helpful and friendly. This  is one college that is not pushy or money hungry like the rest you inquire about. That was probably my favorite part,was not feeling pressured or annoyed. 

The teachers are great and everyone seems to have an open door policy. They want you to ask for help, they do not want you to struggle or fail."
College Junior,4,"The diversity at this school is great. Other than the male population being far less than the female, the campus is extremely diverse as far as backgrounds and I like that. I do not get into political/religious/sexual conversations with students."

College Sophomore,4,Several different degree options are available.
College Sophomore,4,You are able to test out of classes
College Freshman,4,I'm so happy that there are not prereqs for prereqs.  They enroll you in the exact classes that you need.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the school is Female and often Filipino.  I feel that we are all Goal oriented as we all are looking to succeed with a career in nursing.
College Sophomore,4,The Professors are all there to help and assist students in learning.  I have had nothing but a positive experience here!
College Sophomore,4,There are computers available on each floor and easy access to print.  Unfortunately tho the Wireless service is not enough to support the student population and often one can not access on their laptop.
College Sophomore,4,"The staff is one of the biggest things this school has to offer. Everyone is so willing to learn your name, listen to your situation and alleviate any stress or concerns you have."
College Sophomore,4,I received and endless amount of information the first time I went to visit Natalie in Career services.
College Sophomore,4,"Regardless of having 5 hour classes, I can manage to work."
College Sophomore,4,There is an obviously great deal of diversity at WCU - Ontario. It definitely feels like the real world.
College Sophomore,4,"Feels like you are actually in class, with the knowledge you are acquiring."
College Sophomore,2,I couldn't get a loan and they don't help
College Sophomore,2,"Tuition is definitely more than an average student can afford, however, I have not seen it as a waste."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aide advisor I was working with was rude, and made the experience terrible. Everyone else had to do her job for her. "
College Sophomore,2,"WCU is very expensive but I think it will be worth it in the long run. The financial aid office made my loan process very easy. The only problem that I have with WCU is the book requirements for each course. Some courses require 2-3 books and I have found that I hardly use the textbooks that I order. Last term I was required to purchase 9 books, which was about $700. Out of those 9 books I only actually used 3 of them. From now on I am not going to buy books until I know for sure that they will actually be useful and that the teacher actually uses them as a teaching reference."
College Senior,2,"it is a fast track school so from the beginning they tell you that as a student the school will not work around a students life for school, it will just be too difficult to do with so many students.  I had to quit my job because the school schedule.  The school tells you when your classes are and you are to stay in that class unless you know someone who can switch before the first week."
College Junior,2,The only campus resources offered are library and computer services. I feel health/nursaing should be available to us.
College Senior,2,"The campus attempts to show that they care about their students by having occasional events based on ""student appreciation,"" but the overall impression throughout the year is poor."
College Senior,2,Continuous Wi-Fi interruptions throughout the day and very rare for internet to work while in class.
College Senior,1,Student lounge consists of vending machines.  There is no on-campus cafeteria.  Consistently have to leave campus to get food.

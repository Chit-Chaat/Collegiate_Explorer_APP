Freshman,5,"I really like how Olivet emphasizes faith in the classroom. The professors are so caring for the students. I was nervous about getting homesick, and I do sometimes, but Olivet does a good job of welcoming you and making you feel like you belong."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing so far! All staff and students have your best interest at heart. There is good new food choices on campus including a fully functioning Starbucks because college students need their caffeine fix! The campus itself is like a little ""pod"" with everything close together. Students have to live on campus until 23 or married which is a downfall but all of the housing like dorms and apartments are so close to campus. Updates could be done to the buildings but new apartments are being built very soon for upperclassmen. I feel very safe on campus despite the surrounding areas."
Sophomore,5,"When applying to Olivet, the admission department and financial aid department made my transition to this establishment very easy. They were patient with me and explained everything thoroughly."
Freshman,5,"Olivet Nazarene University is a very prestigious school. They have very high morals, expectations, and values. Everyone that I encountered there is extremely passionate about the college. The campus is absolutely beautiful. They truly do care about their students and have the best interest in them. The ratio of student to professors is small and makes their tight knit community even better."
Niche User,5,"My overall experience with Olivet Nazarene University has been very good. I've only been on a campus visit, but even from that visit I knew I wanted to go to that college. Everyone welcomed my mom and I with open arms, and helped us with anything we needed. Everyone was very polite and just made the visit so much better."
Niche User,5,I love the staff and students. It is a beautiful place to be! I am going to play football and their football team matches everything that the school is about. I would love to see the dorms upgraded some though.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy being a part of a Christian college. No matter your belief system it is great to feel safe and secure at school and know that there are people rooting for you no matter what. There isn’t a party scene that I am familiar with and it is very relaxed. The education I am receiving is satisfactory and the social life I’m building is great as well. The food is not great but there are many other options besides the main food source. Overall, it is a great place to receive a Christian Education."
Junior,5,"This is a private Christian University. If you are a Christian and really want your faith in God to enhance, please at least visit this school. Before I transferred to ONU, I attended a very nonreligious institution where I was  discriminated against by my religion. I had to speak daily on behalf of my fellow brothers and sister in Christ and religion itself. I also had to create my own gospel choir as an encouragement for me to stay strong in faith due to the discrimination. Now that I have prospered to better things, I believe ONU is best for anyone who wants to be around other Christians who worships the same God as they and fellowship.  Please consider ONU!"
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the community that you get from living on campus. The classes are a good size to the point where you can develop a relationship with the professor. You are more than someone paying tuition at Olivet.
Senior,5,Overall I love ONU. The beautiful campus and the people here are what I fell in love with first. I continue to be impressed. I enjoy the unique opportunities I'm offered to learn in my field.
Senior,5,It’s a small campus and has a small population so you can really get to know your peers and professors on a personal level!
Sophomore,5,"I liked most of the rules that Olivet had. The one rule I did not like was that I could not wear shorts to class, I do understand that it is teaching me to dress more professional however on those 90 degree days I wanted to wear shorts. I understand that I am an adult but at the same time I loved that someone cared about what time I was coming in at night and checked in on me every night. It was also really nice to have a curfew because it kept me from staying out late on school nights, I need my sleep. I also loved going to chapel and listening to what the speakers had to say. Although with chapel I loved having classes that were taught from a Christian perspective. My overall year was a really good year."
Junior,5,I recently went to Olivet for a campus visit and instantly fell in love with the campus. The staff was exceptionally polite and helpful with any questions. As well as answering questions you did not know you should be asking.
Freshman,5,"Olivet is a great University and I would highly recommend going there, they are a smaller school so it makes you as the student feel more important."
Alum,5,It is a wonderful Christian environment.  The staff and faculty truly care about students.  Nice campus and the facilities have really improved.
Freshman,5,"Olivet Nazarene University has such a home feeling, the staff at ONU makes sure that you have everything you need and are ready to start classes and are helpful throughout everything. The professors at ONU give you the education you need to be successful in your life.  ONU has a beautiful campus and they provide a variety of different things to do to keep you busy in your free time."
Sophomore,5,"I love the culture. Students are so kind and genuine, professors are caring and intentional, and God is so so present."
Freshman,5,"Olivet is a place where anyone can find something that makes them feel they belong. The emphasis on “education with a Christian purpose” is not a hoax. The staff and professors pour into each student if given the opportunity and help them achieve their overall best. The campus is gorgeous, and the community is one of a kind. Everywhere you go people engage you in greetings, hold the doors for you, and fill the atmosphere with joy! If you’re looking for a Christian community to take part in, or even if you aren’t, Olivet is the place to root yourself."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment and the way that most people are just accepting of others especially freshman.
Senior,5,The professors truly invest in their students.  The small class sizes allows you to form close relationships with your peers and professors.  The quality of the food is steadily improving.  The residence halls and apartments are comfortable for living in.
Niche User,5,"It's a awesome place, and everyone is friendly. The staff are quite helpful and they really put students first"
Niche User,5,"My experience at ONU was very positive.  I appreciated the individual attention that I received from faculty/staff, coaches and stud

d in the cafeteria was good and the academic and athletic facilities are very nice! Small class
The president of the university is seen around campus, very hands-on and genuinely cares about the students."
Freshman,5,"Olivet Nazarene University has a friendly, Christ centered community that allows for personal relationships and amazing academic opportunities. Due to small class sizes, invested, intentional professors, and a number of one on one student and faculty opportunities, students have the ability to form personal relationships with professors. Various internship opportunities and hands on experience in the class room can also benefit students when it comes to networking and increase their chances of landing their desired job in the future. Although the area around the University is somewhat limited, the campus is located only an hour away from the bustling city of Chicago. Additionally, there are a number of ways to get involved on campus including hundreds of clubs, intramural sports, and several on campus events. Being a freshman here at Olivet, I can say that the atmosphere and people have made my transition from home to college much less painful."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful school if you are looking for a personal education with a Christ-centered mission. The professors are highly qualified and very invested in the students. Olivet has many connections so it seems like many graduates have jobs lined about by the end of their senior year. Overall a great community that helps you grow as an individual spiritually and intellectually.
Sophomore,5,Olivet Nazarene is a fantastic college that is close to God. The staff at Olivet truly believes that each and every student belongs here. The small campus is well maintained and beautiful year round. Academics challenge the student in all the right ways for maximum learning. There are many clubs available and Olivet has an amazing community of people.
Senior,5,"I love Olivet because it is such a close-knit community that feels like home. Though many of the rules are very strict, I find comfort that I am with people with similar values than me. I have meet some of my closest friends at Olivet."
Niche User,5,"I have stayed on this campus for the NTS camp event 3 times. its a beautiful school and i hope to attend in 2 years, all the staff are nice and helpful, this has been my dream college since the 6th grade"
Alum,5,"My time at Olivet prepared me academically, professionally, and spiritually to find success in the workplace and in life. It's important to choose a university that won't let you get lost in the crowd, and I am so thankful for the investment of my professors in me personally and academically. The friends I made, the organizations I was involved in, and the experiences I had have shaped me in ways I never even knew I could hope for. I'll always be a proud alum and so grateful for the university."
Alum,5,"What an incredible place. I majored in Business Administration and enjoyed my studies. However, it was the balance of extracurricular activities, Christian programming and events, and safe spaces to have fun, all in close proximity to Chicago, that made Olivet Nazarene such a great experience. There is a clear design of faith formation built into every class that I took there and the professors brought a great wealth of knowledge and experience of being Christians in the workplace. I am proud to call myself an alumnus of ONU."
Alum,5,"I went to Olivet and loved it. Great education and great professors. I know have a great career, and credit my success to the university. Beautiful campus too."
Niche User,5,"I’m in love with the Olivet Nazarene campus and atmosphere. The professors really get to know you, and they are there to help you."
Junior,5,"I love the close-knit community at Olivet. The school is very small, so its easy to get to know your classmates, dorm-mates, and professors. I have become very close with some of my interior design professors, even going over to their home for dinner as a class (all 8 of us), or going out to breakfast at a favorite diner. I also love the way Olivet encourages me in my faith."
Sophomore,5,"Olivet Nazarene is an excellent school. They have wonderful Dr.'s and professors that are willing to go the extra mile for any student. Olivet Nazarene has excellent athletics that are very fun to watch and enjoy. Student life is all over the campus. Their are so many clubs and activities to do, you will never worry about being bored!"
Senior,5,They have an awesome environment if you are looking for a small Christian college. It is easy to find awesome people who you can make lasting friendships with. Most professors want to invest in you and see you succeed.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Olivet! If I could see one thing changed it would probably be more diversity as it is a predominantly white college.
Junior,5,Olivet is has a great community that makes you feel at home within minutes of entering campus. Professors are professional but also caring and strive to see you succeed in their courses. There is a vivid campus life that is booming with activity for much of the year. There is endless support for you at Olivet and everyone seem to be rooting for you and your success.
Junior,5,"Olivet is a fun, caring university that creates a fantastic atmosphere all around campus. People here care and go out of their way to create relationships with you. Olivet gives you an education with a Christian purpose. There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus outside of class. Intramurals happen year-round and are competitive and fun. Olivet puts on all-school parties/events during syllabus week and around holidays with free food and games. Olivet really caters to freshmen to make sure they have a great experience and feel like they belong. There are always plenty of jobs on and off campus as there is a pretty large community around campus. Every room comes with a Tempur-Pedic bed, making it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. High ceilings for bunking beds to create more room. After freshman year, you have an option to live off-campus in an apartment.  All rent is included in the room and board fees. All laundry is free on and off campus."
Freshman,5,ONU is such a great university. There are so many nice people here. The campus is beautiful and there are so many events to be part of here.
Niche User,5,I loved the friendly environment and the people in it. I would definitely recommend going to Olivet.
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere here at Olivet, everyone is always really friendly. I have made lots of friends through playing soccer and classes. The food quality could be a little better but it is still good. All of the professors are great and try to incorporate God into classes."
Sophomore,5,"Olivet has provided me with many different opportunities and I am valued, wanted, and invested in as a student."
Freshman,5,"I felt like Olivet was a home away from home. I met a ton of new and friendly people. My dorm was good and friendly, plus it was easy to the new adjust. I got a quality education inside and outside the classroom. It is not a party school, so I am able to focus. There is a lot of events for students and things to do in the city. This place has really encouraged and help me grow in my faith. I would recommend going here if you want to attend a small school and to learn more about faith."
Graduate Student,5,Olivet Nazarene University is a wonderful place to get your degree. The professors are dedicated and caring and want to see students succeed. The campus is peaceful but also filled with many activities of different interest.
Junior,5,"I liked how nice and knowledgeable to students and teachers were who were helping me when I visited. They have many opportunities available there for different people with different interests. I respect the fact that they learn with a Christian purpose and how there are different speakers who come to the chapel to talk to the students in a mandatory 15-minute, 2-day a week meeting. The campus layout is large, but easy to follow for the most part, and the architecture is superb and has a lot of character. I am planning on staying in the upperclassman girl's dorm and most campuses do not have this option. The school is very diverse with several people from many backgrounds as well."
Freshman,5,I love the professors and programs. The people are all extremely nice and professors are helpful and understanding. The are many programs to ensure student success with academics. The Christian aspect is very amazing.
Freshman,5,Olivet is so much better than I could have ever dreamed. I’ve recieved a Christ centered education and have made incredible friends and memories.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and the amount of activities that you can join!! The academic programs are top notch and they offer well rounded curriculums for each major.
Niche User,5,"Everyone is so helpful and concerned about one another. We enjoy every time we are on campus. Even though, we don't have any family that went to ONU, we are involved in the university in one way or another. If it's going to church on campus, going to turkey tournaments, football games, or bears camp.I cannot wait to start my journey at ONU."
Alum,5,"I attended Olivet from Fall 2013 to Spring 2017. The school reached out to me, offering a wonderful scholarship that allowed me to pay the high tuition. I am glad I attended and made wonderful friends.
I was originally an English Education Major, but ultimately graduated with an English degree. The English department was amazing . You can tell that the professors are dedicated and enjoy their work. I loved my lit courses, especially Literary theory.
I liked the education school and the professors. However, I often felt that the Secondary education majors were put on the back burner. Secondary was obviously not a priority. This was a common complaint."
Senior,5,I got enrolled to the pre-absn program at Olivet Nazarene University. The professors are really good. They give a lot of feedback on one's progress in course. The materials for studying are truly detailed and interesting. The lectures on power point are representative of what would be asked on the exams and tests.
Freshman,5,Olivet Nazarene University is a wonderful place to be. The university not only facilitates academic growth with their rigorous programs but social and spiritual growth as well. You will find the campus and people quite warm and welcoming. ONU will become your home away from home and the family you never knew you needed.
Freshman,5,So far the staff at Olivet Nazarene University have been so helpful during this process. I have found that everyone is really caring and willing to help you.
Freshman,5,I visited Olivet Nazarene University and instantly fell in love with it! I loved how the environment and staff members there made me feel welcomed and right at home. The professors truly care about your success and will aide you if you are struggling. Professors and staff members are not only helping you grow at Olivet but also your future and career outside of Olivet. I loved how the environment is God based and it is so easy to make friends there on campus.
Freshman,5,I love all of my classes. The professors are fantastic and truly take the time to make sure you that you understand the material.
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. I'm a sophomore and everything seemed right from the beginning. The environment is safe and I feel free. The people are so friendly and loving. The campus is beautiful. There are many food spots around, and food is awesome! Also, the professors are amazing! I love love love it!"
Freshman,5,"I love this school, it centers around Christ and has such a welcoming environment. There are so many events that give opportunities to meet all kinds of people and make friends."
Sophomore,5,Olivet is a wonderful school. It has a beautiful campus and the christian education is unmatched. I am very happy with my decision to come here and pursue my degree in Social Work.
Sophomore,5,"I am an International Student here at Olivet, and there is no place I would rather be. I have had profs helping me and my friends till past midnight, that is a rarity. I think you get a lot more than just a diploma here, it get to grow as a person. Lots of options for housing, there are like 6-7 off campus apartment complexes that cost no more than dorms, and then there are also dorm options for upperclassmen."
Senior,5,"I loved my experience at Olivet. It is a great school that provides incredible opportunities. Just like any school, your experience is what you make it."
Junior,5,I really enjoy being a part of these campus and so glad I am able to receive an education with a Christian purpose!
Freshman,4,"I take hybrid courses due to COVID-19. Otherwise, I would normally be fully face-to-face, just because that's what I prefer. The lecture videos that I have to watch for class don't always load correctly, which is the only reason why I didn't give this a full 5 stars."
Freshman,4,"The school is really great! The teachers are really nice, they will help you when they see you need it. The staff is great all in all. The food could use some work though. It's not that great besides the fries or burgers. It's also a really safe school (obviously since it is a Christian private school). The dorms are okay, you meet a lot of new people; make a lot of new friends. But the dorms are kinda small. The programs and degrees they have here are okay. The school is also very preppy with its events held every year (not all events are in place due to covid). It could be kind of stressing sometimes but overall a solid school 4/5."
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience went well for it happening so sudden.  It was a difficult transition but the professors did a good job trying to make the transition smooth.
Sophomore,4,The professors and staff are great at Olivet. They really care for their students and want them to succeed. There are many ways to get involved at Olivet and the community through sports and clubs.
Junior,4,The Education there is very good in my opinion. The community of the school is one of the better ones. There are a lot of rules and weird things about Olivet but overall it's the best school that I've been to.
Junior,4,It was stressful and difficult at the beginning but once I got into a routine it all worked out. I think the profs did the best that they could in the given time they had to make plans for online.
Freshman,4,"Olivet Nazarene University has an amazing community with a deep education that challenges students in their everyday learning as well as their own belief system. The staff and faculty are extremely welcoming and well taught, and the campus is well taken care of."
Freshman,4,"Olivet Nazarene University is a great school full of amazing students. It has a gorgeous campus and an awesome community. The professors are very kind and thoughtful, and they make sure they get to know each student individually while helping each one succeed. While the rules may be strict at ONU, it is easy to find ways to have fun and express yourself amongst your peers. It is a great place to meet new friends, build relationships, and strengthen your relationship with God."
Freshman,4,"Overall good. Very welcoming, quiet campus. You don't have to pay for laundry and the beds in dorms are temperpedics. Renovations could and should be done to bathrooms."
Freshman,4,"Awesome school and people, and is very close to the city of Chicago! Stuff to do on campus like the rec center and sporting events."
Freshman,4,"I love the academic scene . The part I would change is to make chapel optional . I don't have a dorm I commute every day, but I have heard the dorms are nice and when I hangout in them they seem nice. They offer a lot in scholarships to good students.  There are so many things to do on campus you don't have the time to try them all."
Senior,4,"I give it four stars because I loved the art department and all the faculty there. I grew so much as an artist and learned valuable techniques. 
Besides the art department, the university as a whole is just average and some might say below average. The living spaces, food, and events aren't great."
Senior,4,"Olivet Nazarene University has the small-campus environment. The dietetic program at Olivet is wonderful and the faculty spend much time preparing students for a career. However, I would like to see more diversity on Olivet's campus."
Junior,4,Even though it is a Christian school I would like to see the rules be changed a bit as progression in our world and generations are continually changing. This campus has helped me develop myself in more ways than I can think of. I have met amazing people that I will have in my life forever and has helped me develop the work ethic I have now
Sophomore,4,"Olivet has been a pretty great experience for me. The professors are very friendly and are always willing to help me. The environment is really great as well. However, our cafeteria food, Sodexo, sucks."
Senior,4,I am a senior this year at Olivet Nazarene University. My past experience at Olivet have been great! The students and staff are respectful and nice and everyone respects each others religion. I never felt out of place and the campus is a safe and comfortable place.
Junior,4,I have made lifelong friends at Olivet and received an amazing education. the rules are a little rough but they're nothing you can't have fun with still.
Junior,4,"I have been taking pre-reqs to attend their ABSN program. The online accelerated format is great for working adults to gain education in a quick pace without having to interrupt their working life to get to a classroom. The only downside that I have found is communication between the student and university and professors can be difficult at times. Many online professors offer phone contact information, but some do not. Additionally, in the year I have been enrolled my advisor has changed 3 times. Fortunately I was diligent in checking in on all of my course requirements as I managed to catch a missing course before I was disqualified for the ABSN cohort. The university did admit they made an error and provide financial support. Lastly, there are many hidden course fees in the way of lab materials and books that are not discovered until the class begins. Overall the education has been good just with periods of frustration, but that is life after all."
Freshman,4,"I love going here because I have one on ones with my professors, and everyone on campus are friendly. I just wish wish we didn't always have to go to chapel."
Sophomore,4,"Olivet Nazarene University is a wonderful school to attend. The faculty, staff, and students are very respectful and friendly. The local area is alright, it has some activities for students to do on the weekend, and it has a lot of restaurants. I just prefer my own hometown since we are bigger and we have a lot more to do."
Freshman,4,"Most professors rely too much on technology. I prefer to do more paper work and individual projects. Some professors get side tracked with stories and get off track, resulting in confusion of topics. However,  the professors are extremely caring and friendly. Most do a terrific job with handling classes and questions, also with expressing the material covered in class sessions. I love my college so far."
Sophomore,4,"I have been at Olivet Nazarene University for a year and a half now. There are many great things about this university. My favorite things about Olivet include the Bible-based education I have received, the ministry and mission trip opportunities, and the intramurals. Intramurals and the ministry opportunities have been great ways to connect with other students on campus and make new friends. The food is not the greatest which is one thing I would change. I would also make the hours longer, especially for dinner over the weekends. The professors I have had thus far have been wonderful. They care deeply about our learning and help when I have had questions."
Junior,4,"Overall, Olivet Nazarene University has helped me grow as a student and a person in many ways. I am an athlete on campus and also involved in several clubs on campus. Throughout my time here, I have realized that because of the involvement ONU has offered me, I have faced many challenges. However, those challenges have helped me to become the person I am today. In general, I believe that ONU is a school that invests in the students who attend in a real-life and applicable manner."
Junior,4,"It has the great academic program here. The professors are very friendly and good. They explain lectures very well.  However, the college experiment is too serious. The classes sometimes very hard. There is not much fun to enjoy here."
Senior,4,"As a current student in ONU, I am taking classes in regards to my Biology major in order to advance myself in medical school after my undergraduate studies. On the side of that, I have become more aware about getting more involved with my college, and I decided to be a part of the marching band of that college called the Marching Tigers."
Sophomore,4,I came to this school for the education not for the religious side of things which is heavily enforced.
Senior,4,The professors are very well versed in there area of teaching and they make every effort to help students understand the material.
Senior,4,Olivet Nazarene University is a great medium-sized school with plenty of resources and excellent instruction.
Graduate Student,4,As a current graduate student I feel like the program fits to my current needs. I am able to continue working part time while still being enrolled full time. This program requires a lot of dedication outside of the classroom but being able to manage my own schedule makes everything possible for me. The communication with professors and advisors has been great from the beginning.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Olivet has been great! I really enjoy the athletics programs! Football, in particular, has brought me great mentors, coaches, and friends. The teachers care about the students and everyone is united to impact the world in a Christ-like manner."
Freshman,4,I love the close-knit community that Olivet offers. I wish food allergy accommodations were improved.
Freshman,4,"Olivet is great! It's a very safe place to be, and the campus area has a pretty good variety of things."
Senior,4,"Going to a Nazarene University and being a member of the Nazarene church myself, I have many positive things to say about this university. I have felt my spiritual life blossom and grow while in fellowship with my classmates. My professors do devotions and prayer requests before class, and if I'm struggling with a personal issue or request, they are willing to talk during office hours.
 The academic aspect of the school is incredible as well. My particular major here at the university is Mechanical Engineering, and I am testing my mathematical skills more than I thought I would every day. I am being challenged, but I believe that it will also be worth it in the end."
Senior,4,Olivet Nazarene University is inviting to all people. The campus is small and students and faculty are friendly. There are plenty of activities and things to help you becoming involved in student life. I was a commuter and the staff was very accommodating and the school even provided a lounge area and an optional morning meeting to meet other commuters and enjoy some breakfast snacks. The academics are outstanding and the teachers really take the time to get to know you.
Niche User,4,"Olivet feels like home as soon as you step on the beautiful campus. The workers that I met while there were extremely polite and ready to perform their work to its fullest potential. The dorms, the Williams dorm in particular, are in need of a little bit of home improvement, but all of the other buildings have beautiful exteriors as well as a homey interior. I was very impressed with the campus's upkeep and beauty, and I look forward to returning soon."
Sophomore,4,"I like that Olivet creates a sense of community among the campus. The professors and staff are very dedicated to their work and are always willing to put others first. One thing I would like to see change is the dress code or the ""open dorm"" rules. In my opinion, Olivet, although private, is still a college. The students should be able to wear (modest) shorts and hang out with the other gender whenever they please."
Senior,4,"Olivet is an extremely nice environment, and everyone associated with Olivet is there to help you prepare for the future, as well as educate you with a Christian purpose."
Sophomore,4,"Olivet is a great place, but it's true that it's not for everyone. There are a lot of rules so the whole ""free range"" college experience doesn't really apply here. But if you're looking for a great community of Christian believers at a reasonable price with great academics, then consider Olivet!"
Junior,4,Olivet had such a positive impact in my life!  They encouraged me to grow deeper in my walk with Christ as well as challenged me academically.
Freshman,4,"I have loved the environment at this school. Most people seem extremely genuine and authentic. Moreover, from an academic standpoint, the professors are excellent and I couldn't ask for anyone more devoted to providing an excellent educatioin."
Junior,4,"Olivet has a great Christian community. The surrounding area is kind of sparse in regards to entertainment and restaurants but there is still plenty to do and see if you get a little creative. The campus provides a lot of stuff for students to do. The housing is pretty nice if not a little small. The food is mediocre but there are a lot of options and flexibility. The professors are invested in the students. There is more diversity than in previous years, but there still isn't a lot. There are a lot of sports teams, but there isn't great student enthusiasm for them. We have chapel twice a week which i enjoy. Some people don't like having chapel. There are a lot of ministries and clubs that you can get involved in. I really like this school, but there is a curfew and a dress code which doesn't sit well with some people. I recommend Olivet for the somewhat conservative Christian. I like the size. It's small but not too small. And ONU is pretty good about giving out financial aid."
Freshman,4,"So far I am really enjoying it. I would like it better if I hadn't overloaded myself with 18 credit hours and 13 classes total because it definitely takes a lot of time management. The only thing I would say that could be better is that a couple of the majors such as music (which is my major) has credits that you can choose for 0 credits. I have a friend who technically has 18 credits but if you counted up all the classes she decided not to count, she was at 23."
College Freshman,4,"Although the classes were a bit bigger than I expected, they are still great and I am not just a number to the professrors. There are many courses offered, and all the profs definitely enjoy the subject they teach, and they love the school they teach at."
College Freshman,4,"The dorm buildings are pretty old, and they don't have elevators. But the ACs work great, and all the furniture is lovely. I think the closeness of all the girls on my floor is wonderful, and I really love my RA. The RD is amazing too. Overall it's great for living."
College Freshman,4,"I really love Olivet Nazarene University. Everyone makes sure it becomes your home away from home. The food is okay, better than some school food, and the academics are great. All the students are like a big family and it is just a wonderful environment to be in. The Christian aspect of the school is so wonderful, in my opinion, as we all can grow academically and spiritually. The Chaplin is great, profs pray before class starts, and overall it just is so refreshing to be here and be enjoying my time here even when I'm so far from home."
College Junior,4,I think I'll be able to get a good job
College Junior,4,"I love going to all of the sporting events. However our football team is so awful, its unenjoyable."
College Sophomore,4,"I love how there's a Christian, but more importantly God-loving environment and the classes are great and really get you into your intended major"
College Sophomore,4,All RA's should enforce each rule in handbook
College Freshman,4,Internships are amazing. There is a building at the school that will help you find an internship.
College Freshman,4,Safety is important in this school. There is lots of security all around the school.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is amazing, I love meeting new people."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of involvement in athletics at Olivet.  Majority of students on campus are involved somehow.  If the student isn't involved in varsity sports, they are more likely than not involved in intramurals.  The varsity sports are very competitive and rank high in Olivet's division.  All of the sporting events are very well attended and the spectators are very into the game.  I would say Olivet has a lot of school spirit.  The facilities are fairly new and well taken care of."
College Sophomore,4,I still havent involved myself on internships but I've heard that it's great and the staff there is very supportive and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,Choosing Olivet has been a great experience for me especially being surrounded by people who share the same faith as me.
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe on campus and never heard of anything happen to any of the student on campus. There's always usually a good amount of staff on campus and public safety.
College Sophomore,4,The building always look clean and well taken care of.
College Sophomore,4,Everybody has good sportsmanship. People either on games or practices work as a team.
College Sophomore,4,I like the environment in which this school portrays. It feels nice and welcoming. The staff and professors at Olivet Nazarene University are very supportive and great at what they do.
College Sophomore,4,"Again, this school is much better for you if you're not queer as a three dollar bill.  I like it, and it has helped me grow in my faith, but the school does not support me as a queer Christian.  Apart from the cost, everything else is great."
Sophomore,2,"When you first arrive on campus, there are many get-togethers to make you feel like you made the right choice. After the first few weeks, the campus gets dry as students begin to start leaving most weekends to go back to their families. There is a curfew on campus and only certain days/hours when a girl can enter your room (monitored). There are nightly checks at each dorm room to make sure this isn't violated.

Olivet Nazarene University is a religious school, and when I say religious, I mean religious! Most classes are started with devotions and prayer and you are required to attend 2 chapel services a week. If you exceed a certain amount of skips, because they do take attendance, they will start fining you $25 per skip, so be on time to those morning services. Most of the student organizations on campus are religious-oriented.

If you here for a quality education or love the religion, you can find it here. For any partying or ""real college experience"" find elsewhere."
Junior,2,"In all honesty this institution may seem good at first, but is bogged down by multiple problems. If you aren't a sports or a nurse person this is probably not the place for you, especially for engineers you can get much better for cheesier. Olivet doesn't really excel in any area and feels more so average in every area of study except Theology and has a heavily enforced religious atmosphere. There have been several controversies regarding non-religious issues and people being expelled there is also a fine enforced chapel every week. Administration is often slow, ineffective, and barely cooperates with student groups. Students are unaware of how local communities feel about the campus, and are entitled. Diversity isn't a priority and is mininal. Any activities are usually student lead with administration only pitching in merchandise to sell for over-priced prices. Don't come here unless you're a nurse or athlete and really want a (barely) Christian based education setting"
Freshman,2,"No greek life, dorm life is not great,  no microwaves allowed. Professors are good, not a partying school =("
Sophomore,2,"Having been in their ABSN program in Oakbrook, this is a terrible place to attend nursin school. They are liars and chest their students for money. Making money is their only priority and they use Christian name for it. Do not come to this here if you really want to be a nurse. You will suffer a lot."
Sophomore,2,"Being a Student in their Oakbrook ABSN program, I have to say it one of the worst nursing programs. I am not a cry baby to go post on yelp to complain but rather someone who saw many of my classmates struggle under their treacherous and unprofessional professors. Their professor spend most time complaining, gossiping about students, finding problems in them  that doesn't exist, and making them run in loops to have questions unanswered. They spend very little time teaching and guiding their students. They are always finding a reason to blame their students for this and that. Such a waste of time and money. I would have transferred out of this program if I knew this was such a terrible school at the beginning. Now I cannot because their credits wont transfer to another program as I am done with my first semester. 

Do not come here if you really love nursing. By the time you are done you will hate Christianity and nursing.  I hate every minute of my time here"
Freshman,2,"Olivet is a great university for those seeking a strict judgmental campus. You have more freedom at home. I totally love the christian campus, but you have a curfew, dress code, many rules in the dorms, etc. Student life sucks very few clubs and opportunities."
College Junior,2,"I really wish that ONU participated in fraternities and sororities. I think it would give students a feeling of ""togetherness"" it is super unfortunate that we don't have that. The RA's in the dorms try to make it seem like the girls on the floor were in a little group which is kind of like a sorority!"
College Freshman,2,The proximity of the class is the one of the good things about this school doesn't take a long walk to reach your class. The dorm life sucks curfew at 11.
College Freshman,2,The football games suck. Not many people have school spirit.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a great deal of social pressure to identify as Christian, and professors assume everyone is a Christian even if you tell them you aren't. If you are atheist, LGBT, or non-white, you'll be at worst condescended to and at best ignored. The administration cares more about their conservative donor base than the needs of students. Lots of really pointless rules and naive RAs. My worst experience was when I came home to find my dorm room door was locked and entire dorm room was being searched by my RA and RD... because the RA smelled ""smoke"" on my roommate (she had just come from a bonfire). The only people who think Olivet is an ""accepting environment"" are the ones who already fit the mold."
College Freshman,2,"Olivet is lacking in diversity leading to more close minded and stuck up students. The academics are not nearly as good/competitive as my public HS which says a lot. The campus is quite clean and safe, but that's because there is nothing to do on campus due to the stifling rules. I was definitely disappointed with my experience."
College Junior,2,"Not much ethnic or racial diversity. Anyone who thinks differently gets sort of singled out and made to feel like they are doing something wrong or un Christian because they don't fall into the ""Nazerene"" label."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone here is really nice, but it's not the place to go for the ""college experience."" It doesn't feel like you're being independent because of all the rules..also it gets boring in my opinion as the surrounding area sucks. The profs are nice but the academics are SUPER easy"
College Freshman,2,"They have lots of rules that tend to vary in enforcement from letting it slide, to being very strict."
College Junior,2,"The party scene is nowhere to be found. Basically, you make your own fun. Thankfully, my friends and I would make dinner, bake, and we would watch movies to pass the time by."
College Sophomore,2,we don't have greek life
College Senior,2,School is not located near busy area
College Junior,2,"If something goes wrong, it can be super stressful."
College Junior,2,"The campus has its strength in its facilities, but it also has its weaknesses. The music building is atrocious. So are the dorms and Grand apartments."
College Senior,2,I literally want to cry all the time just thinking about it.
College Senior,2,"Not really worth it. Considering cots of school already, definitely not worth it"
College Senior,2,"They kind of hate us. But many students are pretentious, little dirt bags. Don't blame them for hating us"
College Junior,2,Winter of 2013 into Spring 2014. Nuff said.
College Junior,2,There is not much to do besides hang with friends/teammates.
College Senior,2,I would have thought the more southern parts of Illinois (BOURBONAIS) would be friendlier than people in Chicago.
College Sophomore,2,There could be improvement in the wireless access and make it less of a hassle to connect at the beginning of the year.
College Sophomore,2,"The teams are not that good, especially football"
College Sophomore,2,"Basically always winter, except one month of fall and one month of spring."
College Junior,2,"From all apartments that are available through ONU you can walk, but otherwise a car is very handy."
College Junior,2,"If you are looking to live off campus, you should reconsider just living in campus apartments."
College Junior,2,"Nobody ever does anything. The campus is kind of dead at night. But that's ok, because I love Netflix."
College Junior,2,"Most of the time there's not a lot of options to choose from or nothing is available. If there were, it would probably be out of my price range anyway."
College Junior,2,"There really is no ""night life."" This isn't a state school so there are no crazy parties or bars or anything like that. The ""night life"" to me is being at an event on campus, being at my apartment with my roommates, or maybe going to dinner or bowling with friends."
College Junior,2,"Bourbonnais is a very small town with not much to do. The most interesting things to probably do would be to go bowling or go miniature golfing. When it is nice out the Kankakee River State park is not too far, so that's a different option to choose from."
College Junior,2,Spots fill up really quick. People who don't have the specific stickers park in the wrong areas and it's very inconvenient and annoying. There should be more places to park.
College Freshman,2,ONU does not really have a nightlife...
College Sophomore,2,Because of the strictness of the school we have curfews and would get kicked out if we went to a bar or club.  There are not many restaurants open at night either.
College Freshman,2,"there is no greek living, we are a christian university."
College Freshman,2,"Any gay people here will most likely not be open about it, and there are few students who are not white or black."
College Sophomore,2,Sodexo dining is probably the worst part about Olivet. Sandwich line is alright but as far as the main line goes it is usually pretty nasty.
College Sophomore,2,I'm worried about getting attacked by my enemies.
College Sophomore,2,It's different from most schools. It's too strict!
College Sophomore,2,The guys parking and girls parking are separated.
College Freshman,2,Most apartments are far away and take about an hour to get to campus.
College Sophomore,2, noone goes to bars
College Sophomore,2,we have one main dining hall that is open 3 times a day for short periods of time which i always miss for class. the food is terrible. we have 2 restraunts on campus that you can use flex dollars at. 
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people I know say that it's bad. I, personally, am satisfied with the meals our food service provides. They do have options for salads and occasionally a veggie burger or something for Vegetarians and Vegans. However they do have a lot of chicken. They serve cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, pizza, salad, cereal, bread and stir fry every day and for both lunch and dinner Monday through Saturday. "
College Sophomore,2,They guy/girl visitation in living areas are extremely strict with scheduled days and times in which they can visit.  It prevents social lives.  
College Freshman,2,there is not much diversity but it is getting better.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, it can be difficult to get around."
College Freshman,2,"I love the school however, theres not much to do."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Overall, one should be of similar mindset to the typical Olivet student if they are going to feel ""at home"" there. While the school is making strides toward a diverse student body, it fails to equally embrace diversity of thought. Being a private Christian institution however, Olivet reserves that right. Prospective students should make sure that Olivet fits them, in particular their personality, and socio-political outlook. A relatively liberal city kid isn't necessarily going to thrive at Olivet, and depending on his or her area of study may not extract what Olivet does have to offer. On that note, Olivet does have one major thing going for it. The vast majority of its professors are of profound quality. No gripes there. They are always willing to see students, and will match any student's enthusiasm. Your effort is their effort. Moving forward, the grounds are small, and there is little to do on or off campus, even without the strictly-enforced curfews. It's a relatively boring four year life. All in all, Olivet is actually a great school, it's just not great for everyone. If your Christianity means the world to you, and you are generally a traditionalist in terms of mindset, you'll love it. If you question the status quo, dislike forced chapel attendance twice each week, and value intellectual freedom, Olivet is likely not for you. "
College Junior,2,When its cold its to far to walk. I would be nice if they had trolleys in the cold
College Sophomore,2,"Ethnically speaking, much of the student body is white, and while there is some diversity, there is not much. Economic background is also limited, as Olivet has a higher price tag, being a private school. Political beliefs are all across the board, and religion is also varied to a degree."
College Junior,2,"It's Olivet. Unless you go to the school sponsored events, there isn't a lot of stuff going on. I like it because I'm not big on partying or generally straying outside my small group of friends, but when I do, there's still some things you can do. Like joining one of the clubs for thier activities or getting coffee, or even just meeting up with your friends for a fun night in."
College Sophomore,2,ugh .... flavorless.  Wish they had more healthy options
College Freshman,2,Weather is not a big problem at Olivet unless it rains a lot because the roads and parking lots are uneven so flooding tends to happen after long rain periods
College Freshman,2,"The campus is in Illinois. The temperature often reaches both extremes in this part of the country, but the school year takes place mostly during winter, which can be very cold. Fortuanately, classes aren't very far away from dorms, so you should be alright with a good winter coat and gloves."
College Sophomore,2,"There is some diversity but most of the people are white. Our campus does get bonus points, in my opinion, for taking the time to address and encourage diversity on a regular basis."
College Sophomore,2,ONU is a smaller campus so having to park on the opposite end of campus is a hassle it's probably a shorter walk than students at other schools have to do. Its about a 5-7 minute walk to get to my car. On the plus side parking is free for all students even freshman.
Freshman,1,"This place is terrible. You are treated like a child because of strict curfews, room checks, and only being allowed to have the opposite sex in your dorm once a week. Church is mandatory twice a week, and if you miss more than 3 times you get fined. Most of the professors have strict attendance rules and will even go so far as to lower your grade an entire letter if you miss more than a couple classes. Being sick is not considered a valid excuse for missing. There is no freedom here, and even some blatant sexism and homophobia, and even the occasional racist remark. A lot of people here are only fake nice. Only go here if you are a straight white Christian who enjoys being oppressed."
Sophomore,1,"During the second week of classes, a construction truck totaled my vehicle. My body was in horrendous pain, and I notified all my professors immediately. After missing only two days of class they all became relentless and cruel, despite the fact that I was keeping up with studying and coursework while being admitted to the hospital on numerous occasions for my injuries. I was forced to drop two of my classes - I received no empathy or help from anyone. Biology professor Derek Rosenberger intentionally gave me the wrong office location so I could not get his signature to drop the lab class. When I eventually found his office, he ridiculed me, and wanted a ""good reason"" for him to sign my sheet. Overall, my experience with the students and staff were disgusting, and despite claiming to be strict ""Christians"" - they had no morals or compassion. Simply disgusting people. Hope my experience gives you insight on their mentalities."
Alum,1,Please think twice before sending a child here.  They claim to be a Christian University but the office is full of liars and fakes. They screwed me over pretty good. Just think twice and learn from my mistake.
College Freshman,1,We don't have it at all. I don't see why this is important for college...
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life and I'm not too upset by it.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life. I think.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at this school. The closest thing to Greek life here might be the Bible studies.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This campus doesn't know how to hold an event that doesn't revolve around religion. Feels like everything is either a worship service or Bible study even when it's supposed to be for fun. The only party we have here is ""Party with Jesus""... enough said."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No parties, or hanging out with the opposite sex outside of designated times or areas. 11pm curfew"
Recent Alumnus,1,"When they say this campus is ""diverse"" they mean that there are all different types of white, Protestant Christian denominations represented here! It's among the worst when it comes to racial diversity (blacks have a much lower graduation rate than whites). If you are LGBT you better keep quiet because if you come out, people will not want to be your roommate and they will tell you you don't belong at Olivet."
College Junior,1,We do not have this on our campus!
College Senior,1,"Do not go to the BSN program. It has a 60% fail rate.  It requires writing 30 research pages a week, studying 15 Chapters, doing clinical days and several exams every week. It is unnecessary and does not result in good nursing board pass rates."
College Senior,1,"Do not go to their BSN program. Plan to write 30 pages of papers for class, read 15 chapters, and take 3 exams in one week. It is unnecessary killer and the nursing board pass rates are lower than a community college associate degree program. It is not necessary to kill the students. There is no consideration for our lives. A grade of 77 fails the course. Failure rate is over 60%.  Do not do it to yourself."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life.
College Junior,1,There are no such things as parties at Olivet. I wish there was so we could have a real college experience.
College Junior,1,The school needs to back off and treat us like the adults we are. We should not be treated as though we are never going to make mistakes. Having as many rules as Olivet only makes students want to rebel and break the rules out of defiance. They are condemning and rude about what we are allowed and not allowed to do. It is not providing a positive Christ-like environment. They are judgmental and very fake. Olivet is not setting us up for the real world and makes us live fairytale lives while on campus. I am repulsed on how they treat some people who break the rules. There needs to be more grace and understanding.
College Junior,1,"It is horrid. They pick on the poor and make them fill out unnecessary forms with information that they have access to themselves. It makes them fill horrible. My friend described dealing with the financial office as "" I rather get by teeth pulled out without anesthesia than deal with financial aid."""
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life on campus whatsoever. No fraternities or Sororities are even allowed.
College Freshman,1,IT DOES NOT EXIST.  To have fun you have to go visit another school. but dont forget to first fill out your overnight pass that allows you to leave this prison.
College Freshman,1,"fined, suspended or expelled for breaking any of the following rules: 

no alcohol even if 21, no drugs of any sort, no members of the opposite sex in dorms, no yoga pants, no tight clothes, no dirty rooms, no swearing, skipping chapel, being out past curfew and no shorts to class."
College Junior,1,"There aren't a whole lot of parties to be had at Olivet. Since Olivet stands by Biblical principles, drunkenness is not promoted."
College Junior,1,Greek life doesn't exist at Olivet. SOoOoOooooOOoooooo
College Sophomore,1,"Olivet is a Christian based campus. It has rules against any acts, or possessions of alcohol. Therefore the ""college experience"" definition of partying at Olivet does not exist."
College Sophomore,1,It's not a party school. You will get suspended if you get caught with alcohol.
College Junior,1,"Public Safety is the worst. Even though they got brand new cars, they are a joke. There is only one Public Safety worker that makes up for the rest."
College Senior,1,Not going to lie. Olivet is not accepting if you do not fit the criteria.
College Junior,1,Non-existent as far as I know.
College Junior,1,Can not live off campus unless you are a 5th year senior or a commuter with family in the nearby area or you are 23 years of age or older.
College Senior,1,It's bad. I've been to universities in iowa and two here in Illinois...olivet is the worst.
College Senior,1,"You would think that if Jesus Christ didn't condemn every waking moment and action someone made neither would Christians! Well, that is not the case here."
College Senior,1,"None. 11:00 curfew enforced, get a study pass to stay out and study longer."
College Sophomore,1,There is a limited space for cars.
College Freshman,1,I say its the worst bwecuase it is much to strict. most people have more freedom living at home
College Freshman,1,"It is a school squished between one of the worst neighborhoods in the US, as declared by Oprah, and a ton, and i mean a ton, of small towns"
College Junior,1,The only option is to have a car
College Freshman,1,"Students are not allowed to wear shorts to class or chapel, chapel is twice a week and mandatory, and the only dorm visitation hours for members of the opposite sex are from 7-11 pm on Thursday nights. Even on the ""open dorm"" nights, students are still required to have the door open, and both feet of each person must be on the floor, and PDA is frowned upon. Regarding alcohol use, even if the school finds out that someone has been drinking or otherwise acting beyond the code of conduct, fines or more serious disciplinary action will be administered. This school likes to fine rule-breakers a lot."
College Sophomore,1,there is no greek life which I do not necessarily see as a problem. Fraternities and sororities tend to be cliquey and all about their clique so it makes for a more open minded campus
College Sophomore,1,They treat you as if your in grammar school.
College Sophomore,1,It's very quiet and boring.
College Sophomore,1,We absolutely have no fun. There is no parties.

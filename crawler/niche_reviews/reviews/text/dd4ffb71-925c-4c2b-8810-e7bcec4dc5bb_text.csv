Junior,5,My online  experience is very good. My professors are well prepared and the online experience have very little internet issues. The zoom have been very productive and the overall learning experience is great.
Junior,5,Widener University is an excellent place to educate yourself and receive your four year degree.  They have a lot of tutors and support personnel to help you to reach your goal.  The atmosphere is good and a good place to learn and get ready for the work force.  The professors and great and is dedicated to helping you graduate on time.
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with widener university has been exciting. I had my ideas before i was admitted, but i am now more convinced that it was the right decision. Widener university is not just the best because of it's academic standard, it is also there because of it's engaging and highly wonderful staff members. I recommend this university to anyone who doesn't want to be just a number but an important person treated as such."
Freshman,5,"I have always been skeptical about online studies, mainly because i believed it was ineffective in knowledge transfer and that it was prone to failure, but ever since i started it at widener university, i have been proving wrong completely. The online class at widener is designed in such a way that you are more likely to pass than fail. The use of canvas makes it easier for students to keep up with assignments, quizzes and lecture books. Zoom video conferencing is utilized for classes and there is a high rate of consideration for people affected by either network or unknown circumstances. School emails and canvas are used extensively to pass information to students. The lecturers are considerate to everyone in the class and teach not just by video conferencing but by uploading study material to canvas to help students."
Junior,5,The university is amazing with helping students if they happen to have any problems and are very active with getting their students involved. The nursing program itself is also very good and the professors are very interactive with the students and push us to do our very best.
Junior,5,"The courses that I have taken online have been pretty simple, but if I had any problems it was easy to get in touch with them and figure it out."
Freshman,5,Widener so quickly became my home. I found my best friends and quickly adapted to my new life and couldnâ€™t imagine picking anywhere else. I absolutely love it here.
Freshman,5,Teachers did a great job of transitioning and students were provided with online activities to do to keep up with student life
Freshman,5,"Before i gained admissions to Widener university in Chester Pennsylvania, i had applied to many other colleges but none of which had given me a warm reception like this university did .Therefore, i will say Widener university has the nicest and welcoming admission staff. Secondly, Widener university has a very neat and calm environment which makes it very comfortable for college to study"
Junior,5,I like the small campus effect and the ability to create a relationship with your professors in order to succeed in the classes. There are plenty of activities and organizations to get involved with. The student body is pleasant and someone is always willing to help.
Junior,5,Widener is just such a community dynamic. Everyone makes you feel so welcomed. The campus is beautiful and so safe.
Senior,5,"The small class size allows students to form such a deep connection with teachers, which goes a long way in the class room. The campus gives a more suburban feel, but is in close distance to Philadelphia which gives the best of both worlds. There are endless opportunities to get involved. The curriculum at Widener truly prepares students for the work world."
Junior,5,"Widener University is an amazing school that has made me develop into a true leader. Both the academic staff and faculty are fully invested into the students education and life. The professors are for the students and are always willing to assist you. The small class sizes guarantees one on one connections with the professor and other students. No matter what major, students are encouraged to get involved in research with faculty as well as internships in their respective fields."
Freshman,5,Widener University has some of the best academics on the east coast regarding Nursing! Personally coming from a small town there is definitely a considerable amount of help offered to me here. I can find tutors in any subject and receive much needed help in areas that I am struggling in.
Junior,5,"Widener is an amazing school, with amazing assistance like tutors and faculty. The campus is beautiful, and campus safety ensures student safety. The only downside is there should be more food choices to pick from. This school is also very expensive, yet offers a lot of financial aid as well. Other than that Widener is an amazing school and I advise you to check it out!!"
Freshman,5,"Widener University is an amazing school. It has amazing professors, people, and learning opportunities. The campus is beautiful and a safe place to be. I love the availability for assistance if you are struggling in your courses. Everyone at Widener is dedicated to making your learning experience a great one."
Sophomore,5,"I like how easy it is to get help from your professors and advisors. Whenever I need something from someone it is always an email, call, or walk in away. This was great for me because I needed a lot of help, especially during my freshman year while I was still getting used to that environment. I also liked how easy it was to get connected with other people on campus. They hold many events where you're able to meet other freshman  on campus who are new just like yourself."
Junior,5,"I like Widener University.  As with any college or university, some professors are terrible and lead to long, frustrating nights.  However, the number and quality of good professors easily make up for this fact.  Widener University allows for a lot of personalized attention to students with one on one moments with the majority of the faculty."
Junior,5,"The reason I love Widener is the friends you make on campus are truly for a lifetime. Widener is nothing more than amazing! They're so many activities to do on campus and that there is always something to do! Widener is the place to be and gives many scholarships so, in the end, it is affordable. Widener has one of the best nursing and engineering programs out there. Widener is truly a hidden gem."
Junior,5,I really enjoy Widener University. It took me a little while to get into the swing of time management but I got it down now. I made this Dean's List this past semester. I am feeling very good at this point in my college career.
Senior,5,Beautiful campus with a buzzing student life. Academics are the main focus and the faculty hold the highest degree in their fields. Professors are very easy to meet with and talk to. Campus life is vibrant and living here is the best experience.
Sophomore,5,"Such a great education but very hardwork. You need to put your all into achieve but it is attainable, hard nursing program but well known."
Niche User,5,I have never tried it but it seems like a good school. That try to make you the best you can be! I believe you will succeed in this if you really want to try and accomplish your goals.
Freshman,5,"I went on a campus tour because this is my number one choice and its such a beautiful small campus, the dorms are perfect size and there is so much to do and see within miles of the campus."
Niche User,5,I am an accepted student and I can't wait to attend.  I was and am fully impressed with this school and can't wait to become a member of the WU family.
Niche User,5,The college is so friendly and the people really help you prepare for your career choice. It has some great places near by too.
Sophomore,5,"As a returning Sophomore, I can truly say my college experience so far has been great.

The classes are a bit challenging and it is a big difference from high school, but I have been able to keep up with my schoolwork and maintain a 3.0 grade point average.  Widener University could use some more diversity, but I have been able to fit in well and join clubs that allow me to experience greatness.  I cafeteria has a range of food choices that cater to any type of diet.  Also there are plenty of local restaurants where you can eat and access your meal plan."
Sophomore,5,"Small classes, more one-on -one attention with professiors. College staff are very passionate about what they do."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the levels of knowledge that the professors have. Most professors have a sense of transparency and no hesitation to display their humanness. The students have a sense of unity, the will to work together to accomplish the common goal- learning and graduating."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Widener has provided me with a great education experience as well as valuable life lessons.  I would like to thank my parents for providing me with guidance and support which has allowed me to be prepared for this chapter of my life.  I have been able to excel in the classroom, Athletics and with campus life.  The Widener staff does a fantastic job of making sure that each student believes in his or abilities to succeed.  My grandfather passed away just prior to me attending my Freshman year.  He  always told me, believe in yourself first and others will see your confidence.   This message is how Live my life each day at Widener University."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and how welcoming everyone is on campus. I enjoy the small class sizes because you really get to know your professors personally and they want the best for you. There are definitely many things to get involved in and there's always something to do!
Senior,5,"I love Widener.  The minute I toured the campus my junior year in high school I knew it was the environment for me.  I went back several times to be positive I was making the right decision, and every time I returned it got even better.  The population of Widener is also what makes everyday better.  The people I have met impacted my life greatly, especially the amazing professors.  From taking a trip to Costa Rica with the Biology department, to finally helping me decide to want to pursue nursing, everyone has been incredibly helpful.  I couldn't ask for a better education or environment for myself to be in."
Freshman,5,"This school is a good fit for me. I enjoy the learning environment as well as the social environment. Widener is a great school for nursing majors, which is why I chose to go here over any other school. Yes, the classes are challenging, but to be a nurse your work has to be extraordinary."
Freshman,5,Widener is really great! The nursing program is amazing and the staff is so helpful. The program allows you to interact with your peers as well as the surrounding community with different assignments and volunteer work. It is so easy to get involved here as well. Everyone is very nice and welcomes you with open arms. This is my home away from home!
Freshman,5,"What I like about Widener is the faculty. Everyone at Widener is willing to help one another out, and look out for each other. Widener brings happiness and comfort for students and teachers. Teachers willing to stay extra hours for the help and need for the students. Thats why I love Widener."
Freshman,5,My experience at Widener University has been amazing so far. Everyone is extremely welcoming and friendly. Widener makes sure that everyone feels like they belong there. They are extremely helpful for students who are of financial need. The professors are wonderful and they make sure you actually learn what is being taught.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing nursing program and awesome civic engagement programs. The nursing staff have presented me with multiple job opportunities. The civic engagement team has broadened my leadership skills. The university has taught me so much, academically and internally. It is shaping me into an adult and providing perfect opportunities to prepare me for the future."
Alum,5,the professors worked very well with students and are very encouraging when it comes to research. Students are also very friendly
Freshman,5,"As a first year student, I really like how ""homey"" campus feels. Living on campus is great. This school focuses a lot on the sciences, Nursing and Engineering, and if any of those field are not your cup of tea, I wouldn't recommend it to you. Widener has many different clubs, and activities students can join, and if there's not a club that you see, you can create your own with your friends. The academics are very good, challenging at the beginning but you'll get used to it."
Junior,5,Widener have given me so many opportunities I would not have gotten anywhere else! I'm so happy I made the decision to further my education here.
Alum,5,"I loved the people I met there. I like all the extra curricular activities I was involved with, including Greek life! It was a very supportive, and motivational academic environment to be part of."
Senior,5,"Widener is the perfect school for me.  The campus is beautiful and all classes are within a 5 minute walk.  It's a smaller school but big enough to the point where you will never know everyone (about 3K undergraduates).  Widener has taught me so much in the classroom but has also given me so much opportunity to grow as a person.  I've become a better person but also a much more confident one.  I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything, and I am forever indebted to this Universtiy."
Sophomore,5,A great to school to feel like you're a part of a community. Athletics are a big part of the campus. If you don't do any sports there are clubs and intermural sports. The school is small but keeps added.. trying to add a drama department soon. The voluntary co-op program is unique to Widener.
Sophomore,5,"Widener is a school where you have to become involved. I am involved in Greek Life, this allowed me to give back to the community, raise money for different organizations, and develop friendships I would have never developed before. The classes are small, helping me learn from my teachers and connect with them. The teachers are always there to help you and I can go to there office whenever to get help with different assignments. People on campus are so friendly and I am able to be involved with different groups on campus."
Graduate Student,5,"This was the BEST experience ever!  The School and Classes are small and focus on the individual.  All of my classes applied to my work, and the professors are very responsive.

This school is a diamond in the rough!"
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending Widener University as a freshman. I like the campus itself. It is a small, beautiful campus. Also I like the classes being offered and how small each class is so that I am able to get one on one meetings with professors. All the professors are extremely helpful if you ever need their help with the courses. Also the campus is very diverse and since its small, you get to know everybody and are able to make connections whenever you need."
Freshman,5,"Everyone here is great, from the professors to the coaches. Campus size is perfect, facilities are great, class sizes are small."
Freshman,5,Beginning freshman year...loving the atmosphere....the staff...living on campus...great environment...many activities 
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school! Originally, I didn't want to attend Widener. I came to this university because they gave me the most scholarships. and I wasn't expecting much. The more active I became the more friends I made, and honestly, I'm very happy I chose Widener. It's been great thus far. I play on the women's rugby team, which is great, and the Greek organizations on campus are also amazing. They even have a co-ed social greek organization called Theta Delta Sigma. Anyways, it's a small school but it's really easy to find your ""niche"" or jump around.

Professor really care for their students, and its a wonderful environment. I can't wait to go back this year!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love WU so much. Widener has brought me so much in the past year. For example, i have made many new friendships, learned a whole bunch of new things and figured out what I wanted to do with my life. WU has a great exploratory studies program that helps students decide what they would like to major in. All of the academic advisors want you succeed and get out within four years."
College Sophomore,5,"Every course I have taken so far has made me work to my full potential. There has not been a class yet where I was able to just slack off and pass. I had to put time and effort into each class if I wanted a good grade. The professors were always easy to talk to and always made time for their students. Whether it was meeting for office hours or scheduling another time, the professors were always flexible."
College Sophomore,5,When you don't know anyone it's hard but I met my best friends here. I feel that I am getting a good education based on my major. If you are involved in many things it does make life a little less boring
College Senior,5,I learned so much as a BI major.
College Sophomore,5,"Widener was ranked the 10th most underrated school in the country by Business Insider just last year, and it's reputation and prowess is growing exponentially! And I have seen certain recent graduates and current seniors set for breathtaking success.  5-10 years from now, a lot more people will know the name Widener."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel welcomed and supported whenever I step foot on campus.  A lot of great people and just a fantastic atmosphere.  If you visit or even attend, you can't come in expecting any one thing about the school to blow your mind.  But what you can expect is an awesome all-around experience.  The setup of the freshman dorms, the cafeteria, the gym, the perfect-sized campus, and the weekend activity come together to make for a handful of incredible relationships and experiences."
College Sophomore,5,"Are the dorms the stuff of dreams? No... But at times you'll find you spend little to no time in your dorm.  But when you are staying in, it's a great atmosphere/environment! Make friendly with your neighbors because you'll have a lot of them!  That's the advantage of the small freshman rooms; a unique bond forms in the freshman dorms, and you have plenty of options for upperclassman housing. If you're worried about having a lot of neighbors, you won't find trouble without looking for it, and the RA's are very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"Can't lie, little cliques and rivalries develop like at other schools, but you won't find too much drama unless you go looking for it.  I never would have imagined going Greek before going to school.  It has introduced me to so many great people and opportunities and is by far my best decision since getting to school (I've been a part of it for 6 months now)."
College Sophomore,5,"I wouldn't choose any other school over Widener.  It has a great community environment, and now almost halfway through undergraduate, I've loved it from day 1. Everyone is welcoming and it's easy to get to know people. The size of the school is perfect; big enough to always be meeting new people and small enough to know people everywhere you go.  Most of the professors really care and there are tons of great organizations to get involved in, including Greek life, which isn't too crazy like at some bigger schools.  Beautiful campus, all up-to-date.  Some people complain about the location when looking at it, but Chester is not as bad an area as the media portrays it to be- there are a lot of great Chester residents! My only minor complaint is the gym and caf hours, which even still, aren't bad (gym open 6:30am to 10pm weekdays, 10:00-7:00 weekends, caf 7:00am to 8:00pm weekdays, 10:00-7:00 weekends). Choose Widener!"
College Sophomore,5,I love how personal everybody is and it's very easy to meet new people.
College Sophomore,5,"I am in a fraternity at Widener, the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.  It was the greatest decision so far to join.  I've made great friends, great memories, and also learned a lot about leadership, morals, and life in general.  Whether Greek life at Widener is huge or not, it's still an excellent thing to look into."
Junior,4,The professors/instructors were able to connect adequately with the students online. The online information are easy to follow.  The assignments are designed so that the students have enough time and opportunity to work on them.  The subject discussion are detailed enough for students to understand.  I will surely recommend other students who are looking for online courses to use the Widener University online program.
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Widener University was good.  The classes were at average occupancy not over crowded.  With this, students have able access to the professors."
Junior,4,Widener University has great opportunity for involvement in the local community and as well as job opportunities. This allows you to be build your resume and create opportunities. I was able to do research after completing my freshman year as well as being able to join the co-op program while being a dual major in multiple honors programs.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Widener University is Great!
My overall network of people has increased. I am finishing my sophomore  year at Widener University in the spring. I am an Residence of Life Assistance I like that Widener University is a diverse college. My professors are really helpful with the lessons.  All my associate within the college are very supportive."
Junior,4,I like that Widener University is a small school and close to home. Professors know me by my name and there are many resources for academic support.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Widener University is how open, friendly, and helpful their staff is. Anytime I need help with an assignment or just  needed someone to talk to my teachers were always willing to help me become my best self. Everyone in this environment is great. What I would like to see change is amount of extracurricular offered to non-sports related students."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love my experience at Widener University so far! I have only been here for a few months, but the overall atmosphere is so welcoming. All of my professors are very personable and have my best interests in mind. Widener as a whole is absolutely beautiful- my view of Old Main every day does not and will not get old."
Sophomore,4,Widener University is a very diverse campus. It is either a hit or miss with the professors you get. Some of my professors care about their students and want them to learn while others are just there because it is their job. The sports teams are alright nothing special. Widener prides themselves on the co-op program and I do not think they tell the truth of what it entails.
Junior,4,"Although I've had financial struggles, the staff at widener are extremely helpful and make sure you have the tools necessary to succeed. By building relationships with staff and professors, I was able to fulfill goals and plan a future I could be proud of."
Sophomore,4,"Widener University is a very diverse, yet inclusive school. There are so many clubs and activities to fulfill all of my desires and interests. Each person I have met all have a common goal of being successful. Attending a school, where each professor and student is striving for success makes achieving your own goals more attainable."
Freshman,4,I like the way the campus is set up. The size is adaptable for new students to get used to. Each professor and dean take pride in their work and in their students well-being. Widener University challenges each and every student to their greatest abilities. The university also offers help to students that may need extra help in a subject which what really drew me to Widener University.
Niche User,4,This is a beautiful college with very helpful professors who are excited to teach their students. The food is great and dorms are very cozy and convenient. The outer area of this college is a bit dangerous and somewhat dingy but usually peaceful. The location is also convenient for travel to Philadelphia. Many college students go to Philadelphia to work or have fun. This college offers many scholarship opportunities for students and is very helpful with scheduling classes. The campus is very clean and beautiful during the summer and even better when covered in snow. There is a lot of parking around the campus if you do not want to pay for a parking pass too.
Senior,4,"Widener was a great school for me because of the environment, it was small enough, that it allowed me to cultivate great relationships with my professors and the faculty. It is a place that allows you to feel comfortable, and at this point in time, I feel like this place is my home. There are some negatives, but this place is honestly what you make of it."
Sophomore,4,The student diversity is amazing. The food choices on campus are good. The sporting events are fun to watch.
Freshman,4,"Widener University is a good college to go to. The class sizes are pretty small, so you get to know all of your professors. The food is okay, Moes is very good."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful but I seen better looking colleges. The school is supposed to be known for their study in health. It is a good school for physical therapy. That's if you plan on doing so.
Junior,4,"Widener gave me many opportunities to grow through my career and as a student leader. At Widener, I became involved in greek life, service clubs, and many on campus activities. Widener definitely needs improving in areas such as housing, food, and general safety around campus but I do not regret my decision in going there"
Senior,4,Widener University is a great university. It is small relative to the majority of other colleges and universities and I really appreciate this about it.
Sophomore,4,I will be returning in the fall asa sophomore nursing major. I chose Widener because of its outstanding nursing program and its state of the art sim labs.
Junior,4,"I enjoy Widener because of its small size and dedication to personal attention. As a private school, Widener does have a high price tag."
Sophomore,4,It gets to be more fun once you figure out how to get involved on campus. The food is ok but I wish there were healthier options. Some teachers are amazing and others are just absolutely terrible. There is not a lot of school spirit for things such as football but everyone gets excited for homecoming and bingo. Beautiful campus but it sometimes smells like sewage in random spots.
Sophomore,4,I really do enjoy Widener. They have a lot of resources for students. Yet I wish the area was nicer.
Junior,4,"Widener University is an incredible school, specifically the School of Nursing; It is a world renowned program. With that said, it is one of the most difficult programs. You must have incredible passion and motivation to be successful in nursing. Widener's atmosphere is supportive and light-hearted. Everyone here supports each other. Widener also offers an immense list of clubs and activities, including a student nurse association, student government, student life, etc. There is always something to do here. The nursing staff is also incredible. Every single professor is here to aid you in your studies. I have not had a bad experience with any nursing professor, and some have even become friends."
Sophomore,4,"Widener is a great school to find your comfort zone and get involved. Also, the faculty is very engaging and always willing to help."
Graduate Student,4,I am taking an online MSW program and I quite enjoy it and the work is very fulfilling and enlightening. The teachers are great.
Sophomore,4,Overall my experience with Widener University has been good.  I enjoy the programs and organizations they have to offer as well as the relationships I have built.
Freshman,4,"This college is what I was hoping college would be like.  This is a beautiful campus. Everyone is helpful including the upperclassmen.  Staff is also helpful.
There are so many clubs to get involved with.  Professors are very nice and helpful. This is my first year and I am so glad that I chose Widener University.
So far, it has not been overwhelming.  I am very pleased with Widener."
Freshman,4,"I love Widener University. So many resources to help you be successful and guidance. The campus is beautiful and well kept. Campus safety is always around so you always feel safe. Could have better food and AC in dorms. Not much diversity on campus, but as an African American, I never feel segregated or like a target."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a student attending Widener University and my experience so far has been quite average. Like most colleges, you pay way too much for education and the food is just terrible. Other than the food being sickeningly terrible, I must say that I truly do stay at this school because of the amazing professors, major programs, and student life. I have just previously participated in the Habitat for Humanities alternative spring break program through my school and it was a life changing experience. In the one year I have attended Widener University, I have learned  more than I ever have in my life time."
Alum,4,"I believe that this college shaped me into the person I have become now, the teachers really helped me with my career path and helped guide me to become greater."
Junior,4,"The time schedule for some lectures are very conflicting especially for a commuter who takes public transit.  I commute everyday to school and ever since sophomore year, I have had to take some courses at 8:00am.  This no fun when you have to wake up at least 5:30am in order to make it to school for class on time.  I do not live far away it is just that some buses and trains do not run as quickly around 6:00-6:30am in the morning."
Sophomore,4,"Widener University is what you make of it, just like any college experience. There are endless opportunities to help yourself grow as a person and as a leader. All you have to do is take that chance, join that club, go on that trip, and your experience with Widener University throughout your four years at school will be a memorable one."
Graduate Student,4,"Widener University has provided me with an excellent online education so far as I earn my Master of Social Work. The professors and advisors are very supportive and personable, while the material is appropriately challenging."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally enjoy this school, it gives a home away from home feel, so each time you come back there is no anxiety, but a sense of calmness with a dash of excitement. They always have fun events to get everyone involved, my personal favorite would have to be basket bingo. The faculty as well are great always nice no matter when i come and thats including the cooks, janitors, security, etc. Overall its a good school."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm returning to college to get my bachelors degree. Although I'm starting my first class in the fall the process of becoming a student again and being accepted into Widener, I have to say has been great! Everyone has been every helpful with getting me set up with my classes and choosing the best degree. I'm a full time MRI/xray technologist so at first I was little nervous to go back to school after being out of school for the last four years, but with everyone's help I feel so comfortable and ready. Most of the people I spoke to when setting up my courses were all in school and reassured me that their is nothing to be nervous about. Teachers are there to help their students and want them to succeed and are always willing to help. Over the last few weeks I have become very excited to get started again and know my bachelors degree is right around the corner."
College Freshman,4,Accessible people to discuss jobs/internships.
College Freshman,4,Education aspects of Widener are satisfactory.
College Freshman,4,Attendance is large at games and events.
College Sophomore,4,"Amazing professors, opportunities to do extra (research/coop/etc), and small classes generally"
College Sophomore,4,"Lotta brown, gay, and even brown AND gay people"
College Sophomore,4,"Widener's campus is not necessarily not safe, it's the environment around Widener that makes it not safe. However, there is always campus safety basically on every corner of campus and off campus. I usually always feel safe unless I am in an area a few blocks off campus. While on campus thought I know that I am safe."
College Sophomore,4,"Widener holds a career fair every fall with over 50 plus employers, this is one of our biggest networking events and many students get opportunities from attending this. Our career center holds many lectures that are helpful with resumes and cover letters and preparing you for interviews."
College Sophomore,4,People usually say if you don't play a sport then why did you go to Widener. Sports are a big part of campus many people participate and come to widener based on recruiting.
College Senior,4,They have a lot of opportunities and professors email jobs/internships but you have to apply yourself.
College Senior,4,I am a member of a couple of honor societies but you have to work to get that high.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally am Caucasian and I can't say that I'm deeply involved in the minority community, but I have several good black and Asian friends, and never have I heard complaints about feeling discriminated against or left out"
College Sophomore,4,Not a large part of the student population are users
College Sophomore,4,"The only reason I hesitate to truly rave about the safety is because I know that people look at the Chester community with hesitation.  But I come from an area where there is little to no crime, and I can honestly say I feel just as safe on campus as I do at home.  I volunteer in the community on a weekly basis as well (at numerous locations). Don't do anything outlandish and you won't have a reason to question your safety."
College Sophomore,4,"Intramural sports are fantastic here, and the football team is always really good (homecoming is a blast!).  Basketball courts aren't available quite as often as I'd like for pickup games, but overall the gym has given me an experience that leaves little to desire. Weight rooms aren't necessary top top of the line, but definitely high quality."
College Sophomore,4,Very important in school life
College Sophomore,4,We have great security on campus
College Sophomore,4,I live in Harris Hall this semester I love it in there. It has a great social atmosphere and the cost was not as bad as I thought. Also the convenience of going to class is great
College Sophomore,4,I'm still a sophomore so I still have plenty of time left at Widener University and I look forward to graduating
College Senior,4,We always win basketball games.
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety is amazing they really patrol and make sure the students are safe
College Sophomore,4,The courses I have taken I really enjoyed learning because most of the professors s truly showed that they really cared about what you should learn to help you further in getting your degree.
College Sophomore,4,The sports are important especially when it comes to Home Coming. This university has something that is called roll pride and it is where alumni and currents students come together and enjoy activities including the football game at quick stadium.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall,the health and safety aspect of my college experience are great.  As long as it's on campus, I have not run into any issues at all thus far.  Off campus, I haven't had any issues either, but I am aware of the crime rates and issues of the community.  However, campus safety does a great job patrolling 24/7 even up to a couple streets off campus to make residents and off campus living students feel even safer."
College Sophomore,4,So far I haven't had any issues with the housing.  I was in the engineering LLC last year and absolutely loved it.  This year I am extremely satisfied with where I am as well.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the tight-knit network of friends I've made, as well as the personal care the teachers apply.  I like the fact that classes are small, because it makes it easier to ask questions, and gives the teachers a better chance to answer all questions.  Overall, the learning experience is outstanding."
Freshman,2,"In my experience, i hated the online learning. i didnâ€™t understand the material and also had no motivation because i had assignments back to back."
Freshman,2,"It's important to know upfront that Widener limits your personal freedoms by making you live on their campus dorms for 3 yrs and require you to pay $3500 each semester for their unlimited meal plan for 2 full years!
Most universities give you a chance to live off campus after a year and pick the meal plan that works best for you after your freshman year.  Not Widener, their administration is inflexible & will make you pay for their expensive unlimited meal plan even if you have medical issues that require a special diet.  They are more interested in their own profits then the well being of their students.  
Making matters worse the school is located around the dangerous city of Chester so you can't really walk off campus to get food since the area is unsafe.  I personally felt trapped at Widener's campus since I was forced to exclusively live & eat there.  So I am transferring to another College that will allow me some more personal freedoms you would expect to be given as a student."
Freshman,2,"Do not go here if your a science major. Their chemistry and math programs suck and the professors will rarely ever help you. The enrollment services faculty in lipka hall are also extremely rude. Tutoring on campus is a joke. It's just people who were able to pass the class by chance and know nothing about what their suppose to help you with. Overall, I am considering transferring next semester. I am only thankful that my biology teachers actually seemed to care about my success and are doing whatever they can to make my transfer as smooth as possible."
Freshman,2,"The professors that I had were extremely rude and as a freshman I was given 7 classes and 2 labs with no other choice. The dorms are pretty terrible, many of my friends complained about them being infested with bugs and overall the halls were just dirty. The area is terrible and thereâ€™s not much to do on campus either. The advisor I had was so sweet and made the process of transferring out of Widener as stress free as possible."
Freshman,2,"Cost too much for such poor education. You definitely won't get your money's worth. The food is just ""okay."" The dorms are disgusting with mold and roaches. Student life and all the activities are great, but that isn't not worth the tuition."
College Junior,2,"I was bullied from the time I began school.  If you don't drink, smoke weed and interact with sex, then you are not liked.  it took a lot of work to make friends."
College Senior,2,I know that kids sell drugs on and off campus
College Sophomore,2,"Small gym, no free weight section. I mean there is, but there are specific hours you can be in them otherwise the sports teams occupy the whole thing. Not very many machines."
College Junior,2,Widener housing is a huge  it doesn't matter who you are or what you do they always seem to mess up your housing. They have charged me for numerous things I haven't even done. The cost to live on campus is almost four times more then living campus. Widener's housing is a complete rip off it isn't worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Widener is great educationwise. There are some teachers who are more strict than others, but that is at every college. widener has very small rooms, and the bathrooms are never clean. And it also doesnt have a good party scene. The parties are ok and then they all gets shut down. and the food here is horrible"
College Sophomore,2,You're in chester. There's not a lot you can do.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman & Sophomore students are forced to get unlimited swipes for their meal plan. This is very expensive especially when the student does not have the time to go to the cafeteria that often, nor do I even want to. The options are always the same and they are not good. It is rare the cafeteria even has something I want to eat. I am a vegetarian and yes there is ONE vegetarian station but the common dish is pasta, which I am now sick of. I am not happy with the meal plans/cafeteria."
College Freshman,2,"Chester is a depressed area with nothing to do.  It is not safe and I would not leave campus to go into Chester.  When I leave Widern Campus I have tp go far away >5 miles to find shopping, restaurants and entertainment.  I wish Chester had more to offer."
College Junior,2,"I'm a grad student, and there are no parties for grad students."
College Freshman,2,I rarely hear about them
College Sophomore,2,The surrounding area is sort of dangerous
College Freshman,2,"Dangerous place to be, do not cross the bridge by any means"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't anywhere to really work on campus, they need you for about 5 hours a week at max"
College Freshman,2,I don't think there are many attractive guys on campus.
College Freshman,2,Widener University Main Campus is located in Chester so of course the are safety issues.
College Sophomore,2,"You're in the middle of Chester. Shootings happen. It's not ideal, but it's okay. Just don't be stupid."
College Sophomore,2,"They fancy it up for prospective student days, but it really sucks. You get used to eating stuff that you aren't sure what it is, or eating sandwiches and salad every day. Weird soups too..Pumpkin bacon soup?"
College Junior,2,paying for a permit when you already pay so much to attend the school
College Junior,2,They are available but you don't get much money
College Freshman,2,"If you don't mind living in a dangerous area with gang violence and heavy drug scene, go for it"
College Freshman,2,"I've had an awful time here. The people aren't very friendly, not commuter friendly at all, the workload is stressful, and it is extremely expensive."
College Freshman,2,"No smoking campus, but drugs are easily accessible"
College Freshman,2,"2 nearby shopping centers, both very dangerous"
College Freshman,2,you don't want to live off campus.not the safest area.
College Sophomore,2,Certain areas of the walkways tend to flood when it rains.  These areas can also get icy during the winter months.  
College Freshman,2,I think the Greek life is interesting to have 
College Freshman,2,People do not drink often and don't have to drink
College Freshman,2,Its not the best but it does not cost a lot 
College Freshman,2,It is different than eating the food at the caf. 
College Sophomore,2,"Safety is awesome here! Security everywhere and they're really nice.
Student health, on the other hand, has very very very limited hours, is usually booked by athletic appointments, so if you're sick your screwed, and only open certain days. It sucks... but they are nice when you do get in to see them"
College Sophomore,2,"There's the main cafeteria which is where everyone goes for most meals. It usually has a variety of options but rarely change, but on weekends it doesn't even open until the afternoon and is very limited."
College Sophomore,2,Area surrounding university is very unsafe but campus security is good
College Junior,2,Food is not Good â€“ The food is not good and they have very few options. 
College Sophomore,2,"Eating on Campus â€“ The student food court is not big enough for the university,long long lines to get in ,and not enough seats to sit down.when you only have 40 min lunch break and stand in line for 30 ,it is not ideal!Also it is expensive!Other options on campus is only 2 small stores which sells out of food before noon and nothing is available after that!"
College Freshman,2,Not That Many â€“ Because of its location we don't have that many good choices for off-campus dining. If you have a car you can drive to better places but if not the campus cafe is your best option.
Graduate Student,1,Online learning is not ideal for all students. I found it difficult to stay focused and the technical difficulties made it hard to get through class.
Freshman,1,"People here are the worst. All anyone does is smoke weed and drink in their dorms. The place looks like a ghost town on the weekends until the students come out at 11pm to go to parties. Partially because there is nothing to do on campus nor in filthy Chester but mostly because the students act like doing drugs is a personality and have no other hobbies. The parties aren't even good; you have to bring alcohol then just stand in a hot, crowded room. Some classes were good, some were terrible. My math teacher gave me my only non A, I got a C! The material was not even hard it was because he doesn't teach what's on the test, uses Mylab math for part of the grade which often grades incorrectly if you put a comma instead of ""and"" or something like that, I even came to him twice during his office hours and he wasn't there, he never answers questions he just starts talking about something completely unrelated with what you asked, and he even gets questions wrong on the board."
Alum,1,"I transferred from Widener from community college and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. Although I made the best of it, I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone else as it is terrible in every regard. The academics are awful. My high school AP courses were both more challenging and more enriching. I also found that my AP high school teachers were, on average, brighter and more engaging than the professors at Widener University. There are a few really amazing professors at Widener, just as there is at any college, but the majority of professors are just awful. 

While I enjoyed my time with my frat, the social life is lacking as the school cracks down so hard on the party scene in a strange attempt to overwrite it's previous reputation as a great party school (and yes, it used to be a great party school) despite the fact that almost anyone could graduate from their university while half asleep. With terrible academics and no party scene, what's the point of attending the school?"
College Junior,1,Too expensive. A lot of teachers are simply awful. Not because they're tests are difficult but because they don't know how to teach properly. All the parties get busted. They kicked all the frats off frat row because one sorority hazed one girl and her Mom called the school.
College Sophomore,1,"There are barely any off campus dining options. The closest restaurant is about a ten minute DRIVE away. Therefore if you do not have a car, you will have to eat on campus."
College Freshman,1,"There are not many places to eat off campus because unfortunately, Chester is not the safest city at night."
College Junior,1,"Chester is not a very happening city, there is really nothing to do here."
College Junior,1,There are only three or so places around campus... They are all horrible quality. I wish there were more options.
College Junior,1,It's location is in one of the worst parts of Pennsylvania
College Freshman,1,"Dangerous, yet close to PPL park home of the Union"
College Freshman,1,I hate the CE program. I am starting over elsewhere
College Freshman,1,Located in one of the most dangerous cities in US
College Freshman,1,It's comparable to living in a shoe box
College Freshman,1,I do not go out often out of the city 
College Freshman,1,The weather is not bad here in Widener University
College Sophomore,1,"Grad housing is pretty gross. The houses are not kept up well, I was sick due to the vents not being cleaned out for the first 3 months living here. The only upside is close to campus, having AC and washer and dryer in the basement."
College Junior,1,It can be a strict school with a lot of on duty guards and busting for underage drinking or alcohol use in dorms.
College Senior,1,"A lot of bad things happen in Chester, where Widener is located. Shootings, robberies, you name it. I've begun to feel less safe walking across campus alone after dark, so I usually call someone while I walk...just in case."
College Sophomore,1,Right now it's so cold and rainy here! The only reason I didn't grade it an F is because it's not snowing!
College Senior,1,"Not Even Close to the Best â€“ I've been here for a few years, tried to transfer but this school does a great job of making sure enough credits dont transfer to other schools. Class are rough, and the teachers are the worst especially in the math and engineering department. Not enough to do once you out grow the house party scene, Wouldnt recommend to most."

Sophomore,5,I had a very challenging and fun experience at College For Creative studies my first semester was a big transition from going from highschool to college but overtime I adjusted to the school and my classes. CCS has a insane workload that they put on students to mainly utilize time management and that is something that I struggled with the first 2 semesters.
Sophomore,5,During the pandemic and the lock down I took online classes on Zoom for my 2 classes at CCS at first I wasn't quite familiar with it and some of my instructors had to adjust to it as well my first meeting didn't go as expected but overtime I got a hang of it and the class did as well. Our classes met every Monday and Wendesday my drawing class started at 9:30 normally running for 45 minutes or longer if my instructor was giving us a lecture or if we was doing a critique. My animation class started at 12:45 normally running for an hour or more depending on what is occurring in the class towards the ending of the semester our Zoom time got shorter due to the one on one meetings with our instructor and us having to work on projects on our own time.
Freshman,5,they have support nice staff members also they are very supportive to the lgbtq+ community and to minorities also very helpful teachers and a greater understanding of the art study also gives you great opportunities for students who want a job doing art also has a different community that are very opened and loving.

Niche User,5,I recently got accepted to attend CCS in the fall. The school is great with communication and will do anything to help their students.
Sophomore,5,"I think CCS is a school that genuinely wants the best for its students, but it will make you put in the intense time and effort to get there."
Sophomore,5,"I have just completed my first semester at College for Creative Studies, and I already have the sense that the professors are really interested in helping you develop the artistic skillset needed for my area of study.  They are incredibly down to earth and friendly, and there are so many opportunities to network in the art world and make connections."
Freshman,5,Ccs really fosters your artistic side and the teachers are all incredibly knowledgeable about what it is that they teach
Freshman,5,"College for creative studies has been the best decision in my life. The faculty and staff have been incredibly helpful and I’ve learned so much about the art industry it’s absurd. The classes are phenomenal and we have guest artists in the industry come visit us frequently. There’s someone visiting almost every week, sometimes every couple days. That said tho, the school is also a bit strict, and the party scene is incredibly low compared to other schools, and I don’t usually hear much about our sports team. (If we have one...) But honestly, those aren’t details I care for."
Freshman,5,Love the school! Quite excellent! really amazing teachers and staff! lovely and supportive environment!
Freshman,5,"The faculty are very helpful, advisors are quick to offer any aditional information required, the students are friendly and the college offers a great variety of courses for anyone interested in traditional or non-traditional arts."
Freshman,5,"Not enrolled yet, took amazing tour. Most thoughtful and informational experience so far. Have every intention of enrolling in May."
Freshman,5,The application process was easy to understand and when I had any questions the faculty were quick to respond. The professors and staff on campus are the most down to earth and friendly people. They really want you to learn how to be successful as an artist.
Junior,5,"Great overall art school, Faculty and administration are helpful and friendly. Professors engage you in group critiques an d discussions, the best part about this school is that everything that you learn in the class room, you can immediately apply it to work outside school. Great school to challenge growth artistically and mentally."
Freshman,5,They’re always professional and make sure they solve every problem I have. My coach have reached out to me to make sure I’m prepared for the the semester.
Niche User,5,"The campus feels entirely judge free, even in my dual enrollment classes, I may have came into those classes with a sense of urgency to be better with everyone, but once everyone got to know each other, we all learned something from each other and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Since I have taken those two semesters, I have already accumulated a 4.0 GPA with CCS. I have taken three tours at the campus in both buildings and I have been motivated by both visits. I cannot wait to start my college experience at this college."
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at Canton High School in Michigan and I attended a walk-through at CCS, and absolutely fell in love with the school. This confirmed my decision to attend fall of 2019 as I was so nerves before my walk-through. The class rooms, living spaces, and college environment gave me a sense of peace of excitement! This scholarship will help me entire this stage of my life with less financial worries."
Freshman,5,the campus is amazing and such a good place to truly make amazing art. With top of the line equipment and professers that you can see truely care about you and the art you make.
Niche User,5,I have been to the Campus and it is      very nice and clean. The art program is exactly what I am interested in going into.  My sister goes here and I will be attending in fall.  I am looking forward to starting my next journey in life ...
Niche User,5,"What I really love about CCS is the way teachers and students interact with one another, the attention to the student's needs, and the major specific based curriculum I've always wanted to experience first hand. As an artist, you are always asking for constructive criticism and help with improving your artwork. Not only does CCS staff and teacher help you with that they build a relationship with their students. Students are able to thrive in a community where all artist big and small are welcome. The people at CCS are so helpful and invested in students work that at the end of each semester they talk to each individual student about their work personally to get that one on one feedback for their work. In the heart of downtown Detroit and the influence of the Detroit Institute of Arts, CCS is a match made in heaven for any artist"
Freshman,5,"From what i've experienced so far at CCS, all I can say it was nothing that I expected, in every good way possible. If you're looking to pursue a major in the art field, this is the college for you. Being surrounded by others pursing the same major, you feel like you belong in the environment that you're in. Being surrounded by others in your major pushes you to become better and pushes you to want to exceed your peers. The staff and professors are experienced, helpful, and professional, and the school is equally professional."
Junior,5,"Very personable, excellent courses! The faculty are all very well trained, it is in a safe area, and my peers are friendly! There's lots to do at this school!"
Sophomore,5,I loved CCS. Best college experience yet. Only problem was that I couldn't afford it. I learned more in one semester than I ever would have anywhere else.
Junior,5,"This is a private school that may be expensive, but it is worth it. Note that you get what you put in though. Coming from a community college, I saw a huge difference between CCS and the former. The classwork is rigorous and will take a toll on your mental health if you do not take advantage of the wellness center, RAs, etc. or if you get behind on your work. The experiences I have had here — surrounded by hundreds of other creative and diverse people — has been life changing. While there may not be Greek life or official sports teams, people who make it past freshmen year don’t have the time or interest in these anyway. The professors have all been amazing (save for some of the liberal arts teachers), and have been incredible connections for networking in the future."
Freshman,5,"College for Creative Studies has every art major you could imagine. The staff is incredibly helpful, respectful, and creative. I am beyond excited to attend in the Fall and grow as a young. The professors are not only amazing mentors but they are artists themselves which makes the experience way more realistic."
Freshman,5,"I just started January 17th, and I'm really learning alot. My Professors are very good at what they do. The work is rigorous and I am very excited to learn, new things everyday."
College Freshman,5,A degree from CCS is invaluable!
College Freshman,5,"College for Creative Studies is amazing. It has a strong reputation and presence in the global Art and Design field. Innovators and futurists come out of that school, and it's ranked #3 for after-college job success in your field."
College Freshman,5,There are always companies/ businesses reaching out to our school for people interested in a job there and lots of the alumni have gone to do great and famous things. The employers and our career center seem to be of good quality.
College Freshman,5,"My school experience has been pretty great, I like most of my teachers, the class sizes are perfect to me, the many classes we can take are nice, the teaching is effective and i am improving in my skills. That's all that is needed."
College Junior,5,"I hardly ever hear of any crime, and if I do its very rare."
College Junior,5,Professors and mentors will work one on one with you to help you achieve your true potential.
College Junior,5,"Professors and the Student Job Center will help you find internships and jobs, but you must be motivated and persistent."
College Junior,5,"The dorms are pretty nice, and you get a kitchen at the ACB which is wonderful for cooking."
College Junior,5,Teachers are super helpful and will work one on one with you to help you grow and become a better artist or designer.
College Freshman,5,"The safety on campus is incredible because it's such a small school to begin with but there is also security everywhere. I feel like I have nothing to worry about, even when I'm standing outside in Detroit in the middle of the night!"
College Freshman,5,"I know going to CCS won't be a walk in the park - there will be all nighters pulled, and home work up to the ceiling, and bad days. But I think it's for the best that we know how it is in the real world, not like high school when you were babied each step you took. College is a whole other ball game."
Recent Alumnus,5,Love the techniques they use for my major of photography
College Freshman,5,There is no Greek life
College Sophomore,5,This college really offers a diverse community. I would say a good thirty percent or more of this college are international students. I think its amazing that students come from all over the world to this school. It really opens my mind to thinking how lucky I am to be there. I do not think the community at this college is judgmental at all. Most students take in the chance to interact with everyone and building their connections.
College Sophomore,5,"I am completely happy with my program. Crafts is the smallest major at this college. Having less people in classes makes it really easy for one on one time with professors along with building connections. My specifically in crafts, I am a jewelry major which gets even smaller. I find the atmosphere very welcoming and comfortable. My career goals are to become a designer for a jewelry company. After my undergraduate I plan on exploring what else is available for me through graduate school. Honestly, I do not have many concerns about finding a job in my field. I majored in what I love and plan on making the best of any opportunity that is given to me."
College Student,5,internships are the keys to getting a job
College Student,5,Amazing. The education keeps this place alive
College Student,5,Great options. Its fun to explore the food here.
College Student,5,policy enforces it. kida and no one ID's in the D
College Student,5,"facilities for everything, we have a foundry"
College Student,5,it is free of charge and its under 24 hour security.
College Student,5,everything is up to date and free to use and / or check out.
College Student,5,"it is a hard school to get into and stay in, but that's all the fun isn't it."
College Student,5,"safety incidents rarely happen, security is very strict but friendly."
College Student,5,"Everyone is different, whether it be race, sexuality, or age. People from all over the world attend this school and speak many different languages."
College Freshman,5,The workload is quite hefty but it prepares you for future careers
College Sophomore,5,Its free and everything is so close
College Sophomore,5,You will see every variation of a person you can possibly see at CCS
College Sophomore,5,I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. this is the best place to go if you want to study art in the mid west
College Sophomore,5,The only difficulty you have at ccs is the tuition. The most important part of the criteria is the quality of work in your portfolio and how well you can come up with an idea and portray it on paper with a drawing. The only tip i can give is to draw a lot and just try and do your best with each drawing that you do
College Senior,5,The College for Creative Studies provides some of the best campus housing options in the country. Amenities surrounding the aspects of campus housing are premium and exclusive.
College Senior,5,"Diversity on campus is viewed as a positive subject. Due to the courses of study at the school, diversity from of all aspects is welcomed and embraced in order to reflect the progressive environment."
College Senior,5,"The Transportation Design Program at the College for Creative Studies is the best in the country for anything related to the automotive industry. The courses of study provided by the school are challenging with a healthy student body atmosphere that is competitive but necessary for individual drive and success. Being in the program, constant exposure to industry talent and industry professionals is a students dream come true. The college's facilities mirror that of an industry professional's real world work environment and provide an experience that is later seen in internship and job opportunities. Networking with today's industry is the heart of the program."
College Senior,5,Internship experience is a key tool in a student's portfolio. Real time projects and contributions are what to expect in an internship position.
Freshman,4,I think it is a great college for studying all types of different arts. They offer great curriculums by the professors and you learn so much from going here! I couldn't have picked a better college to go to.
Freshman,4,The online courses are well taught but I just think that in-person classes are better. I learn more from in-person classes than online courses.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are through Blackboard, which is a mediocre program to use for online learning. Otherwise it's alright for liberal arts classes."
Freshman,4,"Great college for anyone interested in pursuing a career in the Art+Design field, lots of opportunities for connections to be made and very career future orientated"
Freshman,4,"So far as a freshman it's been overall very pleasant! The campus is easy to navigate and the staff, fellow students, and administrators are all helpful and interested in the careers of their students."
Freshman,4,"CCS isn't for me personally, but I still recognize this is a pretty great school. My main issues are the location (I'm a local), lack of ability to take liberal arts and that I don't connect with my peers. Location wise, I'm a commuter so because of this I am missing out on a large part of the college experience: living away from home. While CCS does require some basic liberal arts requirement, like writing, the choice of anything not art is limited if not nonexistent. I have been here for a full semester and I can tell I am different from the rest of the freshmen student body. I dont care for cartoons, video games or Dnd. CCS is a school worth considering but also know these things."
Freshman,4,"My experience at College For Creative Studies has been very challenging but productive I an adjusted to the school, my peers, the administration, and student life. I wouldn't change anything about the school just yet."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman for the Fall 2019 semester and I can already say that CCS is a wonderful school. The teacher's are great and make the content easy to grasp. The school also has a lot of fun clubs, organizations, and activities to take part in, so that really great too. The only problem thus far, and it's a BIG one, is that CCS is very expensive. This year alone is $52,000, and I currently have $15,000 left to pay off for this semester, and I'm required to have under $1,000 to register for my winter semester. As fun as CCS is, and as bad as I want to stay, I don't think I'll make it to graduate."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the academics, and having an easy way to connect my professors when it was needed. There was easy access to the library, equipment for projects, the school store, and supplies that were needed for classes. My professors pushed me to do better and make amazing work. I believe I am getting prepared well for the Advertising world."
Freshman,4,"I love the connection of students to professors. Everyone here has an open mind and great knowledge! I would highly recommend this college for those looking to pursue a career in the arts. It is a lot of hard work, but the skills gained are above any expectations."
Junior,4,I love the school and professors although students create a very PC environment where its easy to offend others that to an extent makes creative expression difficult at times.
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore majoring in Product Design. I really love living in the city and the wide variety of people you meet on campus. One thing that I would change is the fact that the workload can be extremely straining. I wish that they had more public places available to students to relax.
Niche User,4,As someone who went here on a trip to visit for a couple of weeks this place is great. It is pretty expensive to get into though.
Junior,4,"In order to succeed here, you just have to do good work and try. About half of the professors aren't great so it really depends on your own drive. If you push yourself, you'll find endless career opportunities, but you really have to try, some people seem to think that just by going here they're sure to get a good job-not true. Also the food here is horrible in every way."
Sophomore,4,Get ready to really chase your success here. Nothing will come at you; you have to go out and get valuable input and try very hard.
Niche User,4,This is my dream school and I have been researching it for years. I've done summer classes at the school for just as long. The campus is small with a lot of smokers but has a lot of heart and ingenuity.
Freshman,4,I really love how hard they push you into hard and push you to become a better artist. No matter how hard the work is in the end youre reminded why you became an artist and what youre here for.
Junior,4,"The faculty really cares for their students, and the school provide so many great opportunities for all student that you can't get anywhere else.  The only negative things I have from CCS is the supplies/food is very expensive on campus its better to go off campus.  As well as the on campus housing is terrible, it is very convenient being right on campus, however personally I did not enjoy it."
Sophomore,4,"There's a huge workload but in the end that workload really pays off. Most of the teachers I've had are great, but there's been a few that could've been better. Overall, it's an amazing school with a great environment and people."
Alum,4,"Was honestly the most motivation of learning in life so far and never wanted to stop, especially learning a little from all programs. What  I would change be to add outdoor work space on each building, especially the tinker toy building, in between the stair well and 24 hour lab. I believe too much time there is spent work inside. If they was a work right there, there'd still be over head for shade and rain. when a deck for sunshine. Building around Detroit have it. Why can't the design school have one to help enhance the creative mind."
Sophomore,4,"So far the teachers have done what I expected them to do, not all of them though. Considering the amount i'm paying to go to this school i'd expect the food to be phenomenal but instead it isn't worth an arm and a leg."
Freshman,4,"College for Creative Studies is a private school perfect for those who are invested in a future in the arts. Although the majority of students attending CCS will not walk out a celebrity, it guides students through the essential techniques, principles, life-lessons, and budgeting that artists must use in their field. By cultivating the students in their practice, and forcibly torturing them through grueling hours of laborious homework, it sets a foundation for the challenging practices ahead. As a Freshman in Entertainment Arts- a major based on three subdivisions: Game, Animation, and Film- I found my current experience to be wonderful; although the debt is not so wonderful. It is without a doubt one of the top schools for students who want a job in the entertainment industry. The students, alumni, and staff are upbeat about sharing their wisdom to better each other. This includes opening the door to potential jobs in the industry."
Sophomore,4,"This school lives up to its name of ""the bootcamp of art school"". Tuition is high and the work load is relentless. However, it allows me to learn a lot. Going through foundation classes allows you to be experienced in a variety of different trades while focusing on one major. Classes are small which allow for individualized learning. I am impressed with the resources the school offers as well. The school seems to do a pretty good job with directing students to internships and career opportunities, but I do see a large amount of alumni teaching courses here, so it probably could be better."
Senior,4,"I love this school even though it can kind of be awful. The resources are fantastic, the technology, the wood shop, metal shop, foundry, ceramic studio, glass shop, just so many great things! It is a very challenging institution, particularly during the freshman year. It is a small school, so it is easy to form a bond with a lot of the students, especially since the students tend to be quite like-minded. The school can kind of stink depending on what major the student chooses. It is a great design school, fantastic for product designers, but the majors that are not so design based kind of get the short end of the stick. I have lived in the student housing for 4 years. They are improving it and renovating it, but unfortunately I have had to live in the construction. The campus is safe, the professors are great (usually), and it is a very inspiring place to be."
College Freshman,4,"I only ever walk on campus alone and i always feel safe. I only feel a little concerned going to my night class at the Ford campus because the Kresge building's security is at the back and there are no ID checks when entering the building due to it's odd structure, however, that is worry about outside people."
College Freshman,4,"It's a good experience so far, workloads can sometimes get hard to manage but I feel like I am learning everything I need to know and more and the faculty I've interacted with are helpful or easy to talk to. What makes it unique is that it is on the smaller side therefore students can get more one-on-one attention."
College Junior,4,The security on campus is pretty good.  Other than normal college stuff I've never really heard about any other issues and I've always felt pretty safe here.
College Junior,4,"Overall I have greatly enjoyed attending the College for Creative Studies.  I been going here for almost three years now and while here and there I find issues with either certain class or otherwise, they can be dealt with and my artistic mind and abilities have broadened, grown and have been challenged."
College Junior,4,"As far as finding internships, teachers and other faculty members are willing and eager to help in whatever way possible.  Networking is one of the biggest parts of campus life, and the career services office is very helpful in terms of helping you get ready for jobs and interviews as well as helping you find opportunities."
College Junior,4,"At the College for Creative Studies, what I knew coming into this school was challenged and my artistic abilities were put to the test.  The intensive program helps us grow as an artist, enhance, explore and broaden my abilities."
College Sophomore,4,They ave security systems in place
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers know their stuff but each one teaches differently, so one semester you may have one teacher who is teaching his/her own level; then the next semester you have another teacher who has gone way beyond."
College Sophomore,4,"Although internships general go to Juniors/Seniors, they still have us work on our resumes as freshmen to prepare us."
College Sophomore,4,I am lot living on campus seems fine
College Sophomore,4,It's difficult because I also have to work 20-30 hours a week but I love it.
College Student,4,Love the different facilities that are available for students!
College Freshman,4,"Housing at the Taubman Center is pretty good. You are in the same building as most of your classes, which can be really nice. My main problem is that there is not enough room for people's belongings. They put three people in rooms which were designed for two, and this contributes to the problem. The maintenance and facilities staff for housing are excellent."
College Freshman,4,"College for Creative Studies is a one of a kind school. The professors are excellent and the students who attend the school are devoted to their work. We become prepared for the workforce, with some students getting internships by Sophomore year. Facilities are excellent, but the shuttle service between campuses needs some work. Overall, CCS is the only place to come for an art or design degree, but the cost is insane."
College Senior,4,"It is a great school with amazing opportunities. Teachers are very invested in your success and want to see each student reach their potential. Teachers have always had my back. You won't get much sleep though, very heavy work load."
College Sophomore,4,The school is a great design school and it is very demanding. You have to be on top of your work at all times or you might fall behind and people are eager to pass you.
College Freshman,4,"It's about $5,000 for the whole semester.

There's the ACB dorms and the Tubman dorms.  There are two types of rooms:

A. 2-3 people

B. 4-6 people

The ACB will be renovated this summer."
College Freshman,4,"I love the food here! It's delicious to say the least. The Taubman has more variety since there are two cafeterias instead of one on the WB campus. Even though the prices are a little expensive, it comes in handy with students who have meal plans. The interaction is very pleasant and the little side bars that they offer is great."
College Freshman,4,"It is very convenient to live on campus. The meal plan allows you to go the grill located on the campus and as far as work rooms, there is plenty of space for students to work on projects. However living in the Taubman Center (TC) building has average room for three roommates to share, while the ACB building is very spacious. The people are kind, yet they keep to themselves. The cost of living on campus is pricey though- at least $550. However if you are lucky to get the College for Creative Studies scholarship, you can live on campus free (something i got). You just need to uphold a 2.8 GPA. Both campuses have 24 hr. computer labs, which is very convenient for late night projects."
College Student,4,"most of the students are at this school as it is one of the best to help you advance in the art career of your choice,they are helpful and friendly."
College Student,4,nice dorms and college setting
College Freshman,4,"Great housing depending on the campus you're on. I prefer the Taubman campus to the housing in the ACB because I find it cleaner, safer, and more secure. The ACB housing has a lot more room though and it's a lot closer to most classes you'll ever take."
College Freshman,4,There are some pretty cool things that the city puts on right around the campus that you've probably never heard of if you don't live in Detroit or aren't part of the artist community. The Ford campus is also surrounded by great museums and is right by downtown. The Taubman campus has nothing there though.
College Freshman,4,"Detroit is pegged as this violent, broke, intimidating city - but since i've lived around Detroit, I could honestly say it isn't a bad city. It has a lot of festivals and things going on, and what I love the most is how multicultural it is!"
Recent Alumnus,4,Unsafe area if off campus
Recent Alumnus,4,Downtown area has lots to offer
Recent Alumnus,4,They have lots of security
Recent Alumnus,4,"They are very good with trying to help with financial aid, however they are an expensive school."
College Junior,4,The campus is a safe area to live in.
College Junior,4,the Campus is beautiful and inspirational.
College Freshman,4,The are very big on safety
College Freshman,4,"I don't care about looks, and people seem to be very nice"
College Freshman,4,I love how the showers are in the rooms. It's organized and I also like how they have monthly inspections with cleaning.
College Sophomore,4,"My only advice is to try to apply as early as you can.

Administration is easy online, and there is staff available to help on campus"
College Sophomore,4,"You'll have to be at your best and a junior, But there's tons of internship and job opportunities available, all from known brands, Instructors are well experienced (still being in the work field and all) and cooperative. Computers and other equipment are all top notch. Workload though, is more easier for those who live on campus, which is unfortunate for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Food is good and prices are reasonable, hours don't stay as late as they should though"
Senior,2,You pay an astronomical amount of money and you end up with a job that pays the same if you didn't go to college in the first place. Save your money and your life.
Niche User,2,So I haven't done online learning yet but my friends who attend their already dislike it cause art schools you need to be hand on.
Alum,2,After having been graduated for about two years now I can say that I have never SUFFERED so much in my life from a poor decision I have made. I worked my ass off at the College did everything I could to KEEP ATTENDING. Having to reapply for student loans DESTROYED my credit and now over half my monthly income that I made at a job USING MY DEGREE goes to paying them back. The end cost does not balance out with what the average job salary for work relevant to the degree you get and it is DISGUSTING. YOU ARE PAYING FOR A 130K+ BACHELORS DEGREE and at the end of the day IT IS ROBBERY WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH. Only a handful of teachers i believe were worth it but they also teach at other schools that are a quarter of the cost then CCS. Worst mistake of my life and Ill be paying for it for the next 20 years.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think they have any sports teams
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was very excited to attend this school I always wanted to be an animator and this was my chance. The school was expensive but I took out student loans to pay for it. I regret that. I'm 172,000 in debt and I still don't have my degree, only have 6 (originally 9) credits remaining before I have my degree and those 6 credits are liberal arts electives. This screw up happened because when I went to register for my courses my counselor did not schedule me out correctly and I ended up taking 2 classes that I did not need and do not count towards my degree audit. I'm not willing or able to take out any more private loans as sallie mae (now navient) has been hounding about my payments.  Those classes together are a total of $7000, at the moment I'm supporting myself so I can't afford it, and I'm currently paying off a balance that I owe to the school. At the rate that I'm paying it'll be 3 years before I can finally finish. I've had many meetings with counselors, registrars, faculty members etc. faculty did everything they could to help me but as far as the higher ups they just don't want to do it, even though other students have told me that the counselors they have worked with have been great. One told me that one of the counselors was able to find him extra financial aid, and other students have said the same. I'm not sure why they weren't willing to help me I've given them 172,000 in money. I know one thing they are having their review for their accreditation soon I'm not going to give them a positive review."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not the best place to live and the nicer places are pricy.
College Junior,2,The cost of housing plus tuition is horrible.
College Student,2,theres no room for creative fun. its too strict.
College Student,2,sports are basically non existent here
College Student,2,Its bad small lame parties. No one is social.
College Sophomore,2,"The food isn't great. The cooks can't really cook, and the healthy food they serve is more expensive and doesn't taste that great either"
College Junior,2,The school is so highly priced and the government just thinks my parent is going to pay for my schooling. He's not so I  am up to my neck in debt already. 
College Sophomore,2,"The hours are inconvenient, the foods not that good. Just don't buy a meal plan."
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife is for people with cars and usually for people of age of 21 or older. There are no places walking distance where you can get access to nightlife things in general. However, regardless of being a dry campus, some people do drink in their dorms. This school, teaching and training students for specific and specialized skill set, will keep their students busy at most time. A particular night of a student during week and on weekend would be homeworks, overnight homeworks, and projects. The city of Detroit, well known for its infamous dangers is not as bad, but misbehavior and curiosity of what we call ""sketchy allies"" may possibly get people in trouble."
College Sophomore,2,"In all honesty, there is a good abundance of drug and alcohol usage. But one really has to go looking for it. It's practically invisible because of all the regulations set on campus. And most students that partake, do so either off-campus property or by themselves to avoid getting caught. It's generally an abundant conversation piece between students in the hallways, dining area, or during studio classes. But virtually undetectable to teachers and faculty."
College Freshman,2,Everyone is so busy there are few parties to go to
Recent Alumnus,2,"CCS is an art and design college, we artists aren't largely involved in sports activities. Now I'm not saying that there aren't any sports clubs or activities, I'm just saying that our main focus is art and design. Those who crave sports activities have started various sports clubs on there own, we other non sports people cheer them on and watch them play. Our mascot is a peacock, known for its beautiful colors, how cool. Recently we created a very nice work out area, with weight lifting equipment, etc. I have yet to use it though, I get my work-out done by walking around the city."
College Sophomore,2,Detroit Housing – My school doesn't give any out side help when trying to find other options for housing. An what is available is extremely expensive or cheaper for lack of security.
College Student,2,"well... if your late or arrive at the last second, you'll get a parking spot on the 3rd floor, and if your early and lucky enough, you'll get it on the first floor."
College Freshman,2,"Drug/Alcohol Use at CCS – Lot's of marijuana use at this school. Some other drug use, and moderate alcohol use, despite it being a dry campus. Generally, if one is caught on campus, they will need to complete 3-4 hours of community service."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the most desirable place to live, but Detroit has a lot of things to do including the international auto show for car buffs. The midtown area where CCS is located is generally pretty safe but students don't walk anywhere alone or at night if they are smart."
College Junior,2,"Treated Like the Stepkids – CCS has some really good facilities and programs. But for my specific major (which is relatively new for the school) it seems like we're the unwanted stepchildren. First of all of our classes are in the basement, we rarely get to see the sunlight, and to top it off you can't get phone reception down there. They don't allow us 24 hour access to our computer labs (which they do for the other majors) we only get 24 hour access during finals and even then we have to beg to get it. There is a lot of drama between teachers (talking down to each other threatening each other), they are constantly moving in and out. The head of my department is a nice guy but he's been known to say disparaging things about 2d animation (he's someone who is a champion for 3d animation). Definitely room for improvement."
College Junior,2,"The Hours Are Terrible – The food is decent at best unless you want to take the trip all the way to the other building then wait in line forever to get a meal that tastes good, but this is all saying you get there in time. The hours make it so you practically starve to death if you are on dining dollars. You can't have late nights without food that's available."
College Sophomore,2,Dreary Winters – Detroit has quite a bit of gray weather but the winters are absolutely horrible. The sun is a rare sight and it can get very depressing.
College Junior,2,"In Michigan the weather is always off and on, it can be sunny one day and snowing the next. It doesn't affect campus though, because our classes never get canceled."
College Junior,2,"Off campus is housing is hard to find because of the area that the college is located in. It is easy to find an apartment that is twenty minutes from the campus, but it is hard to find a decent/safe place to stay in close proximity to the school."
College Student,2,"Unless your 21, there is nothing to do in Detroit."
College Student,2,"very unorganized. class times constantly change, work load is inconsistent,some weeks you'll have no work, others you can't breathe. the curriculum is decent, moves slowly. the work areas are limited."
College Junior,2,"There is a level of strictness at our school in a few different categories. The first is that you are expected to maintain a certain grade (a high grade) to continue attending CCS. Mostly, this applies to the classes that are specific to your major. The other level of strictness has to do with housing. CCS is a dry campus, so no drugs or alcohol is allowed in your apartment in the ACB or Taubman Center. You will get warnings and after your second warning you are on probation."
Recent Alumnus,2,We Didn't Do That – We did not have athletics at CCS. I give this a C because I probably wouldn't have gave it any of my attention if we had.
College Senior,2,"Campus Mobile – Unfortunately transportation at CCS is not what it use to be. The new addition to the campus has caused the school to split the the students up by departments. So the mobile will only travel between the two, rather it use to travel to the local cvs and grocery store. It can be frustrating because there are only three medium sized buses split between the two campuses, which could mean you may be late to class occasionally."
College Senior,2,"Below Average – i was a student athlete before attending CCS. However CCS does not off any kind of athletic team sports. Its really disappointing because there is a great portion of students of all races that would enjoy competitive sports. A new building was added to the campus that has a basketball gym, however hours of operation are inconvenient for commuter students because the building is shared with a high school."
College Junior,2,"Too Cold – I'm from Miami, Florida and based on what I'm used to, it's far too cold in Detroit. On cold rainy days, it's difficult to transfer work from building to building without it getting damaged. On snowy days, it's just as difficult."
College Junior,2,Printers Are in High Demand. If you are looking for a printer at College for Creative studies then get ready for a search. Other then the main computer lab that everyone uses there a few printers around campus that students are allowed to use. This becomes a huge problem when students are rushing to print their midterm papers. I would suggest bringing your own printer to help eliminate any last minute stress.
College Junior,2,"Detroit Resaurants – There are few options off-campus. The options that are available usually take to long. Overall, Detroit is not known for it's options."
College Junior,2,"Who's Athletic at Ccs? Unfortunately The College for Creative Studies is an Art school with no athletic programs. I have't played a sport sense high school, and miss being apart of a team. I think sports is a good way to make friends, get exercise and feel like your apart of your school. I also believe that many students who are involved in activities outside of class rooms are often more successful in their education."
Recent Alumnus,2,I Feel Uneasy – there have been attacks and robberies around campus and i wouldnt venture off campus at night for fear of an attack.
College Sophomore,2,"The Salad Bowl – The students at CCS are super diverse. Me personally, I have a wide variety of friends, which I didn't have before going to college, so to have that here is a huge wake up call in a good way. I love how everybody is different from each other and how everyone has something to put on the table. You learn something new about someone, but more importantly yourself."
College Sophomore,2,"No Real Athletic Center – I would really have liked to have a nice gym so I could work out in between work and classes, however I only found a few small facilities in cramped rooms with a little bit of equipment.  The campus is great otherwise, just that part makes me a little discouraged."
College Sophomore,2,"Teachers Are Supportive – Before I came to college, I always used to hear that when I go off to college that teachers wouldn't try to give extra support.  But when I came to the College for Creative Studies the teachers were all nice and some would let you in their classes even if you weren't in that class.  They are very supportive and I look forward toward completing the rest of my college years here."
Senior,1,"There is no online, unless you consider the 'worse-than-community-college' virtual education they hastily plastered together during COVID."
College Freshman,1,CCS does not have any true athletic teams or facilities. Some students do get together once in a while for fun to play soccer or basketball at a place near by.
College Junior,1,We are in Detroit there isn't many safe places to go
College Freshman,1,"Not very good selection. Extremely overpriced. Almost every meal costs over $10, no matter how small."
College Freshman,1,The big problem is that it's not safe to live off campus. Especially if one is female and has to walk at night.
College Sophomore,1,Detroit is very dangerous and very depressing. The crime rate is high and you wouldn't walk around after 6 p.m. anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"It seems very dangerous town and very old. Some of new building is just too expansive and can't afford it for students. It is hard to find clean, close to school, and safe place around detroit."
College Student,1,"Minor Usage of Drugs at My College – Many of the student that I know don't use drugs at all, they don't drink alcohol either. The way I see it is that the peer pressure comes into play when the victim has a weak faith in himself. Also a big part of peer pressure is the friends that you choose to hang out with. But overall, the worse that I've seen at my college is just regular smoking."
College Sophomore,1,"Other majors brag about their professors. But I don't feel challenged by mine. I have only experienced 2 professors from the Interior design department. From the two Ive dealt with I feel like all the stress Im under trying to pay for this school is being wasted. I can barely understand what they say. Could we find an american? They are never on time, how can you expect the students to be. When they are in class, they act like they don't give a crap. they arrive late give an assignment and leave. they drop in a couple times-thats it. I thought this was an art school? I didn't learn much in my rendering-viscom class. And by the end of the semester nobody wanted to go to class. If im paying almost 1,000 dollars a class I would like to learn something."
College Junior,1,"I do not think there are any groups for Greeks, nor do I know a students specifically, but they probably so exist."
College Junior,1,We Don't Have Any Sports – we rely on RAs or student life to set up sport events. We have no actual teams or sports.
College Senior,1,"The School Has Pretty Strict Drug Abuse Rules – Some time ago CCS became a dry campus. Now more than ever they are buckling down on students. 1st time offense will get you on probation, and you may lose your housing privileges. Second offense and you will be expelled permanently. If you like to drink as long as you are of age you can go to our sister school Wayne State University, where you can party as much as you like. Also because of our location, there are a lot of bars, clubs, and casino's that you can venture out to. Not to mention the 5 min drive to Canada where you are only required to be 19 to drink."
College Sophomore,1,Almost half of the people that I know go to CCS keep/smoke marijuana in their dorm rooms and smoke on the parking garage roof in their cars. I think security needs to step up their game on this matter
College Sophomore,1,"Less Than Satisfactory – The dining options at CCS are overpriced with a quality of gourmet pet food. I would never think to try any meat. The fruit is sometimes fresh, except for three days later when it still hasn't been sold yet. Last year the food improved a bit with the addition of the Taubman Center building. There are many more food options, that are much more appetizing and less scary to try. Stay away from the pasta though, it looks good, but you won't feel all too great about an hour later. I only eat on campus if I absolutely have to."
College Junior,1,Local buses are dangerous and the school shuttle will now only go back and forth between the Taubman Center and the main campus.
College Junior,1,"Not Much to Do for Students in Detroit – Unless you are very familiar with the city and you are over 21, there isnt much to do in Detroit.  It's certainly not a very walkable city.  You have to drive quite far to go to bars, clubs, concerts, etc.  The city has some cool spots, but you have to know where they are.  Most students stay at home and hang out with friends."
College Junior,1,"Would Rather Move to Another City – The College for Creative Studies is in Detroit, so finding an apartment that is safe and close to school can be a challenge. I originally lived in my school's dorms, however, I wished to have the added freedom of living off-campus. Apartments that are in the immediate vicinity of school are rather pricy because they are in a good part of Detroit (you basically pay for safety and peace of mind - my building had 24 hour security). After my lease was up, I had to move in with my parents for most of the summer in order to consider my options for this up coming semester. When faced with choosing a more affordable apartment in Detroit (which would include increased safety concerns) or moving to another city 15-20 minutes away with affordable prices, I chose to move to another city. I would rather drive 15-20 minutes to class, than worry about my safety or pay expensive prices to ensure it."
College Student,1,"Punishments Are Severe – Police are extremely strict over drugs and alcohol, if caught will either recieve community service or get kicked out of school. Violence is not accepted usually results in getting kicked out of school. Every where we go we have to show an ID at all times to the staff and if we loose it we are stuck outside of our dorm even if the security gaurds no us really well (this happens a lot for all students) most things result in punishment."
College Student,1,"Typical, Boring, and Bad Customer Service – near our college in the downtown detroit area we have some regular fast food joints like mcdonalds, burger king, and subway. Not to mention a white castle that is walking distance but will leave you with a rather large heart burn. Entering most of these places I have recieved very poor customer service from a young crowd like college that don't even appreciate the money they earn in such a bad economy. I myself work in a restraunt and do not enjoy the part of greeting angry customers and cleaning off hundreds of dirty tables, but I was taught how to be professional and continue to greet customers with a smile and a good attitude, something many of these kids lack."

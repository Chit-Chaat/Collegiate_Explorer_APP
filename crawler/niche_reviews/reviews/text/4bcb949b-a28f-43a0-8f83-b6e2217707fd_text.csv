Graduate Student,5,Naturally it's different but not difficult as compared to in-campus experience. There is more work but ease of finishing up class in your own comfort zone.
Senior,5,"I loved Goldey Beacom College! Small campus, small classes. Allows for teachers to really get to know you as a student and a person. Also allows for one on one help if needed. My advisor was great! Everyone who I ever had to work with or interact with here was helpful and friendly."
Sophomore,5,Goldey-Beacom College is an amazing school with a lot of resources for students of all ages that want to better themselves. They have multiple paths you can take by going t Goldey. They have a range of class schedules you can take so many majors and minors. They really care about you as a person more than just a number. They give out free tutoring and extra help when needed. Goldey-Beacom College os more of a family then just a college. They do a lot for there students regardless if they stay on campus or off. If they commute from far. Even the Saturday students that come once a month. They connect with on and emotional level and really try to get to know you as a person and not a number.
Graduate Student,5,"Caring professors and campus staff with small class sizes add to the overall positive experience.  The campus is currently constructing a new dorm and while construction is underway, the campus is still fully operational with limited inconvenience."
Senior,5,"I liked the size of the school because I was able to recognize people and looking back on my freshman year, that helped me out a lot with making friends. Some changes that I would like to see for future students is luckily already being done! My school is expanding its campus which I think is important because more events can be held at school so that students won't get ""bored"" with how small our campus is."
Niche User,5,"welcoming, beautiful,save, diverse 
admissions office is very helpful, they make you feel comfortable, the campus is safe and small so you wont become lost at anytime. beautiful area close to all needs such as jobs , grocery stores and things to do."
Senior,5,"I like the small size of the school and how everyone knows everyone. It is very tight knit and that was something that helped me choose to attend Goldey-Beacom. I don’t like the quality of the dorms, they are livable but could be updated."
Niche User,5,The amount of offers given are amazing. With the idea of going to college where there is a great campus and the amount of opportunities are very beneficial. The idea of going to a college that will lead students in the right direction is a great place to go.

Freshman,5,I love Goldey Beacom College it is very safe to be at and the diversity is amazing I meet someone from outside the country everyday. The food they make is really good I always end up going back for more. All my professors were amazingly helpful to me they always gave me resources to finding help or anything I love the school. My first semester there was great I love all my roommates we get along so well that we even enjoy having people over and cooking for others if they don’t have food we supply some.
Niche User,5,"Very nice school but the dorms in certain houses are very small but that's normal. The gyms look amazing, and the pool is really pretty. The academics are amazing. You are getting what you paid for. The college is not to much at all but when you are coming out of state it may be a little pricey."
Junior,5,I love Goldey-Beacom College! It's a small private college campus and if you need any help from professors they are always willing to be there!!! The one thing I want to change is the campus events/activities.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy attending Goldey-Beacom. It's a small community, that is good if you like to have a family feel where you know everyone. The teacher here are exceptional and really do want to see you succeed. Goldey-Beacom is not a well known school, but it is growing slowly. Although this school is very small and has a tiny campus, this is a very good school if you are an athlete as well, most of the students on campus are athletes for the school. Lastly this school is extremely affordable!"
Junior,5,It's  Very business oriented. You get a lot of one of one attention. Goldey-beacom college is all about you  succeeding not failling. Instructors really work with you.
College Senior,5,"It is the perfect mixture for busy students. It pushes you, but does not overwhelm you."
College Senior,5,"I love my professors and the small class sizes. I really feel like I am important to all of my professors, instead of just another number."
College Senior,5,I do not have any complaints about my school.
College Sophomore,5,"I appreciate the professors here, they are patient, direct and have a commonality of teaching education!"
College Freshman,5,Very diverse and a great crowd of people to hang out with.
Alum,4,"I did not take classes online at Goldey, however, I have heard they are simple to follow and educational."
Graduate Student,4,"It has small classes, which make learning easier. There is student areas where they can sit to study or just hang out with friends. The library is also a good quiet place, with spaces for private learning. The teachers are helpful especially during these testing times when everyone is trying to adjust to a new normal. My overall experience at GBC is pleasant."
Sophomore,4,"Lots of activities, great variety of programs to choose from!
School spirit continues to grow and increase across campus. Social media apps help keep us all in the loop on what’s happening around campus . Sports to bus trips, campus wide games and events, food trucks and organized activities just make the learning environment that much better..... not to mention safe for us!"
Junior,4,"This is a rather small school, so the advantage is the teacher to student ratio. Every student gets individual help if needed, unlike the large four year schools. The dorms are fully equipped with a kitchen and living area much like an apartment, so students can cook all their own foods which in term prepares them for their future in the ""real world"". One thing I would like to see improved, which they are currently constructing, is updated facilities. They are building a new dorm tower and lounge area which will bring more student life to the campus."
Freshman,4,Goldey-Beacom is a very small school but is very good with helping you connect to employers and is helpful with trying to get you a job after graduation.
Freshman,4,Goldey-Beacom College is a wonderful business school designed to help students transition into the business world. I really loved the teachers and academic program. I would love to see the college increase their activities and clubs. The small school is willing to expand their experiences but needs a little help doing so.
Junior,4,"I have had a very good experience so far at Goldey-Beacom College. Being a small school, the community is very close knit. As an athlete, you maintain close relationships with all other sports teams. Professors are very experienced and care for their students and their future."
Alum,4,"Great faculty and staff! All of the them want the students to succeed and are more than willing to help. Smaller campus, but great for students who want their professors to know them by name vs. by a number."
Freshman,4,I love the family environment the school creates. The location isn’t that great for entertainment but it’s not terrible. The faculty and staff are very friendly and they are helpful with career skills
Freshman,4,"So far, Goldey-Beacom has been an excellent experience. Great staff and students, amazing atmosphere, and wonderful diversity. I am looking forward to spending the next four years at Goldey-Beacom College."
Junior,4,"Not enough day classes. I have to take the bus which doesn't run at nights, forcing me to take day classes. There are some classes I have no choice but to take at night and I don't like to drive at night, plus I have limited access to a car. If I had known there would be such limited availability I would have seriously reconsidered going here, but as it is I have no choice. I can't go to Wilmington University, they are basically just a diploma mill, University of Delaware is too expensive,  and Deltech doesn't have my degree program anymore and Delaware State University  is too far south for me to get to on a regular basis. I am really frustrated by the lack of day classes for my major. Unless you have a car, don't bother."
Senior,4,"If you're into getting a business degree it's a great college. Some instructors go above and beyond in making sure you succeed NOT fail. College environment is very friendly, people are very helpful and you pretty much get to know everyone. I consider Goldey-Beacom as my second home."
Junior,4,Goldey is a small family like oriented school. The teaches are very open and time convinent whenever you need them.
Freshman,4,"I like Goldey-Beacom College because it has a very diverse student population, while the campus only two main buildings (excluding dorms) I see people, students that are happy and willing to put in work to achieve their life long goals."
College Junior,4,Great business degree from business school
College Junior,4,"Its a great school, its not overwhelming to the sense that your stressed out everyday but you still get a great and affordable college education."
College Junior,4,There are college fairs every semester with great companies from around the area.
College Junior,4,Teachers  and staff are very open and very approachable
College Junior,4,It really is chance but there are great people so you do get a sense of the whole college dorm expereience.
College Junior,4,The school is now bringing back baseball.
College Junior,4,This school is great if it is your first college experience. The small classes allow more interaction between the student and teacher. You can get certified in Microsoft office applications for free through your Microsoft classes.
College Senior,4,I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel
College Senior,4,The professors are willing and able to teach
College Senior,4,We have a very large international student population.
College Senior,4,"I assume it is good, but I do not know much about it."
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on campus.
College Senior,4,"The only Greek affiliation we have at this school is Alpha Chi, the national honor society."
College Junior,4,Goldey-Beacom is a small private school. Everyone is friendly and the advisors are very good at helping with any problem the student has. At my school I feel like everyone cares.
College Sophomore,4,I get what I need out of the center when I use it!
College Sophomore,4,"you are challenged here, and you must take responsibility for your own education and future, professors will help but not do the work for you!"
College Sophomore,4,"Students are exposed to local business events, local business opportunities in my related field, and the school offers many partnerships that they know will help increase student interests.  Study groups are available and tutoring too!"
College Sophomore,4,"This school has grown tremendously from 10 years ago, and I see thee administrators reaching out to the students asking for ideas to make it better!"
College Junior,4,"I have not had an internship, and i do not plan on having one because Goldey Beacom does a good job with involving me into their community. I work in the business office, and there, i gain insight into the business world. I have gained experience and confidence in looking for internships outside of this college due to the confidence they have given me."
College Junior,4,"The financial aid process runs very smoothly, and the school is very flexible in offering scholarships to every student who is in need. They make it very easy to apply to scholarships, and are there to assist you every step of the way.  
I would suggest with follow up emails and to keep your GPA steady, as with any other college/highschool or job."
College Junior,4,"Although there are not a full range of athletic options at Goldey - Beacom , I am very please with the options available. The fan support is excellent, since it is a small school everyone is very supportive of each other.  The school spirit is as good as it gets within a small community, and the athletic facilities are kept up very well. I do wish the school offered more athletic options opening it up to more opportunities, however i am extremely pleased with the options available as stated above."
College Junior,4,"It is located in Pike Creek, DE. Not to far from Wilmington, Philadelphia, etc. 
Close to restaurants, grocery stores, and more. The campus is fairly small, pretty quiet area."
College Student,4,"lots going on. grocery store, restaurants, nail places, etc. right across the street."
College Student,4,"very wide variety of students. blacks, Mexicans, whites, Asian, etc."
College Student,4,Pretty good.  Has a lot of pizza places and one sort of nice restaurant.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are good, however many of the credits cannot transfer."
Freshman,2,"There is no campus life. They cram six people into a dorm only made for four people. The dorms were also filthy when all students moved in. There were many health violations such as build up on pipe lines that could have become  a fire hazard. The dorms were apartment style, and one of the other safety failures such as no fire alarms in the rooms. The fire alrms were in the kitchen, but if one was in the shower or in the room with the door shut, they could hardly hear the alarms. The cafeteria is a fast food stop and holds no nutritional value. The classes are extremely business driven which can seem good but does not apply to everyone at the school. Yes, the school is a business school, but it also has majors in English and psychology. In English and psychology, business may not be important, so it should not be included in general math courses."
Freshman,2,"No college that puts a student in a “college algebra” class should be taken seriously. There isn’t a meal plan. Microsoft Word and Excel are mandatory classes, which is ridiculous. Do not go here."
College Junior,2,No good sports and no shook spirit
College Sophomore,2,"It is very difficult to receive help, I live with my parents, however, the income is about $1000 over guidelines and it has made my receiving financial aid very difficult."
College Sophomore,2,There are few courses with bad professors.
College Sophomore,2,It is a business school so the only good classes to take are business classes.
College Sophomore,2,There is only one computer lab on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Not very much of an option.
College Freshman,2,"Nothing bad ever happens on campus, mainly because so few students live on campus. Our dorm rooms are always locked and we need a key to access the buildings. The security guards are very old and when they come to bust parties they do not really do much, nor could they really do much."
College Freshman,2,"The campus (resident students) are mainly white, or black. The other nationalities are mainly all international students."
Alum,1,"I'm just warning you now: do not do it. This is hardly a ""college"". It was smaller than my high school and it accepts almost anyone that applies (and the students show it). The administration will do everything in its power to ruin your college experience and not allow students to have fun. I think the dean forgets that GBC is a college and not high school. The only reason I went was for sports, which is the ONLY thing the school really has to offer. The athletes have school spirit and try hard, but it's not enough. Nothing is worth attending this school. Go to a real college."
College Junior,1,No Greek life at all
College Freshman,1,"The local atmosphere at Goldey isn't great because we don't have many places near by where students can go, and there isn't much going on around campus either."
College Sophomore,1,There is no transportation unless you have a car.
College Sophomore,1,Not a good night life at all.
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,I absolutely hate my school and am trying to transfer.
College Freshman,1,"Goldey-Beacom does not really have many places for the students to hang out. There are some pool tables and ping pong tables in the student center but that closes pretty early, as do the canteen and the library. The dorm buildings do not have a common area where every one can hang out. The school does try to keep us busy with activities like zumba or dodgeball."
College Freshman,1,"its a small school , no need for transportation on campus , its only when your going off campus that you need a bus and the bus stop is across the road . you have to plan your trip with google maps and keep to a schedule ."

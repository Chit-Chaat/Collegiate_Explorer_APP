Niche User,5,"I haven't taken any courses online at UNA, but I bet they are great. I have some friends that take online classes and they love it."
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at UNA I recently transferred after being out of college for one year. Everyone has been helpful and kind and all facilities in the science building are nice.
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience is not much different than in-person learning. The professors make sure to provide lectures via recordings or zoom & they are still there 24/7 to answer any questions you may need.
Sophomore,5,It’s been a wonderful experience so far! Everyone is so welcoming and helpful. Each of my professors have been extremely nice & they want the best for their students. They’re willing to do whatever it takes to help students succeed.
Sophomore,5,My online experience at UNA is excellent. My professor had gave us easy access to our course. I was able to access my courses via canvas. With canvas you are able to go in and do any assignment anytime before the due date. The due date was usually on the same day during the week at 11:59.
Junior,5,I really liked the warm welcome and helpful nature provided by the faculty and staff at the University of North Alabama.
Junior,5,I have not taken any online classes at the University of North Alabama at the time of this writing but have heard of positive experiences from other students.

Senior,5,Amazing campus life and amazing professors. The class sizes where perfect and the teachers would help at anytime. The sports were fun events to attend and the food was really good.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my experience at UNA. I am a transfer student. I plan to double major in Elementary Education and Spanish. The campus is beautiful with so much history to the town and community.
Freshman,5,The University of North Alabama feels like home! It has a friendly atmosphere and has many way for you to be involved on campus! All the students and faculty here at UNA are amazing to make this place feel like you belong!
Sophomore,5,The University of North Alabama is a Greta place to go to college. It isn't a big place like the University of Alabama but it is still big enough so it feels like college which is why I like it. I grew up in Florence so I still have the home feeling. The learning atmosphere is also really comfortable and the professors care about you learning.
Freshman,5,Great community of students. There is always something fun to do and ways to get involved on campus. The professors are great and easy to get along with.
Freshman,5,North alabama is an amazing school. the people and the vibe there is chill and relaxed. the scenery is beautiful. i would love to change the distant from dorm to the college. it a nice long walk my friend.
Sophomore,5,UNA makes it simple to start your college career at any age. I work a 40+ hour a week job and take online classes and they make it simple and easy to do both.
Freshman,5,"It's my first year at UNA, and I absolutely love it!!! I'm significantly involved with the Honors College, and it's amazing!! The staff for the Honors College are wonderful and incredibly accommodating. Sometimes the dean brings his dog in after work!! I've made a great deal of new friends just by living in Lafayette, the Honors dorm, and attending Honors events this year. UNA is a great school, and I'm so glad I picked it!!!"
Niche User,5,"The campus is amazing, and decorated with fountains and lions. The real Lions on campus give this passion and school spirit that can  not be explained. The true University of North Alabama experience is an affordable 4 year university with small class sizes at a high level of academics. The University of North Alabama also has an absolutely outstanding arts and fine arts program, that sets you up with opportunities and chances to achieve your person goals and success."
Niche User,5,The girl who gave me the tour was super sweet. I was amazed to hear how much she knew about the school. She made me feel at home while I was on the tour because not only did she teach me about the school but she also tried to get to know me. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the closeness of all the classes.
Freshman,5,This college feels like a home away from home. Everyone is so kind and helpful. When I was visiting the college I was blown away at how friendly everyone was. It is a gorgeous campus and even if you didnt want to go there i would still tour it. I absolutely love it.
Senior,5,UNA is an amazing university filled with professors that actually care about you and so many resources. I originally fell in love with UNA for its beautiful campus but the relationships that I have developed over the years with friends and professors is unreal.
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at the University of North Alabama, so far my experience has been great. I love the diversity of student from different walks of life, I get to learn about their culture, and of course the food which I love. We also have a system at the university called snap. Snap is a transportation system where if I or everyone didn’t feel safe walking, we can call someone from snap, and they would take us where we needed to go on campus which I think is a very good system to have. One thing I would change or add would be more restaurants or food trucks so we could have more options."
Freshman,5,AWESOME... it’s home away from home. The town and surrounding communities are very welcoming.  They have a diversified local farm to table cafes and boutiques.  The only thing I wish they had in town was an Asian market and an affordable Thai restaurant.
Freshman,5,I love the campus it very beautiful with each build how there own  unique style. I love seeing the lions. The people in una are very friendly and if need help then ask and they will definitely help you in anyways
Freshman,5,"I have just recently been excepted into the University of North Alabama, located in Florence AL. The few interactions I have had with the students and staff at the university have all been good. I was amazed on how fast I was excepted into the university and the staff does what they can to help you get all your financial stuff taken care of. I am looking forward to starting my first year at UNA."
Sophomore,5,"One of my favorite things about the University of North Alabama is how friendly and ""at home"" you feel on campus.  Staff and students do an amazing job making this university feel like a community, or one big family."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here. They have so many great features. They make sure every student is well equipped for classes. All the professors are great. They take the time to make sure you understand the material. I would recommend this school to anyone
Junior,5,"This College is amazing. I was worried about moving away from my family for the first time but as soon as I got here, North Alabama felt like home and now I am here for my third year and I don't believe that would belong anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,The University of North Alabama is full of top rated professors and the best courses. The campus is beautiful. The campus is very diverse and offers programs through the semester to engage students.
Freshman,5,"When i have visited there, the environment has always been welcoming, kind, and open. The campus is clean, beautiful, and filled with diversity. The music program is one of the best in the state, and the academics is thorough. The teachers seem to be just as nice as the environment."
Freshman,5,I love the University of North Alabama. I have met so many new people and my professors are also very helpful in any way. Grades are really important to me and the University of North Alabama has helped me keep them up. The only thing that I wish would change is the parking issue.
Freshman,5,"The students and faculty are very welcoming and helpful. Everyone says hi to each other and give off an overall happy atmosphere. I love the class sizes also, with smaller classes I have a better relationship with my professors."
Niche User,5,Everyone on campus is friendly and willing to help you. Its a very welcoming university and easy to find a place to fit in.
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of North Alabama. It has a very beautiful, safe campus. It is also very easy to find your classes. The professors are nice and are more than willing to help you and will take time out of their day to meet with you."
Sophomore,5,I love UNA so much! I'm a Criminal Justice major with a Crime Scene Investigation minor and I couldn't have a better experience.
Junior,5,The University of North Alabama is a great school located in a town with a large amount of history and a unique personality. The teachers and staff love the school and do everything to make it succeed. I have only experienced the best education and assistance I could ask for. It is truly a great school.
Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at UNA, the teachers seem to really care about their student and they want us to succeed. I even had a teacher help me with my advisement issue with my minor."
Freshman,5,I extremely enjoy the campus and the area that surrounds it. I picked this school because it is very diverse and I know I can succeed there. The on and off campus food is amazing. There is always on campus police there for your safety. I can't wait to be there this fall!!
Sophomore,5,"Affordable tuition and cost of living. Visually pleasing campus with great professors for the most part. Florence is just darling and has a small but progressive art community. If you want to live somewhere you may make a mark on, come here."
Freshman,5,"What I like about UNA is the environment, and the music business. The environment really opens up to me and hats why I think other people should go to UNA. It’s a nice open, friendly campus that ou can feel welcomed at."
Niche User,5,"UNA is a wonderful school to go to. It is very easy to get in-state tuition here and they have many collaborations that makes opportunity thrive here. UNA is not a school for many STEM majors, but they excel in nursing majors, music, arts, math, biology, chemistry, business, and education. They are expensive, though, so be careful on how much financial aid you get."
Senior,5,"Small class sizes! Awesome professors! Research Experience is applicable to all students. The President is great. If you want to be involved we have over 140 different organizations to choose from. Inclusion, great food, fun experiences, good value, options for scholarships."
Niche User,5,The staff and students are so kind! The first day I went there I felt like I had made new friends. All of the ambassadors giving tours were so helpful and caring. Besides the great people the school also has a beautiful campus! The same designer that designed central park designed the campus. And you can tell it is truly unique.
Sophomore,5,The university is one of a kind it's the oldest 4 year public university in Alabama the campus is a nice scene great people
Freshman,5,"When I came to UNA, I was hesitant about actually staying there for long. Coming from a small town, walking onto campus and meeting so many different people was a culture shock, but I got over it. I have made friends and I love the teachers. The campus is beautiful, we have Chick-fil-A in the commons, and the fact that we have live lions on campus is amazing. I would recommend this college to anyone wanting to further their education and strive to become part of a community."
Freshman,5,The experience is great. The campus is very diverse and the university is very community orientated.
Freshman,5,The University of North Alabama is a great college with a beautiful campus. The University  has many degree options to choose from and is willing to help the students achieve success in any career they choose.

Niche User,5,University of North Alabama is very cozy and the people are extremely nice and there is a lot of diversity.

Freshman,5,"Love UNA! Beautiful campus, amazing faculty, awesome students! So many things to get involved in. UNA is easy to navigate and everything is within walking distance. Only downside is parking is hard to come by."
Sophomore,5,My mother graduated from there and I am now pursuing a bachelors degree also.  The staff if very friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the campus. Seeing the fountain light up at night is an amazing experience. The population is diverse, and there are lots of opportunities to meet new people."
Freshman,4,"I  have had both good and bad experiences with online learning but I think it just depends on the professor. Overall, I would recommend online classes."
Senior,4,I love the University of North AL.  I returned to complete my degree after almost 40 years in the workforce.  They lack an adult portfolio program which provides credit hours earned for work experience.  No support for returning adults.  A lot of support for first time entering freshmen.  No evening/after hour support.
Sophomore,4,My personal experience at being at UNA is that this is a good place to learn how to become an adult and begin to live on your own. Florence is a small town and on campus I met a lot of people from different places from different background. UNA's campus is very beautiful other than when they are doing construction. UNA's faculty and staff are very respectful.
Sophomore,4,The University of North Alabama has so much to offer to such a wide variety of students. Their campus is absolutely beautiful and has several student organizations to get involved in.
Junior,4,"It is a great university for students who are eager to learn. There is much to do such as events involving the fountain that brings the community together. Easy to be part of something and make connections. Overall, it is a great university to attend."
Senior,4,The small class sizes at UNA are a really nice benefit. A majority of the faculty and staff are really invested in students succeeding in their classes and obtaining a degree. The campus is beautiful and is situated in the middle of historic downtown Florence.
Freshman,4,"The campus and surrounding areas are beautiful. All the students are very involved and polite. Band students are treated as equals to athletes and cheerleaders. The main change I would enjoy seeing would be a better, closer to campus, football stadium - as the one they currently have is shared with the local city high school."
Senior,4,"Currently enrolled in the online BBA program & it has been a great college experience thus far.  Wide variety of courses, professors are industry leaders as well as educators.  Faculty and students are international and bring a wealth of knowledge to create a unique learning experience for all age groups.  

The online programs allow great flexibility with work schedules.  The University of North Alabama offers traditional, accelerated and hybrid courses to allow you to create a course schedule that works for you.  Tuition costs for all online programs are at in-state tuition rates.  UNA is a convenient and quality education for both traditional and non-traditional students.  One of the best decisions I made in continuing my education!"
Niche User,4,The University of North Alabama (UNA) is a wonderful four-year university. The professors are all accommodating and willing to help their students succeed in the next chapter of their life. UNA also has an Early Scholars program which allows high school students to take college classes for college credit that will be transferred upon graduation. Overall UNA has a relaxed atmosphere and promises to help students achieve their goals for higher education.
Junior,4,The University of North Alabama is a great college that provides students with several opportunities that go beyond academics. This university helps you to establish opportunities that will enhance your graduate studies or career development.
Freshman,4,North Alabama is a wonderful educational opportunity with friendly staff and a welcoming environment!
Freshman,4,"So far I have liked being at UNA. The professors are really great and willing to help students during office hours; additionally they are very personable and want to help their students succeed. The other students are nice and the overall climate of the school is great. UNA is not a huge school, but I enjoy the smaller, homey feel of the school"
Sophomore,4,"The University of North Alabama is a fantastic school with amazing education opportunities. We have just become a Division 1 school meaning all of our sports compete at the D1 level. We offer highly recognized nursing, education, and business. However, parking on campus is limited and sometimes I feel it is slightly dangerous due to lack of crosswalks and a slight lack of law enforcement making sure the street is safe for students to cross. The fast food available around campus is of good variety. There is always coffee available and the library is open until 1am most days so students  can study as much as they need. The school provides as much as they can to allow students the best opportunity and access to furthered education."
Graduate Student,4,"By far, the main aspect of the University of North Alabama that I enjoyed was the student-teacher relationships. Class sizes are much smaller than at a major university; therefore, students are able to build stronger relationships with their teachers. This greatly benefited me because I developed a great relationship with one of my first college professors here, Dr. Hunt. Over my four years of undergrad, she assisted me in finding volunteer opportunities and even helped me get an internship in my desired work field and field of study. Being able to develop these relationships with our professors also assists us in learning how to effectively and confidently communicate with our superiors in different sectors, especially in the work sector."
Sophomore,4,"One of the best features of UNA is its beautiful campus, historic landmarks and almost year-round warm, sunny weather. The south is known for its hospitality and people here really are friendly. You walk through campus and your gaze inadvertently falls onto someone and they smile at you. You can’t help but smile back. 
Another great advantage of UNA is primarily small size classes, approachable and truly caring faculty, and number of services offered to students. 
Even though the South is known for its conventionality and dogmatism, most of the youth, including UNA students, are more open-minded and eager to learn than one would expect. 
The only problem is, however, if you are an international student like myself, you will not find much transportation to get around in a relatively small yet exhaustively-long-way-to-Walmart college town. 99% of students own private cars and there is not much public transportation available in area.
Overall, it is a good school."
Sophomore,4,This university has a beautiful campus and great class sizes. It is great if you're looking for a smaller university.
Freshman,4,Throughout my first semester here at UNA I have really enjoyed myself. The environment here is like no longer and even if I'm far away from home it still feels like home up here. The people here are so nice and the campus is absolutely beautiful. The professors are top of the line and will help you at any time you need them. They are on a first name basis with every student which really makes you feel like they know you and care about you. I wouldn't trade UNA with any other college in the country and know for a fact that I made the right decision coming here and I look forward to my next four years here at the University.
Senior,4,UNA is a distinguished and respectable college that competes with the larger Universities in the state. My experience has been wonderful.
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at UNA thus far. The campus is phenomenal and so is much of the staff. I also have enjoyed living in the freshman dorms; they are very up to date, clean and well staffed! One thing that is frustrating, however, is the lack of available parking and the abundance of parking violations given this inadequate parking."
Freshman,4,UNA is a great school . It's a great campus with nice people .  It is the first school I applied to and fell in love with at the moment I got here . Now that I'm here the only thing i would like to see a change in is upgrading the food in the cafeteria and upgrading our safety .
Freshman,4,"I really like the fact that everyone is, if not welcoming, at least nice. Everyone here is so nice and it's wonderful."
Freshman,4,I like how how easy it is for freshmen to find buildings and how kind the professors are. I would change the ease of access for the dorms.
Graduate Student,4,"I just finished my first semester at University of North Alabama. I'm fully employed, I have a wife and a daughter, so an online program was important to me. I don't live or visit the campus very often. But, the courses that I've taken thus far have indeed been great. They were challenging and I felt enlightened after completing them. I have great expectations for the following semesters."
Sophomore,4,"The University of North Alabama is a great school with fantastic professors! The school is small which makes walking to class easy. Parking can be difficult, but they are working on fixing this issue."
Alum,4,Wonderful experience there over 20 years ago. Campus has definitely upgraded in beauty and more attractive than ever. Looking forward to the athletic teams moving to Division 1. Hope for continuing educational success and beyond. Roar Lions!
Freshman,4,I love how this school is so involved. There is always something going on and great encouraging people all around. Only change I would like to see if or parking issue being fixed.
Junior,4,I have had a pretty good experience here at University of North Alabama. There is always something to do when you're not doing school work. 
Sophomore,4,"I loved my professors in my field, which is Computer Science. They are always willing to help out in any way possible, and are very willing to help you find internships and help you find jobs after graduation. Some things I do not like about UNA are some of the basic requirements for each major. I do not like how they require so many basic classes that most of us will never use. Another thing I do not like is the housing situation. I live in Covington hall and I have found roaches on my toothbrush before, as well as in the kitchen. This is more on the Student's fault, as most do not know how to clean up after themselves apparently."
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful and just overall breathtaking. It's also a wonderful college, but mainly for the upper class. If you don't look a certain way don't bother. "
Freshman,4,"The University of North Alabama is a great 4 year college right here in the heart of Alabama. They offer so much in way of sports, college life, education and even the area around the campus in Florence and the Shoals is a wonderful place for young people to start their lives! The majority of students seemed very open to tell about their own college thoughts and even how things could be better. Overall the UNA visit was very good and has helped on my decision making!"
College Sophomore,4,"The Career center is extremely helpful in the resume building process, and even finding part time jobs while still studying."
College Senior,4,Very nice and home warming
College Senior,4,UNA has a great football program and great woman's sports
College Freshman,4,"In order to help freshmen like myself to better adjust to college life, my college has been creating events like movies on the football field, magic shows, talent shows and even a concert. These events help students meet and get to know other students, helping them feel more at home. These events have helped with my homesickness, making me feel more at ease and feel better being an hour and a half away from home."
College Freshman,4,The housing is great at UNA. They just built two brand new dorms for freshman that are very efficient. They have nice dorms for upper classmen  also. The dorms are great for having friends over and they are very affordable. Every dorm is in good proximity to classes.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is very encouraged towards new students and transfers. i'm not in a sorority but each one at UNA does great things for the community and the university. The fraternities are also a big help in the community and the university, and they also know how to have a good time. Non-greeks respect the greeks because they do community service projects and many other good things all around. There are greek housing available for sororities and fraternities."
College Freshman,4,"UNA has a great athletic program and they don't just focus on one main sport like some schools do. UNA equally supports every sport offered at the university. Our softball team just won the national championship in our division this year. Along with many other accomplishments, the football team and the baseball team have won several championships. Basketball is my favorite sport and the school shows great support towards the program."
College Sophomore,4,"so far, my classroom and course experience has been amazing. some teachers ive had are extremely passionate about their teaching and it shows in class. for the most part, course material is very well taught and it helps that class sizes havent been too big so far, which makes it easier for a student to get individual attention when needed."
College Sophomore,4,the campus is extremely safe and students seem to take initiative in preventing accidents such as sexual assault.
College Sophomore,4,"i stayed in Mattie lou residence hall for my first year at UNA. I loved the appearance of the building as well as the people that lived there, I pretty much knew everyone that lived there. One thing that i didnt like was the elevator issues we had throughout the year as well as having to deal with cold shower water at one point."
College Sophomore,4,"the athletic teams as a whole range from decent to great teams. the softball team was the best division two team nationally and the football team is also pretty good. our fan support and school spirit are generally pretty good, especially at the start of football season."
College Junior,4,The university has an outstanding athletic department and tons of school spirit.  It's really a lot of fun.
College Freshman,4,Where can going to campus is great day usually work around your class schedules and love having you there
College Freshman,4,Great life is great is always fun to find a new family to be a part of and they accept everybody for who they are.
College Freshman,4,Everyone always comes out to the games and have fun and there's always prizes and food for everyone
College Freshman,4,The School is great. Nice people and lots of stuff to do
College Student,4,The career center will help you with anything you need from your resume to finding jobs to interview for.
College Student,4,"Class sizes are normally 30 people, and I love that. The teachers actually care about the student and their academics."
College Student,4,Loved the new dorms for Freshman! They are great and newly built.
College Student,4,Athletic facilities are great! I go to them almost everyday.
College Freshman,4,The athletics program is one of the best.
College Junior,4,I participated in my schools Club Volleyball team as its first year and it was the best experience I've had in college.
College Freshman,4,I love the alumni support from the school. Everyone is supportive and aware of UNA as a whole.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes aren't to big and the teachers are great with students
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on campus! For the most part! Someone is always awake on campus.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are amazing at least the new ones are!! Better than Ive seen at big schools
College Freshman,4,Everyone for the most part respects UNA athletics we are National Champions in softball and conference champs!
College Freshman,4,I love the University of North Alabama. We have dominated D2 sports likes crazy this year! The atmosphere is amazing here. I can't complain at all.
College Sophomore,4,A degree solidifies my success and achievements.
College Sophomore,4,"If you are Greek at my school, congratulations, it's a wonderful life to live. The support they receive from school is respectable and they typically have a good atmosphere surrounding them wherever they go. I have thought about being a Greek member, but that lifestyle isn't for me. I view Greeks as normal people with a brand attached to them, which isn't a negative connotation of them, it just is what it us. Greeks have houses all around campus and you definitely notice the love UNA Greek receives."
Sophomore,2,"I, personally, have not felt at home at the University of North Alabama. It is a great school, but not for me. I long for the ""big campus"" feel, but this is just not where it is seen. The classes I have taken have been very easy. There is not much school spirit, and I'd love to see more of that."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus in Rivers Hall my freshman year was tolerable. My sophomore year in Rice Hall was frustrating. The building was old and outdated. It wasn't a clean building, it needed renovation and better structure. The only amenity was the proximity to and from class. I enjoyed being around other students and the social part of living on campus is incomparable, but the cost did not add up to the living arrangements. However, to be fair, UNA has new dorms that would easily sway my opinion if I were to live in the new dorms, but as for Rice Hall, it was the experience was abysmal."
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm not on campus late at night due to safety concerns.
Recent Alumnus,2,It would have been better if the Greek system did have so much influence on the rest of the university.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the showers don't work as well as wifi
College Freshman,2,"There are rules around here. But really there's no officers in the dorms unless called for a situation. Room advisors are really the only people that have a say over what we do but, they're students themselves so they're not strict at all. We basically do what we want. If an RA doesn't see it you'll more than likely not get in trouble."
College Freshman,2,Rooms are small.  Community bath - need I say more?  INTERNET CONNECTION RARELY WORKS!!
College Sophomore,2,"Dorm wifi is bad, but computer labs work well."
College Senior,2,"The nursing program is extremely challenging. The workload is intense and overwhelming. I do not enjoy the nursing program, but I look forward to beginning my career in helping others. The job opportunity for nurses is excellent."
College Senior,2,"There are only 2 main bars that people go to and you end up seeing the same people everytime you go. Parties at the frat houses can be fun, but often can be shutdown by campus police."
College Senior,2,"There are only a few local restaurants off campus that are good and cost efficient. Florence definitely needs more food options because there is a very limited amount currently. There is a decent amount of chain restaurants, but it could stand to have more local restaurants."
College Senior,2,Small school equals bored campus police.
College Freshman,2,The classrooms are extreme compared to outside.
College Freshman,2,If you dont have your car parked at a certain time (esp. around 10-2) those spots will be filled up. The likely hood of you making it to class on time is slim. ADVICE get there 30 minutes before class
College Junior,2,"campus shuttles are not the best, get there early, wait, and hope they show up on time"
College Freshman,2,It sucks this school is wack af
College Freshman,2,"This school is a cliched up school if your not frat or in a sorrority your a lame
all the white people here are racist af"
College Junior,2,"It's a nightmare, I'll be honest. You're only safe if you're an 8am class, or a 2pm class or later. That's when more spots are available. Also, with all the construction or new buildings going up, UNA keeps gaining, then loosing even more spots. Furthermore, we keep accepting more students, and this means more cars. Not so many people stay living in the dorm life, so a lot of people have cars and live off campus. Imagine the number of cars. You do the math. "
College Junior,2,"Parking in on or around campus is difficult. The campus lies within the main urban areas of the city which limits parking and makes students have to park on the street, sometimes far from campus. Provided parking by the university is terrible and what parking places exist are continually blocked off or not for student parking. "
College Junior,2,"parking is close to where you need to be, but you need to get there early because they fill up quick."
Alum,1,"The University of North Alabama is one of the worst schools that I have ever attended. When I graduated, I felt I had not learned anything at all and I was completely unprepared for the career that I planned to pursue. The students and student leaders act like UNA is a second high school because of their immature and bratty attitudes. UNA only cares about money and you can tell through the greedy administration and the low level of academics. The parking situation is also one of the worst parking situations that I have seen on a college campus. I could go on and on, but there is not enough space to describe the deplorability of UNA. Save your time and money and go to another school. You will regret your time at UNA."
Niche User,1,"Nursing Majors should check other places that puts more stock in the person’s character over a test score.  If you can ace the entrance exam go for it.  Otherwise you will have a hard time getting in.  The exam is a MAJOR part of their decision making process & UNA uses a floating bar for their scores.  So, if you score a six on the entrance exam this time & they only accept those that scored a seven or better, then better luck next time.  Just because you score an eight the next time does not mean you will get in.  The bar may be nine or better.  So you never know what you have to score, other than a perfect score.  You pretty much have to pass the nursing exit exam to get in (with a 90 or better).  Doesn't matter if you have good people skills or GPA.  If you’re in ROTC you may get extra points.  So those who struggle with standardize tests need not apply.  However, UNA is more than eager to take your money.  Excellent test takers do not always make the best nurses."
College Sophomore,1,I was forced into going to this school by my parents. I am not happy there at all but cannot afford to pay for school on my own.
College Freshman,1,"Terrible, a waste of time and money dont go here it sucks "
College Freshman,1,It's nasty and they take all your money for that nasty little dorms ew 
College Freshman,1,"At UNA, there are the stereotypical Alabamian types of guys, cowboy, southern types with an annoying drawl. None of whom would classify as attractive. Good luck if you're looking but you probably won't find anyone."
College Freshman,1,"The campus in general is ugly. If you're looking for beauty, search somewhere else as the GUC is an eyesore and even the center area around the ampitheatre is severely lacking. The buildings clash with each other and just aren't pleasing."
College Senior,1,Parking is absolutely HORRIBLE. Due to the University's location in a historic district expanding the campus let alone the parking is unrealistic.
College Senior,1,"Campus police respond quickly to underage drinking, smoking, ect but when it comes to more dire crimes they don't really help as much. As an example, there was a string of rapes last year that were never really addressed by the campus police. I just don't believe that they distribute resources as they should."
College Senior,1,"Parking is terrible, you have to get up basically before school starts to find parking spaces that aren't a mile from the school!"
College Sophomore,1,Freshman cannot park on campus if you don't LIVE on campus. You will almost never find a spot. Personally I park half a mile away from campus and walk. It takes less time.
College Junior,1,"The only thing UNA is strict about is parking.  The ""police"" here love to give tickets, even to people who aren't breaking any of the rules."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police are lazy and incompetent. You are highly likely to get a parking ticket for parking in a lot that stays mostly empty, but you also might get raped while walking in the parking deck."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on Campus is terrible! In most cases you have to arrive on campus an hour or more ahead of time to even receive a parking spot, let alone a good one."
College Senior,1,"Most of my graduate courses were work that didn't live up to the standards of my undergraduate degree. Along with rampant cheating and professors that just aren't that concerned about students, it's not a very academically sound place."
College Senior,1,Cheating Rampant – In 3 different courses I've had there have been huge instances of cheating. One professor literally watched as students used pictures taken on their iPhones to cheat on our final.
College Senior,1,"Professors Spotty at Best – Check the ratings on RateMyProfessor. They're pretty accurate. Most of them are part timers with low availability or full timers not truly interested in students. For a non-research, teaching school it has an amazing lack of student centered focus, especially in the College of Business."
College Sophomore,1,"There Just Isn't Enough of It. The parking situation at the UNA is horrendous. You have to time your arrival perfectly with the dismissal of the classes before yours. Otherwise, good luck being on time. I've gone from lot to lot countless mornings in search of a parking place only to be forced to park across campus and end up late for having to walk."
College Junior,1,"Although an effort has been made to help the situation, new students come to the campus every semester, making parking difficult!"
College Student,1,"Freshman students cannot park on campus and must park downtown and get shuttled over to campus and back. This is very hard for students who live off campus and not close enough to walk, very thankful i am not one of them. There is open parking after 4 p.m. which is helpful. I never drive to class because its impossible to find a parking spot!"

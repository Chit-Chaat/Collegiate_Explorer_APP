Junior,5,Northern is an awesome university. The small classroom sizes don’t make you feel like you are number like other larger universities. As an education major I believe it’s the best program in the Midwest. The professors and staff care about your success in and out of the classroom. They provide so many opportunities for internships and for education majors with in-classroom teaching. I haven’t found one professor or one staff member that I don’t like. I’d highly recommend Norther State University. And as always GO WOLVES!!!
Alum,5,I liked that the professors and faculty were available and genuinely care about each student’s success.
Sophomore,5,Northern State University is a very welcoming school. It is very easy to be able to talk with your professor and get to know them. They have many option on how to get involved and connected with many different people on campus.
Freshman,5,"It is an extremely beautiful campus. The professors are amazing and the classes are as well. They have a good variety of classes and offer online for a good amount of those classes, which really helps for those who have jobs."
Sophomore,5,I love going to school at NSU. The people are so nice. I am taking up Accounting and Education classes and all of my teachers so far have been great. The teachers really know how to connect and work with the students in their classes. One thing I wish to see change is the participation from students in the activities provided.
Freshman,5,"Faculty are very welcoming, It has a home feeling where to see the same few people all the time. Teachers get to know you. Facilities are awesome especially the new regional science building."
Junior,5,"Even though this school is a public school, the class sizes and faculty make this school feel like a private school.  The small class sizes give you more opportunity to ask questions and build relationships with professors.  This school also has great scholarship opportunities, as well as a low tuition rate."
Senior,5,"A UNiversity that faciliatate dreams. Encourages students , is at the best afortable price. Has all necessary supports that a student will need. There is not much distraction. Meet people from all over the world"
Sophomore,5,There would be absolutely nothing I would change at Northern State University. The professors and peers that attend Northern are some of the nicest people ever. The professors make sure they make time for you even outside of their office hours which is really nice with my work schedule.

Senior,5,"I love NSU. The faculty are fantastic and personable, the cost is unbeatable, and the campus is beautiful!"
Junior,5,"I went to Northern as a music major and absolutely loved it! The faculty in the music department is absolutely phenomenal. Not only that, but the entire campus is very supportive of the arts, which is hard to find at a school in the Midwest where sports tend to dominate. When they say you’re not just a number, they mean it. Even the general education professors know their students by name, even if they’ve only had them in one or two classes. Highly recommend to anyone that’s looking for a great education at a very affordable, smaller university."
Sophomore,5,Small classes with excellent professors who pay individual attention to students. Excellent community and resident life staff.
Freshman,5,"It was a really good college. The students are nice, the faculty are very friendly and helpful. I don't like that students are required to live on campus for the first two years, though."

The campus is safe and very nice. Northern State University has that ""personal touch."" The food is very good and there are plenty of activities to take part in. Being a member of the track and field team has been a positive experience, as well. I like seeing that Northern State University welcomes all races/nationalities. I would recommend Northern State University to anyone who wants to attend a quality institution!"
College Junior,5,My experience at Northern so far has been a rollercoaster. Trying to find the right career path for me has been tough but the professors have been wonderful and very helpful. Meeting new people is easy and every one gets a long. It's been great and I'm glad I chose this school.

I generally like to study in the library with no distractions."
College Student,5,I'm an Elementary Education major and I absolutely love it.  I can't wait until I get accepted into the School of Education and can get more involved in my major.
College Sophomore,5,I have not seen or heard of any theft in the dorms or around campus. It is a small campus so everybody know everybody.

Senior,4,The online transition was really easy and they're online classes are easy to understand. The professors are happy to help and ready for questions from students.
Senior,4,Northern has an amazing international program that helped me explore the world. They are a smaller campus so it's very welcoming. They really care about their students however I do wish they had more activities that were not centered around sports
Senior,4,"Very good online class system. My major doesn’t necessarily do online, so most of mine were elective classes. They get back to you fairly quickly & the classes are usually set up easy to navigate!"
Junior,4,"Overall I felt that online classes went well. I like how you’re able to do online classes on your time which makes it easier when you are working as well. It felt overwhelming at times when it feels like you are teaching yourself but gradually you learn that the professors are there to help you! In the end all the resources are there, you just have to ask!"
Freshman,4,Northern State University is a great university to go! The best thing is the community of Aberdeen loves Northern students and shows them love.

The resources on campus are wonderful and if used, you can really set yourself up for a lot of success during college and after graduation. Living on campus is a really fun time and the RA's and staff in the dorms are very supportive. The dorms are also very well kept and comfortable."
Sophomore,4,"It was my first tour that really sold me. There was just something about Northern that just felt right, as cliche as that sounds. It just seemed like NSU was the place I was supposed to be. From time to time I wonder why I chose to come here when there s not always something to do in town, but then I remember that there is no other place I would rather be in the long run. After my first year, I ended up liking it way more than I ever anticipated and couldn't wait to go back. I fell in love with the people and my teammates on the track team, I met a few of my closest friends I've ever had. The classes, of course, are more challenging but the professors are so helpful it makes up for it."
Junior,4,"My experience at NSU has been great and comfortable thanks to the staff and people.  It's a smaller campus, so it's very calm and easy to develop solid relationships with your teachers. My only recommendation for the school is to make their social events more social? Sometimes the programs and events feel stiff. Other than that, they do a great job and maintain diversity so you always feel welcomed."
Sophomore,4,I liked that I was able to attend classes in Huron at their Community Campus at a greatly discounted price!
Niche User,4,"I personally loved Northern State University. If you are looking for a smaller school, but still want to have all the things a big school does then Northern is your best option. I will be playing on their DII women's soccer team and their training and game facilities are very nice. The coaches are just as amazing. The professors are willing to work with you and the science profs love to do research!"
Freshman,4,"For such a small community, the faculty is exceptional. The professors I had have taken the time to learn our names and interact with us in a way beneficial to our own personal learning styles."
Freshman,4,Northern is the best. Its situated in a snall town and has the friendliest atmosphere ever.  As an international student thata anazing because you never have the chance to pine for home.  People ate friendly and the faculties and staff are very helpful.
Freshman,4,I love Northern State.  I am going to play college softball there and I loved everything about the campus
Freshman,4,The atmosphere at Northern is better than I could ever expect. Everybody is there to help each other. I wouldn't want anything to change.
College Junior,4,Northern has a great fan base for most of its athletic teams and the school has great school spirit in supporting our team. The team performance has been shakey but the athletes are doing their best and doing great.
College Freshman,4,"As for being freshman I'm still really new to this whole thing, its very nice coming from a tiny town. Its a small campus with a big campus feel."
College Senior,4,"From what I know, we do a lot with trying to recruit alumni to support the school.  I think we have a lot of alumni that work on campus or outside of campus bringing new students in."
College Senior,4,I love the small class sizes and how major-specific class sections tend to be.  Some professors tend to just read off their slideshow and not give you much more insight but others are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understood the material.
College Senior,4,"Fan support is not always the best, but when the students get together for homecoming the school pride really shines.  Everyone on campus is very friendly and when future students visit campus everyone takes time out of their day to show them around.  Our athletic facility (the Barnett Center) was recently updated and is made to accommodate everyone's needs."
College Senior,4,Northern State was an ideal place to receive my undergraduate degree.  The professors and upperclassmen were extremely helpful and willing to lend a hand where need be.  The campus is small so it is easy to learn your way around.  The people in the town are extremely caring and sweet.
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere at Northern is great! It is a small community in itself and people genuinely get to know you. Plus, the Aberdeen community is very supportive of the school and wants to see it succeed"
College Freshman,4,everything is great. some of the RAs can be a bit too strict. there were a few times where one of the RAs closed the 3rd floor bathroom for 24hrs each time. the offenses weren't that big and shouldn't have been carried out that way with that punishment.
College Freshman,4,health and safety on our campus is very supportive and helpful
College Freshman,4,we are very involved with sports and we support or teams all the time.
College Freshman,4,"its great, there are lots of choices to pick from but past 10pm, when people are getting off work or getting their late night cravings, there are basically no places to eat because everything closes around that time."
College Freshman,4,Food is good. Could be more options though
College Freshman,4,They helped me and knew what they were doing.
College Freshman,4,I live at home but i heard that it can be hard to live with others but it seems like people get a lot of living on campus
College Freshman,4,I had no problem getting aid for school. scholarships took time to get done but in the end was worth it
College Freshman,4,The nice part is having a room to your self but it can cause problems when you get snowed in and can't get to class
College Junior,4,"I don't personally eat in the Dining Hall on the NSU campus, but I do eat from the variety of different fast-food and eat-in restaurants here in Aberdeen. It has all my favorite fast food places, along with some I can't find in my hometown. There are also a vast number of great dining in restaurants to eat from."
College Junior,4,"Aberdeen has never been a primary choice of me to live, but it has everything I could ever need."
College Junior,4,Living off campus if way better than being stuck in the small crapy dorms.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are very strict on some things like keeping the halls or bathrooms clean and sometimes the noise level down at night, but most of the time the RAs don't really do anything."
College Sophomore,4,"Student life is good lots of space to hang out outside and do something like sand volleyball, throw the baseball around or football. Library is big, they have a zone so people can talk quietly and an upstairs that is all quiet and cant talk, and then they have rooms to work on group projects together or if you need some quiet by yourself."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is usually safe. There was once or twice this year that we have had a scare about someone getting raped but most of the time it is usually quiet around campus.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are very important and big when the school plays any sport from football to volleyball and basketball. A lot of fans show up including the students and locals. School spirit is wonderful always cheering on the guys or girls. The facility is in great condition.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a wide range of academics from pre med, early childhood teaching and secondary teaching, psychology, sociology, biology, coaching minors and endorsements and plenty more minors and majors. The professors are nice and most of them do care about your grades. Registration is pretty easy just fill out the registration form and housing. Workload most of the time is pretty easy, its usually just reading and then when midterms and semester testing come around than it gets a little harder. Study areas include library, student center, dorm, dorm lobby, mostly wherever someone would want to study."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere is good. There are recreations like parks and places to camp. A lot of places to shop like the mall, target, Walmart, and other little family owned clothing stores. Plenty of cops around town and around campus. There are the activities that the high school and two colleges have that the students and locals can go to. Most of the time there is always something going on."
College Sophomore,4,"The experience is good, professors help you out as you need and can go into their office or after class and talk to them. They all know your name so if they see you around campus they say hi. Class sizes are relatively small usually about 20 to 30 students, some of the general ed classes are a little bit bigger like my wellness and bio class that had to be a bigger room."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is nice, and a lot of people get along with everyone"
College Freshman,4,Enjoy all the local attractions and events to attend.
College Freshman,4,"Cost for transportation is almost non-existent. By living on campus all buildings for classes are located within walking distance, very convenient."
College Student,4,"There isn't too much diversity here at Northern, but for the small amount there is people are pretty accepting."
College Sophomore,4,It really is not hard at all to get into your desired major. It is a seamless process and there are hardly any requirements.
College Sophomore,4,no issues and we all just get along fine. no issues seen  or heard.
College Sophomore,4,well i really dont see others doing drugs at school and i really dont know who does. Not hte crowd i hang out with.
College Sophomore,4,i really enjoy what I am doing and learning in the classroom.
College Freshman,4,The sports department is big on campus and the students in them are some of the most studious do to the grade and attendance requirements. There is a lot of fan support for the teams and many alumni come to games.
College Freshman,4,There are many labs on campus to choose from. Some of the computers are slow to start.
College Freshman,4,"I have taken many classes at NSU in a variety of subject areas. The professors are knowledgeable, fair, and engaging. All classes seem to have some sort of presentation throughout the semester to aid students in public speaking skills. The advisers are always willing to help."
College Sophomore,4,Most of us have a house or rent a house in Huron. a beautiful little town.
College Sophomore,4,The professors in the business department are awesome. They will help students find jobs or internships and help train for interviews and stuff. I'm not that concerned about finding a job because I know I have lots of help
College Sophomore,4,Most of the students here are athletes or come from hardworking families on farms. People are down to earth for the most part and just like to have fun.
College Sophomore,4,"NSU is a very diverse school. We have a very large population of students from all over the world, and NSU has American students all over the world."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the buildings are recently renovated. The student center is brand new and people are there all the time.
College Sophomore,4,"They are strict with drugs and alcohol, which you would expect. Everything else they are really laid back and allow friends from other colleges to visit and stay in the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a lot cheaper to live off campus, you have to provide your own meals for the most part though. However, the school does not allow students to move off campus until after their sophomore year, which is a negative. "
College Sophomore,4,There are large parking on both ends of the campus. They are very close to buildings except for the building right in the middle of campus of course.
Sophomore,2,"Northern State University can be a great school, but it has MAJOR flaws. Professors are terrible about communicating with their students, when students email them. Most of them have terrible timing and wait until the very end of the semester to place grades. If a student is gone numerous times, they don't reach out. They make it seem like they don't care about their students. Yes, Northern has some great professors, but they have more professors who are terrible. Everyone at Northern who you'd expect to be able to help you, push you to someone else who ""should be able to direct you correctly"" don't."
Freshman,2,"Northern State has a very diverse campus. There are many students from other countries, and Northern is always great about welcoming them to the states! The academic advisors that you work with are absolutely great!"
College Freshman,2,they try their best to have healthy choices but the flavors are all wrong and they reuse left over food from the day before which is really gross.
College Freshman,2,"It's very cold, but I knew that when I came to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"If a future student gets the WolfPact scholarship for going right out of high school it is great. However, transfer students like me receive no reward for outstanding grades. Also most of the non guaranteed scholarships are only for students from South Dakota or another country."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a computer room but we rarely use it and if we do need it, it should have a printer but it does not.  Very few students bring their laptops, the few that do sometimes are not able to get on the internet in the building. Do all of my homework at home for these reasons."
College Sophomore,2,The reason I have It is bad for I am a student but no discounts in Huron SD for the University is in another town.
College Junior,2,"A lot of students use drugs and alcohol, but it is acceptable to abstain. "
College Junior,2,"This category is a wash at NSU, some policies are very strict while others seem to be non existent. "
College Junior,2,Things are average/ sub par at Northern State. Excitement and attendance in varisty sports is high during the early parts of the seasons and seem to fizzle out by season's end. 
College Junior,2,"Winter = Awful – The summer in Aberdeen is fairly normal for the Midwest. Hot and humid occasional storms, although they often receive more rain. The winter however is frigid. I have suffered through a few -35 degree days and it snowed and stormed almost every weekend."
College Freshman,2,We live in a mainly white rural area. There are a handful of internation students.

Graduate Student,5,"PUC had some of the best professors I have ever encountered. They invested in students both inside the classroom and out, often inviting students back to their homes for dinner or Bible Studies."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved the quality of professors at PUC, and the small size that made the university feel like a big family. One thing I would change would be more options for now vegetarians in the cafeteria. Many students drove off campus to buy meat, and the drive was somewhat treacherous, especially at night."
Alum,5,"One caveat. I got kicked out after my sophomore year. Granted, I lit a dresser on fire and threw it off the roof of my dorm. (Go Grainger!) However, after getting kicked out, I returned to graduate there.
I also graduated in 1996, so I can't speak to what the college is like now, but when I was there, it was ranked #7 in the nation for pumping kids into medical school.
Note, the college is a Seventh Day Adventist college. I grew up Seventh Day Adventist, so all the quirks that go along with that were things I was prepared for. (Dry campus, religious services, etc.) But for me personally, those were things that I appreciated and was grateful for despite my spirited nature.
The primary thing I loved about PUC was my peer group. I was an F-up in high school and needed to be surrounded by other pre-med students that could set a proper peer expectation for what was and would be required in the future in medical school.
I'm now a double boarded addiction psychiatrist and director of a rehab"
Freshman,5,"loved the campus! community and education! it’s perfect for anyone who wants to go into the medical field. doctors, density, pharmacist, nurses, and anything else."
Alum,5,My 4 years at PUC were amazing!  I truly loved living in such a beautiful location while being part of an institution dedicated to serving God and humanity.  The educators and friends I met while at PUC have stayed with me since graduating 17 years ago.
Freshman,5,"I've just enrolled. But everything I hear is amazing. The advisors from the college I'm in contact with, are amazing."
Senior,5,"PUC has provided me with the best college experience possible. The college is rather small but this allowed to me establish meaningful relationships with the professors, staff, and fellow students.  It is definitely not a party school but there are many activities like community service and worships available to the students."
Junior,5,"It is an overall great experience. There is a strong feeling of community and is a second home to me. I love that the campus have many activities to participate in such as movie and game nights, as well as, hiking trails and intramural sports."
Niche User,5,"During my visit at Pacific Union College, the staff and faculty were so kind and helpful. I fell in love with the school because of the welcoming environment and I felt like I belonged there."
Freshman,5,Excellent option. Highly recomended. Life as a Boarding student is gratifying. I learned to be independant and create my own study enviroment.
Alum,5,"Great Experience here. I took one year as a full-time student. my major, pre-professional dental hygiene. Counselors and  teachers where more than that and really good bonds could be made. As a soccer player, I enjoyed the time and sacrifices. "
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are just as you expect them to be. All the professors I've had so far are always willing to help guide students that may need extra help. The professors have a great relationship with the students, faculty and staff treat the students as oversized children, when not in a classroom setting."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a police station not that far from here. And all the students are very respectful to each other, in at least that way."
College Sophomore,5,Health is great and the school promotes healthy lifestyle choices from alcohol and drug abstinence to exercise and healthy dieting.
College Sophomore,5,We have absolutely no Greek life. This is a private Seventh Day Adventist school that does not support Greek life. Go to UC Berkley or UCLA
College Freshman,5,Most of the professors good at teaching their classes and helping students after class.  The workload is very heavy I have to say.  The library is probably my favorite place to study because they have study rooms that are really quiet so I get a lot of studying down there.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love their intramural program!!! It is a great way for students to easily get involved.
College Freshman,5,I enjoy the campus at my school and the community of people. The professors are great!
College Sophomore,5,"I always feel secure on campus. There were a few incidents, but they were resolved quickly and safely"
College Sophomore,5,"PUC is a fast-track to Loma Linda University. If you do well in the medical program at PUC, you should be lined up for school or job opportunities in the medical world."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors make the tough academic climate worth  it. They genuinely care about you, and are always there if you need help. Students frequently dine with professors, creating a strong sense of community."
College Sophomore,5,"Pacific Union College is a great school. What makes it so terrific is the sense of community. As a Seventh Day Adventist, I've found a place where I belong. I have met people, students as well as faculty, that will be friends for life. This community approach is translated in the academic realm as well. Classes are small, open, and I do not find it difficult to ask questions or express opinions. The course load is challenging but well worth it. I would recommend PUC to anyone preparing to attend college."
College Sophomore,5,"Pacific Union College is a great university with a flourishing environment. Yes, the  dorms may still need work,  and there are little annoyances that you have to get used to, but beyond that is the friendliness of the students and professors. Everyone on campus is invested in your academic success, and this makes a student feel as if they are never alone. People at PUC are very friendly, and it is near impossible not to make a new friend."
College Junior,5,I love the campus and the teachers are great and helpful. Great academic courses.
College Sophomore,5,Off-Campus dining is better than on campus
College Junior,5,Food in Napa Valley is great. There's a variety of food for everyone's taste buds.
College Junior,5,Administration takes a head in the sand approach to preventing sexual assault by simply promoting abstinence.
College Junior,5,"Progressive campus where most people are accepting of all sexual orientations, races, sexes, or whatever. A small subset of religious students are intolerant, as are some administrators. However, for most of us, the only thing we are intolerant of is bigotry! ;)"
College Junior,5,"Professors have varying experience, from seasoned professors nearing retirement to those who recently completed post-doctoral programs."
College Junior,5,"Everyone plays intramural. For most of my time here, the varsity teams haven't been very good but that seems to be changing and our teams this year are actually competitive!"
College Junior,5,There is a wide variety of options making this one of the best aspects of going to PUC.
College Junior,5,"Lots of partying here. Thirsty Thursdays at Ana's Cantina is pretty popular. Friday night is usually spent at parties. Saturdays most students go out and do things off campus, then drink at nearby cities. All in all, plenty of opportunities to get sh*t faced so no complaints here."
College Senior,5,"I don't see much - there's a zero tolerance policy. I know that some students are able to get around it, but then I don't see any, because I'd avoid it like the plague. So I like that there's ""none."""
College Senior,5,"I love the atmosphere - nature, forest, scenic, picturesque - but because it's rather remote, there's no public transportation or nightlife to speak of."
College Freshman,5,"The school is in the Napa Valley,  so the food is really good,  but really expensive"
College Freshman,5,"The varsity trams get good support,  but intermurals are the star of the show. We have the #1 intermural program in the US of A"
College Freshman,5,"We always feel safe on campus, and health services is always ready to provide help if you ever become sick or injured"
College Freshman,5,"PUC is in the Napa Valley,  one of the most beautiful places in America.  There are many hiking trails and places to jog around the area."
College Freshman,5,"The financial aid advisors are really helpful, and make sure they maximize the amount of money you receive"
College Sophomore,5,Financial Advisors at PUC are a great help toward achieving aid money you need to help pay for school.
College Sophomore,5,PUC is known for having a super active Gay Straight Alliance -- lots of activism from that segment of our community.
College Sophomore,5,They give out SO MUCH money in scholarships it's ridiculous.
College Sophomore,5,Great professors with lots of either top academic experience or real-world experience.
Recent Alumnus,5,My school is unique because it is the most beautiful campus ever! It is also well known for its academics. Very good science and nursing programs. It's the best choice.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are many activities on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,PUC wants students to succeed academically and spiritually.
Recent Alumnus,5,Everyone is kind and friendly.
Recent Alumnus,5,The campus is just the right size. You can walk to all your classes within 10 minutes or less and everybody on campus is so friendly. It feels like we are a family and you always have a chance to get together with friends.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love where PUC is located because you have access to great festivals, sporting events, shopping areas, and attractions. I always find some fun thing to do on the weekend and being at PUC allows me to live life to the fullest."
Recent Alumnus,5,PUC is a campus that cares about the well-being and safety of students. They quickly notify students of potential threats and they hold the safety of students in their highest regards.
Recent Alumnus,5,"PUC is near many great dining options with great food in Santa Rosa, St. Helena, Napa Valley, and San Francisco. These dining options will not disappoint and it is worth the drive to these areas."
College Sophomore,5,I wouldn't want to go anywhere else for my education.
College Sophomore,5,"The rules are so strict, that no one does drugs. I love this school."
College Freshman,5,"Majority of the guys and girls are great. They dress nice and clean, they have many hobbies such as playing instruments and planning social events, they are very studious and care about their future."
College Freshman,5,The scenery really contributes most to the overall atmosphere at PUC and makes it worth the money.
College Freshman,5,Nightlife is great because you can go out to eat. You can find really great friends here.
College Junior,5,I believe pacific union has very strict policy for students living on campus. Men and women don't share dorms. There are certain rules and regulations for going out at night. I believe these rule and regulations are keeping students to focus on why they are there. This schools focus is on education not partying. For people who love freedom and love to party a lot at night I believe it must be very boring for them.
College Freshman,5,"Since PUC is an adventist college, almost everyone is Adventist. Also, my school is very diverse and one race isn't seen as the bigger number."
College Freshman,5,My school has offers great academics. The environment is that everyone is focused on academics. It is school before parties. The professors are really nice and always willing to help. Many people flock to the library to study which is great because learning with other people motivates me.
College Freshman,5,"My school is  great. You never have to worry about your safety because the environment is very relaxed. I have never come across people on drugs, alcohol, or with weapons. I feel really safe on my campus."
Senior,4,"I took Spring 2020 quarter completely online. It was difficult keeping up with everything, but overall, the professors were pretty accommodating."
Senior,4,I have been at this school for quite some time. Overall a positive experience filled with a lot of growth and adventures.
Junior,4,The classes online at Pacific Union College are organized and easy to follow. The professors online work closely with their students and have a quick response time to any questions or concerns emailed to them.
Junior,4,Pacific Union College is a great school. They have many different resources to help you get through college. The college is beautiful and full of nature. Pacific Union College professors work closely with every student to help you succeeded. The one thing I would change about this college is the cost.
Sophomore,4,"So far, this school has truly helped me focus and strive for the best. I would not trade any other school."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are great and so are the students. This is a seventh-day christian school. This school has definitely helped me trust in God and strengthen my faith.
Freshman,4,"Pacific Union College holds a strong academic reputation that advantages other larger universities. The benefits of having a small community with a diverse student body Pacific Union College has a Christian environment. Although Pacific Union College may need renovations in their facilities, the college does not exclude the purpose of what it means to live with heart and to love and understand life."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my first quarter at PUC.  It is really easy to connect to the professors and the students. Because  of PUC's smaller size and secluded location, there is a  strong sense of community which helps develop a healthy atmosphere. Some of the students on campus complain about the cafeteria food but I like it. There is a wide variety of dishes in every meal time so you are bound to like something. I just wish that the dorms were air-conditioned because it can get really hot during the spring quarter. If you are planning on attending PUC, don't forget to pack a fan!"
Freshman,4,It is an amazing school that I hope to attend. Whenever I visit I am just amazed by how helpful everyone is and the community is tightknit.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience is really great, the people are amazing. I would recommend anyone to go. The food is really really nasty. I would recommend you to make your own food. The location is beautiful, there is a lot of nature, but it rains a lot, so bring rain boots and jackets."
Junior,4,The professors care about the students and due to smaller class sizes have more time to answer questions or meet out of class time. The campus is isolated in the mountains above Napa Valley but it is a very beautiful campus. The tuition is very expensive but the quality of the education and reputation of the school precedes you once try and apply for jobs especially if you are in the medical field.
Sophomore,4,"This college is amazing with their safety and academics. It can be boring if you are really into partying, greek life, and having nearby food and stores. The class sizes are small, which helps you learn better and helps more one-on-one teacher help and time. The campus is beautiful of the Napa scenery. You are close to San Francisco. 
I love how they have a teaching and learning center because you can get tutored for free on subjects that are difficult for you."
Senior,4,Pacific union college is a really nice school. One of the reasons I chose it was because it was small and tight-knit. Everyone on campus will smile at you and is always willing to lend of helping hand. The nursing program there is AMAZING and they truly prepare you for the NCLEX
Alum,4,"PUC offers an excellent quality education, particularly if you are interested in nursing or education degrees. The campus is wonderful, the people are nice, and the location is unbeatable."
Alum,4,It was and still is a great experience. But need more masters program and gpa changes to be made in some department or acceptions to programs depending on student situations.
Sophomore,4,There is a good spiritual environment on campus. The college is close to home so it makes it easier to visit family more often. There are many opportunities for success at PUC.
Freshman,4,"I just finished my first quarter at Pacific Union College, and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The ration between students and teachers makes it very convenient to ask help from a professor. I am a biology major looking to go to pharmacy school. The academic advisors are very helpful if you need help. The Dorm life is also very Good. There are many motivated students and seeing them be motivated also motivates you to do your best."
Senior,4,"It was rated one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. The staff and residents are friendly and helpful and kind. The cafeteria food is poor and the only way to get signal is through Verizon, it is also a bit isolated so a car is a must if you want to do anything."
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a wonderful, positive campus seated in the very green area of Napa Valley. The air is wonderful, and the climate is comfortable. The teachers are good at what they do, and everyone is very kind and approachable. However, the cafeteria does not cater to all eating types (it's all vegetarian), it's very expensive, the town is so isolated that one needs a car to get to Napa (or anywhere else for that matter), and some Major programs are not as large as others. I would recommend this college to people going into a medical profession."
Junior,4,"PUC is a great school. I feel that gives pre-professional students, especially med and dent, an extra leg up for getting into Loma Linda because of the formal interviews that take place on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse campus and the professors are always trying to help you. Their doors are always open. Being a christian campus, there are a lot of spiritual events. The campus itself is very beautiful and there are a lot of ways to be active on campus."
College Senior,4,"It's been very safe, I feel safe and secure."
College Senior,4,I've had a wonderful experience thus far.
College Senior,4,"So far the academics have been challenging, and professor have created a friendly learning environment."
College Junior,4,Public safety makes their rounds 24/7.
College Junior,4,Campus is great. My dorm is close by my classes.
College Junior,4,"Nursing program is great, challenged academically."
College Sophomore,4,There are many students that have been able to start their internships early because of positive recommendations from their professors.
College Sophomore,4,"I actually don't live in the dorms, but I do room in some of the other college housing. The rooms in the apartment I am in is a bit smaller than a single room in the dorms, but I really enjoy the bit more privacy I get."
College Sophomore,4,"Being an Exercise Ed. Major, this is the best I've seen"
College Sophomore,4,"It is my first year in college so I was expecting the worst. However, I was very wrong and I'm glad I stayed."
College Sophomore,4,Overall experience has been great. Students are easy to get along with and are very friendly. Professors find the time to accommodate to your learning styles and listen to suggestions.
College Freshman,4,I think freshmen year will be fun and challenging.
College Student,4,Professors are easy to get to know and the workload isnt very overwhelming.
College Student,4,The safety on campus is not a problem
College Student,4,"The school provides everything that I expect for my dream college. The class sizes are the perfect amount and not too crowded. The professors are very kind, sweet, and happy. I see the passion they have for the information they teach to their students. The people are fun loving, so I don't have much worry that I will make great friends there. The food and cafeteria is excellent. ""Surviving"" without meat is not a problem for me. The quality of the courses are impressive. They definitely prepare a student for their future career."
College Student,4,"There is a great atmosphere of spirituality and wonderful people. An abundance of nature is in every corner, giving the aura of God's creations wherever you go."
College Freshman,4,The public safety department at school is great.  They are always on top of everything that could seem harmful to students.
College Freshman,4,I think that the dorms are in excellent condition and the RA's are really nice.  I think the curfew should be later than 12am though.
College Freshman,4,"I love going to the basketball games that PUC puts together.  I go with my friends down to the gym 3 times a week at the least to play basketball and do any other sports we want to do.  I think the gym is closed at a great time during the week, but I strongly disagree how the gym is closed on Fridays at 2pm and closed until Saturday night it is too dead on the weekends and I am very bored and so I wish the gym would be open on Fridays and Saturdays.  I also disagree on having the student center closed on Fridays at 2pm and Saturdays."
College Freshman,4,I do not ever see anything that seems dangerous to me on campus. I feel safe to walk around at night.
College Freshman,4,I love my school. I appreciate the location and the people. The professors care about you. I wish the cafeteria did a better job and I wish they offered more degree/class options.
College Sophomore,4,"Nice campus, nice students and teacher.

However, the campus in on the mountaion. It is very hard to go out to the town or market.

You have to have a car or friend who has a car. If not, you will be stuck in the campus."
College Sophomore,4,This is a great unique campus and I enjoy attending here
College Freshman,4,It was a great experience and I loved the campus and everyone was friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great for someone who grew up a seventh day adventist and is looking to stay within that community. It would not be a good fit for someone who is seeking a secular college experience full of partying, drinking, and goofing off. My school is also not for someone looking to flaunt their college as being impressive a it is very small and not very well known. The school suits me, but I don;t think that it would suit most people."
College Sophomore,4,"College days was convincing and sure once school started it wasn't the same, but it was nice to have people around who are willing to answer any questions."
College Sophomore,4,I think that the professor are very eager and willing to help you succeed
College Freshman,4,The surrounding area filled with nature was amazing and the spiritual atmosphere on campus is very reviving. There are so many opportunities to be involved in many of our varied interests.
College Sophomore,4,Only thing to keep you occupied while here
College Sophomore,4,"took a bit of work on my end, but went well."
College Sophomore,4,"could use work, but good."
College Junior,4,"Lots of food places, if you don't mind a timely drive/carpool. Make a date out of it. Or even a road trip if you don't mind the drive to San Francisco. St. Helena is the cutest spot for cool cuisines. Napa has the fast food joints and the more commercial restaurants. Santa Rosa is the closest thing you'll find to that ""big"" city vibe, so that is where you'll find more diverse places to dine."
College Junior,4,"The financial aid process was pretty smooth. The school gives out scholarships, but considering the cost of tuition, they might as well not be giving you anything (it's honestly not even worth it)."
College Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful. You wake up the birds chirping, and a fresh feeling in the air. The social life on campus is laid back and chill. The people are friendly and genuine. However, since the campus is on a hill, being without a car makes it a challenge to leave and go anywhere remotely populated/commercial."
College Freshman,4,"The restaurants in St. Helena are great! Most of them are pricey because of the area, but the food has always been delicious! I don't know if any of them have student discounts, they don't advertise that."
College Freshman,4,I have never had any issues with the strictness of campus. The rules are there for good reasons and they make sense.
College Freshman,4,"I was able to receive around 12,000 dollars in scholarships directly from the school. That was great, because tuition is high. I still have to search for other financial aid though, because it's not enough to fully cover and I don't want to be a burden on my parents."
College Freshman,4,"I like living in the dorm. Laundry is rather expensive, it would be nicer if it was cheaper. Also, the rooms are a bit small, but it's doable. I had great RA's and the dean is awesome!"
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is a great way to meet people. You get to know the people in your dorm, classes, and clubs easier."
College Sophomore,2,too expensive for tiny portions and not too good.
College Junior,2,PUC does not focus on athletics. Intramurals are far more popular and encouraged.
College Junior,2,Our family makes too much to qualify for financial aid but not enough to pay for tuition comfortably.
College Junior,2,"It's really not that healthy, even if it's vegetarian."
Recent Alumnus,2,There were rare moments when I enjoyed a meal
College Junior,2,"PUC has an excellent faculty. Students are, for the most part, bright and fun to be around. PUC's administration, and in particular the Office of Student Life, are genuinely some of the worst, most asinine people I have ever had the unfortunate experience of interacting with. The most hated person on campus is easily the Vice President of Student Life."
College Senior,2,"Not much happens in Angwin, CA."
College Senior,2,"It's expensive and small. There aren't a whole lot of options. But what does exist is close to campus and has nice neighbors, at least!"
College Senior,2,"The athletics program is rather lacking. Intramurals are really important, well attended, and well publicized, but essentially everything else about the athletics is no good."
College Freshman,2,"This is a Christian school,  so parties don't happen, and if they do they are off-campus"
College Freshman,2,Most people live in the dorms
College Freshman,2,The WiFi signal is very poor and is not accessible throughout the entire campus.  Internet is very slow.
College Freshman,2,BORING. There are no parties or activities that go on. You have to entertain yourself in order to keep from getting bored.
College Freshman,2,"My school is very isolated. It sits at the top of a hill in Napa and the closest restaurant is 20 minutes away. There is nothing to do at my school and many times all you find yourself with nothing to do on a Saturday night. My school offers barely any attraction, it's all about studying."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much of a variety. They also over price everything.
College Freshman,2,The school is on top of a hill and so to get to places it takes about an hour. 
College Freshman,2,"It is almost impossible to live off-campus. PUC is isolated on a hill and off the hill, almost everything around is wineries and hotels or bed and breakfasts; not many places to live."
College Sophomore,2,"PUC is a vegetarian friendly school so we do not serve meat at all. It has it's perks because it gives a variety of different types of foods. However, because it is a vegetarian school it is a hard to get in the meat fill if you are not (like I am not a vegetarian) and the food after a while becomes tiresome."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the facilities are old and are in need of major renovation. Such as the weight room and the gym, even for a school of only 1,600 students, the weight room is not sufficient to take care of the needs of exercise hungry students."
College Junior,2,"Transportation is, expensive, and only in some seasons. Not transportation to nearer town or city but only to the airport."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life on our campus so this doesn't really apply to our school.
College Sophomore,1,dont know much about them.
College Sophomore,1,Cannot get an apartment unless your a married or have a kid and the waiting list is forever long
College Sophomore,1,No parties which is good
College Sophomore,1,very hard to find or hear about.
College Junior,1,"Srsly, ""what parties?!"" This is an Adventist college. In the middle of nowhere California. And good luck finding anyone on this campus that isn't a complete stick in the mud. No one lets loose like that."
College Junior,1,"They treat you like a child: curfews... 11 o clock check ins every night, it's ridiculous. And when I say check ins, I mean the RAs open your door with their annoying master key, and look in your room to make sure you're there, so they can sign you into their attendance system app thing. And if you're not, THEY COME BACK - at 3am! - with a flashlight. Also you get pinks (referalls) when you break curfew. No staying out all night until you're over 21, no boys in girls dorms, no girls in boys dorms except in the lobbies (and the opposite sex gets kicked out at 12)."
College Senior,1,"There's literally no Greek life to speak of on campus. Last year some students started the English Honors Society with Greek affiliation, but I haven't the slightest if it's still going."
College Freshman,1,It's the worst because they do not allow off-campus housing.  They should because it allows some people to really learn to be responsible.
College Freshman,1,My school does not offer transportation sadly.
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely no nightlife options anywhere close to the school.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at PUC and it is not allowed on campus.
College Freshman,1,"You NEED a car if you live on campus. It is isolated on a hill, which takes 10-15 minutes to drive up. The closest city is 15 minutes away but is more like a small town. Napa and Santa Rosa are the closest average sized cities and they are both about an hour away. There are no campus shuttles or bus stops but the Student Association occasionally takes students to places on weekends for free."
College Senior,1,Campus police are pretty strict about drinking regardless of whether you are of age or not. The school is affiliated with a christian church so they do not tolerate any drinking or drug use. The dorms are not co-ed and you can not have people of the opposite sex in your room.
College Sophomore,1,This is a christian school and we live in the mountain area kind of on  a hill. There are no local bars/club scenes unless you have a car and you go to Napa or to a small local town near by. If you want to do that then you need to have a car. There probably are parties but they are pretty well covered up so that the administration doesn't find out.
College Student,1,There is not much as far as bars and clubs. But the school is right in the heart of wine country so there is places near by that you can drive to. Nothing much like that for 18 and older.
College Junior,1,I am not really aware of too much student housing around the school. It seems as if students would have to drive far because the campus is farther inland.
Recent Alumnus,1,"On campus nightlife consists of vespers at the church, dinners at faculty homes, game night in the cafeteria, or classical music concernts.  Off campus nightlife is at least an hour's drive away and most of what you'll want to do is forbidden by school rules anyway."
College Freshman,1,"There Is None – To get to any sort of public transportation, you would have to walk at least ten miles down a huge and unsafe hill. There are no buses on campus to help people get around. This school is horrible about transportation."
College Freshman,1,"In the Middle of Nowhere – This school is up on a hill with absolutely nothing but houses for the people who work here, one little tiny grocery store with nothing but vegetarian foods, and there is no such thing as public transportation unless you count an ambulance. The closest town is very tiny and it is ten miles down the big hill. The closest city where there is decent shopping and attractions is an hour away."

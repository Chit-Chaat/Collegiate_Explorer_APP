Senior,5,This is a great school. The instructors are excellent and are dedicated to the success of the students. You can always reach the instructors and will go the extra mile to assist.
Senior,5,Vincennes University administrators and instructors did their utmost best to give the students the best online experience possible. Online school requires a lot of discipline but knowing that the instructors were a phone call away was very good.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Vincennes University is that they are determined to make sure that the students on campus get all the help that they need. The advisors on campus will make sure their students are mentally okay , stabled in all their classes , and make sure that the classes that they are taken are towards their degree."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Vincennes University has been the best experience of my life! I could not ask for a better college when I have it right in front of me. They do care about their students a lot. What I really like about my university is that their administrative process is the best. Everything goes down smoothly and organized. The teachers are the best and put their best foot forward and sacrifice themselves for you to have the very best year and the very best scores. They go above and beyond in teaching and have the best curriculum to start with. Even though some of the majors are technical, the teach you a lot more than what you need to know and that is a plus! For me as I am studying Business Management, i can say that I have learned more than ever. Even if I go to Barnes and Noble to read a business book,m I can get more than that book here at Vincennes University. What would I like to see is for them to keep at ti and never give up and strive for more. I'm sure you will love it."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience with Vincennes University was well worth it! I did however feel a bit nervous because I am so used to being on campus. Whenever we all started to go online because of covid-19, I got the hang of it and thanks to my professors, they did a great job of explaining wherever I needed to go on the website and they went the extra mile to get me to where I needed to be. I also was grateful because they had their virtual office hours so any questions I needed I did not have to go all in the email and I could just be direct with the, in their virtual office hours. They helped me with all of the questions I needed and they made sure I was doing okay and that I was up to date for any assignments that I needed to do. I do like how Vincennes University manages circumstances like covid-19 because they look for ways for us students to keep learning even if we are having our worst moments. They like to keep things positive, but they do understand what everyone is going through."
Sophomore,5,I had a great time and learned a lot. There chemistry department is not good but there is plenty of help in the learning lab though. There was only one professor that I did not care for.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love VUJC. I am a nursing student there and they accommodate my single mom lifestyle so perfectly. Great professors and environment.  Great place for a parent trying to better themselves!
Sophomore,5,Distance learning is amazing and easily explained. Professors are attentive and care! I have genuinely enjoyed my time and VUJC and I am very eager to get back to class!
Freshman,5,"Everything at Vincennes University is amazing. No matter what the issue is, somebody is there to help you."
Niche User,5,They're a great school. The people that work there are really nice. Their campus is really nice. I got invited to Vincennes University for the SkillsUsa  competition for Auto body Collision Repair and Technology.
Freshman,5,Love it here! Teachers are willing to help.. I work on campus where we have a pol and even our own bowling ally
Sophomore,5,"Overall I love Vincennes University. I come from a small town and a small high school, so the transition to Vincennes University was very smooth. Vincennes is a smaller school and as a student you get more one on one time with your professor than you would at a bigger school. I like most how small the classes are. There is also a lot of help offered at Vincennes University. A math lab and writing lab are available all the time if needing help. At Vincennes University they have an awesome student union for all students to chill and get homework done. It has been a great place for me to go between classes and eat my lunch and get homework done at. It is also fairly cheap compared to other colleges. One thing that has been a struggle for me since I am a commuter is finding parking. So if I could change one thing it would be the parking situation. Overall though Vincennes University is a great college and I highly recommend it."
Niche User,5,My mom just graduated from the sterile Processing program and she loved it. She said the instructors were assertive and helpful which made it easier to learn and transition into a full time sterile processor at a local Hospital before even getting certified. They did mock interviews and study sessions after the program to get you ready to enter the field. I am now trying to get into dental assisting there but we are experiencing financial hardships. Hopefully I can get awarded a scholarship to further my education!
Junior,5,"I love it there. The people and the area and the professors are just absolutely great. The food is great as well. Along with the food,  the athletics and the swimming areas and the dorms are astounding along with everything else. The friends that you met yearly are one of the best people you will find in your life time."
Sophomore,5,I liked how helpful all the staff was. There were several ways to get extra help if it's needed. I loved all of my professors also.
Sophomore,5,"I currently attend VU Jasper Campus. The classes are small, which is nice. It is also closer to home for me. I love the campus."
Graduate Student,5,"Vincennes University was my first college experience, and I can say it was and amazing one. The campus was nice and safe. The university offered amazing events to attend, that were unforgettable."
Sophomore,5,I liked the local atmosphere. VU is a university where you can go and learn one on one with fantastic professors. The professors and staff are very helpful with whatever you may need. The only thing I'd like to see change is more 4 year degrees that could be earned on campus.
Niche User,5,I really liked the way the college looked and felt. It is well developed and some of the new buildings like the engineering building are pretty insane. I met one of the teachers there and he was pretty awesome.
Freshman,5,I love everything. The campus is easy to get around. You can get involved in a lot of activities. I made the bowling team.  Great support from teachers.
Niche User,5,"Vincennes is a nice college and welcomes anyone and everyone that gets accepted and would like to go there. Vincennes just gave me the home warming feeling that I have been looking for. The people there are really nice and help guide you if needed. I am very excited to join them next year and make it my home for the next four years! I love the atmosphere it has because it is so different than any other college I have visited. The dorms are very nice, I stayed there over the summer and it was one of the funniest times I have ever had. The cafeteria is also very good and has many different selections."
Freshman,5,Vincennes University is a great school that offers a very wide variety of programs. The professors do a great job of teaching and are always willing to help when needed.
Alum,5,"I went to Vincennes University from 2013-2018 and I enjoyed my entire time there. Sure there were plenty of students that struggled and didn't enjoy it, but I think that happens at every college, it's a place where kids are now adults and they find what does and doesn't work for them and sometimes school is just not for them. I lived in the dorms, lived off campus, lived in campus apartments, ate at the dining hall and joined a fantastic sorority while there. I had a great experience and hope that everyone who goes there has the same."
Sophomore,5,Vincennes University was a wonderful first experience of college life! It offers wonderful tuition at an affordable price; most of the professors are wonderful and want to see their students succeed; and most professors have had experience in their field before they came to work there. There are excellent class sizes as well.
Freshman,5,There should be more options for food on campus. There are only two spots for food on campus so if you want to get something different you have to go buy something off-campus.
Alum,5,"I attended Vincennes University via the Jasper Campus as a non-traditional student with children at home.  I enjoyed the professors and my classes immensely.   The classes were small enough and professors invested enough in our success that individual help was always available.  I would recommend the school to anyone.  Perhaps most importantly, the tuition was very reasonable."
Niche User,5,"What I personally loved about Vincennes was that it’s nice and quite , and it seems like students and teachers get along well."
Sophomore,5,Attending Vincennes is one of the greatest experiences a college student could ever have. The small campus makes it easy and available for all classes and its a warm home feeling living on or near the campus. Academic wise it is a great school to start out if you're still deciding on what
Niche User,5,The Distance Education option is excellent for students who have a family or are currently working. You can fit school in to your schedule!
Junior,5,The faculty is wonderful to work with. Everyone is freindky and easy to work with. Campus and the town offer many great experiences!
Freshman,5,The only thing I wish could be changed would be to add a soccer team because I love soccer and would love to be on a Vincennes University soccer team. Other than that everything else is very great!
Freshman,5,"My experience with Vincennes University has been great the teachers are very helpful, and the Tudors are great as well. what I like about Vincennes university  is that the school is very diverse and always have fun and exciting events for students to be involved in. I love that the teachers actually care about their students education they stay after class and help the students become successful in the class room.  Also, Vincennes university has a great clubs like student government and honor society and fraternity and sororities that are actively involved on campus and in the community. What I would like to see change is the cafeteria food selections I would like them to offer more of a variety of foods"
Freshman,5,"Vincennes University is a wonderful place to further your education. The professors are amazing, helpful, and kind."
Junior,5,Great programs with help in every area you could possibly need. There is a lab in almost every building and professors who are very understand and will help with anything you do not understand. I have found that my professors really do care especially if you take the time to get to know them. I'm in the education program and love the people I work with and the professional standards they hold us to.
Niche User,5,Vincennes University is a very safe campus for those who’ve don’t feel safe. They even have police escorts in case you don’t feel safe. The students are very active and very helpful with one another. They even offer free tutoring for those who need it. There campus food is amazing and have a variety of different foods.
Sophomore,5,"Vincennes University (VU) is located in a boring town and this was the reason I chose it because it would allow me to stay focus on education. This is my second year studying in VU. I found that the professors are truly passionate on teaching and friendly! Their office doors are always open and they love students discussing with them! For homework, it is in an appropriate amount and it always help me grasp important concepts and get prepared for every quiz and test. There are many resources on campus. For example, COPE, a student support service, provides students with free tutoring, transfer-college tours, and regular community services. Apart from the education aspect, there are tons of leadership opportunities. For example, the Student Government Association, different club leadership positions, Resident Assistant, theater manager, etc. The teacher advisers are always so helpful assisting us to organize programs to foster students all-rounded developments."
Freshman,5,The professors here are very hands on. They do a lot to get to know each student in class. The classes are small which makes for a better learning experience and less distractions.
Freshman,5,I really like the atmosphere there. Everyone is willing to help you out where ever you may need it. THe teachers there will go out of there way to make sure you are getting what they are teaching.
Junior,5,"I  really like Vincennes University. This university is both affordable and close to home. I love that I can save money while attending Vincennes University and in turn, I won't have as many student loans to pay off."
Senior,5,"Vincennes University is great school for a student who is looking for a smaller, more hands-on college."
Freshman,5,What a great campus! Never had a moment where I was looking to transfer and always felt same while in the school grounds. Professors are fantastic!
Freshman,5,"I'd tell others about VU, but only for 2 year programs. Right now, the food isn't the best in TDC but in the new union the food is good, just sort of expensive."
Freshman,5,"I like the class sizes, they are small so you have more one on one help from the professor.  What I would like to see change is more variety in food choices on the weekends."
Freshman,5,I just enrolled to Vincennes University and will be attending starting March 3rd. I have not been in school since 2001 and I think it will be a wonderful experience.
Senior,5,I am in the Surgical Technology program at VA andI have enjoyed my experience.  The classroom setting is small and you can get custom attention from excellent instructors.  We are all encouraged to work and practice as a team in an environment that promotes academic excellence!  The program is fast paced and intense and my clinical experiences have been fantastic.  I would recommend the program to anyone interested in a career in surgery.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love Vincennes! I wouldn't change anything about it. Even with all of the construction with building the new science building, this is one great college! Social life is wonderful and the academics is unbelievable! I look forward to Vincennes in my future."
Freshman,5,I really like the class sizes.  There is about 30 people to a class.  Your teachers know who you are and I like that they have office hours and they can help you.  But they really need more parking for residents.  
College Senior,5,The education I have received from college is excellent. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful in what they are teaching. They are able to link it to the real life and what to expect.
College Freshman,5,Learned a lot so far.
College Freshman,5,Best school I have ever been a part of.
College Senior,5,scheduling classes around work and family is amazing
College Senior,5,this school offers classes that you can easily use

College Sophomore,5,They do help you get going. And there are programs to help
College Junior,5,"The instructors go over and beyond to teach their students different techniques and give great advice of how to perform a certain weld. They take their time to make sure their students are not struggling and can understand their work. With their ways of teaching and what I have learned from being their in 2 semesters, I can immediately join the work force and perform great."
College Junior,5,"I am still only in my second semester of my first year. However, anytime I have asked my adviser for information about internships or the process of obtaining my degree he has been extremely helpful."
College Freshman,5,"It is really easy to transfer credits, the classes are easily made-up and the professors will work with you."

Freshman,4,"Really amazing staff! My teachers are very patient and understanding, especially with COVID and other hindrances."
Freshman,4,"Very good school for those who would like to pursue a career in aviation. The instructor are amazing and they work closely with their students to insure the best outcome. The pace is fast moving, but efficient and the experience of flying is all the more satisfying."
Freshman,4,"Vincennes University is a great school to learn and have fun with clubs and sports. Vincennes University will help you find yourself in more ways then one if you are not sure about a Major you can take more than one. I found a great major to fit all of my needs and love learning about it, so come to Vincennes University and have fun"
Sophomore,4,"I appreciated the dedication of the professors to their students, and the effort that the administration went to in order to provide me with financial aid."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, its a in expensive college to get the program that I want to do. The professors are very helpful, they want you to succeed. Its a average size campus, not too big and not too small. If this college is close to you, I would highly recommend studying here to get your degree."
Sophomore,4,"Based on my experience at Vincennes University, I love the fact that the campus is small and is easy to get around. The small classes sizes also make it very easy to communicate with the professors, which helped to learn and comprehend the material we were learning better. However, one negative aspect was the conditions in the Harrison Dorm Housing. The rooms were extremely small and hard to move around in, and pests were present from time to time within the ventilation units which caused for the need to relocate to a different dorm house."
Sophomore,4,Clean and nice facilities. I just wish the food at the dinning hall was better. Professors are helpful for the most part as well.
Sophomore,4,I like to say in my two years here at VU I really liked it. I have made friends with people that will last me a lifetime. The teachers are good depending on who you have they some are willing to go above and beyond but other will look at you and not willing to work with you
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of Vincennes University. I feel respected and appreciated as a student with every classmate and member of staff.  Vincennes continues to display cultural enrichment and individual freedom as they teach us from day one through their core values. The academic advisers provide great resources for becoming and remaining a successful student.
Niche User,4,I went to a campus visit and I was absolutely in love! It's a very good transition from high school to college.
Freshman,4,"I think Vincennes University is very helpful with getting any one started and encourage them to pursue the major that fits the person.  Very pleasant, understanding and staff finds way to help everyone"
Niche User,4,Vincennes University is a decent college for a broad amount of majors and has a well-maintained environment. There is a lot of students at almost every area of the college at all times. The gym & dorms are decent sizes and present themselves as comfortable to me.
Sophomore,4,The campus is easy to get to know and easy to get around and the teachers are very good and understanding.
Freshman,4,This university is a pretty great place to pick if you're needing a cheaper place to start with your degree. The fact that that college is so small makes it easier for someone to get plenty of help if they need it.
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful and the people there are so helpful and caring. I also really like the campus because the students and staff care about each other. Vincennes makes you feel like your at home.
Sophomore,4,"I have been a student at Vincennes University since 2016 studying Biomedical Electronics. For anybody looking for a comprehensive hand-on in technology will love it. Professors and students in the technology department are like family.  

 Vinceness University is also located in a small town with less destruction. There is less partying and more focus."
Junior,4,I would like to see more in regards to more clubs for lgbtqia+ and those that are non-Judeo/Christian/Muslim religions.  But the teachers are very understanding and many are willing to accommodate particular situations. Some will go out of their way to be able to help students make the most of the education they are trying to get.
Sophomore,4,"I've been here for over a year now it is my second year here at Vincennes University and it has been great. The education that my professors give me is beyond what I expected when I came here. I've learned more information about my major, and it makes me want to use that knowledge to pursue my passion even more greater than previously. The professors are so caring and they want the students here to become successful in the end. It really helps me as a student, to push not only myself, but my professors to show them that I deserve to be here. The people that I've met here are so nice and kind. Some of the people that I have met, they have became some of my closest friends that I hope to have a connection with for a long time."
Freshman,4,The college offers a very good program for my major. Students are very social and like to have fun while getting work done in the process. The teachers help the students get the best grades they could possibly get through the semester.
Junior,4,"I am still attending, but so far the school is very nice. The only negative thing about it would be the fact that some teachers don't care about most of their students. There is no interaction between the teachers and the students. However, the higher classes that you take in the college, the more they seem to care. So, classes for new students are going to be difficult due to the inconsistent teaching methods from the first year and second year teachers. This makes it difficult for the students to want to go to class and learn. I would know, I was that student."
Senior,4,The professors are amazing and I love the small class sizes! The price per credit hour is extremely affordable. The staff is very knowledgeable and always willing to help with any questions one may have! I love the ability to take classes online and utilize an exam proctor for testing. The university has several extension campuses which is a tremendous benefit as well!
Sophomore,4,"It's a fairly small campus that offers small class sizes so you can interact one on one with your professor if you need to. There are plenty of student ran clubs so one is sure to fit any attending student, and if there isn't a club you would join or there isn't one you would like to see starting a club is a fairly easy process as well."
Freshman,4,Vincennes University is a great college due to the fact it’s a cheap college to get in to. It’s one of the cheapest colleges in the state and it’s really nice for it’s price. Class size is small which is convenient for those who want smaller classes instead of the high-numbered classes. Professors can focus on the student even more and can help out when they need it.
Graduate Student,4,My overall experience with at Vincennes University was a great and educational experience. You learn alot and its a new environment to get used to but there education is one i would recommend to all.
Sophomore,4,During my year at Vincennes I have learned a ton. With my time I have been here it is safe to say that if you have a question the professors will answer it as well as possible and will make the subjects more understandable.
Junior,4,Vincennes University is a great college for technical degrees. It has a lot of opportunities for extra help with classes in the learning labs. Professors care if students show up for class and if students understand the content.
Niche User,4,"Great open house for students and parents.They gave small group tours and allows us to ride in a golf cart due to my disability. Every department  had representatives  to talk and ask questions. They provided  each student with T-shirts and nylon bags.They help us learn about financial  aid, housing, classes, and admissions.Very nice tour for your student  to see the class area ofhis or her major and meet 
the teachers and currents students  of the program. Got to eat free meal at food hall and experience  the awesome food.We tour the dorm room also. Vincennes University has a great Step Program to help students with learning  disabilities and ADHD.They staff was great. Admission staff helped get application  completed."
Freshman,4,"As an entering freshman, the college has been very open and generous with helping me. It is also a rather cheap college."
Sophomore,4,"All of the professors that I have had so far really care about the success of their students. I like the overall cost of attendance for Vincennes University. Something I would like to see change about VU is the campus. I feel it could use some liveliness such as flowers. It wouldn't take much. Overall, Vincennes University is a great college."
Alum,4,"I attended and graduated from Vincennes University with an Associate's degree in graphic design.  I can't speak for other areas of education, but from what I experienced over the course of two years, I can say that the art program is top notch.  I loved my professors and their hands on and personal techniques.  I know this sounds cliche but they really do care about your success and will go above and beyond to help you.  I would HIGHLY recommend attending Vincennes University if you are thinking about starting a degree in art or are interested."
Sophomore,4,The school is very nice for a junior college (there are some 4-year programs). The food isn't bad and the gym is phenomenal. All the professors I've had are very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,4,"Vincennes University Jasper Campus is a diverse university which allows students to be themselves. It's composed of mostly commuters who are wanting to stay at home and safe money, and also older people who are wanting to go back to finish school."
Sophomore,4,"I have lived in Vincennes all my life and decided to stay here in my hometown to go to college here. I heard from my different community schools that Vincennes University was an overall good college because of how friendly and helpful the professors were. I decided to attend college there and found out for myself that everyone was telling the truth. This college might be smaller than some of the bigger name colleges, but Vincennes University is definitely better than some of these bigger name colleges."
Sophomore,4,It is a nice small campus. There is not much to do in town. Students do not get told of many of the events that are going on around campus.
Freshman,4,I love Vincennes University. I chose to live off campus and completely regret my decision. The campus is beautiful and there are always lots of fun things to do. 
Niche User,4,"This college is extremely affordable for students and the academics are pretty good. While there is a shortage of professors, the professors currently there are amazing. They aren't just teachers, they are a students friend that is helping them get their education. The professors here really go out of their way to benefit students. There is a decent amount of diversity here as well as great people."
Freshman,4,I am having a good freshman year so far. Many new friends and new atmsophere. Everyone is very active and social to mostly everyone. The professors are very good and also respectful to us. 
Niche User,4,"I have visited and I take college classes from Vincennes through East Allen University, and the Professors and staff have been nothing but thoughtful, helpful, and motivational."
Niche User,4,"Over summer, I stayed at Vincennes University for six weeks. The dorms were clean and had good heating/cooling. The food was minimal, not many people were there over summer. The town is small, not a great location, but not bad either. The campus felt very safe while I was there. "
College Junior,4,"The American Sign Language Program is excellent, and available to reach a broad age scope. The professors are excellent."
College Sophomore,4,Hopefully I will move on the advisors here have guided me so far on my next step and I trust them to give me advice on what's next .
College Sophomore,4,I did chose ISU but I heard a lot of negative info about that school so I changed  to Vinu I think it was best.
College Sophomore,4,Still learning I hope to move on to the next level in my life .
College Sophomore,4,I have no complaints as of now.
College Senior,4,Very easy to access and use

College Sophomore,4,very personal and seem to be happy to be teaching
College Sophomore,4,I believe the graduates are very knowledgable and ready for the work force
College Sophomore,4,I think its a great school and a great price.  I would recommend it to anyone

College Sophomore,4,They help you get going in the work force before graduation. at least in my major
Sophomore,2,They just loaded busy work. I was doing 3 to 4 times more work than I was when in class. They were good at responding though. Also DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT LET VAUGHN SCHEDULE YOUR CLASSES!
Alum,2,"Fifty years after graduating, I still see comments about the town folks not embracing students! Without VU, this town would blow away like the dust bowl cities of the 30’s. Just a shame.

Freshman,2,"I thoroughly enjoy my major (Conservation Law Enforcement). But that is truly the only decent thing about this school. VU is very small and is a total joke of a college. There is NONE of the typical ""college feel"" here and nothing seems to be taken seriously. The school is dominated with a very strange crowd of people and there is VERY little student life and party scene. If you plan on getting your degree and having some fun along the way, this is not the school for you. I will be transferring just after my freshman year is over."
Freshman,2,"I’m a freshman at Vincennes University and I strongly feel that VU could use a lot of help when it comes to helping their students. First off, the financial aid building is no help.. some professors are rude but some are really nice. The food is not good it literally makes me sick. The campus is so small and not very diverse and although VU admits anybody into their school I believe that should have a second guess at some people. I wouldn’t have thought fights would be happening nor bullying and the school not stepping in to do anything! Now if you commute from home or off campus housing you might have a better experience but if you’re staying on campus in the dorms ... think twice! The water in the tub doesn’t stays in till after you get out, some of the sinks are clogged and some of the beds aren’t protected! I feel the faculty needs to be addressed and something needs to be done to make Vincennes University a better college campus and to make it feel more like home!"
Junior,2,Very Poor professors and Extremely bad financial aid and any other assistance help. I personally have gotten told to drop out multiple times by professors for small petty reasonings.
Sophomore,2,I feel that Vincennes is desperately lacking in the cultural department. The financial aid helps no one! Every classmate at my school at least 3 out of 10 cannot continue the course because of the pricing or lack there of efficient up to date books and novels. I was extremely disappointed my last year at the University it has changed dramatically. There is NO MultiCultural organizations. I believe the school board at VU needs to be addressed . The majority of the student dorms are trifling and needs serious attention. We spend so much money for a greater future and excellent education but our living environment is poor like my rating. I don’t mean to bash the school but the truth must be told.
College Sophomore,2,i do not like online courses. i do much better in a classroom where the topic is discusses amongst everyone
College Junior,2,"I was not impressed with my teacher, as she did not explain what I was required to do for the class. It seemed more like she was there just to do the grading, and hardly anything was taught."
College Junior,2,"There are many good people at Vincennes University, and especially in the PTA program, students are outstanding in character.  However, I do not always feel safe walking around campus.  There have been several times I have been approached by students of the opposite gender who I do not already know.  In one instance, another student who I didn't know yelled at me at the top of his lungs on my way back to my dorm to ""Turn around.""  Most of the time, I hope that these students are just trying to be ""funny"" and don't actually mean to cause any fear or harm, but I haven't always felt convinced of this.  There are many groups of African American males who are often loud and disrespectful.  However, there are many white males and females who are profane also.  I have made friends with students of both races and genders, however, and I am thankful that during many of the times when I have felt threatened, there have been multiple people that I can turn to for protection/reassurance."
College Junior,2,financial aid is very unorganized
College Junior,2,They have a horrible financial aid office. they will put you on hold and will barely help you with your problem.
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is really hard to get here if you're an average, white, middle class student here. They don't really try to help you but instead offer several reasons on why you're wrong. Also they don't offer a break down of fees before you choose your major."
College Freshman,2,"Vincennes University is very diverse, it's majority black and white. If someone don't know you they don't talk to you  for most people. I guess you have to run into people that's friendly and don't care about the color of your skin."
College Freshman,2,I don't like this school
College Junior,2,"I've had multiple problems with the advisors, but the instructors are very easy to work with."
College Senior,2,"I'm a Business Management major. The workload isn't strenuous, that's if your advisor cares enough to put you in the correct classes. Job opportunities are not well announced, aside from the job fairs they hold once per semester, nor internship opportunities."
College Senior,2,"The advisors signed me up for classes I did not need, were not interested in students success and the registration process is complicated. Availability of classes is poor. The staff and faculty seem extremely careless and aloof to student needs and success."
College Senior,2,"The tuition is reasonable for the school but some of the finacial aid officers can be of no help, you really have to know which people to go to. Some will tell you what to do but not help you with doing, or give you the information as to why you owe the school a certain amount and dismiss you even though you are still confused."
College Junior,2,I have had a problem with my homework i can get assigned up to twenty four assignments a week. The stress of so much homework often reflects on my in class assignments.Which makes it hard for me to transfer with such low grades
College Freshman,2,its primary a 2 year school. so most people transfer. it is a great school to start out at or get a degree at.
Graduate Student,1,"I had very bad experience, like the ones that made me lose my full scholarship to Charleston Southern University. The communication was bad with my professor. I was being put in a course with a professor I didn’t  understand or we didn’t connect well."
Niche User,1,This is a horrible place and a horrible town. Never go here. Nothing here is worth your time. They will screw you over for the rest of your life for classes you didnt even take.
Freshman,1,"Vincennes University is a cheap college, and what you pay for is what you get.  There are several AMAZING professors there who love their job and want students to pursue better in college.  That is really the plus side about the school.  The parking it terrible because there are only a few small parking lots.  Everyday, I literally drove around for 20 minutes looking for a parking space.  It does not sound bad, but when you have a 40 minute commute, you will realize. The way the campus is set up is ridiculous.  And, there is a Jasper Campus and Gibson County Campus.  The Gibson Co. Campus is closer to my house, almost half, and I fight tooth and nail to have classes there.  No one at the Vincennes Campus wants a student to go closer to home.  Also, lastly, the advisors know nothing about different types of majors.  My READING advisor had no knowledge about the medical field and its majors.  Enough said."
College Junior,1,I do not like it my professor does not help me at all.
College Freshman,1,I really hate it here. most people who go here are leaving
College Junior,1,There is only one thing that sets our school apart and that is the performing arts center that was named after a comedian name Red Skelton.
College Junior,1,I would rate my overall experience a 1 because I really don't like the school it is a small campus and there is nothing really to do around the area.
College Junior,1,"Financial Aid at VU is a hassle to deal with. They don't provide valid information to whatever you ask. They just give you the complete run around and don't say anything about it. VU also likes to slam you with random charges and doesn't let you know why you haven't been charged either. If you have an existing balance, they will willingly cut off your meal plan and ruin your chance of gettin your books."
College Junior,1,"My school is not hard to get into, you dont even need a high school diploma. Most the people here are not ready for college. They are so focused on parties and meeting people that their grades slip. The precentage of graduates at my school is very low and believe the reason is that the school focuses on getting everyone here but does not focus on keeping everyone here."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is so unfair to some students. I have a friend that was kicked out of the school due to some specific issues the University failed to handle. Now that she is back, they don't treat her fairly at all and whatever happened before it's like they still hold a grudge. I haven't come across many friendly staff yet.  I would not recommend this school."
College Student,1,This class should be a requirement before even getting considered for the nursing program.  This is a very difficult class and is hard to manage with nursing courses.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Typical Student : Very obnoxious out side of classroom , a partier, loves alcohol, and very boring love to start drama"
Recent Alumnus,1,"School gets a d- in my book , when you first get there it seems like a great school but it quickly turns boring. There really is no support from the surrounding town which makes the community and campus dry. If your into cow boy boots and horses you'll love the atmosphere but if your a party type youll hate it. Cafeteria is nice gives a restaurant feel although staff can become lazy and not refill certain items like they should.  Attendance is mandatory if you miss more  then 3 days per class you get a warning , very frustrating for college students because things happen. Classes are easy to get through and teachers can be understanding. Lastly it is a racist town so if youre not white you will experience some form of discrimination."
College Sophomore,1,"My College Experience – Vincennes has a reputation with their financial aid, they do not help at all. My classes were the only thing that made it worth it. I love my teachers and the other students in my major. Overall, Vincennes has a decent curriculum, but the hassles with financial aid losing my information almost outweigh the good parts of the experience."

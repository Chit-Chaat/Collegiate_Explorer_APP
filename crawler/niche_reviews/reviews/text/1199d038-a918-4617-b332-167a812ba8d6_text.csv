Senior,5,I loved how invested the professors were with your success. They take the time to get to know you and what your interests are within the field and then point to to resources that can help you to achieve your goals.
Sophomore,5,UNH is a great University! Like all things it's only fun if you make it fun! being an active member in the community and taking pride in the institution you align yourself with is key in loving your community! If you take advantage of everything UNH offers then you'll have an amazing experience!
Freshman,5,"I love UNH. I fell in love when I realized how at home I felt when stepping on this campus. It is extremely easy to make friends in the social aspect of things and I have had nothing but good relationships with the professors I have had so far. From the coffee shops to the library, this place feels like home even if it is your first time stepping on campus no matter where you go. Definitely consider UNH in your college search!"
Freshman,5,Online is no different than in-person in my personal opinion. In all your classes you take notes and are expected to study and further your learning sort of on your own with the guided help of the professors.
Senior,5,The transition to online learning for covid-19 happened very abruptly but fairly smoothly. All professors adapted to zoom calls for exams and lecturers. Labs were videotaped by the professors who walked us through the procedures.
Freshman,5,All four kids in my family went/are going here... I think that says a lot! UNH never disappoints. I truly recommend this beautiful school!
Alum,5,I spent 3 years here for my B.S. and loved it. Durham is a great town and UNH offers tons of activities!
Alum,5,I only took one summer course online and it was fine! UNH uses Canvas which makes course delivery super user-friendly.
Alum,5,"I never took a fully online course, but obviously accessed the online platform for notes, homework, quizzes, etc. Its incredibly simple and easy to navigate."
Sophomore,5,I have had a wonderful experience at UNH. It is an excellent school that provides an amazing education.
Sophomore,5,"I honestly was a little worried going into my freshman year because a lot of kids from my town and area go to UNH, but since there are so many kids you only occasionally run into people from high school unless you really try. I really love the campus and the sense of community that the school provides."
Freshman,5,We used zoom to facilitate live and recorded lectures. We interacted witho Peetâ€™s through discussion boards and continued group projects .
Freshman,5,"I had a terrific freshman year. I enjoyed all my classes, met an amazing group of new friends, enjoyed participating in club sports and cheering on our hockey teams."
Freshman,5,The professors did an excellent job engaging students during online instruction. I was also impressed with the frequent 10 minute check-in individual zoom meetings to make sure students were on track.
Freshman,5,I love the area and everything you can get involved with. The people come from all over and there are many opportunities for everyone no matter what they are studying.
Freshman,5,"The best community I have been a part of absolutely love it! Due to this current pandemic, I have valued my time at UNH and miss it dearly. This transition to online classes has been hard and UNH has tried to be there for their students every step of the way. With much consideration, I am hoping to return in the fall to wildcat life. Fingers crossed that I will soon be attending sporting games and eating at the dining halls with my college friends!"
Sophomore,5,UNH provides students with excellent education and opportunities . They do their best to promote diversity and inclusivity.
Freshman,5,"Going to UNH was the best decision I made. Although it has its ups and down, being a wildcat is very much worth it. It has a great community there."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love UNH. It has such a bright and welcoming atmosphere. Staff/faculty/and students are wonderful. 
I do not believe I would change anything
Everyday is a great day to be a Wildcat!"
Freshman,5,Love this school! I've lived in NH for most of my life and thought I wanted to get out as soon as possible! It turns out that i've met all sorts of great people here and I can't wait to see how the rest of my experience turns out!
Freshman,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at UNH so far. The atmosphere is great, and faculty and staff make you feel welcomed and humbled. It is a big campus and there are lots of things to learn about it, but it is way easier than most people make it out to be. As long as you have that grind and determination to do great here, you will!"
Niche User,5,I've visited this school a few times and each time I leave happy! The campus is remarkable along with all the teachers and people present. I am very excited to attend this school.
Junior,5,"UNH is a great option, especially with in state tuition. Would not recommend attending out-of-state."
Freshman,5,It is full of activities and people are diverse and nice. As an international they have a lot of program/clubs/events to help you integrate with domestic student. There are also a lot of opportunities with culture experiences and personal development.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at the University of New Hampshire and I love it! The campus is breathtaking and worth a visit! The professors are very understanding and willing to work with students to meet their needs as well as having access to other opportunities for help with classes. The athletic events are lively and well constructed to welcome people of all ages. The apartments are roomy and easy to access campus from. I would highly recommend this school to any of my friends!
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of New Hampshire! I love the classes, professors and advisors. So far, I've been able to take many interesting courses and I have enjoyed all of them, related to my major or even not related."
Junior,5,"I love how welcoming and helpful faculty are. They also truly understand that each student comes from a different background, so whether you are international, first generation, transfer, traditional applicant, or a combination  of more than one, you will not feel ostracized and will fall in love with the campus."
Freshman,5,"My experience at University of New Hampshire has been very good. The housing is nice and the campus is beautiful. The food is pretty good. While the professors vary greatly on how well they teach, the academics overall tend to be good."
Sophomore,5,"At the University of New Hampshire, I am very pleased with overall experience. The campus makes me feel safe and welcomed with CFAR, SHARPP, CPACS, and the campus's own police department. I am very pleased with the amount of time the professors make to help their students. The campus is an easy place to get involved with extra curricular activities, sports, or greek life. College is an important time to build your resume, and take full advantages of the recourses given to you, and I can confidentially say UNH has provided all the support and opportunities for students need to succeed. For my major, I am required to do an internship over the summer, UNH faulty, staff, and professors sets their students up for a job after college."
Freshman,5,A wonderful college! I am currently a freshman living on campus and have had an amazing experience thus far. All of my professors have been helpful and friendly along with all dining hall staff and RA's.
Senior,5,UNH is a great university because they really make sure to create numerous opportunities for incoming students to get involved in the student life right away. It feels like a home away from home. It is very easy to find groups of people who share common interests. The campus is very easy to learn and always feels like a safe place. UNH offers many opportunities to get hands on experience in whatever field you are pursuing. There are also many ways to get help with career searching/networking.
Sophomore,5,"UNH is where I met some of the most incredible people. I've found my best friends, a group of 9 crazy, caffeine-loving, science geeks just like me. There is a group of people on campus for everyone, which is one of the things I love the most. Not only have I met my best friends, but I have met my mentors, became close with professors (which I never thought was really possible) and I have a job I love more than anything else in the world. If your biggest concern about picking a school is fit, this one will fit you no matter what (unless you're not a fan of the cold!). The academics here are very good, and all programs have incredible research opportunities. I have never had a class that was a waste of time or one in which I didn't learn something valuable. Class sizes are large, but that's part of attending a school as big as UNH. I hope you come to love UNH as much as I do!"
Junior,5,I love University of New Hampshire! It's a great school with many opportunities to grow as an individual! Really great food and facilities!
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful! The dining halls are great, the food is always delicious and they have a decent amount of options. Most of the professors are very nice and helpful and care about their students. Great school!"
Sophomore,5,"UNH offers so many clubs, weekend activities, and movies in the movie theater for people to enjoy, you're never bored. There's the town of Durham right next door to walk around, buses that take you to nearby towns, and the train on campus that you can take to Boston for the weekend. The professors are enthusiastic and offer all they can to make sure you're doing well. Your advisors are super supportive of your decisions and do all they can to make sure you're on track. My advisors even went above and beyond in their support when I switched majors."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the Paul College of Business and Economics. Overall, all buildings on the campus are appealing and relatively new. The professors are typically very friendly and want to help you succeed. Most people are nice and it is easy to meet people because of the opportunities offered on campus."
Sophomore,5,It is a great school with a lot of great people. The campus is amazing and it is a lot of fun to be here.
Sophomore,5,"The University of New Hampshire has incredible professors that dive deep into their lectures, and share their experiences related to the field of study to give students the knowledge needed and real world examples of what to expect."
Sophomore,5,UNH is an incredible university that really cares about their students and gets everybody involved on campus in any way possible.
Sophomore,5,UNH has been a wonderful experience so far. All of the professors have been very helpful and they want their students to succeed. UNH also offers a wide variety of student life forms that I have happily taken part in.
Junior,5,"This campus is one of the prettiest campuses in New England. The dorms are all very clean, and the people are all very friendly. UNH is very diverse and there is something for everyone to be a part of."
Senior,5,The University of New Hampshire is an amazing school to attend. There are so many resources that help guide incoming freshman and help engage students. The campus is safe and the students are accepting of diversity.
Freshman,5,"The minute I walked in the doors, I knew this was the school for me. Amazing staff members, the teachers are kind, the students are as well.. It's affordable, great education, small, class sizes, great teachers, small campus (Manchester campus). There is nothing you can not like. You have amazing help at any time you need. This is a great school!"
Sophomore,5,"Always can find people to hang out with on such a big campus. Great people, great place. You really get out what you put in there, just make new connections. UNH alum are always happy to help."
Sophomore,5,The professors really care about how well your learning the material and are often willing to make time out of office hours to help. The campus is beautiful and everyone is so nice.
Junior,5,"Fantastic academic programs, and a beautiful campus. Truly a great experience from start to finish. Professors really love their jobs and the students are eager to learn. Social aspects are also very welcoming and there is always something to do on or nearby campus with friends."
Niche User,5,"I am not a student but I am interested in the school and have visited it, and it gives such a positive vibe and is a beautiful school!"
Junior,5,"UNH is an amazing school. It has great campus life and an insane amount of clubs and activities for students to take part in. Over the past three years, I have always had great relationships with my professors and it's obvious that they want us all to succeed. There are so many helpful resources on campus to help with academics, mental health, and any other issues you may be facing."
Junior,5,The academics are challenging and diverse. UNH has a very strong presence and dedication to each individual college. The advisory staff and student assistance is fantastic as well.
Junior,5,"I am in love with how diverse the University of New Hampshire is. The school is always filled with students and professors walking the streets, studying and hanging. The athletics help bring students together to show pride towards our team and college. I would not change anything about my college or my college choice. I always have something going on whether it is volunteering, working out, studying or working."
Sophomore,5,I like how UNH is diverse and then other colleges. UNH is a place you can meet and interact with friendly people. The campus is safe and the people are welcoming.
Sophomore,5,Friendly atmosphere with an endless number of possibilities. Great place to try new things and meet new people
Alum,5,"This is an amazing school filled with brilliant professors and a diverse array of students. Settled in a small country town and surrounded by pleasant local shops, restaurants and popular locations. I completed my undergraduate degree here and would not choose to have done it anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"Great campus, big but with a small feel.  I really enjoy  my wildlife management classes.  Easy access to Portsmouth and Boston.  The campus is beautiful especially in the Fall.  So many groups and activities available."
Junior,5,I love the student life on campus! SUPER fun and really easy to commute to classes from dorms. Living on an on campus apartment is the best of both worlds!
Sophomore,5,"UNH is a large school with a small town feel.  The community is great and it is beautiful.  The academic programs are diverse and enriching and the social scene is a lot of fun from campus activities, to club sports and groups, to varsity sports and the party scene.  There is truly something for everyone here at UNH"
Junior,5,Haven't had any bad professors here so far. Schedule gets a bit crazy at times and costs quite a bit though.
Sophomore,5,"In my experience, the University of New Hampshire has been an overall excellent experience. There are various ways of interacting with campus life with various organizations to join/interact with. There is also flourishing Greek Life which actively interacts with the community. In addition to this, there are is also what seems to be an endless list of classes to choose from allowing you to specialize in possibly any major you desire. This has proved beneficial for someone like myself as I am still unsure of what I want out of life in terms of the work field and having the option to select from such a wide variety of classes has proved beneficial in so many ways for me."
Junior,5,"I couldn't have chosen a better place to spend my undergraduate experience. At UNH, there is something for everyone -- literally. There are so many different groups of people, clubs to join, and activities to do, that if you cant get involved or find people like you, you haven't looked hard enough. Every time I leave to go back home, I already want to go back; many of my friend's have the same feeling, and I don't know anyone at the school who doesn't like it. Regardless of the social/friend side of things, the academics have impressed me for a state school, and many of the professors are willing to help you with the connections they have and the opportunities they have for students."
Freshman,5,My experience has been amazing my fall and spring semesters. I have figured out how to balance my time between my academic and social life while at the the same time utilizing what The University of New Hampshire has to offer.
Sophomore,4,Online learning has actually been pretty good with UNH. I still feel like its somewhat challenging even though its online which is good. It's easier to balance school and life when it's just on the computer as well.
Sophomore,4,"Very fun school climate, great food, fun events from time to time. Wish it was more diverse though. Love the events the school puts on for us, I think we have a lot of different unique benefits and activities to do. The classes are a good level of challenging but doable. I don't feel too stressed at this school and it's fairly easy to make friends."
Freshman,4,"UNH is doing very well handling the pandemic. Good mix of in person and online classes, food could be better."
Freshman,4,"I do most of my classes on zoom. It's been a process on both sides learning how to get everything done, but the professors are trying their best."
Freshman,4,This is only my first semester here but it has been pretty good so far. My professors have been doing an excellent job with online learning. The school itself has done a great job of taking the necessary steps to ensure our safety during COVID.
Sophomore,4,"although it is rather expensive to attend, i don't regret enrolling at UNH. i have found the courses that i've taken to be extremely valuable and believe the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"many of my classes this current semester have been online due to the pandemic. although the online learning is not my forte, my professors have adapted to the changing conditions and provide the best possible education for me and my peers"
Sophomore,4,"UNH is a great college with a very welcoming and kind community. I love how big it is, but yet it's very easy to make friends and meet new people. They have great departments for all majors with incredibly intelligent professors."
Senior,4,"The campus is gorgeous in the fall, cold in the winter, and muddy in the spring. The police presence on campus has become over whelming in recent years. There has been a tough crack down on underage drinking and parties in general.
The engineering buildings especially Kingsburry serve as excellent facilities, which is necessary for the engineering majors as we have to spend hours there every day."
Senior,4,The university has a beautiful campus that is always bustling with activity. It offers so much for students to get involved and stay busy.
Senior,4,"Given the circumstances, the professors and school reacted well and remained professional while learning as they went."
Freshman,4,"I havenâ€™t taken classes online, but my brother did. Although it was hard for the professors to adjust, they did a great job!"
Senior,4,The education received at UNH is top tier. Every class is interesting and informative. A great school with great professors.
Alum,4,"I attended UNH through the National Student Exchange program and really liked it. There's a unique range of courses and the professors are very smart. The campus is absolutely amazing, it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. There's a ton of opportunities to join clubs and get involved too! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the student demographic and lack of effort to diversify their campus. The school is overwhelmingly wealthy white students. Not to mention, it's literally built on the grounds of a deadly battle between settlers and natives in the 1600s (Oyster river massacre). I have a problem with this because it took my own curiosity on the history of this land to learn about it, a monument on campus or day of acknowledgment would be nice... Overall, great education and area, but lacking in social diversity."
Sophomore,4,UNH did an amazing job with online learning. I was able to communicate effectively with my professors and I was able to get a decent educational experience considering what we were up against.
Junior,4,"Although online learning could have been challenging at times - my professors made their best efforts to comply and help students through the big change. I have felt my experience with online learning was surprisingly pleasant, as it taught me not only how to help myself learn in a different environment, but helped me overcome challenges from not being in a physical classroom which is where I thought I learned best."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at the University of New Hampshire has been pleasant. Our campus shows great support for students, and provides lots of opportunity for its students. I have been involved with many different organizations on campus, and have learned greatly from every opportunity provided for me. UNH is a community that definitely provides for its students, we are privileged to have great professors, course loads, and activities that surround us every day. Other students and I love going to class - we actually look forward to it most of the time. UNH has allowed me to grow into the person I want to be."
Freshman,4,"UNH is a nice school and has lots of opportunities. A lot of students are from NH, MA, and ME. They push their students to do their best and offer lots of clubs for students. The sporting events are tons of fun because UNH is D1. It is located in a sleepy town so most people party on the weekends. Some weekend events include sports and free movies at the MUB. The campus is really pretty and the food is above average."
Freshman,4,I personally love the campus and the location of the University. The student life and organizations on campus were all inclusive and very fun. The professors could be more accessible to students when help is needed but other than this my experience was amazing.
Freshman,4,"I was able to take all of my classes and my two labs online when the University was switched to online only. From this my professors were able to create a learning plan to help fit all of the students, and the lab instructors were also able to make the labs accessible and understandable to everyone."
Senior,4,I loved my experience at UNH. It was everything I wanted and more! The professors were typically really great and always willing to help.
Freshman,4,I love the location and the campus itself. Itâ€™s beautiful and authentic. You I cannot wait to go back. The professors at UNH are very intelligent and make the classes worthwhile and interesting.
Freshman,4,I took online classes my second semester of my first year. It was challenging but yet I still learned a lot. My professors made it possible for me to maintain a good education and were open to questions at all times.
Freshman,4,"As a first-year college student attending UNH, the only complaints that I have are in regards to the handling of COVID-19 information communication. While it is understandable that no one has all the info on the current state of the world, I do feel it could have been better managed by administration. But overall this school has gone above and beyond in terms of my expectations of the college experience."
Sophomore,4,"When choosing a college, I knew that UNH would be the right school for me. Not only are there nice and friendly students and faculty, but the whole community is well connected. The professors and classrooms are well put together. Most of the professors are passionate about what they are teaching, making the subject matter more engaging to learn from. Living at UNH, you would feel like everything is close to each other as if the campus was smaller, but it is much bigger than you might think. UNH has some really nice dorms to live in, creating a friendly and safe environment. The campus food is some of the best that I have ever tasted, and it is great that they have a station dedicated to those who want to stay healthy. UNH have some great athletic sports, as well as having many different clubs and activities to choose from. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here at UNH!"
Freshman,4,"At the beginning of my freshman year I really didn't want to accept the fact that I was going to the college that everyone from my High School went to. As someone who identifies as Asian I was afraid of going to a school that was predominately White, but I entered a program called Connect and through that I found my people. Now that I am coming to my last few weeks as a freshman at UNH, I definitely can say that I have fallen in love with my school. The professors that I have had the opportunity to work with have been phenomenal, the students that I have worked with have been awesome and the food is definitely delicious. I wish I got to finish my first year on campus but I'm glad that UNH was quick to jump onto online classes to provide students with the rest of their education via online courses. on top of continuing classes and resources, students have received  a variety of reimbursements (That apply to them). I'm definitely proud to say that I am a wildcat."
Freshman,4,"This is the most accurate one you guys are going to get.The school is fine. It is what you make of it;and if you make friends and find people you like hanging out with you'll have a good time, as is with any college.A lot of the one stars are stuff like ""kids drinks every weekend.""Yeah obviously, it's college.UNH has cracked down a ton on drinking anyway;they didn't love the ""party school reputation.As of now (2020,) they're at a happy medium.Academics are average. It's not Harvard, and I'm sure you guys know that.Most of my friends went to UVA, the rest to Ivy's.They're buckling under their respective workloads one at a time, and I'm kind of cruising, and our salaries likely won't differ a ton in the long run.UNH academics aren't super stellar anyway.You'll find brilliant kids here, and a lot of ""I got into an Ivy but couldn't afford it so I'm at state school"" kids, so it's not like the whole culture is composed of slackers, or that different than any slightly higher ranking schools."
Freshman,4,"I am so happy I decided to attend UNH. My first semester was rough being away from home and having classes that were not interesting to me. However, second semester I declared a major (Nutrition: Dietetics) and I truly enjoy all of my classes. Furthermore, I have friends now. The school is beautiful and I feel supported my professors and administration."
Junior,4,I originally applied as a way to satisfy my guidance counselor's recommendation that I apply to at least one school in my state but as soon as I set foot on campus UNH felt like home. I love the freedom to take classes in areas outside my major. I have met a lot of great people in my three years so far.
Freshman,4,Welcoming and friendly environment where one can build life-long friendships. There are many opportunities to get involved around campus and in the community. Each and every student has the ability to shine inside and outside the classroom.
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time at UNH so far and am happy with my decision. It is hard to be from out of state though, with such high tuition rates for nonresidents. Overall, everything is very well thought out and it seems as if many of the staff members are really here to help and care about your success."
Senior,4,Nice rural campus with easy access to Boston and Portsmouth. Professors are tentative and willing to help if you put fourth the effort to reach out on your own. Plenty of student orgs to keep you engaged and sporting events are highly recommended!
Sophomore,4,Pretty campus with some good teachers. An expensive college though. Good facilities. Some of the teachers are hard to learn from.
Junior,4,"Academically, UNH is a great school because there are a ton of research opportunities and internships. UNH is close to the beach and the mountains.  I participate in so many organizations and clubs to stay active and meet new people!"
Freshman,4,Great community! The campus is beautiful and the walks to class are no longer than ten minutes. Easy to get involved around campus with all the activities that are held within the Memorial Union Building. The only thing is that the majors are very competitive you you have to be on your A game if you are undecided your first year. The food is very good with three dining halls to choose from and many other places to eat downtown. The professors are very helpful! The dorms in Christensen are the best?
Junior,4,"I love my experience at UNH so far. I would like to see it diversify with its students and for the law enforcement at the school to be less strict, we are COLLEGE STUDENTS. There are plenty of research opportunities here if that's what you are looking for in a school."
Sophomore,4,Great school where you really are in charge of your own education. Many students take so many classes just for their interests outside of their major. Such a great place to grow in every aspect of your life.
Junior,4,"UNH is a very welcoming school, I transferred here halfway through my freshman year and had no problem finding a spot to fit in! There is a wide variety of people to meet, classes to take, and food to eat. In-state applicants that qualify for a Pell Grant also get a tuition grant from the school. One thing I would like to see change is the rising cost to attend the UNH, but the financial aid/ business services offices make it easy to work through covering expenses every semester."
Freshman,4,The out of state tuition is very expensive. I wish they offered more scholarships / more ways to obtain money to pay for the school. The advisors are also very very very difficult to meet with.
Junior,4,"As a third year student, I am proud to call UNH my home away from home. I have had an amazing experience in college so far due to the excellent opportunities from clubs and classes. I have made a plethora of friends, both in and out of my major, and cannot begin to express how happy I am to return to school each fall. I look forward to going to my classes because they are both invigorating and engaging as they pertain to my major. As a land grant institution, the University of New Hampshire places an emphasis on agriculture, which is one of the main reasons I decided to attend. It is one of the few universities that have an accessible barn on campus, which gives me the hands on experience I was determined to use to my advantage. Having access to the animals on campus and ones through class field trips is helping me prepare for my life after college. I will miss the stimulating campus life once graduated and hope to remember the college experience and look back on it in the future."
Sophomore,4,Unh is a super pretty campus with very good food and fun sports. The campus is very lively during the days and nights. The professors are mostly kind and there are lots of classes to choose from. I would like to see a smaller tuitions
Alum,4,"I would not change my experience at UNH for the world. The campus community is unlike any other! I felt as though I was at home away from home while living at UNH. The community, professors, and student body worked closely together to make this feeling a priority. You never felt alone at UNH, whether you were involved in greek life, a club/organization, or sports team. The only thing I would change about UNH would be the cost of tuition, but isn't that what everyone has at the top of their list for changes in university education."
Sophomore,4,"A great university with an unbelievable amount of opportunities to pick from. Professors are there to help you no matter what kind of class you're in (large lecture or small classroom). Plus, there are so many ways to make friends!"
Junior,4,"UNH has a very welcoming environment. I came from the south and knew absolutely no one before moving in. Now, my friends joke that i know more people than they do even though half of their high school goes to UNH with them. It is probably true though because there is so much to do on campus and i definitely took advantage of it! Sorority life is very accessible for any girl interested in meeting new people! i also play a club sport and i am in a leadership position in another club. the thing i need the most help with is paying the tuition because they are very stringent on scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"I would appreciate seeing more unity on campus. Since the school is very large it often seems like there are many small groups on campus rather than a large campus community. However, there are many things that connect UNH students, such as athletics and academics."
Junior,4,What I enjoy about the University of New Hampshire is the wide demographic of students on campus. The campus itself is also a very nice place to live while taking classes. Most buildings are close by  and the downtown area is awesome to spend time in.
Senior,4,"UNH provides a great academic experience and excels in many other aspects as well. The surrounding area of Durham offers trips to the mountains, beach, lakes and more all within an hours drive."
Sophomore,4,Great environment and beautiful campus. The one downfall is the science building needs to be upgraded.
Junior,4,"UNH has a beautiful campus and offers many different areas of study. It has a wonderful community that makes you feel welcomed. There are clubs and organizations for everyone which makes it easy to be an active student and make friends. UNH puts a lot of effort into helping their students be successful in and out of the classroom. There are mental health counselors that are always available, a health clinic, they help students find internships, make resumes, and hold mock job interviews.  The dorms, on campus apartments, and dining halls are great. You don't feel like you're missing out on home cooked meals. UNH is also very accomodating when it comes to different diets. There is also a quaint downtown area very close to the campus where you can go shopping or go out to eat. The only thing UNH lacks is diversity in their student population. However, the students at UNH are very friendly and open minded."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've had a good experience at UNH. Academics and campus life are good, it lacks diversity so that's the only problem."
Sophomore,4,Inclusive programs but has to work on inclusion regarding financial backgrounds of students socially on campus.
Sophomore,4,University of New Hampshire has a beautiful campus with new or up to date buildings. The staff and professors are always kind and friendly to all their students or peers. UNH makes you apart of one family and makes you become one big family especially when it comes their sports teams or if you join certain groups which is an amazing experience.
Freshman,4,"The community of UNH is welcoming and relaxed. There is great encouragement to participate in the diverse UNH campus activities allowing for an ease into college life. Great pride in the campus to be a wildcat! 
One has to be a strong advocate for themselves  and their education. The larger institution makes it difficult to develop professor/student relationships. 
Academic support appears to be lacking."
Sophomore,4,The campus is really nice but there's not much to do unless you go searching for it. Professors are okay but some of them could be better. The food is getting worse and worse.
Junior,4,"UNH has good academics and the professors are very helpful. However, what I would change at the school because I am a commuter is the parking for students is horrible. The nearest parking lot for students is way too far of a walk from the rest of campus. Even with the buses, it takes too long. Instead of spending money on other things UNH really needs a commuter parking lot in campus, not just around it."
Junior,4,"The University of New Hampshire is a large community. It is also a beautiful campus. The one thing that UNH lacks is diversity. If there were more diversity, I would give UNH a five star rating."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus with lots to do in the area, including many outdoors activities. Located close to the coast, and Portsmouth. There is a train on campus that goes right to Boston. Classes are challenging and rewarding. There is a good variety of foods and three different dining halls to choose from."
Sophomore,4,"I had a great experience my first semester at UNH! Everyone is so inviting, my professors are very outgoing and readily available to offer help, and the atmosphere on campus made for a very easy transition into college life."
Niche User,4,"Good environment, but as liberal as they come. What you get out of it is dependent on your degree. Far too expensive for a public university."
Sophomore,4,"Being a current undergraduate student at the University of New Hampshire, the teachers are compassionate in their teaching as well as their students. Although, I feel that I would like to see more of a diverse community and I know UNH is working on that, but there is still in need for more improvement."
Sophomore,2,My major does not transfer well onto online classes and it was VERY difficult in the spring semester of 2020.
Senior,2,"The University of New Hampshire is for a certain type of person. The student body is really white, except for international students. If you want a diverse student body, go somewhere else!! The tuition is incredibly expensive to sit in a lecture hall of two hundred people and read to off of a slide show. The dining hall is disgusting and overpriced. The residence halls need to renovate. The party scene is nonexistent."
Freshman,2,"This school is only for a certain type of person. I am not that type of person. This school has put me in such a deep depression. I lived in Williamson my first year and it was terrible. The floors are gendered and itâ€™s a party dormâ€” I felt out of place being LGBT and wanting to go to bed before 1 am. The campus is also very large and is a pain to walk especially during the winter. I used a lot of the resources provided to me as a student and they were ok for the most part. PACS (Psychological and Counseling Services) showed to be less helpful and after appointments I would feel worse. The administration does not care about the student, only their money. I received an $8,000 scholarship from my department, but then the school took out $8,000 from my financial aid package. Iâ€™m sad that I had such a bad experience here and many have enjoyed it here, but it is not for people who arenâ€™t straight, white, and middle class or of higher economic standing."
Sophomore,2,"This review is for The College of Life Science and Agriculture.   It is important for undergrads to know that COLSA is not a teaching dept..  It is a research vehicle for professors.  It is not uncommon to have a professor who is sub-par, in other words an inadequate teacher and one  who is wrapped up in their research rather than teaching.  The school will tell you professors are available to help you during their office hours but in reality they aren't.  They are not there to truly teach an undergrad.  The school will also tell you that TA's will be available to help you.  In reality they are either booked or too busy with their own work to help undergrads.   It is not unheard of to have a prof. or TA whose English isn't very good either.   So the problem is as an undergrad you will be on your own.  You can try to form study groups and get help but the reality is, everyone is busy.   COLSA sells something very different than it delivers."
Junior,2,"I won't lie, I hate it here. The school makes a person feel useless when they are not taken seriously in any way. In this school. students are dollar signs, not people. Tuition is incredibly high to set in a lecture hall of two hundred people and be read to off of a slide show. I've also lost count of the amount of times they have messed up my credits or financial aid status. But the education is supposed to be pretty good."
College Junior,2,"Hardly anyone attends the football games simply because they are not in the FBS and do not play against any of the big name schools. Similarly, tailgating has been banned for many of the home games, which takes a lot of the fun out of the experience."
College Sophomore,2,"The student body is really white, except for the international students. If you want a diverse student body, go somewhere else."
College Sophomore,2,"I liked most of the people in my dorm and the facilities are nice.  However, the RAs are pressured by the administration to police the residents for even minor rules violations.  It creates an unhealthy dynamic.  Some RAs are nice and helpful and understand that their job is to assist the residents, but some are on a bit of a power trip and don't seem to care about their residents.  It is not a comfortable way to live.  If you want to be treated like an adult, live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I can only speak for what I've seen, and what I've seen is loud parties and drinking. I'm sure there exist students who don't fall into this category, but a lot do."
College Sophomore,2,"It's ridiculously expensive for what it is, many of the courses are disorganized and have ludicrous workloads, the school blew the equivalent of an entire year's tuition buying a table, and the course registration process is buggy and disorganized. If I knew about all of this I wouldn't have applied, but now that I'm here I wouldn't change my decision entirely because I've never had friends like I have here."
College Freshman,2,"There is a very obvious lack of diversity here, since we're living in one of the whitest states in the U.S. The minorities here are mainly ones who play basketball (stereotypical, I know) and there are international students living here but they appear to be disconnected from us and have their own social circle amongst other internationals. If you're looking for diversity to be a part of your college experience (as it should be), UNH is not the college for you."
College Junior,2,Our school does not have much of a Greek life and in my opinion I would not want to pay money I don't have to join any fraternity.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of options for out of staters
College Junior,2,I go to UNH Manchester and there are none
College Freshman,2,"The gym is super super small for the amount of kids at this school. That being said, they are building a new, larger gym for the next few years! School spirit is huge here. Kids really take pride in being Wildcats!"
College Freshman,2,"There is very little in the area of financial aid and scholarships, and it gets worse with each year."
College Sophomore,2,"I did get the financial needs met, but a lot of it is in loans. The CEPS college often announces scholarship opportunities otherwise they are not readily available. The financial aid department can't always answer questions, but they try their hardest. Unh doesn't give many scholarships unless you get a full ride, but they are more than happy to give out loans to those who need them. Talk to your department offices about scholarships and if you are in dire need, schedule an appointment with the financial aid department, they don't want to see people leave because they can't afford it."
College Freshman,2,The gym sucks. All the machines are always taken and there's no space
College Sophomore,2,UNH does not offer much financial aid. It is an expensive public university. FAFSA is important.
College Freshman,2,We don't have many off campus eating places. If your looking for a McDonalds or Burger King don't come to Durham because they won't have any of that. The only thing they have is Dominos which does provide coupons for students. We have a small bagel place to get breakfast and Dunkin Doughnuts to get drinks. We  also have a Starbucks but other than that we don't have too many restaurants to go out to eat.
College Sophomore,2,People that are a part of Greek life feel they are somehow superior to everyone else on campus. They are a very segregated group and tend to stick together.
College Junior,2,I have never really felt support by my school in a financial aspect. It is the most expensive in state tuition out of all the state schools in the country and I really have no idea why.
College Freshman,2,"Durham= SOOOOOO Boring. There is nothing to do here, and it's especially boring if you grew up close to mountains, because you have to drive at least 2 hrs if you want to hike.  The whole one way street thing is obnoxious too and there is constant construction that has been going on since I've lived at UNH. On the weekends all I wanna do is get the heck out of there!"
College Freshman,2,"When I was getting ready to go to college, people told me it would be the best experience of my life.  I was going to learn so much and enjoy what I was learning. Finally, I could have teachers that really seemed to care. But this is NOT at all the experience I am having at UNH. Honestly, the professors are not that great.  They don't get you excited to learn, and I always leave class with an empty feeling.  I'm almost done with my first semester and I can't really say I've learned much of anything.  I'm not motivated at UNH, and it makes me sad because I really do want to learn sooo bad.  The academics are also very unchallenging. Disappointing to say the least.  If you are somewhat intelligent I recommend you go elsewhere!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"I was forced to pay $7,000 out of pocket to attend here"
College Senior,2,"Being a quiet studious student, I wish the police did more to actually stop bad behavior.  They often came across unfriendly and overall bad at their job."
College Senior,2,I had to take out huge private loans each year.
College Senior,2,Mostly pizza and unhealthy options.
College Junior,2,Just bad all over the USA
College Junior,2,"Only three bars down town for 7,000+ students.... enough said"
Recent Alumnus,2,"My financial situation isn't great, as it is with most college kids. My family is struggling with money especially as my brother goes into college this year as well. UNH offered me a significant amount of money my first year, and has decreased it ever since. It is a very expensive school, especially for out of state. They also don't offer many scholarship opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,not many places to go in durham
College Senior,2,The adviser office is helpfulish but advisers with in majors are not knowledgeable. The work load is ridiculous professors are not regulated. And be prepared to find your own internship because not one is going to help you.
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene at The University of New Hampshire is pretty limited to only alcohol use. Other drugs are evident, but alcohol is abundant on campus. Despite this though, students know safety and most nights are filled with safe fun!"
College Freshman,2,Many underage students are unsafe with their usage
College Sophomore,2,this campus is mostly white middle class with locals from wealthier families.
College Sophomore,2,Only in the library do you have a chance on continual internet
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, it seems like the only thing people ever focus on is trying to give out as many parking tickets as possible. Buying a parking space is very expensive as well as the parking tickets."
College Sophomore,2,There are just so few of them! Most cant find one that pertains to the area of study!
College Junior,2,"I am not a par tof the drug or alcohol scene.  I do not know much about how abundant they are or how easy they are to access.  But I know LOTS of people who drink and if you don't, well you do  NOT fit in with most..."
College Freshman,2,In-state students get little to no financial aid
College Senior,2,It is like a wind tunnel here in the winter! Pretty cold.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much transportation to take you to places nearby to do things.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are generally run-down buildings far away from classes.
College Freshman,2,UNH offers little to no financial aid to most in-state students.  Their business services department can be very difficult to work with and is often misleading.  They do not follow up on what they say they will unless you prod them constantly.  I received no financial aid from the college.  I am very displeased.
College Freshman,2,"Don't count on what they say they'll give you at first acceptance. Once you've confirmed your enrollment they take most of it away, happened to a lot of people I know."
College Sophomore,2,I do not satisfy with the academic class especially the core classes of business. 
College Sophomore,2,The parking lots is what the drivers should worry about.
College Freshman,2,There are no green spaces. Smoking areas are inconveniently placed. The gym should be in the middle of campus.
College Freshman,2,The network is prone to crashing a lot and they charge way too much for printing.
College Freshman,2,"The administration is soooooo strict, especially in the freshman dorms"
College Freshman,2,"The only sport anyone pays attention to is varsity hockey, the games are a lot of fun to go to, but I wish other sports were big here too. I hate the athletic facility. It's always crowded and doesn't offer anything special."
College Freshman,2,The weather here is very hot in the beginning of fall semester and then...get ready for the freezing cold 
College Freshman,2,UNH is located in a very small town with very few things to do. You have to take a bus to the next town to go shopping or to walmart.
College Sophomore,2,I can't afford to eat off campus. Not too much to choose from in Durham - why waste the money when you have already paid to eat on campus. 
College Junior,2,I do not like my parking availablity on campus. You have no choice but to pay to park. If you dont you will get towed or a large ticket. There is no spot in town for free parking even in my apartment. One of the biggest turnoffs of my college is the parking. 
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of drug use at UNH, ranging from all sorts of drugs. Some students have died from drug usage, and many more have been arrested, but it still goes on. "
College Sophomore,2,"They only  have really basic majors, it's hard for me to find what I'm interested in. "
College Sophomore,2,"I just switched my major, and my advisor has not been helpful in the transition"
College Sophomore,2,"People here love to ""party"" but all it is is just girls dressing in really skimpy outfits and going to frats. There are no clubs or bars around, so everyone just goes to people's houses or frats to drink. "
Junior,1,God awful like I cannot think of an even worser way to handle things. They have no idea what they are doing FALL 2020 and classes start in about 2 weeks. I am staying home because they are handling COVID really badly and I do not want to catch it. Also the housing offices screwed people over and broke contracts with students and kicked them off campus for no reason which is not right. Also they screw you over for the following semester with housing saying you can get kicked out or not they dont know or if you stay home you have no spot next semester.
Senior,1,"i hate learning online, the professors tried SO hard to make it work and I am so proud of them for that."
Junior,1,"As if it wasn't hard enough during the COVID-19 lockdown, UNH did nothing to help students with their loans. The business office was extremely unhelpful, direction was poor. You take 3 or more classes, you're considered FT, and make you decline their insurance. I did, saved my emails, screenshots and they were still claiming I needed to pay, when I didn't need to!!!! CYA!, they are horrible!  Making students apply for summer classes separate from their original loans just to make a buck. STAY AWAY! Professors are over opinionated. Professors also blatantly told me I couldn't amount to their classes, poor excuse for professor. I came from a community college, and I wish they did a bachelor degree, because I'd be at MCC in a heart beat! Although I don't live on campus, they made me fill out the rest of the stars."
Freshman,1,"Ended up dropping out after one semester. Very unfriendly environment. I was really looking forward to going to college and meeting a whole bunch of new people, but when I got to UNH, it was hard to get people to actually socialize and look up from their phone in the dining hall. The only positive thing about the school is the campus. Its pretty, and nice to walk from class to class."
Niche User,1,"If you want to drink beer and take easy classes, this expensive diploma mill is for you. They are on a mission to dumb down the university and they are achieving it. Good teachers increasingly leave and administrators get fat salaries. When was the last time an administrator taught you. Don't get caught paying for a UNH diploma, increasingly it will be worthless."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police are abusive to students. I have known several people who were placed in so-called ""protective custody"" and hauled off to jail for the night who were only mildly intoxicated at best and were not in any danger (like, they were sober enough to talk to their parents on the phone after they got to jail and tell them what was going on and their parents couldn't figure out why they were in jail because they sounded sober).  Another person I know was forced to get in an ambulance and was hauled off campus and dumped at the hospital in the middle of the night without any help or any way to get back to campus.  She was also sober enough to talk to her parents on the phone.  The protective custody thing is all a sham the campus police are using to try to control student partying.  The administration knows this is happening and does nothing about it.  Maybe it's all their idea; who knows. The people I know have been very traumatized.  It has not had the desired effect because it has not changed their attitude about partying; it has only made them distrust the campus police more and want to keep their activities more secret.  It also has not helped curb student partying because there is just as much partying as ever. The campus atmosphere is not healthy because people are afraid to get help if someone has had too much to drink because the penalties for students who are caught drinking are very harsh (for example, taking away scholarship money) and people are afraid they will be put in ""protective custody"" and have to spend the night in jail if someone finds out they've been drinking.  I would be afraid to report a sexual assault if alcohol were involved because I would be afraid of being tossed into the conduct system and losing my scholarship.  I don't feel safe living on campus because of the campus police."
College Sophomore,1,"The administration seems dysfunctional.  Some members of the administration seem openly hostile to students; others are apathetic and seem more interested in making their own jobs as easy as possible than in doing the right thing.  Communication with students is poor and written polices often are not followed.  I know this can be a problem in any large institution but it is a particularly bad problem at UNH.  All of the good administrators seem to be in admissions, but once you get in and arrive at the school it is a whole different story."
College Freshman,1,"They give out barely any scholarships. If you live in-state, good luck."
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus is like being trapped in the small town of Durham, unless you want to pay the $800 to park your car there on top of the $7000 to live in a small cramped space where you still have to wear flip flops to shower."
Recent Alumnus,1,UNH does not give financial aid. UNH does not give financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"I hardly know anyone who got any scholarship money to go to UNH. My friend who was in the top ten of my high school was only given $1,000 per year.  Way to dig deep UNH."
College Senior,1,The parking is very strict and almost impossible. There should be more parking space more students who commute or have there car on campus.
College Senior,1,Next to no scholarships offered at UNH.
College Sophomore,1,It is non-existent! 3rd highest public university for in state students in the nation and no aid other than federal student loans! Shame with all the grants and donations they receive.
College Sophomore,1,"Too expensive, too crowded, crazy parking police with LOTS of tickets!"
College Freshman,1,Most people at this school are similar which doesn't allow for much diversity.
College Freshman,1,It's so cold outside so we mostly have to stay in the dorms inside.
College Sophomore,1,"There is always a party going on, with crazy drunk people roaming the streets."
College Sophomore,1,Most of the students here both drink and do drugs.
College Sophomore,1,Parties at the Greek houses are awful and out of control.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is ridiculous. It's extremely expensive to purchase a permit and very confusing trying to figure out appropriate places to park without getting a ticket. The minimum cost for a ticket on campus is $50
College Freshman,1,The weekends are crazy. Many kids smoke weed and drink alcohol.
College Sophomore,1,"I had financial aid, and then it was taken away this year without any warning or explanation of why. When I went to inquire about this, I got a really sarcastic response from the people working in the office, and was not helped at all. "
College Senior,1,"Campus is pretty darn strict, if you get caught with any alcohol in your room you can be kicked off campus, only if you're underage of course. But still, it's college, expecting students not to drink underage is like expecting birds not to fly. Plus there are UNH police as well as durham police, and for the big party nights they recruit police enforcement from towns all over the county. This spring they called the riot police in and shot pepper spray paintballs into a crowd that was off campus, just peacefully enjoying the weather. Be wary of the police, and RAs, but so long as you're responsible UNH be a really fun time."
College Sophomore,1,The school is filled with white people. which many are prejudice. There are minority clubs that will make you feel welcomed. However the overall community will make you hate white people. There are also many cases of racism.
College Sophomore,1,"I literally made an account here just to write this. If you are out of state or from a city and do not already have friends that are going to UNH, DO NOT GO HERE. There are cliques before you'll even step foot into the school, its absolutely ridiculous. I love the school but the people in it are are complete idiots, especially the backstabbing girls that will talk behind your back non-stop. I'm actually transfering for this sole reason. If you don't like country music or anything everyone else does, you'll be casted out. I'm warning you. I can't believe I just paid a huge amount of money for the worst year of my entire life. BYE UNH."
College Freshman,1,It is ridiculously expensive to bring your car on campus. There is not many parking options and the police are very annoying with their ticketing.
College Junior,1,"Parking at UNH is atrocious. Anyone who has a car on campus is almost guaranteed to get some parking tickets. If you commute, you are allowed to park in A-Lot, but there is very limited spaces to park here and it's really hard to find a parking space at most points throughout the day. If you can't find one, you have to park in an area that always has parking spaces, but is about a mile off the main campus and you have to take the buses if you don't want to make a thirty minute walk. If you park at the meters and your time runs out, the evil parking trolls will somehow find your car within the first couple minutes of parking there and give you an outrageous fine ($50-$100) for your first offense. Winter parking ban complicates matters even further (and lasts throughout the majority of the school year) by making it so that the places you can park are even more limited and its even more impossible to find a place to park."
College Freshman,1,literally the parking sucks so bad the only place for guests in the day time during week days is all the way in the visitors lot which is at the very beginning of campus and you have to pay the meter which is like 25 cents for 15 minutes its absurd. weekend parking is free in designated areas ad over the winter theres a winter parking ban so its not free anymore and you can park in like one area
College Junior,1,"UNH is a very white school, due to it's Northeast location. Diverse students are accepted overall, there are just not very many of them compared to the overall student body. I know of several incidents of racism and homophobia on campus. The multicultural community on campus is active, but it is small and insulated. UNH does make a very good effort to be inclusive and to recruit more diverse students. The diversity programs are exceptional."
College Freshman,1,Terrible.  No parking for freshman at all.  You're friends will get tickets when they visit.
College Senior,1,"Severe Punishments and Threats of Punishments â€“ we have 2 police forces at UNH. one is UNH's own force, the other is the town of Durham's force. they are very strict about underage drinking and will sometimes stop you if your holding a can of soda walking down the street on a weekend. You can also get kicked out of housing on your first offense of underage drinking in your dorm, which is something they make sure to drill into your head on day one. Not to mention the legal situation you would be in! All in all, i suggest if you are going to drink do it elsewhere, because the risks are not worth it!"
College Freshman,1,"Tickets are easy to come by and parking is not.  It is pretty expensive and the cheaper the spot, the more inconvenient it is.  UNH definitely has a parking problem."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is a horror, there is very limited parking and it can be quite expensive."
College Sophomore,1,Parking rules are not clear and they give out too many tickets. You have to be lucky not to get a ticket. Appeals never go through.
College Sophomore,1,"The police are very strict about underage drinking and drug use. The poilce are on patrol everywhere on campus on the weekends. If you decide to drink, be smart about it and don't advertise it when your walking the streets on the weekend or in your dorm."
College Freshman,1,"In order to obtain a parking pass, you have to pay a lot of money, and at that, parking is relatively far from campus and dorms. If you park on campus without paying for a day pass or regular parking pass, you will get a ticket. UNH police is very quick to ticket cars missing payments, and the fines are at least $50. But, with busses constantly running around campus, cars aren't really neeed unless you have somewhere to go off campus."
College Freshman,1,It's very expensive to get a parking pass (more than 400 dollars) and parking is far from campus and dorms
College Sophomore,1,"Crack House â€“ Our school has for a long time been notorious for both binge drinking and a very vivid drug scene. In fact just this past year a very prominent Fraternity was shut down after an investigation revealed a stash of drugs with the intent to sell. To say the least...no one was surprised...at all. And as an EMT, a can tell you that drugs are not an uncommon sight to see on weekend night at UNH."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Enough Spaces â€“ Unfortunately for those who pay for a parking permit, it seems that the transportation department sells more parking permits than spaces. You will find that throughout the semester, looking for a parking spot will be a priority. Unless you show up a good half an hour to forty-five minutes early, be prepared to be late to class due to circling the parking lots. I suggest getting to the parking lots or spaces much earlier than your class begins. This will ensure you have a spot and plenty of time before classes begin."
College Senior,1,I am giving them an F because of the ludicris amount of parking tickets they give out. It's absolutely insane.
College Junior,1,"There are only three bars in Durham, and they are all 21+ so for the majority of students the nightlife is challenging.  House parties are popular but the town and school are extremely strict on alcohol policies, and New Hampshire has an internal possession law meaning that if someone has consumed alcohol even if they are not holding a container they can still be arrested if they are underage."
College Junior,1,"Freshman residents (living on campus) are not permitted to have a car on campus.  Upperclassmen may park in ""resident lots,"" but pay anywhere between $250-350 per semester for a permit.  The parking lots available for residents are nearly a mile away from the main campus where the residence halls and dorms are; there are shuttles that run to these lots during the week every 10 minutes and every 30 minutes on weekends, but only until 11pm.  If someone that lives on campus has a job off campus that gets out late, they end up walking nearly a mile back to campus at night."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Over the past five years, the Greek scene at UNH has devolved thanks to various violations relating to hazing and underage drinking. My frat specifically, TKE, was kicked off campus for such offenses."
College Senior,1,Getting More Strict â€“ Police force sucks and cause problems when there are no problems at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Bad Bad Bad â€“ Parking is my biggest complaint at UNH. Not because you need a car, because you don't. There are free busses running all day long to pretty much anywhere. Also, freshmen are not allowed to have cars on campus. But if you do have a car, there is no where to park! There are some meters, but for such a large school they are hardly ever available. All of the parking lots are closed to students until after 6 pm, and you will definitely get a ticket within 5 minutes if you park there. We also have a ""winter parking ban"", which closes most of the parking lots after midnight."
College Junior,1,"There is not a lot of diversity at UNH.  We have a few non-whites and asians, but other than that, everyone is white."
College Sophomore,1,"A Personal Computer Is a Must Have â€“ Even though UNH does offer a lot of computer labs that are fully equipt with computers, printers, networks and the like, if you do not have your own personal computer to complete projects on or homework, you will be left in the dust. Almost all the classes i have taken require all assignments to be done online and emailed or submitted virtually to the professor. This means that computer labs are ALWAYS full unless you get there early enough to stalk a computer."
College Freshman,1,Unless your an athlete don't expect ANYTHING. All the school cares about it giving all our varsity athletes full rides while the rest of us have increasing tuitions
College Freshman,1,Availability and Convenience â€“ There is a winter parking ban where it is difficult to find a parking lot that allows you to park in the winter. I have heard many people complain about parking tickets
College Sophomore,1,"There is a lot of parking space at UNH but most of it is far away from classes. It is hard to find a spot sometimes, be sure to get to campus earlier to find a spot and make it to class on time. Freshman are not allowed to have cars which does make it very frustrating."
College Senior,1,"Police Everywhere â€“ There are UNH and Durham police everywhere, especially on the weekends, but if you are not causing trouble or extremely visibly intoxicated, they generally won't bother you.  The real problem is with parking on-campus; ticketing is unbelievable. There is nowhere to put your car, even for five minutes, without risking a hundred dollars or more in fines even for a first offense."
College Junior,1,"To Little â€“ Diversity is a major weakness for this University, though they do plan on bringing in more international students through a strong focus on the international programs."
College Freshman,1,"I would feel safe stating that 93% of the students are Caucasian, with a few African American students and others thrown into the mix. All in all the lack of diversity in culture, skin, religion and hell, even fashion is a bit harrowing."
College Sophomore,1,"Expensive and Inconvenient â€“ You have to be very careful where you park on campus. Police are very quick to ticket cars parked in non designated areas. Parking passes are very expensive as well. There simply isnt very much room allotted to parking at UNH, and the space we do have is poorly managed."
College Senior,1,"Tiny Gym â€“ The student gym at the University of New Hampshire is tiny. For a gym that services over 12,000 students, it is less than adequate. There are only 16 treadmills and approximately 20 stationary bikes/ellipticals, with a scattering of weight machines/benches. The hours of the gym are great (6am - 12am M-F, 10am-10pm Saturdays, 12pm-12am Sundays), but thats about the only good feature. What is worse is the fact that varsity athletes have access to a private gym (with better equipment), yet they continue to clog the already tiny workout center for non-varsity athletes."
College Senior,1,"Parking at UNH is horrible. There are many students that drive and absolutely not enough parking spaces. The campus police are quick to give out tickets to those people parked in areas that they shouldn't be, and the fines are NOT cheap!"
College Freshman,1,"Process Was an Absolute Headache â€“ I was constantly checking in with the office. It was a hot summer, and the staff in the financial aid were moved and I had a hard time contacting anyone. Paperwork took forever to process, and I received my financial aid too late for the tuition deadline, causing there to be a $100 late fee. The staff was very difficult to work with; I suggest starting early and asking a lot of questions ahead of time, such as what paperwork is needed for certain aid."
College Freshman,1,"Bad housing â€“ The new housing is nice, but the older buildings such as stoke are horrible! The halls smell, and bathrooms are cramped, we even have random missing tiles.  I think my hygiene has gone down just because i don't like using the facilities "
College Sophomore,1,"parking is restricted unless you have a permit which is very expensive. Tickets and fines are overpriced, however, having a car on campus is not required and not necessary because of the transportation system."

Freshman,5,"it was hard at first but once you know your way around where you need to be, its easy. My advisor was helpful in dropping one of my classes due to parent duties first. I waited so long to start that im even further behind than I thought I would be but my professors are very helpful."
Freshman,5,Enjoyable classes and honest people. Very welcoming and adaptive to covid 19 stressful events conflicting between online and in person lessons.
Junior,5,"I love the environment at Dalton State and how every instructor is interested and concerned with each student in regards to them succeeding; not only in their classes but others and outside of school as well. Dalton state is spacious yet filled with so much nature and even has trails on campus to walk on between, before, and/or after classes. I absolutely love how diverse Dalton State is among students and educators. There are always so many activities to do and support if you need it."
Junior,5,"Due to Covid-19, classes had to be put online. It was very easy to use the system Dalton State was using and to access courses and understand when deadlines were, where to turn in work, etc. It was also very easy to communicate with your professor and stay on top of your work."
Freshman,5,"Dalton State might be a small college, but this is a good thing considering classes are small and professors are more accessible.  There is a lot of help offered by faculty and students."

Alum,5,Great school with very dedicated teachers and staff. I was an international student and was able to get all the advice and support I needed for the three years I was there. The support towards foreign students was outstanding.

I have met so many amazing people, and everyone is very welcoming and kind, including the Professors, as they teach their students like real people and adults.

Freshman,5,"It is a really friendly place with many people to help you out, and with the student to teacher ratio being 19:1 it Is really easy to get 1 on 1 help with a professor"
Sophomore,5,"Dalton State College is a great college. One thing amazing about Dalton State is the student life.  The school always has events happening around campus anyone can attend. The food on campus is also great. Peeples hall offers a Starbucks, there are vending machines all around campus, and then there is the cafe that offers different food everyday. The school is also very diverse. They have a high amount of latinos enrolled at the college, which is great because they are involving a minority to makeup a large amount of the school, unlike most colleges. Dalton State is also extremely affordable. The school itself offers many scholarships that any student can apply to once they are accepted. With HOPE, PALE, or both you can end up having a free education at a school that is apart of the university system. The public safety department is great and will help any student get from class to class."
Niche User,5,"As a dual-enrollment student, I see a variety of aspects of the college from an outside perspective. The campus is very safe and there isn't much to be said for the ""party scene"". The college just added dorms for comfortability and to allow more out of state students more housing options."
Sophomore,5,It is a wonderful community with wonderful staff that loves to help others. It has a great variety of classes and extra-curricular activities. It is such a great college to attend!
Junior,5,"The community is nice, and the campus makes you comfortable. The campus is easy to navigate and it is a really good size. The people that go there make you feel included and like you belong. It has the community college feel with a four year college pay off. The dorms are really nice and feel like home away from home."
Freshman,5,Dalton Sate College is a very good college for freshmen's to adapt to the College life and a wonderful school.

Freshman,5,The counselors have been very helpful with all of my paperwork and the professors are always there to assist with any issued I have in class.
Senior,5,"I love Dalton State because it is a smaller school with plenty of opportunities to succeed. The teacher student ratio is smaller and allows students to be able to actually talk to their teacher and get personalized help unlike at bigger universities. Although it is fairly small, it is still a challenging school and the education departments make you work for your grades."
Junior,5,It's a great school to attend and especially being the cheapest university in the whole nation. The professors are really good and I would recommend this school to anyone that dont want to spend much money on college. Its nice to see a lot people from different states that found this small town that I grew up.

The academics provided at the school are at a precise and excellent level with a very reasonable price compared to other colleges and universities. When you roam the halls of DSC, you are met with individuals of many different races and ethnicities who are accepting and loving to your own. The campus size is perfect for an individual who prefers a small area of residence as well as the location which resides on well-maintained mountains. Dalton State College is an excellent choice in pursuing your education with reasonable prices, guaranteed safety around the campus, and no discrimination among peers or professors."
Junior,5,The professors are really helpful. It's a small school so the classes are always hands on. The classes are small no more than 30 people. The campus isn't too big so the walking distance from buildings aren't bad.
Junior,5,"I like the commitment of the teachers , they do their best to make all their students successful in each and every class. The classes provide a challenging environment where you actually have to use critical thinking skills and be able to solve things . The medical Lab program at Dalton state is the best ."

Junior,5,"I appreciate the commitment of faculty and staff. Being an education major, the education classes are the best classes I have taken. Great school!"

Sophomore,5,It is a nice college with a small town feel to it. The atmosphere is nice and a great place to learn.
Niche User,5,I  have had a AWESOME experience at DSC!!!!! They have a great campus. The students there are so kind and actually care about school and keeping the campus clean!

Senior,5,"I absolutely love this college. I am older and was nervous that I would not fit in, that went away real quick. Everyone was very welcoming. The professors are amazing. Most of them will go above and beyond to help you. I am so glad I chose this college."
Niche User,5,Dalton State is an amazing college to go and experience. Its one of the top Affordable Colleges in the state. The staff and members are Great.
Niche User,5,I really love the price and the way that people motives you to be part of the Dalton State I think is a really way to get start your education. It's close to home for me. Also is not expensive as other schools.
Freshman,5,Dalton State College is an amazing college for people who are wanting to start somewhere that is very affordable. It is in a great area of Dalton and allows students from all over to appreciate the school. Every professor I have had was always considerate of their students and even the student body is always there if someone needs help with something. I think Dalton State College is a great college that is able to give many options to every one of their students.
Alum,5,"I am an alumnus of Dalton State College, and I really enjoyed my experience.  The professors were always helpful and encouraging, and I had the opportunity to lead on campus in a way that may have been more difficult at a larger university.  The tuition is very affordable and has allowed me to build an excellent career in Information Technology.  I highly recommend my alma mater."
Freshman,5,"I loved the different opportunities and diverse experiences you get at Dalton State. All over campus there are a ton of things you can do. Weather it be hanging and dining out in the pope area or studying in the library, you will always have a helpful hand. The student life on campus is overwhelmingly nice and welcoming. I love being able to interact with different types of people everyday. I have noticed  that the professors aren't just their for the job, but because they actually care about the education of the students. They aren't like the scary stories I've heard in high school where professors will rip up your work if its wrong, and they will not even show you how to do it right. They are always willing to go the extra mile to help you understand the subject, and they give you the schedule of their office hours so you know when and where to seek extra help. The overall experience is a joy, and I'm proud to call myself a roadrunner."
Niche User,5,"Dalton State is a great school. I took the biology introductory courses, and I have an amazing teacher."
Junior,5,"Dalton State College is known as one of the most affordable colleges in the country. Set in the beautiful mountains of northwest Georgia, this college as grown from a community college to a four year university, with shuttle parking to accommodate the growing number of students. The nearby restaurants benefit from the college and the area of Dalton is thriving because of the college's presence. The teachers are learned and patient with the students, helping the students who struggle with the concepts to succeed. The growing community of online classes available makes this college even more affordable for working adults. "
College Junior,5,They will work with you to fit your classes in with your schedule. There's a wide range of classes that are available throughout the day. It's very easy to get a flexible schedule.
College Junior,5,"eCore registration is very simple, and easy to get into. The workload is the same as a class on campus. The professor's check multiple times a day to make sure they have everyone's questions answered. They have a great tutor that is FREE."
College Junior,5,"I am not to this point in my college career, so I am not sure"
College Junior,5,I have had a great experience with every professor I have encountered. They incorporate a lot of activities that most affordable colleges would not include.
College Junior,5,"Great group of employers on campus. They deal with many students, but still manage to work with you one on one with your schedule."
College Junior,5,"It's a very challenging school unlike most affordable colleges. Studying is a must, but that is a wonderful thing. It means we're learning! The buildings are very clean and presentable. They have many events for students and extra-curricular activities. The Biology major has a lot of options at Dalton State College."
College Junior,5,"This college is very affordable , and the professor's are very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,There's a large variety of classes and times. Transferring credits is no problem as long as you discuss it with your advisor. Registering for classes is always fairly easy and you can make it as convenient as you want. I always prefer Tuesday and Thursday classes
College Sophomore,5,The courses are worth the money with all sorts of new technology and such. The professors are always at your disposal
College Sophomore,5,There's usually tables set up all over school for recrites of all categories.
College Sophomore,5,"My school is affordable, but challenging. They accept everyone and make sure to include everyone in all sorts of activies. They are always having events that are fun and advertise all the time. Over the summer there was a ""murder mystery"" in the library that anyone could partake in. My school is very fun, caring, and challenging acedemically, yet the professors will assist you in any way they can to ensure you pass."
College Freshman,5,I ABSOLUTELY love our online courses! I enjoy being able to easily work at my own pace fit to my own schedule. And most professors are very available if you do need help with something.
Graduate Student,4,The online classes are great because they are well prepared. The Education program is great. You serve over 1000 hours of student teaching in the two-year Elementary Education Program.
Graduate Student,4,Dalton State College is a friendly college located in a great peaceful town. It is off the interstate and makes it convenient for towns near the area.
Sophomore,4,"I love Dalton State because it is close to home. The environment is very friendly, and I have met some awesome people on campus. Because it is a smaller college, the professors have the time to talk to each student. The professors are really caring and helpful. The staff is always checking up on the students and giving us access to resources that may help us."
Freshman,4,"I really like how nice of a community Dalton State is as a whole. There are lots of campus events, places to hang out, and people to meet. The Professors are good, and almost always really care about the students. I would like to see a bigger impact on Dalton as a whole, while Dalton state does do a lot for the community by being here, it doesn't do too much when it comes to supporting the community. One of my favorite things about Dalton State would have to be the public safety department. There are emergency button toweres everwhere,  very friendly police, and lots of them."
Senior,4,"It’s a small college that provides a relatively well-rounded education for students. However, issues with parking, lack of classes, and underpaid professors leads to issues with scheduling and graduation."
Junior,4,"This College, even though only a four year college, is well diverse, in addition to being well centered around the needs of the students. This college is located in a semi small town, just in between Atlanta and Knoxville. Since the college was originally a community college (it is in the works of being a full fledged university) this college is still very in touch with the small Dalton community. The have what they call the ""bird feeder""which help those students who need additional help providing themselves and their families with non-perishables. They also still offer very many afternoon and ""night"" classes for those who have to work the regular 9-5 jobs. Even though  Dalton is a somewhat small community it offers many opportunities to experience different cultures and help people see different perspectives. Being a transfer from Chattanooga, I enjoy the people and the learning environment more at Dalton State College."
Freshman,4,"Very good school. Although, getting everything together before classes start is a hassle. They need better organization."
Junior,4,"I like that dalton state is very close to my house. I live about 30 minutes from there, so I am not that far from my family members. I love that safety is very prioritized on this campus. One thing I will mention is the lack of parking spots. If you want a good parking spot you have to get there way before your class starts. However, the professors are very helpful and dedicated and it helps the overall learning experience."
Freshman,4,My time at Dalton State College has been a good time. They are always trying to get students more involved in the community and the school. Teachers are very understanding and are always willing to work with and help students to succeded. The environment of the school makes me glad I chose to go to a smaller school over a big university. I feel as if there is more one on one time with professors and you really get involved with a lot more of the students. I have made a lot of friends and great connections because of Dalton State College.
Niche User,4,"Dual Enrollment student here.
Other than a few hiccups with some professors, I've really enjoyed my time at DSC. It's a great campus, and in a real nice location by means of where everything else in Dalton is located. Everyone's real nice, they all seem to love making you feel welcome, and all the professors I've had have, to some degree, wanted to make sure you succeed in your class. 

My only gripe is my Spanish professor not really teaching my class Spanish?? But rather letting us kinda just? Talk? Screwed us all over when Finals came around but other than that, I still really enjoyed my time here at DSC and I don't expect anything less than astonishing with future performance."
Freshman,4,"The staff and students are all so uplifting! Always trying to stay involved in keeping up with everyone, the staff has proven themselves to be an outstanding group of people!"
Niche User,4,"Every time i had a question they were fast to respond and nice. They never got frustrated with me. This is a good priced school for in-state and out of state tuition. They want to make sure you have the highest education they can, they are always willing to help and never leave you unstratified."
Sophomore,4,"Not a very huge school, but average. Nice education and professors. Not very excellent food. I enjoy my time here even though I plan on transferring out."
Sophomore,4,I love dalton state so far. I am an online student with them currently and it is so simple to contact my professors in case I need help.
Senior,4,A nice community college that has so much to offer. It keeps growing and offering more degrees for its students.
Niche User,4,"Dalton State is small town school with very difficult professors. The seem to just be there to be paid with a few exceptions. I enjoying going there to get some what I needed to, but there is not a community at this school."
Senior,4,"If I could change anything, it would be getting more involved on campus. There were a lot of cool opportunities on campus, but often they were times that I had classes or that I had to work."
Sophomore,4,Professors at Dalton State are very kind and encouraging. Professors encourage you to ask for help. The campus is very beautiful and diverse. There are lots of opportunities to make new friends and get involved in student activities. They also have lots of degree opportunities and the academic advisors to help you with your degree decisions. Dalton State has definitely been a great experience so far. There has been no point where I haven't felt unsafe at Dalton State.
Freshman,4,"It was an enjoyable experience, and the professors were all very nice and helpful. I would not want to stay all 4 years however."
Freshman,4,"I currently attend Dalton State College and I am going to be very honest on this review. Educationally, Dalton State is a good choice to learn and improve on a major or area of study. It is also a very good option for those with financial struggles, which is one of the reasons I attend the college. The dorms and food are quite impressive too, bu the only problem I have with the school is the lack of school spirit and activities. If this area can be improved it would make Dalton State College a beautiful college experience."
Senior,4,"If you want to go to a college with small classes and more interaction with your professors this is it. Dalton state really wants you to succeed and feel welcomed.  However, if you are looking for a party school and the “college experience” this isn’t it."
Niche User,4,Administration is very helpful . I believe they should make a bigger parking space . Many have a hard time find parking due to the limit of parking  spaces.
Sophomore,4,"small college that makes you feel important to school and you get a nice one on one experience with it, professors really seem to care about their work."
Sophomore,4,"I have been here almost 4 years and have enjoyed it. Dalton State College is an affordable school with pretty easy classes. There are a lot of degree options and the staff are very approachable, from professors to financial aid; I've never had any problems. The campus itself is very clean and well-organized and they also offer many of their courses online, with some programs completely online."
Junior,4,I like the small classroom setting and the ability to interact with invested professors. The campus is small and student oriented. Most professors are always willing to help.
Sophomore,4,"Dalton State has plenty to offer students. Anything and everything you need on campus is all within 5 minutes walking distance. If you can't find what you're looking for on campus, Dalton State is located just mere minutes away from the interstate and West Walnut Avenue, which is where the majority of Dalton's restaurants are located. Dalton State is only a 10 minute drive from my house so it's also very convenient for me. The only thing that keeps Dalton State from being ""excellent"" in my opinion is the limited majors they offer. Now they offer a large selection of majors, however they lack in the science and technology majors in my opinion. Other than that, it's a great college."
Alum,4,I love DSC. There are a wide variety of classes to suit everyones needs. The staff and students are great to be around. There's so many clubs and sports programs.
Sophomore,4,"Dalton State is a very challenging, very success driven college. You’re encouraged to participate in the classrooms and student life. It’s a very good college."
Freshman,4,I recently started classes at dalton state. I go full time and I love it there. The teachers are super helpful and the campus isn’t to big for me to get from class to class.
Sophomore,4,Dalton State is an extremely friendly college and you receive a lot of help with your advisors in choosing the classes best for you. Professors pick you up when you are confused or don't understand only if you reach out.
Niche User,4,The professors and staff at Dalton State have done everything in their power to make sure I feel at home and that I am taking all the classes I need to for my desired degree. The students truly tale you in and make you feel like one of their own.
Sophomore,4,"Dalton State  is a really good school to go to . The education is one of the best. Professors truly care about the students and they urge students to pass. This is NOT a party school. However, education is better to have then a party experience."
Sophomore,4,i the professors at dalton state college. they teach very well. i also like how they built the dorm rooms. they are very nice and clean. dalton state college is a good environment according to me.
Freshman,4,"This is a place that feels like home. Amazing community, and very active student life. I never want to leave. The professors are tough, but it's helpful. Roadrunners forever."
Alum,4,"I almost gave DSC a 3, and the reason I didn't was because I really enjoyed my academic experience. My professors and the content of my classes were great, and I loved learning at Dalton State. However, the administrative side of things needs some work. The financial aid office is kind of a mess, and if there is ever an issue with your disbursement, you will have to hold them by the hand to help them do their job in order to make sure you get your aid. The same could be said for admissions. Still, I wouldn't change anything. If I had it to do over, I'd pick DSC again."
Freshman,4,"The school is extremely affordable, and very nice as well. All of the students are friendly, and it is easy to get involved!"
Junior,4,"Dalton State is a smaller school, but growing. We currently have just over 5,000 students. I feel like my education is top notch. The school has a very close community. I love it here. Beep Beep!"
Freshman,4,"It's a typical small-town college but it seems that everyone there is very close. You're never afraid to ask a question because everyone there has been there, and they understand the shoes you're currently in. The professors are there to help and they want to see you succeed. Although their classes may not be easy, they're there to push you to be the best you can be. Dorming is new on campus but it seems to already have taken off throughout the college, more college students are signing up to be housed on campus and the student council as well as the president are thrilled about Dalton State soon becoming a University."
Junior,4,I am currently attending college. Dalton state is a good but yet tough school to attend. The classes you are in are sometimes helpful to overall life.
College Freshman,4,"As far as working with my schedule, it couldn't possibly be easier to get things done around my time. Whenever I schedule classes I'm able to tell my adviser my schedule and she fits classes around it."
College Freshman,4,Every professor I've come across has been a delight. All professors appear to be there for their students more than the money. Class size is great and the school is constantly trying to add new courses and degrees.
College Freshman,4,The program I plan on entering has a very high turnover rate. I believe it is 97% within 6 months of graduating. That's reassuring.
College Freshman,4,The programs are designed to tailor your specific major and you don't have to waste a lot of time with pre-course work.
College Freshman,4,I feel like Dalton State has made the transfer from high school to college easy. It has a very comfortable atmosphere and I really enjoy it.
College Junior,4,"It's a small college, so it doesn't have super specific degrees. I have not really heard anything about alumni from my college, I think that has to do with our 17% graduation rate. Most people I know transfer colleges before they graduate."
College Junior,4,"The college is good, but you don't really get into the swing of things until after your first year. After that is when you learn all the ""Ins and Outs"". It would be nice to have someone to guide you in the beginning."
College Junior,4,My job allows me to work either morning or nights so I can take morning or night classes. However when you get to upper level classes it seems you have to be on campus every day. I think it could be nice that upper level classes are only offered two days a week. That way for those of use who have to travel some can save a little gas for their car and time traveling for just one class that wasn't offer on the other two days.
College Junior,4,Sometimes you run into having two tests on the same day and if you don't do some type of group study it can get hard. I love group study. You get a new look from so many people that it makes studying fun. And you remember a lot. And can pass classes with ease.
College Junior,4,Once you're part of the Roadrunner Nations you're always a part of it.
College Junior,4,They have new programs being added each year for anyone.
College Junior,4,I'm returning to Dalton State for my second degree. I love this place! It's small enough that you don't have to run from class to class. They have a lot to offer or everyone as long as you get involved.
College Junior,4,I love the LPN program I am excited to be going into a field that I love and want to work. The best is yet to come.
College Junior,4,I have been going here and it is a bit challenging but it is worthwhile. Can't wait to graduate December 2017!
College Freshman,4,it has been very convenient i have learned many new things that i will benefit from
College Freshman,4,i have not had any online courses
College Freshman,4,my professors are very good at my school they get to the point while teaching so its pretty easy to understand
College Freshman,4,i hope to participate in internships to better my chances of getting a job
College Freshman,4,I've learned many different careers that i can do with a degree of my choice
College Freshman,4,I've had a very good experience at my school everything is very easy to access
College Sophomore,4,This school is unique through the friendly academic environment. I would choose to come back because this campus is friendly.
Freshman,2,"Dalton State must be the most boring and dead college in the whole United States. You would think that there would be a college atmosphere when you walk on campus, but it seems like a prison more than a college. There are no parties, no pretty girls, the only good thing about it is the academics. Dalton State needs to step it up in every aspect."
Freshman,2,The online experience was not for me. too many technical difficulties and too much work being thrown at you especially during these covid days.
Freshman,2,Good college that offers a wide variety of majors to choose from but when log into your email and have to deal with phishers trying to get your information on your SCHOOL EMAIL that's absolutely ridiculous. I shouldn't have to worry about whether the server has been compromised or not when I check my SCHOOL EMAIL!!!! RIDICULOUS AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!!
College Sophomore,2,Dalton State College degrees are not looked at highly. The name won't help you get a job nor keep one.
College Junior,2,There is nothing unique. It is very boring. 
College Junior,2,There is not much to do and the school could use new facilities. 
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty much just a basic community college. It's working on getting updated, with more housing, an updated student center, and more parking space, but it's still small and not fantastic. You get what you pay for."
College Freshman,2,"athletic centers on campus are almost non existent. there is talk of making the gym bigger, which i hope happens. there are some tennis courts and an intramural field. library hours are not very good. on the positive side, the campus is beautiful. set just in front of the mountains, with lots of nature around."
College Senior,2,"the campus resources are ok, the gym is tiny and the cafeteria along with the library are very limited."
College Senior,2,My major is only offered as an associate's degree. I wish they would extend it to a bachelor's degree.
College Sophomore,2,"The school doesn't even have a first aid kit or nurse on campus.....and it's mostly known for its Nursing Program! Even though the resources are there, the staff are rude and unfriendly."
College Sophomore,2,"The school use to be fair (money wise) to all the students.  When I first started attending the school, I was content because it was affordable for all students.  As the years progressed, however, things started going downhill.  The college started to focus on ways to ""catch up"" with other universitys; building unnecessary objects, increasing tuition, etc."
College Sophomore,2,I had went through an entire year before they made me go through orientation and stopped me from registering for classes.
College Sophomore,2,"Improvement on the College – They should make the school bigger because there is way to many students, and we are unable to get the classes that we need to take."
College Sophomore,2,"I Am a Biology Major – It is one of the harder degrees to get at DSC. The facilities are decently set up and the majority of the supplies needed are always there. There are some crazy electives that i still dont understand what they had to do with my major, but the school says theyre manditory. It did take away from time needed to study for my major though."
College Student,2,Don't Know Much – I haven't graduated yet so I'm not so sure about this.  I personally haven't heard anyone say much about this.  Though I have been told of people that have majored in the same thing as me that went here and found a job right after graduating.
College Freshman,2,Careers Found for Certain Students – Some students find the colleges services useful others do not. It really depends on what degree you graduated with.
College Junior,2,"Credit Hour Failure – The reason I chose Dalton State College was how affordable it was and the fact I could live at home. Dalton State did offer a variety of majors with some of the most amazing teachers, but the advisors are not the ones to ask advice on what classes you should take. This past year I took two classes equaling to about eight credit hours lost."
College Senior,2,Inconvenience of Parking – Parking is terrible at the college.  They should not enroll more students than they have parking spaces for.
College Junior,2,High Tuition – I believe that the tuition is pretty high for such a small campus. It is really ridiculous actually.
Senior,1,Dalton State picks and chides favorites. The Student life office only helps students with the same liberal mindset as they have.
College Sophomore,1,Haven't even heard them mention post-grad
College Freshman,1,"Club Opportunities – The school encourages anyone and everyone to start their very own organization or club. Unfortunately when I tried to join a club I thought would be fun, there was no follow-through on activities and meetings. The freedom is there, but no one enforces that meetings should be regularly held."
College Freshman,1,Difficulty getting help with any questions or concerns. I've gotten sent from one end of campus to the other without getting the help I needed. Professors are great but other staff are not knowledgeable and lack communication skills and respect/concern for the students. I have experienced bad attitudes and an unwillingness to provide answers to simple questions or help with anything for that matter. Ive Been very disappointed with Dalton State College in my 2 years there. I'm planning on attending another college if I continue to feel the same.
College Sophomore,1,"There is too much material to study for one test. It's a lot to learn and have to raise family at same time. I don't think some professors realize you have a family and job outside of college. You are wanting to better yourself, and it should be a challenge not a defeat process."
College Freshman,1,Two Words: SO CONFUSING – I was so confused regarding financial aid when to file for it and how it works. I had to basically figure it all out by myself and the people who worked there werent very helpful..
College Student,1,"Not So Much – I am a biology major, and I thought I would be working more in the field and with microscopes and other fascinating organisms, but all we have done was take quizzes and learn about stuff in chemistry. I am not even taking chemistry yet."
College Freshman,1,"Entrance Into Medical Programs – After picking a major in the medical field (for new career), I was signed up with core classes. Admissions/enrollment was unaware that specific courses had to be taken the first semester to progress and actually be admitted to the program. I was given wrong
classes and was informed after first semester by the department's assistant director that my two year degree was going to end up taking four years. I've heard similar stories from other students and most are transferring to other schools. Me, too!"
College Freshman,1,"DSC Post Grad – The school offers no graduate level work.  As far as I know, there are only some opportunities for alumni to stay involved with the school."

Freshman,5,"The people who go the school are awesome, it's very diverse and the learning experience is great. The campus is also pretty and spacious."
Freshman,5,"Dominican University has been very cautious especially with COVID-19. There's at most, 10 students in a class and 12 students in a lab. They provide enough spacing so that students are the required 6ft apart. The professors are awesome and caring, as well as the students. The online experience is very interactive as well."
Sophomore,5,"All my classes turned online during the spring due to COVID-19. However, the transition process went smoothly. Professors either created pre recorded videos for us to follow along on our own time or other professors would schedule 2 day meetings in a zoom call."

When you first come to Dominican, you get a sense of community and comfort by being surrounded by so many people from different walks of life. You have the opportunity to show your unique talents and discuss things you're very passionate about. This is a Hispanic Serving Institution, that advocates also for undocumented students. We have so many clubs and organizations to choose from so you can make a difference outside of the classroom. You also have the opportunity to do research alongside professors and participate in conferences where you showcase what you do outside of the classroom. There's so many majors to choose from and you can even make your own major. You can get help from academic advisors to do so. All of the faculty members at Dominican are willing to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. There is no such thing as a dumb question.

The school provides so many resources and encourages the students to see what is best for them and their education."
Sophomore,5,"I appreciate the small class sizes and teachers that care about their students.  
The athletic programs are improving each year as they recruit quality athletes.  I would improve the dining services as it can be limited."

Senior,5,"Dominican brings in professors that invest their time and effort into students education. This is currently my third semester at Dominican as a transfer students, and I must say I have nothing but positive feedback for all of my professors. 

One thing that I would like to see change at Dominican is an expansion of the library. There are so many students who spend their time at the library working on homework and studying, and such little room to do so without it being congested."
Senior,5,"I love the comunity. Everyone is welcomed at Dominican. Students always respect property and other students, as well as create a safe environment. I like how there are traditions, such as the Caritas and Varitas day and candle and rose ceremony."

Junior,5,I  love the campus. Everyone who has helped with this process of transferring out from Morton College to Dominican has been so nice and helpful. My advisor replies back to my emails within a reasonable amount of time.
Niche User,5,Dominican University is my dream school. I went to visit to the school and I liked the school. Right now I am a senior in High School and I really want to attend Dominican University. My sister goes theres and she loves it. The area is so calm and beautiful. The campus is huge and amazing. Theres a lot of opportunity for students.  Especially during the summer where you can meet new people and feel welcome to the school.
Junior,5,"My experience at Dominican University has been amazing, it was my first college choice because it reminded me of my high school. It was the perfect size, and the staff was very friendly and made me feel at home, which made my decision easier to attend."
Freshman,5,"It is my first year in college. I am almost done with my first semester and I've so far have a great image of the school. Everyone is so welcoming and outgoing. If there  was something that I would change it will be some dorm minor problems, but nothing that would change my mind of attending the school."
Freshman,5,"I like everything about Dominican University. The staff are so welcoming and friendly, they make you a part of their lives. Above all, everyone is looking for a way to grow together, as a community."
Junior,5,"It's a great school from a commuter's point of view. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved. The small classroom sizes make it easy for students to get to know each other and their professors better than they would at larger schools. Lot's of free stuff and chances to participate in many different events. Soccer and baseball are the two big sports at the school, but there are also several other sports for both men and women to join."
Graduate Student,5,"Dominican University is a small yet mighty college. It is one of the most diverse colleges in a nation and it does not have a Greek life affiliation. There are no sororities or fraternities which makes the atmosphere feel less judging and more accepting. There are a few faulty staff members roaming about, but Dominican does everything and anything to make sure students feel safe in their University and make as many changes as they can to continue this mission."
Junior,5,"I first attended the University of Illinois at Chicago for my freshman year and It was a unfriendly campus. The professors did not seem to care for the students and the students on campus did not want to bothered. I am currently at Dominican University and it is definitely an entirely new experience. Not only is Dominican's Camps beautiful, the professors are extremely friendly and they get to know a student more outside from just being their student. Dominican University is a College that is worth every penny."
Niche User,5,"It's great. I really enjoy the campus and the environment. The curriculum is simplistic, and the opportunities are vast."
Niche User,5,"Small, comfortable, and beautiful. They have an excellent library and other facilities, many of which students can apply to work with and pay off their tuition or simply earn money. Very clean and quiet."
Sophomore,5,Dominican University is a very cozy environment- almost feels like home. You can spend hours in the library or around campus without even realizing it. Many of their professors are extremely passionate about the subject they teach which makes learning a great time for many students.
Graduate Student,5,I have a lot of help from this school and the instructors work well with the students. I just started this school in August and I was so afraid because I work full time so I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to maintain but so far I'm doing great and I'm ready to be done with my first year.
Freshman,5,"Dominican University is a great school to attend. It is very diverse, containing a wide amount of people from all over the world! The school provides free tutoring, free fun events, excellent teachers and so on. While attending Dominican, I've been able to make new friends with ease and learn about the school itself. It's an awesome place to learn."
College Junior,5,The class sizes are perfect for those engaging moments where one can ask the teacher for help and communicate greatly with other classmates. The professors are astounding as they will take time out of their day to help you.
College Senior,5,A degree from Dominican University will open many doors to you.  The school is very prestigious and has been around for many years so when you say the name it is recognized and immediately anyone with that information knows that you have had a great education.
College Senior,5,Professors at Dominican University are very helpful and will go out of their way to help students succeed.  When students are interested in their own success it helps a great deal for the Professors and makes their job easier of giving students the information they need to succeed during their schooling at Dominican University.
College Senior,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. There are RA's on duty 24 hours and campus security always on duty.  I feel safe entering on and off campus after studying late and returning to the dorms or leaving out early to go study.  I have never had a issue of assault or any situation that will leave me in fear of being active around campus during any hour.
College Senior,5,"I enjoy attending Dominican University.  The Professors are very helpful, knowledgable, and encouraging during the schooling process. If I am unsure and need help in any certain subject or on assignments I can go to instructors for help after class or via email.  Another helpful thing is there are helpful tutors on campus that are always available to tutor students in difficult subjects.  I am glad I chose Dominican University as my college of choice because it is a small school with a setting that is helpful with students needing 1 on 1 attention.  The classes are small and students do not feel like just a number among all of the students that attend the University.  I will send my children and my children's children to Dominican University."
College Sophomore,5,Dominican is a dream school if you're into smaller and calmer settings. Professors do care about their student's individual goals and always make time to meet with them individually to discuss grades and to go over papers. The courses themselves seem like everyday courses but there is always a treat to them. We offer unique courses depending on the time of the year from election centered classes to art therapy during the spring.
College Sophomore,5,"Safety at Dominican is very good. Our school has active security guards all around campus throughout 24 hours every day. Security is also very easily reachable and do not hesitate to walk you to your call if you have a late night class. Our school does not have any reporting sexual assault cases but still take every action believable to prevent it. Dominican also has a very good health department. Whether you are feeling sick or are having personal issues at home, Dominican's health staff are always providing a helping hand."
College Sophomore,5,Dominican is an amazing school. I love it
College Sophomore,5,Dominican University is an amazing school! The professors are reachable and friendly.
College Freshman,5,"I have only attended Dominican for one year but it has already been one of the best experiences. Dominican is like a family where we have a plethora of cousins all within the walls of a campus that slightly resembles Hogwarts. I think what sets this school a part though is the relationship between professors and the students. For example, my English professor has made sure to schedule one on one meetings with all her students when we are in the process of writing big papers in order to provide us with guidance on what actions are needed to be taken to do the best we can. I think the best experience though is the fact that in my first year I've managed to score an internship and a position as a student delegate in College Debate 2016 hosted in California due to the help from various professors and administration."
College Sophomore,5,"On Mondays I have a class until five o'clock and on Wednesdays I have a class until nine thirty at night. There has never been a time where I have not felt, I love how safe I feel walking around."
College Sophomore,5,I have loved all of my professors! They are always very supportive and constantly trying to help you get the best education you can.
College Sophomore,5,"I know for a fact that as soon as I graduate from Dominican I will get a job, the amount of resources and help that there is is unbelievable."
College Sophomore,5,I do not live there but I have spent a few nights at Dominican and I surprisingly liked being there at night.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Dominican, I truly could not be happier with my choice. A lot of people say how they do not like it because it is not a party school, but I go to Dominican to learn and get my degree not party. I truly love the atmosphere of the school and how I can have connections with all of my professor."
College Freshman,5,"I feel safe, i don;t worry about that :)"
College Sophomore,5,"I think they offer a variety of majors and minors and other programs at the school. There are many clubs that students can join, and the courses are great."
College Sophomore,5,They have a website to help you if you ever come to a problem with a professor or other students. They provide numbers to call for any assistance.
College Sophomore,5,It's such a small school that you get to know a lot of proffesors and students. Everyone is very kind to each other. The school has very helpful resources and hosts many activities and events for students to attend.
College Junior,5,My university valued diversity and challenging students on an academic level. I feel as though I am getting my money's worth.
College Freshman,5,"I attend Dominican University, and I'm currently a freshman. Before attending college I was nervous and anxious about the new chapter in my life, but Dominican University has made the whole transition from High school to College fun and exciting. I can't complain about Dominican. They're so nice and caring and always willing to help the students. The only problem Ive faced has been keeping up with the payments. Because it is a private school it is pricier than most universities. This scholarship would really help out my mother and I. My mother is a single mother who works very hard in order for me to attend Dominican University, winning this scholarship would just make it easier on both her and I."
College Freshman,5,"I'm pretty new to the school, and its only been about a month. However, I love it and I am so happy I made the decision to come to Dominican."
Alum,4,"I was able to complete online learning fairly well at Dominican University. Expectations and schedules were straight forward and clear. Teachers were extremely engaged, commenting on every post and reaching out for constructive criticism and praise alike."
Sophomore,4,I applied later than most of my classmates and was awarded a good financial package. All of the staff I have ever spoken to were kind and knowledgeable in their respective areas.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors were skilled in using technology platforms when the stay at home order was placed. Although bound to the computer, many professors found a way to create group activities and projects through zoom breakout rooms or shared google docs. Although an adjustment to online learning was challenging, the grading scale was fair."
Sophomore,4,Dominican has a family vibe to it. The class sizes are fairly small and the professors actually care about you. They care about your mental health before anything and that is greatly appreciated. It's also a very beautiful and small campus. Everything is within walking distance. One thing I would change about Dominican is the price.
Freshman,4,"The staff and students are very kind. Especially with professors and the staff, everyone wants to help the students in anyway possible whether it be in school or not. There are numerous resources and tons of opportunities"
Freshman,4,"Professors try there best to teach the content like if we were still physically in class. We were provided numerous resources and tons of support,"
Freshman,4,"Dominican University has been so welcoming to me since the very beginning. Starting from when I applied to now, they have been with me every step of the way. The college counselors are amazing at their jobs."
Freshman,4,"Dominican is a great school, the class sizes are small, everyone is really nice to each other. No matter what everyone will say hi to you, most students are fairly kind to each other."
Niche User,4,I visited Dominican University multiple times in the past year and every time I walk on their campus it makes me feel at home. The city of River Forest is very peaceful and perfectly suits the vibes you get from Dominican. Overall the school has been very impressive and I would highly consider enrolling in the fall.
Sophomore,4,"Dominican is a very good school, the classes are very close by to the dorm rooms. The food is good on some days, but you live and are close to the city to run out and get the food. There is a high amount of Hispanic students at the school barely any Caucasians, blacks, and Asians at Dominican. There is no party life on campus and everyone respects your things if you step away for a couple minutes."
Junior,4,Professors combine strong academic credentials and passion for teaching with real-world expertise and robust professional connections. They offer hundreds of avenues at the undergraduate and graduate levels to explore career interests.
Sophomore,4,"Being a small university, Dominican professors have a better connection with their students and are always willing to help out. Dominican also has academic centers that are also available to students who need help in certain areas of study."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed that it was a smaller university, therefore, the connections you made with classmates and professors was a lasting experience. However, as I was a commuter, I felt somewhat out of the loop with events that went on due to the fact that I didn't live there. I would to see more inclusion with commuter students."
Senior,4,"Dominican University is a small school, which I really love. I am a part of the Nutrition and Dietetics program, and it is even smaller. I see the same faces everyday, so it is extremely easy to make friends. My favorite part about this university is the one on one interaction with the instructors. They want you to succeed and do what they can to help."
Sophomore,4,"The community is very friendly and for the most part, the professors teach well and care about their students success. If I could improve one thing about the University, It would definitely be to create a more engaging community with more activities and events. For the most part, the campus is quiet since the majority of students are commuters and leave after their classes. I am also a commuter but I feel like the events and activities aren't promoted enough or the activities and events aren't that interesting. Dominican University is basically a University that you'd go to focus on school."
Junior,4,"It’s a great environment, the student teacher ratio is great the one on one interaction is great. The ambiance is very postitive everyone from staff, faculty and students are very friendly and welcoming. Great facility hours and amenities."
Junior,4,Great small school environment and great people- from students to professors. A very welcoming campus that challenges you accordingly. The tuition is expensive but there are a number of scholarship opportunities and the experience is worth it.
Freshman,4,"This university is diverse, which one of the things I absolutely love. Since this is a private university, it's not as big. Everyone here is very close with one another and are very friendly. The professors here are also very helpful and accessible. They will do their best in order for you to understand material presented in the class."
Junior,4,"I like the Professors I've had. I feel like the school is a big community that welcomes diversity. There were a few instances where some racial slurs were thrown around, but I was not involved in those instances. I used to work in the library at the school and enjoyed the experience. I am currently going into my Junior year at Dominican University."
Senior,4,Its a great school with small class sizes and I love the professors due to the attention they give their students but the tuition is very expensive and you can never find parking. I love how the classes are an hour long and they're one after the other so the day gets done quicker as well as you can easily walk from building to building. Its a great University for the rich.
Senior,4,Dominican University is a small school with many friendly faces. I would like to see in improvement in the food variety and quality.
Junior,4,"I really like the small campus and class sizes that Dominican University has to offer. When you walk on campus you're overwhelmed with greenery and gothic aesthetic this campus provides to the suburban community of River Forest. Being a small school also has its downfall, particularly the lack of range in professors. It is common that certain classes are only taught every other semester which causes many people to resort to taking summer classes in order to fulfill their credit credentials. I would recommend for anybody to apply because this school is what you make it. There are a lot of clubs that you can be involved with and its close proximity to Chicago means that a lot of professors are good people to network with."
Sophomore,4,"After finishing my first year, I'd have to say that Dominican University is a great college to attend. Classes can be stressful, but almost all of the professors I've had have been kindhearted and helpful. The people on this campus are great to interact and work with too. Open mic nights are a highlight."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and the class sizes are small. There are plenty of opportunities to further your social life and gain plenty of knowledge. I will say that they are strict in their financial deadlines and that sometimes you need to email administrators because of slow service.
Freshman,4,As my first year here it has been an amazing experience! It is a small campus but very beautiful and quiet perfect for studying. The Professors are incredible at what they do and always want to help you achieve your goals
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending Dominican University. It is located in a beautiful campus and the surrounding area is very nice. The student body is very kind and the Professors are thoughtful and considerate and want you to be successful. I enjoy being a student athlete at this wondrous university.
Freshman,4,What I like about Dominican University is that its not to big so it's pretty easy to know your way around campus. I also like the professor there because they are willing to help you if you ask for it.
Junior,4,"I love Dominican! Great school, friendly students, and a good environment to learn!! The school isn't too big or too small, and its easy to get to and from class. There are a lot of clubs and sports too join, so there is always something to do on campus.  The professors are also nice, except there are a few that can give you a hard time (but thats the case for almost every school)."
Freshman,4,"Dominican is a very cozy and comfortable University. Faculty and Staff are always there for students to come and see them with problems, suggestions and helpful advice. My first year at Dominican has been truly amazing because there is so many things to do on campus."
Junior,4,"Dominican University is set on helping all students rise to their full potential. They offer many opportunities to students to get the academic help they need. When I first walked into Dominican, it was very clean and it was easy to find things. I talked to an admissions advisor about transferring over from community college into their nursing program, and she provided all of the information I needed to get into the program. The staff that I have talked to are extremely nice and are willing to help you in any way that you need."
Freshman,4,Dominican University is a liberal art institution which I loved! Everyone is so diverse and accepting and I really felt that I could be who I wanted to there which I love. The professors are there to serve your every need which is wonderful!
Sophomore,4,"I love DU! It's a very small school and all your peers and teachers get to know you better that way. I love the campus, its beautiful! Dorming at DU was a great experience too , its  a very diverse school."
Alum,4,"As a recent graduate of Dominican (class of 2016), I am very glad to have gone to school there. They helped me to afford to go to school despite not starting out with a lot of money, and now coming out the other side without too much debt, I'm able to look into grad schooling right away.
Pros: 
--Small class size. You're not just a number.
--Passionate professors. I took on independent projects with multiple professors during my senior year, outside of class.
--Great financial aid. I have almost no debt after graduation.
--Beautiful campus, great for just hanging around outside.
Cons: 
--Christian. The professors are generally accepting, but classmates can be bigoted against LGBT classmates or other religions.
--Sweltering dorm rooms. I had my window open in the dead of winter and it was still boiling hot in my dorm.
--Awful meal plan. They will only let you be exempt if you have food allergies.
All in all, it was a very positive experience, and I'm glad I went."
Junior,4,"Dominican University  is a beautiful campus with its old, rustic architecture. They offer a wide-range of classes to take and have various majors to chose from. Professors are very nice and helpful to the students. Resources are always available to students."
Senior,4,"Dominican university is a very diverse school. I am an athlete at this all school and the professors are amazing. They are so great about my schedule, letting me know what I missed and providing extra help when I need it. The volleyball and soccer trams are fun to watch."
Sophomore,4,I am still currently a student at Dominican University and all i can say is that i love this school. The small setting and smaller class sizes allows for a much better professor and student relationship which helps students feel more secure in their studies. This University also has a small town vibe which i feel is really good for coping with college life.
Alum,4,"Dominican University is an incredible institution that allows for each student to have a uniquely intimate and personal academic experience. With a total of 3,900 students, the student-teacher ratio is superb and truly promotes students being able to build personable relationships with their professors. Located in the beautiful community of River Forest, Dominican's campus is picturesque and reminds you of an East cost Ivy. My only complaint is the cost; with tuition fees at $31, 720/yr (not including Room & Board), one can definitely expect to get their money's worth!"
College Junior,4,The school makes a great effort in helping students gain a possible career in their field of study. There is a department dedicated to recruiting and helping students get internships or jobs before and even after they graduate.
College Junior,4,The school really cares about the students safety and will make a valiant effort in making sure all the students and faculty feel safe on and around campus
College Junior,4,The overall experience at this university is just amazing. The professors are always there to talk to and show there students that they want the best for them and want them to succeed. They will take the time out of their day just to help the students in need and I have had professors in the past that will approach me and ask me if I need any help from them. There is a great level of communication between students and professors.
College Junior,4,The athletics is great. The teams and events bring all of the students together.
College Senior,4,"I enjoy living independently.  The rooms are a little quaint, but I do not mind sharing a space or having a 1 person space. I enjoy the process of having to be responsible for my own cleanliness of my space and not having my Parents around to remind me of cleanliness habits and being successful at it in the end.  I can fit all of the things I need into my space and the dorm floors are fairly quiet and condusive to studying in my room."
College Senior,4,"I enjoy attending some of the athletic games at my school. I do not participate in many athletic activities due to medical reasons, but Athletics are not the main focus at Dominican University, academics are and I find that helpful for me.  I get to utilize all of the helpful assets that are out there to boost academic success during the student's college tenor."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my overall experience has been great at Dominican University. The professors are really helpful when you need help in the class, and they care about your success. If you miss class for a certain period of time, they'll email you asking if you're okay."
College Sophomore,4,Long story short: I am an incoming Sophomore and I already have an internship lined up for this fall as well as being a part of a college delegate program.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms at Dominican are in good conditions. Room sizes vary by building but overall they are very clean and have enough closet space. The only issue is the lack of air conditioners. Even though Chicago is overall a very chilly city, our summers and late springs can be very humid and this causes discomfort among resident students."
College Sophomore,4,"My first year at Dominican was nothing like I expected it to be. I went in with a heavy heart and expecting a hard transition. In fact, Dominican made it easy for me to go from a high school setting to a university setting. The small school environment felt more like a community. The student to teacher ratio was very beneficial because it was easier to build relationships with professors and get extra help when there weren't more than 30 students in a class. Professors at Dominican are very motivated to teach . I, personally, am not the biggest fan of math, but after taking one course at Dominican, my professors enthusiastic mood was passed on to me. Professors also make time for students. A few of my professors would schedule individual meetings with their students when we had papers due. This helped keep me on track of my work but also helped me make sure I was going in the right direction. 

Overall, Dominican University surpassed my expectations. The faculty and student body is very welcoming and motivational. Despite the fact that it is a private, catholic institution, Dominican welcome and always includes all students regardless of their race, economic background, sexual orientation, preferred gender, and religious beliefs."
College Senior,4,"It seems great, I received an email a month ago about an incident and security was all over it. They made themselves available to accompany anyone who needed it around campus."
College Senior,4,"Dominican always has job postings, I am always getting emails about job opportunities in my field. I have also received emails about job fairs as well from them."
College Senior,4,"This school has a lot of online course options. I love my professors, they are willing to help you and just want you to succeed. I am learning a lot and having a good time."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone has a career goal and works very hard to achieve it.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe at Dominican.
College Sophomore,4,The fields are amazing and beautiful. The gym is open to everyone and the machines are new.
College Junior,4,"The professors I had the opportunity to work with at Dominican University were awesome. I'll admit some were bad and I felt like we had a sort of tension between us, but the ones that work within my field of study are great. They help a lot and are there for you whenever you need them."
College Sophomore,4,I love the professors and I love the videos and the amount of resources they put for students to work at home or on their time of leisure.
College Sophomore,4,I have seen a lot of diversity and faculty and students seem very accepting and accommodating towards others.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are great. I love that they have videos of the classes online which is a plus.
College Sophomore,4,Small classes in which the teacher knows who you are and genuinely care about your well being. Small classes mean its easier to talk to people too.
College Sophomore,4,"Nice gym, but small, very small."
College Sophomore,4,I love using the gym facilities as well as the basketball court to get a workout in.
College Sophomore,2,"Security is pretty bad on campus, they care about the wrong things. They would rather write someone up for alcohol use than care about someone who's been sexually assaulted."
College Freshman,2,Honestly I don't eat on campus that often. Last semester I had over 100 meals left and they all went to waste. The food here just is not good. I wish that we had more variety of food.
College Freshman,2,"Maybe 2 or 3 impressive parties a year, when there are parties they're pretty good the just are a rare sighting."
College Freshman,2,"Cyber gets busy at times and get old very quickly. The Dining Hall has it's days but it is very hit or miss. Some meals will be decent, other days you'll be left thinking well I just wasted a swipe from my meal plan."
College Freshman,2,Multiple underperforming varsity teams and a student body that doesn't seem too interested in athletics makes varsity sports somewhat of a disappointment.
College Freshman,2,"Many different ethnicities on campus but that is where the diversity pretty much ends. Very liberal campus from the students to the professors, there is a liberal view all around with a few exceptions."
College Freshman,2,"The policy for checking in guys is completely ridiculous, it takes a while and you have to check out your guests if you want to go to any of the two places to eat on campus. If it is after 9pm and you wish to leave the dorms you have to check out your guests in order to get your ID back to get into the dorms then check them back in later. Overall it is a hassle to have guests, especially for short periods of time. The RA are generally pretty strict with noise and drinking as well, there are a few who are slightly more lenient but not many."
College Junior,2,I don't get food on campus. I either buy from the surrounding restaurants or bring lunch from home.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of students pay attention to what the athletes are doing and there's not a lot of school spirit. The intramurals are slightly more popular but they aren't by far the most important thing on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Recent Chicago weather limits the amount of activities students engage in around campus. The winter has been brutal, accounting for an abundance of snow and chilling temperatures. Therefore, students tend to stay indoors."
College Sophomore,2,"Under mulitple circumstances, my ability to recieve financial aid has been an absolute utter headache. I have received aid, but the experience to do so has been stressful. Exercise all your options and talk to anyone who can be of assistance towards receiving financial aid."
College Freshman,2,There are many students who are commuters and some of us take 2 or busses. We don't receive the u-pass but I really do hope in the future we do because it is sometimes a financial hardship for all of us.
College Freshman,2,There are mainly fast food chain restaurants. There is little diversity.
College Freshman,2,The shuttle buses are not very current. The only other campus we have is within walking distance. We are deep in the neighborhood so students without cars may have to walk about a mile to get to the nearest public transportation.
College Student,2,Many students have accessibility to drugs and alcohol.
College Student,2,Not many offers or availability
College Junior,2,There's no variety at all.
College Junior,2,It can definitely be better. Not too many people go out or have parties.
College Freshman,2,"It only asked me what the guys are like, and seeing as I like females, I chose N/A. However, the girls here are an overall C at best."
College Freshman,2,"The college is 60% commuters, so it's not very fun."
College Freshman,2,"As I am a first semester, out of town student, I am staying on campus.  I did see ads in the student hangout areas offering off campus housing.  Because Dominican University is in a small town, housing in this town as well some of the other towns are close by the school."
College Freshman,2,"Dominican University is a beautiful, old architecture school.  There are many nooks and crannies that are conducive to studying.  Also, the green spaces of the school are even conducive to this end.  However, the sports facilities do leave a little to be desired."
College Freshman,2,"Dominican University is a private, Catholic university. It has a very high Mexican population.  It also has a small population of African American students.  However, being that I am a minority, I haven't had negative feelings toward me.  Also, even though I am not Catholic, but Baptist, that is not looked down upon either.  While their are more activities offered to the Catholics, it is not overbearing to students of other faiths."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are average for this kind of school.  The main thing I would change would be the spaciousness of some of the dorms.  Air conditioning would be nice, but since we're in Chicago, we have much more cold than warm, so it's manageable."
College Freshman,2,"I like the fact that Dominican University is an academic and leadership school.  That pulls me up and keeps me focused.  However, I would also like to have a little more of the athletic atmosphere that other schools have.  That would complete my experience."
College Freshman,2,"Dominican University is in River Forest, Illinois which is a very nice upper middle class neighborhood.  It is right down the street from another university that is its rival.  It is also 9 miles from downtown Chicago, so while it is in a suburban area complete with shops, restaurants and parks, it is near one of the best downtowns in the country."
College Sophomore,2,"Chartwells in the dining hall is usually really hit or miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so good. If the dining hall doesn't have anything good, you can always go to Cyber for decent food."
College Junior,2,As an incoming freshman they fill up your financial aid package and you think wow I'm good to go. But as the years pass not only does your aid decline but the federal money declines and the cost of tuition and housing go up. They say they pride themselves on their affordability but they don't actually help students that are in need of more aid they simply tell them to take out more loans.
College Junior,2,"Campus security has changed a lot over the past year where there was al,oat a complete overhaul of the staff. Security patrol and are friendly for the most part however they are slow to respond to noise complaints and have been known to turn the other way when students were smoking illegal substances on campus. They try hard to be friends with the students and a lot of times it just backfires."
College Junior,2,There are only two real options for upperclassmen and they are drastically different. One is old with no air conditioning and extremely small rooms and the other is new with rather large rooms and closets and semi private bathrooms and air condition. The major downside in addition to the price difference is that there are no single rooms in the new building ie if you want your own space you have no option but to have a small room and die of heat for the first few and last months of the school year. The freshman dorms used to be absolutely horrid but they are remodeling this year and they seem to be pretty nice but again have no ac and are all doubles.
College Junior,2,I came to Dominican under a false pretense. I was told I would finish a BA/MA duel program in 5 years for psychology but the admissions consular left out the part where you had to be an OT major. The professors for the most part are available to help and are friendly but the curriculum it's self is not that challenging. In addition being a school school they don't have as wide a breath of classes available for students in any major especially less for music majors.
College Freshman,2,"The food is okay until you start getting cooked meals. They aren't the best. Some of the warmer food is served stale and the maintinace of keeping food fresh is pretty bad, but vending machines are ful of good food that is replaced regularly."
College Student,2,"The campus is small, the athletics are not that good except for soccer, and  the buildings are gorgeously designed and constructed.  The school really tries to get students involved and together, but there just are not enough people to even make the events fun or appealing."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I find the seasons of Chicago to be very brutal. From freezing winters to blazing summers, its very diverse."
College Sophomore,2,The food of Dominican is sub par. I found better meals and variety in my high school cafeteria.
College Junior,2,"If you're looking for a party school, Dominican is not your place. We live on a really small campus with no greek life in the middle of a suburb. There are a couple of bars in downtown Oak Park, but they're 21+. If you're feeling adventurous, however, we're very close to the green line so you can get into downtown Chicago with ease and then the possibilities are endless."
College Senior,2,"Chartwell's always has many options but some of the food is often nasty. There aren't many places to eat on campus, which is unfortunate. There is the regular dining hall and the ""cyber cafe"" but meal exchange times are limited. Exchange time usually ends around 9pm, sometimes 10pm, so if students are up late studying or doing anything else, there is no on campus location to dine at."
College Sophomore,2,We are not a big school therefore our athletics department is not the best. I have faith we will get there in the big leagues.
College Freshman,2,"I don't feel thath Dominican University is really diverse. Being multi cultural, I have found it a big challenging to ""fit in"" to a crown because it seems like people seperate each other by ethnicity. It is a primarily caucasian dominited school and has a high Latino population."
College Sophomore,2,"Chicago Housing Is Expensive! I'm not too informed on housing around the area, but from what I have heard it is very expensive and limited. Since the area is so close to Chicago, it is hard to find cheap housing. Dominican does offer housing and some say its terrible and some say they would much rather live on campus."
Freshman,1,"Dominican is a affordable school for the value. If you are a men's basketball athlete considering Dominican, go the other way. The Men's Basketball Program is terrible and they haven't had a winning record in several years. The majority of the players smoke weed. The school's gym hours is 9-2 during the day and you don't have access to get in the gym and workout on weekends. It is seriously a joke so if you are considering and don't want a bad experience, choose another school and don't waste your time. Go and look at previous seasons and see for yourself. Coach White has been there 21 years and it is time for him to go."
Niche User,1,"I attended Dominican University for 1 year and I never returned after that. Dominican was not a diverse or accepting campus and I was treated poorly by students and faculty. There was zero sense of community and I never felt welcome or at home. It is very difficult to make any friends and I have heard this from other students as well. Faculty is very biased towards towards certain students and very unprofessional. After having a nightmare year at this school, I had to take a year off to recover because of the horrible way I was treated.  Dominican has a lot of improvements to make because I know attend a school in similar size, in Chicagoland, and the atmosphere and everything about it is not even comparable. Dominican has potentional, but is too set in its ways to make any improvements."
College Junior,1,"The athletics department at Dominican University is terrible. When I say this I don't mean the athletes themselves, but the actual athletic department. They are so bias when it comes to decisions making and they favor the athletes way too much. They are the reason why us average students that just go to school for school can't do anything at all. The gym hours are terrible and even if we try to go the athletic departments use the hours up for practice or something. They also won't allow us to do charity events that involve fitness which is stupid if you ask me."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life at our school. If people want to be part of a fraternity or sorority they have to try to apply outside of the school.
College Freshman,1,"A few sports team own houses which students live at, but unless you want to spend a lot for an apartment or live with your family, living on campus is your only option."
College Junior,1,There are usually no parties going on at Dominican.
College Sophomore,1,My school is not affiliated with Greek fraternities or sororities.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid staff are not helpful at all! Be prepared and ready with your own aid.
College Student,1,None what is so ever
College Freshman,1,I wish I could go back in time and choose a different school to attend.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life at Dominican University, unfortunately."
College Freshman,1,"Student life on campus is almost non existent due to the fact that it's mostly commuters, so the campus clears out after 3PM."
College Freshman,1,"It's Chicago weather. Three months of summer/construction season, and then nine months of winter."
College Freshman,1,Literally nothing ever happens at Dominican University.
College Freshman,1,They're strict about everything. There's a whole process you have to go through just to have your mom or dad come up to your room and bring you some groceries.
College Freshman,1,"In order to improve school spirit and team performance, another gym could be put in.  That way all the teams wouldn't have to work around each other.  It would also show the teams that they are important which would increase team morale and, hopefully, team performance which would lead to increased team spirit."
College Student,1,"There is not much to do.  There are not many unique food choices like I thought there would be near Chicago.  I hate driving far just to get food, but that is more or less the case so far.  There are movie theatres, a mall (30 mins away), and no one really cares about the Dominican students."
College Junior,1,"Dominican used to be an all-girl school. This changed several years ago, but we're still about 70% female. The guys that do go here are generally gay, jerks, or already in committed relationships. That's not to say they're all bad, I have met some of my best male friends here, but as far as they dating scene goes you might want to start farming out to other schools."
College Senior,1,"The school is very strict about policies and not often very lenient. A friend of mine got physically attacked by another student and held her off without pressing charges, but still was given anger management courses. It's nearly impossible to drink on campus, which is unfortunate because students drinking off campus is a safety risk. If a person is caught drinking or breaking any minor rule near the dorms or security officers, they are usually ""written up"" which can result in many different consequences. Another bad thing is that the punishments sometimes vary based on the person that broke the rules which causes tension between different groups of students."
College Junior,1,Its really hard to get around here. And there is pretty much not alot of bars or clubs. YOu have to travel by car everywhere!

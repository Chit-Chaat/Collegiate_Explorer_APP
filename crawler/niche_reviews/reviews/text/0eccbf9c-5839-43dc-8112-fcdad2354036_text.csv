Freshman,5,"Honestly, I've never heard of Paul Quinn College until I visited during my Senior Week in high school. What I like most is that the President, Michael Sorrell, spoke to the student body of my high school. He asked each of us what did we want to major in and told us the majors Paul Quinn had to offer. From that day forward, I knew I belonged at Paul Quinn because there's not a chance that I would actually get a chance to meet a President of another college. Not only that, but he was very intellectual and I now look at him as a father figure. Besides updating  the dormitory, that would be the only thing that needs to change."
Senior,5,I chose Paul Quinn College after the college president Dr. Sorrel spoke to me with such conviction  and faith that I was going to be great and do good thing at the quinnite nation. with his love and the help of his staff i made my decision to become apart of the nation and i Dont have any bad feeling about my decision coming to PQC.

Freshman,4,So far this school is one of a kind. I love it and I’m looking forward to staying here another 3 years.
Freshman,4,At the Quinnite Nation it's a great place to be at you can have so much fun being here with many different people that you have never meet or you barely see then at all.

Niche User,4,When my school went to visit Paul Quinn I didn't think I would like it at first but when I sat down and actually listened and looked around I felt that it was a good match. The school is very clean and the student life seems good. The school wants to help all students with money issues as much as possible which I admire. When we were touring the school I noticed that the population is mostly African Americans which I like because most schools lack African Americans in the population. I feel as if this school would be a good choice for me because of the student to teacher ratio. I work better when the room isn't so packed and you can have one on one time with the professor.
Sophomore,4,"Very good institution if you are looking for a smaller more family like scene. Everyone knows everyone for the most part and there may be ups and downs to that trait, but I like it. Everyone is treated equally and fair. The teachers are great and the classes are fairly easy. Not only do we take classes, but as a urban work college we are required to work 10 hours a week. This teaches us how life will be in the real world. I would recommend this school to many people."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Paul Quinn college has been a very good one. On the fact that the college is quite small and you get one on one time with your professors. And everybody seems to know everybody at this school. The school also has an unlimited range of resources that are available to both faculty, staff, and students. Such as libraries, computer labs, etc."
Sophomore,4,College is small but it is in the process of growing. I am enjoying my experience at school. Nothing can be perfect but college is working hard to improve their campus and student life. It takes time and patience. I am glad to part of HBCU school because I am looking to live from a different perspective.

Meaning some of the money we work for goes towards our tuition and the rest in our pockets. Paul Quinn College wants the best for everyone to make sure you have a successful future."
Junior,4,Paul Quinn is very welcoming and tiny. Great for Business majors. Really prepares you for real work.
Freshman,4,"Currently I attend Paul Quinn College and so far l like it. Its only my second semester of mt freshman year but its great. One thing that i admire is that the professors ,their very hands on with their students . They were very helpful and understanding. The College is very helpful and teaches their students to be very responsibility  adults. The College also enforces a dress code we have to dress in business wear. Which I think is a good rule. One thing i think should the College should change is the work study programs. The reason of that because I think it should be optional."
Freshman,4,My experience at Paul Quinn College has been wonderful. Paul Quinn College is very family oriented and makes you feel apart of something without getting lost in the crowd.

Junior,4,"My experience while attending Paul Quinn College was great. I love the teacher to student ratio. Why? Is because we knew our Professors and we the student were not just a number. The atmosphere at Paul Quinn was more of a family atmosphere. What I mean by that, is our ethos ""We/Me"", and that is saying that we can reach out to each other about any and everything."
Sophomore,4,"Paul Quinn is an outstanding school a college located in South Dallas, but outstanding in academics and student life. Being a private school the student to teacher ratio is perfect small classes and the teacher knows every student. Sports just started in this college so they are not that great as other colleges, but they will soon get their. The experience is wonderful and I encourage high school student or students that are looking to transfer to always take a look at this small private institution."
Freshman,4,It is a great school to start new things and become a leader and lead greatly. It definitely prepares you for the real world after college.
Freshman,4,I like Paul Quinn because it is a Christian base school. I do think that they need some improvement with communicating a little better with non-traditional students like myself. I cant speak for students who are on campus but because I am not on campus and I don't have access to just walk to the financial aid departments or the registrar made it a little difficult. The trouble that I had was with them answering phones calls and returning messages and emails. I had to call several times to get one question answered. Overall I think it is a good school but I really wish they could improve on their phone system.
Freshman,4,"My experience here at Paul Quinn has been a great experience. I learned a ton while in both the class room and while exploring the campus and the city around the institution. Paul Quinn Provided support for me as I transition into the colleague level of school. they have a great tutoring program that assist many of the kids who take hard courses. The institution Is also allowing me to start my own Car washing services  on campus. This help me personality in two ways. I will acquire the knowledge it takes to lead a business. secondly, this help me pay for the remaining tuition. with this skill I we be more responsible when it comes to the real world. Even though Paul Quinn is a small school the professor and the staff of the school ask the students to think big."

College Freshman,4,The Greeks try their best to turn up !!
College Freshman,4,Everything went smooth and great.
College Freshman,4,"It is very good, everyone is on top of their stuff."
College Sophomore,4,"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a multicultural sorority. In Spring 2015 semester the first multicultural sorority was founded on campus. I think ALL greeks are easy to get along with and not only like to party, but help out their community."
College Sophomore,4,"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a girls soccer team. Now that we have both, there is a lot more people that are interested in the school. Both teams play great and I can't wait to see them play this Fall!"
College Freshman,4,There is always someone a person can go to on campus if they ever felt threatened or harmed in anyway.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life on campus is what brings the campus to life. Greeks try an involve the whole school in their activities and community service. They try and do a lot of social events to get everyone together. Non-Greeks lookup to Greeks to bring more fun into the school.
College Freshman,4,it hard but pushed you to do better
College Freshman,4,it seem good I am not in the Greek life
College Sophomore,4,The only thing we have to worry about is the coyotes.

College Sophomore,4,great the teachers at Paul Quinn College help us ever step of the way
College Freshman,4,I am very satisfied with the chose I made with choosing Paul Quinn College to attend for the next four years of my life. I have one on one's with my professor's because we have a small size of students per classrooms. Which benefits me as the students by engaging better in the discussion everyday.
College Sophomore,4,This school is really good.
Freshman,2,"It’s a good school and all but like everything els it has its faults. The administration can be unorganized a lot and few different fields to study. Not to mention we have no football team and turned our football Field into a farm. And the dorms are very old and in my room part of the floor is coming up the
Windows are old and cold air and bugs get in. Furthermore, hot water goes out from time to time and the laundry room can be a catastrophe, clothes left all on top of washers and dryers, dryers not working or getting way to hot and messing up clothes."
Sophomore,2,"Paul Quinn is a relatively small college. They have great opportunities for some students. They work-study college is a great incentive. The current working hard on making it a great place but more time and money is needed. A bright future is under construction though. I would recommend PQC if you need a friendly place, strong and easy connection and care for everyone."
Sophomore,2,I like the people at Paul Quinn College. The atmosphere here is something that I have never witnessed in my life. Everyone here makes me feel like I'm at home.
Sophomore,2,I like that Paul Quinn is closed to home for me and my son and also my jobs it also a HBUC and I always wanted to attended a HBUC. I also love how the teacher are involved with the student and there studies and trying to make it in life.
College Sophomore,2,There's no longer a football team at Paul Quinn college.
College Freshman,2,I am on the basketball team and the school does not care for us !!!
College Freshman,2,I play a college sport and we get absolutely no support in my opinion.
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus isn't the best. The building is very old so a lot of things tend to stop working sometimes for example: heat/air conditioner, water and the windows don't work. The social life on campus is horrible. There isn't a social/game room or anything on campus for us to do at all. If the student body ever wants to do something they have to go off campus."
College Freshman,2,Barely any sports and everyone sucks.
College Freshman,2,Paul Quinn has very little academic degree programs and also very little school spirit.
College Freshman,2,it could be better and a little more organized
College Freshman,2,Everything closes early and is so far away from our campus.
College Freshman,2,The is good sometimes but majority of the time it is nasty. On weekends they feed us breakfast all day and just throw things together.
College Freshman,2,i don't like it . the off-campus housing is terrible
College Freshman,2,the housing off campus is very bad because there's only bad environments out of three housing facilities. and Paul Quinn doesn't help out with housing because they always need more students to help with the work study program.
College Freshman,2,"there isn't many options on off campus dining. but I feel with all the places that's very far from campus, there's many more restaurants. but near campus, you cant even walk to one nor find more the two restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"I go to Paul Quinn College and the housing here is terrible. Paul Quinn college has roaches, holes in the walls, its either to hot or to cold, and not much cleanliness, etc. the social atmosphere is very low also because students here like to stay in there dorms and there's nothing around the campus for student to go to for enjoyment or comfort. Most of the time students don't get off campus do to the lack of businesses around campus so even if students wanted to work off campus, they couldn't do to distance. Paul Quinn does have a mandatory work study program for student to be employed on campus but the treatment is horrible."
College Senior,2,"there is very limited options around us, its only fast food. the cost is okay but its not very healthy. you have to drive real far to get better food and most students don't have a car so that's not possible."
College Senior,2,things was all wrong and just got somethings corrected
College Senior,2,in my opinion it okay
College Senior,2,different events could be giving ....
College Freshman,2,I don't really watch or like any other sport on campus besides soccer and I think they did a good job although they had few players.
College Freshman,2,"I went to one ""party"" and it was lame. The good parties are probably far away."
College Freshman,2,"I would like to live off campus, but it is too expensive."
College Junior,2,We live in a food desert in south Dallas Texas
College Freshman,2,"There's not really any good sports here on campus. The soccer programs lacks funds and rarely wins. Basketball has good equipment, but most of the team is out of shape or are not committed."
College Sophomore,2,Receiving financial aid is horrible at this school. I did receive a basketball scholarship which helped a little but the process is still a hassle. You will have to take out loans to attend.
College Senior,2,"The local atmosphere in the city of Paul Quinn College is located in is an very bad place. There are no close by grocery stores,everything is all far out to where you have to depend on the bus, and the neighborhood itself is bad to where students are getting robbed."
College Senior,2,The financial aid process at Paul Quinn College is complicated to get completed but its worth it in the end.
College Senior,2,The schools policies highly affect students. They are pretty strict with somethings and they dont handle some situations well.
College Sophomore,2,Only if you have a car or freind with one will you be able to use the city to its full advantage.
College Freshman,2,The School really needs to upgrade on the Athletics at the school because its poor right now. The teams are all unorganized and can barely win games.
College Freshman,2,"Currently our campus housing is in the process of reconstructing is dorms.  Yes this college has been through a great amount of damage, but it is improving daily."
College Freshman,2,"I don't like the inconsistent weather in Dallas. One day it could be cold, another it's hot. But the good thing is that every building is within about 5 min. from each other so we don't have to face the elements as bad as some colleges."
College Freshman,2,You are lucky if you are able to get the wifi working and in most spots in the dormitory the wifi doesn't even work.
College Junior,2,The dorms are old. The bathrooms are old. The beds are old. The mattress are old.
College Junior,2,not to good at all
College Junior,2,the dorms are pretty old so there are a lot of issues with them.
College Junior,2,The safety of the community that the school is in is not that good especially when you are trying to find housing.
College Junior,2,Where my school is located there are not really a lot of healthy options close by.
Niche User,1,"Stay away from this school. Specially if they convinced you for sports, do not waste your eligibility years here. my first and last season playing for this school we ""apparently"" were playing in our conference but it was really just scrimmages, but majority of us didn't know that, so the games that we did win didn't even count LOL. . I graduated about a year ago and i clearly stated in my graduation application that i wanted my diploma mailed to me, & we were even told that if we didn't let them know how we wanted our diploma they were gonna mail it regardless. I emailed them months after letting them know i haven't received anything, still nothing. About to go on a year and i still don't have my ""diploma"". The staff here is so rude!!! Specially the business office, they really don't know how to talk to people and expect to be respected when they're the complete opposite.Lastly, check if they're accredited , because if you decide to transfer 2 years in, your credits will not transfer"
College Freshman,1,It's not fun because the students can be stuck up .
College Freshman,1,We have fat slow security. If someone was to hope over the small fence around the school . We are crewed.
College Freshman,1,My school rarely have parties and when they do attempt to it doesn't turn out the way that it should.
College Sophomore,1,Its not strict at all
College Freshman,1,So far I'm in my forth month of attending Paul Quinn college and I have yet not received my Financial aid. it is an ongoing Process and most of the student really haven't received their Financial aid.
College Junior,1,We are located in a food desert but PQC is changing the environment.
College Senior,1,"the building is very old and needs a lot of work, but the funding at the school doesn't make it possible for the administrative to make any changes."
College Senior,1,"the financial aid office on campus needs a lot of help, there is very little help and assistance when you're in need of help."
College Senior,1,"we lack athletic trainers for or athletes, we have very little resources for athletes to get the best available training to compete with the top teams in the area, and this is all because of lack of funds"
College Freshman,1,Living in poverty gun violence and no grocery stores.
College Freshman,1,Living in molds horrible conditions
College Freshman,1,We are in a food desert and poverty.
College Freshman,1,"Not enough people to have a good party. I've tried to throw a party, but no one wanted to come out and enjoy the free drinks and food. Bummer..."
College Senior,1,"The food options at Paul Quinn College is the worst food I have had since I been there in year 2010. The food has no taste, get served small potions, and eat almost the same foods everyday."
College Sophomore,1,"Dallas, Texas has bipolar weather and  a lot of people get sick and the weather also change your mood about if you want to walk to class or not. "

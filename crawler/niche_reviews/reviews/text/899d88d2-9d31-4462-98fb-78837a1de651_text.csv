Sophomore,5,"My experience with Mount Union has been amazing. As a current student, I love it here! The faculty and staff are very helpful, the academics are great, and student life is amazing. Living on campus and meeting new people with similar interests has made my experience more memorable. Athletics are huge in Mount Union culture. Athletes are very competitive and Mount Union athletic programs receive national recognition, especially the football program. Greek life is also something special at Mount Union. Mount Union has a special place in my heart and I will always recommend somebody makes a visit to the campus sometime!"
Sophomore,5,"Although this semester is my first semester at Mount Union, I am a transfer student so I know how other colleges can be. Mount Union has been nothing but helpful to me, between trying to apply for transfer admission two weeks before the spring semester and everything else that has come up along the way. Your teachers know you by name and I haven't met a single student or staff member who is unwilling to help."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Union is a wonderful school. If you are looking for a small school, Mount Union is perfect.  The campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"I attended The University of Mount Union for a week when I attended Girls State 2019. I stayed in the freshman dorms, and although they did not have air conditioning, I enjoyed my stay. The food was very good, and there was always a variety to choose from each day. I also thought the campus was kept very neat and clean. The classrooms were nice, and the class sizes are smaller which makes it nice for one on one time with the professors. I am playing soccer at Mount Union. The locker room is nice and kept clean. The field is very nice as well."
Freshman,5,I’m enjoying my Freshman year.at Mount Union.  Professors and staff are nice and helpful.  I’m a Varsity player in the Soccer team and everyone is very supportive.  I would like to see additional eating places on campus with late hours.  Air conditioning in Freshman dorms would be appealing to new students.
Freshman,5,"The University of Mount Union truly is an amazing place. It's faculty, students, food and mission to be eco freindly are all huge reasons why this institution is so great. There is a sense of inclusion as there really is no divide between student groups, you are just as likely to see a music or theatre students cheering  on their fellow Raiders at a football game as you are a hardcore sports fan and vise versa."
Freshman,5,I loved everything about the UMU admission process. The people were very helpful and friendly. They made sure to always get back to me with the information I needed and they built a personal relationship with me.
Sophomore,5,Fantastic place with friendly students and people.Everyone is like a really big family.The professors are  extremely help to anyone who asks whether you have their classes or not.There's Always a lot do on campus whether it is the weekday or weekend.

Junior,5,"Absolutely love it here. Definitely get involved on campus, that is what will make any college experience memorable."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love this college. It is the perfect size for me. The campus is beautiful and they try very hard to get young adults involved on campus and socializing with eachother
Freshman,5,The professors here truly care about your education. They make themselves very available for questions and help and make sure each student understands the material. The professors are a part of what makes the environment here exceptional. I’m so glad I chose Mount!
Sophomore,5,"The University of Mount Union has a beautiful campus, is very inclusive and diverse, and provides many opportunities for anyone to get involved with clubs and athletics. The professors are very caring of their students and are always there to help when needed. They genuinely care about what they are teaching which helps make learning easy and more enjoyable. I would recommend Mount Union to anyone because you receive a quality education and have a great time while you are there! Mount Union also provides many opportunities to get involved in your field and gain real life experience so you are more prepared when you graduate."
Senior,5,"Incredible university. I felt I received a unique, high-quality education with many opportunities to involve myself and prepare myself for the real world outside of classes."
Freshman,5,"The thing I like most about Mount Union is the campus itself. I wanted a campus that did not have a lot of through traffic and at Mount Union it is one campus and everyone you see on campus goes to Mount. I also enjoy the athletic atmosphere, most of my friends come from the track and cross country team. It is a truly enjoyable experience every day. One thing I would change at Mount is the cost of living, it is 10,000 dollars at the cheapest. While I was going to live off campus so it would be cheaper but you must live on campus for four semesters till you can live off campus. I find it a huge amount of money to stay there so you can get an education."
Niche User,5,"Mount union is a small private university with citizens from diverse cultures around the globe.Above all, it is an institution that make adequate opportunities for both citizens and international students very attractive and beneficial to make learning environment very easy and affordable.It also creates easy access to make enrollment and accomodation deposit very simple to pave way for entry visa possible.besides,graduate employment after  university studies is highly possible unlike other universities which does not provide such great opportunities."

Sophomore,5,I love this school! Everyone is so kind and will help you right away if you have any questions. The professors are so helpful and put their office hours on the outside of their doors letting you know when they're free. The school in general is so fun and active! Highly recommend.
Freshman,5,"The University is always giving you resources to succeed. Once you apply yourself, you are on the right track for a good career."
Freshman,5,"I love Mount Union because the atmosphere is very friendly. I think many people assume because Mount is an expensive college, the students will be stuck up snobs. This is completely untrue. I have found the complete opposite to be true really. I come from a low income household and paid for college completely through scholarships and grants. Never once have I felt lesser because of my socioeconomic status. Everyone I've interacted with have been exceptionally kind to one another. As funny as it is to say, the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the extreme lengths students go to to hold doors for others. The professors are always available and are able to relate well with students. Course material is difficult, but the atmosphere is full of resources and encouragement. I love being a Raider!"
Graduate Student,5,"Mount Union invests in their students, campus, and their sports teams greatly. University of Mount Union has exceeded my expectations as a graduate student in terms of providing many different ways for us to be involved on campus. The buildings are innovative and the professors work to provide the best education to make sure the students succeed!"
Niche User,5,I went on multiple tours of Mount Union and absolutely love the campus and the area around it. I was not a huge fan of the liberal teaching but their facilities are state of the art and is an amazing value for a small school.
Sophomore,5,"The students are very friendly and the professors are interested in the students' education. They assign a lot of homework which really helps students understand what they are taught in class. Overall, it is a really great place to be. As expensive as this university is, they do provide a good bit of financial aid."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school! Great professors! Good vegetarian options! Though you can run into some issues, these are expected at any university. Overall love Mount and all the opportunities it has to offer."

Niche User,5,"Although I had to withdraw for medical reasoning, my experience at Mount Union was exceptional with the help I received from the professors, students, faculty, coaches, and everyone who belonged to the Mount Union community. A friendly, small campus environment that I fell in love with my first 10 minutes on campus"
Freshman,5,"When I was first looking at colleges, I was nervous. Everything was going to change. Mount Union made that transition easy. When I first walked on campus, I knew it was the school for me. It is the perfect size and the people are kind. I have made friends I know I will have for a lifetime. The professors are relatable. I am able to meet professors to receive counsel. I am able to gain a personal relationship with the professors at Mount Union and I believe that is beneficial to my learning experience. There are many organizations for students so most are able to become engaged in campus life. The campus is lovely. There are shaded areas to enjoy and a lovely pond.  The classrooms are comfortable with new technology.  The gym has state of the art equipment too.  Thinking back to how I was nervous about college is silly to me now. I know that I made the best decision I have ever made in going to the Mount Union."
Freshman,5,"As soon as you step on campus there is people greeting you, we aren't a huge school so you're friends  with everyone, professors actually care about what they teach and they do a great job, not to mention we're good at all sports."
Freshman,5,"From the first day I came here, people were so friendly and willing to meet people. The coaches and teachers all love their job and love to help. Classes are not easy but there is so much help available that if you fail it is your fault and yours alone ."

College Freshman,5,This school is very well known for being a sports-oriented school.
College Senior,5,"Best D3 football team, nationally ranked track and field teams, championship cross country teams, Mount is known for the best D3 sports in Ohio. School spirit is high 24/7."
College Junior,5,The school spirit at my university is astounding! The athletics are phenomenal (especially our football team) as well as the facilities. Students support every team whether male or female and attend every game that they can!
College Junior,5,"My overall experience at school has been incredible so far! The academics at my university are challenging and demanding, but the professors care about your learning in the classroom. Due to the small class sizes, professors are always available before or after class as well as during office hours and via email if you have any questions or concerns. They get to know each student individually, which in turn builds a strong student/professor relationship. Aside from the professors, everyone you meet on campus is extremely friendly and welcoming. My university also contains many clubs, activities, and organizations that students can join in order to give each student an opportunity to meet new people and hold leadership positions."
College Freshman,5,Greek life is pretty popular
College Freshman,5,I know they have a great football team
College Freshman,5,I have had a wonderful experience with Mount!

Recent Alumnus,5,I am not involved but I feel that Greek Life has a positive impact on our school and community.
Recent Alumnus,5,I am really glad I chose the University of Mount Union.
College Sophomore,5,"The students here on campus are safe, and aware of the policies in place to protect them. There is very little crime on campus, and we have large safety measures in place."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone here at Mount Union cares about everyone else. My education here at Mount Union is second to none. My academics are the number one priority. Students are put first by everyone. There are tons of classes offered, class sizes are small, and professors are energetic to teach. Classes are designed based on the subject, and are arranged for students to have the best experiences."
College Sophomore,5,"Here at Mount Union our job placement rate is at 99% based on 2014 graduation stats. That statistic is within 35 days of graduation, that 99% is either working at a job in their field or accepted into grad school. We have tons of job and internships available. The alumni are amazing, and employers love hiring Mount Union students."

We have a variety of types of residence halls, one sex, or co-ed. We have all sorts of cost options, all housing options are convenient, and the housing process is easy."
College Sophomore,5,"The University of Mount Union has been a wonderful experience for me. I have really grown as an individual since I came to Mount Union. I am involved in multiple organizations, many of which are unique to Mount Union. Some of those include a mentoring organization, where I am the mentor to a young girl who is in the local middle school, who needs a positive influence in her life. I also am in a service organization specifically for sophomores. I am a Community Educator here at Mount Union, which is the equivalent of a resident adviser. I love being able to really get to know the residents under my advising. Mount Union is quite small and we are a tight community. Everyone here knows and supports everyone else here. Students are encouraged to be involved and try new things on campus. Here at Mount Union the local community is highly involved and connected to campus life. This is one of the things I love the most about Mount Union. Here at Mount Union my education and my experience are the best they could be, and unlike other colleges and universities."
College Freshman,5,Great D3 sports. National Football Champs for 12 years. The track team and basketball programs are extremely good as well.
College Freshman,5,Great atmosphere and friendly culture. A ton of sports and clubs as well.
College Freshman,5,"Mount Union has  99% of their graduates get a job in their intended field of study within 30 days. THAT IS A BID DEAL. Every field of study that has internships necessary UMU has opportunities lined up with great companies. Also, the office of Alumni at Mount does a great job with getting the students involved in their activities and keeping in touch with us."
College Freshman,5,"The athletic teams are just as exceptional as the educations. Everyone on campus rallies behind the athletes and cheers them to victory. Just last month our football team went to Salem, Virginia for the stagg bowl and so many people went you would have thought it was our hometown. What is so great about being at a school with great athletic teams is they really keep the school spirit alive. They all take great pride in keeping Mount Unions name at the top of division III list."
College Freshman,5,"Mount union is a place where strangers become family. From the moment I came on campus for my visit I felt like I mattered here. The faculty and staff do a great job of taking time to make personal connections with the students, which really sets it a part from many other universities."
College Freshman,5,Integrative core is one of the best in the nation for his reason. Professors are brilliant and caring. Study abroad is heavily emphasized
College Freshman,5,I couldn't be happier here. Professors are passionate and caring.
College Freshman,5,Everyone at this school is awesome. If you put yourself out there you will make life long friends in no time. The professors are very helpful and the sports teams are awesome.
College Freshman,5,"Wouldn't want to attend any other school. The classes are small, fun, productive and very interactive. The dorms are decent size and everyone is friends. Its like a big high school and I love it. Almost all the sports teams are very good including the football team who never loses. There is always a party to go and theres never not something fun going on, its very easy to be involved and just a great school to go to. Go Mount Go!"
Sophomore,4,Most professors go above and beyond to make sure their students are able to learn and are available to answer any questions they may have.
Freshman,4,The University of Mount Union has been great for me. They have a lot of resources and many degree pathways.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience came during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it was much harder to work without having that in-class connection with a professor, the instructors and faculty did their best to make the experience much smoother."
Freshman,4,The University of Mount Union is a beautiful small campus. Class sizes are small enough that the professors will know your name and want you to succeed. We have great sports teams and many different clubs to join. While there are not as many majors and minors as a large college or university I am sure you will find the one you enjoy.
Niche User,4,"Mount Union is a relatively overlooked school because it is not super well known. However, the school has great staff who are always willing to help and have a lot of great connections to help students get internships and be prepared for their future careers."
Freshman,4,I liked how they try to have different activities going on every month on campus. One thing they could work on is the cafeteria food
Sophomore,4,Very good professors and small class sizes. I love the decorated campus and that the grounds are well kept.
Senior,4,"The University of Mount Union has overall been a great experience for me. Whether it is academics or athletics, the school always has a championship mentality. I am very glad I chose to come to this great University."
Senior,4,The professors here are unbelievably dedicated to helping students not only in the classroom but in advancing to a career. The culture and students here are also outstanding. The only thing I wish to improve is the freshman dorm rooms.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Mount Union is a great school with a lot of opportunity for leadership, extracurricular activities, and personal growth with individualized attention from professors. It is a small school but the facilities are very good and the campus undergoes renovations often to keep the campus modern and inviting for future students."
Freshman,4,"The small campus and small student to teacher ratio is amazing. I always feel safe when walking on campus, even at night. The professors are easy to talk to and the staff is too. Students are generally always willing to help. However, cafeteria food on the weekend is not good and the hours for other places to eat on campus over the weekend are poor."
Alum,4,Professors know you and care about your learning. Could be better at advising for career and grad school application process.
Sophomore,4,My experience here has been a great one. I have had some rough times both personally and academically. Everyone is super friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand especially the professors. The class sizes are a small enough size where you really feel you matter as a student.
Niche User,4,"Everything is good enough for me except the diversity is literally 0 to none. The campus is beautiful, my tour guide was extremely sweet, outgoing and informative. The dorms seem a little bit small and stuffy though. My least favorite thing is definitely the diversity though."
Sophomore,4,"I like the diversity of the student population.  The professors and staff are very approachable when you have a problem or question.  Right now I can not think of
anything I would change."
Junior,4,The Faculty at Mount Union is second to none. They care about their subjects and their students and have passion for their work.
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE THIS SCHOOL! When I was in 5th grade my grandparents took me to visit the college. They met in alliance and kissed on the famous kissing bridge.  Ever since I fell in love with the history and the people of this school. I was so afraid that I wasnt going to be accepted. My grandmother passed before I graduated high school but the next day my acceptance letter came in the mail for Mount Union. I know she would be proud. This school has its problems but name a school that doesnt. Come to mount, be a raider, and join a family that is unforgettable."
Freshman,4,"I am happy with the University.  I wish it was more affordable my family is having a hard time with the expense.  I like the small campus, I feel very safe walking around campus, food is great, so far all of my professors have been very helpful and willing to work around my sport schedule when we travel. I would recommend the school"
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy campus life. People are cool. Some people are mean, but you get that everywhere. The professors are also super nice and really like to get to know you, and most want to see you suceed."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are nice and small. Professors have a variety of office hours you can go and see them for help.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a decent thing at this school. People won't judge you if you don't join, and vise versa."
College Freshman,4,this school has a very good track record for students finding good jobs after they graduate. I feel I will get a very good education at mount if my parents and I can afford it. I really want to stay here all 4 years but it is very expensive and I am not sure. we are just taking it 1 year at a time.
College Freshman,4,this is my first year at mount union but so far I like all of my professors
College Freshman,4,"its a small campus I am only there during the daytime hour so I don't know how much security is around at night, but I feel safe in the area"
College Freshman,4,I love my wrestling team!
College Freshman,4,so far I really enjoy going to mount union. Staff is great and everybody has been very heplful
College Freshman,4,Most people that come out of here get a job
College Freshman,4,They really hate in dangerment of women
College Senior,4,Campus security is available 24/7. Campus wide notifications are sent out if anything occurs that could affect students.
College Senior,4,"I have an internship related to my field currently, and have high expectations to further my education and obtain a job in my field."
College Freshman,4,Kind of tiny but that is any dorm
College Freshman,4,I am personally not knowledgeable on this topic due to me only being a freshman but I would say that they do a very good job from what I hear.
College Sophomore,4,We have a big international program and our campus is very diverse in all kinds of ways. Everyone is connected in someway we are all involved in different things but we form a family.
College Freshman,4,"The nursing curriculum is rather rigorous but, the professors that I've had have been very accommodating."
College Freshman,4,Greek life at Mount Union is not for everyone.  Those who choose to join seem to really enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,Varsity athletics at Mount Union are the best.  We have a championship football team.  The rest of the sports are at the top or close to the top of our conference.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience so far at Mount Union has been a mix of emotions.  I've had to work through an injury in cross country while taking multiple stressful classes.  I've had a chance to meet lots of wonderful people, professors and peers. And I've also joined many clubs; Nursing club, Psychology club, and Alpha Lambda Delta.  All of these things combined have given me a mix of emotions at Mount Union but, I wouldn't change it for anything."
Recent Alumnus,4,The University of Mount Union is known for its great team sports. Students really enjoy attending games and it is a big part of campus life.
College Sophomore,4,We have strong support for all sports and athletic activities on campus. We have extremely high school spirit as well. Our varsity sports are a main part of the campus community. Our athletic facilities are well maintained. We have plenty of facilities to accommodate the athletes and active students we have on campus. The only downside is that we don't always have the newest equipment.
College Freshman,4,"While I have been at Mount there has been no campus crime that I am aware of. I think our campus security does a great job of making sure all students, their belongings, and buildings are safe and secure. We have drills to practice evacuating buildings in the case of emergencies and our campus security goes through each room to ensure everyone is out, no man or woman is left behind here at Mount Union."
College Freshman,4,"Mount Union is the perfect school to come to if one is looking for small class sizes with personalized learning. The courses as this school, no matter what major, are challenging, but that is what makes UMU so exceptional, the professors push you to prepare you for future jobs. The classes for the most part are very interactive and keep people interested. Professors are passionate about their work, and try to get the students to be the same."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is a large additive in the price component, but I feel it is essential for the college experience. Living in the dorm has been a great experience for the most part. I had a girl on my floor pass away in her room, which was a very difficult experience, but it made my floor such better friends. Living on campus is also so convenient in the way that when you wake up you never have to drive anywhere you just walk a few hundred feet to class."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a big deal on campus. They are always putting events on to help raise money for great causes. I think some people who don't know the philanthropy aspect of greeks think it is all about the parties, but I am aware of the differences. The sorority houses are quiets small most only have 3-5 girls living in them, but the fraternity houses are quiet the opposite. Most of our fraternity houses keep anywhere from 15-30 guys in them, they look like mansions!"
College Freshman,4,Just about everyone lives on campus. Food is great--- if you are willing to try things outside of burgers and grilled cheese.
College Freshman,4,"Alumni, internships, connections, networks--- work hard because Mount has them all"
College Sophomore,4,Joining greek life helped me gain campus involvement and great friendships. Being at a small school helps with my learning abilities as well.
College Freshman,4,Love the atmosphere and the people. Everyone is very willing to help and support. Only thing I think I would add to this school is providing more opportunities for activities to do outside of school work.
College Sophomore,4,"I attend the University of Mount Union, which is in the town I was born and raised in. Many people disagreed with my decision to stay close to home for college, but I think it was one of the best decisions I've made. I love my school. The campus is beautiful and the classes are small, which I prefer. Even though I live in my college's hometown, I still experienced life in a dorm room my freshman year and it was an interesting experience and I'm glad I got the opportunity to know what it's like living on campus and getting out of the house. But I love being down the street from my home and being able to see my family all the time. The University of Mount Union has many unique activities and classes to offer which is why I love where I chose to spend four years of my life!"
College Freshman,4,Availability is pretty good and expectations for keeping them are clear. I don't think enough information is given on all of the available scholarships. You have to really look hard to find everything they offer.
College Junior,4,"There are some pretty nice, low-rent options for students that are in good neighborhoods close to campus."
College Junior,4,"Fraternity houses, off campus athletic houses, and townhouses often throw some pretty great parties. While Mount isn't a party school, there's definitely some fun to be had around town on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,"There are plenty of places to go eat, however very few of them offer or promote discounts."
College Freshman,4,The choices on food get very boring and unappealing after a few weeks on campus due to the lack of choices.
College Freshman,4,"I feel that housing could be improved however, the housing rules and variations are extremely fiar and extremely spacious. One improvement could be a better chance for special or upper level housing for students."
College Freshman,4,"Parties are always very low key. Not many students attend them, and they are not out of control like they are typically advertised as."
College Freshman,4,"We have great food options compared to most other colleges and universities. It's not always good, but there's always plenty of options to fit everybody's dietary needs."
College Freshman,4,Needs more attention to parking issues.
College Freshman,4,There's a very comfortable atmosphere on campus.
College Student,4,People of different attitudes hang together. There is always some sort of gathering on the weekends.
College Student,4,They are extremely helpful and will do anything to accommodate your needs. They are are very strongly opinionated on you success.
Senior,2,"Communication between departments is poor, as well as the communication between offices. Papers constantly get lost, students are constantly misinformed and forms get mixed up and and submitted incorrectly at a constant. A lot of the office workers are also rude or very dismissive when you go for help. Mount Union also covers up a lot of the problems on campus instead of addressing them, making students feel unsafe."
College Freshman,2,Class sizes are small and profs are great. There are somewhat of a variety of courses offered. They do do a great job helping freshman succeed their first year and a lot of people who care about you. The surrounding town sucks and crime rate is very high which intern means cops can be hard on college kids.
College Freshman,2,My full review could be summed up to if you are looking for a school to be only doing school while focusing on grades this is the place for you. If you are a social butterfly or like to spread your wings and get involved with a little of everything this is most certainly not the place for you. The school is great and highly accredited for school but I tend to feel that it is not a four year once in a lifetime opportunity that most kids want when going to school. It has a small campus as well as small student body which I'm fine with but it has no sense of unity. For example: for a national football school that wins all the time even the games are boring to go to and half the time people re talking and don't get hype for the games. So overall if your main goal is to just focus on school this is the place for you but if you want more stay away!
College Freshman,2,"The administration doesn't like confrontation. There is underage drinking that got out of hand multiple times and they were aware of it, but did nothing. During those times there were CE's drinking with freshman and they still have their jobs and weren't punished."
College Freshman,2,If you do not have very high GPA you will not get a good Financial Aid Award
College Freshman,2,There are very few off campus options however the freedom is worth it.
College Freshman,2,There are few to no parties most nights but some nights there are good parties to go to.
College Freshman,2,"Within the first two weeks of my first semester, people had already begun defecating on the floor. Our cleaning ladies deserve a medal of honor. When I visited Edinboro their dorms were basically prison cells, so I'll give Mount Union two dots because it does indeed get worse. I'm in the freshmen dorms, and the sophomore dorms are super nice. However they're not immune to nefarious activities."
Recent Alumnus,2,Mount Union is not really known for off-campus housing. Alliance is not the best neighborhood to live in. Most students just live in dorms and then the townhouses and apartments as upperclassmen.
Recent Alumnus,2,There was always a poor selection and everything was always doused in butter or oil. Eating healthy on campus was always hard. The dining halls had weird hours and made it very inconvenient if you had class during the day.
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria is awful. The food sucks and it's only open until 7pm. The B&B is awesome but not included in the meal plan, however the prices are pretty reasonable. The school is putting in a new cafe in the library over the summer so that will be nice for something to eat while studying..\"
College Sophomore,2,It's just Ohio weather-- one day it's 75 and sunny and the next it's a blizzard. The chances of classes being cancelled for weather are slim to none though.
College Sophomore,2,The school is definitely predominately white but everyone gets along with each other.
College Sophomore,2,There is absolutely nowhere to park by the library and there was always minimal parking outside Bica-Ross residence hall. I've received several parking tickets just because I had no other options.
College Sophomore,2,There is generally nothing to do around campus so it can be quite boring.
College Sophomore,2,It rains a lot so it is depressing to go outside.
College Freshman,2,There is absolutely nothing to do off campus unless you drive half an hour into Canton.
College Freshman,2,"The only places to really go out are to frat parties or house parties. There is no clubs/bars around, and no means of transportation to take you off campus."
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not like my current dorm, and would not like to live in it again."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not a huge fan of Alliance.
College Junior,2,It runs the campus too much
College Freshman,2,Winter is cold and snowy and the weather is constantly changing.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do in the city.  Actually I think the city is hideous but the campus is beautiful.  We have people in the city that we call 'townies' because they can be a little hectic to deal with at times.  There are a few places to entertain yourself with but I would rather stay on campus.  My favorite place to go outside of campus is the humanes society and walk the dogs around.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is just a big popularity contest. 
College Junior,2,Both sororities and fraternities are popular at Mount. You can join your freshman year or later if you want. The girls have lodges and are not permitted to live in them. The guys can live in houses and some of the houses are new and really nice. It isn't fair that the guys can live together but the girls can't.
College Senior,2,Chives is the only bar that everyone goes to and house parties always get busted. If you drink in your dorm you better be quiet otherwise you will get written up.
College Senior,2,There are some international students and a small amount of black students in comparison to the white students. I would say UMU is about 75% white
College Junior,2,"There is an average amount of students with different races and religions. There are more white people but there are high numbers of black and international students on campus. However, a majority of the international students come from Japan."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid is a difficult process, and getting student loans is even harder. For someone whos trying to better themselves you think it would be a little easier. Try reaching out to teachers, friends and family for help!"
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus Dinning – It's okay if you want fast food, but other than you have to drive to Canton to get a good meal. Sure there's Texas Road House, but that place is infested with townies all the time. It takes forever just to get a seat."
College Sophomore,2,"Learn to Parallel Park – Unless you want to be stuck in a remote parking lot in the middle of nowhere, the only real parking is on the streets. Of course, since the streets are public property, the Alliance Police are all over the place and ticket like crazy. Better learn to parallel park correctly."
College Sophomore,2,"Some Rude Employees – I have had trouble with the finanacial aid department on campus every semester since I have been here. There are always problems of some sort that the employees are slow to focus on or direct, and they are often really rude when I try to talk to them about the situtation."
College Senior,2,"They Are Always Together – I heard not once people complaining about someone doesn't hang out with him/her anymore, because the new Greek sisters/brothers."
College Senior,2,"It's Alliance – While it is not the worst town in the world for colleges, there is still not much to do here. The biggest hangout area is Wal-Mart, no joke. The parks in the city are nice, if you can find them. For the most part, though, the city is full of mini-malls. Even the mall itself is a mini-mall compared to most malls I have seen."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much – There is only one bus system, but we now have a taxi service."
College Junior,2,"I love Mount's atmosphere and overall campus look. I love how close all the classes are together and that there is only a handful of buildings where classes are held. I hate the food because there are no options, and I feel like Mount tries to suck every penny out of you."
College Junior,2,"Very Few Options on Campus. B&B Cafe is good. The cafe never has a variety, and I always have to eat fries because there is nothing else good to eat. We NEED more options."
College Senior,2,Very Strict – It's very strict and perhaps too harsh most times.
College Senior,2,"Good food, but lack of variety."
College Sophomore,2,"Ohio weather? Enough said! Only in Ohio will you be able to see all four seasons in one day! So yes, this can cause a damper on the campus experience, but nothing that umbrellas, tank tops, or snow boots can't fix!"
College Senior,2,"I am not overly satisfied with the parking situation at Mount Union because in the lots where we should park, every space is usually taken when I return from my ventures to Walmart and the local liquor store. Although a permit to park is easy to get (as it should be because the tuition is expensive), finding a place to park is nearly impossible unless you know where the ""Open Parking"" lot is. It seems that it is the only safe zone from getting a $20 parking ticket. Although a car is not entirely necessary on campus, it is good to have one so that parents don't have to work around their schedules to pick you up from school. There isn't much public transportation in the city of Alliance."
College Senior,2,"Where Do I Park? Finding a spot is not always easy. Sometimes walking gets you there faster. And if you try to sneak in a faculty spot the campus security will get you with a ticket. They only cost 10 bucks and sometimes you can fight it, because lets get real: We are in college, so 10 bucks is a fortune."
College Junior,2,Beware of Campus Security – Campus Security definitely will find you if you park in the wrong spot or park in McMaster circle too long. They are heartless creatures and would rather ticket people than do something worthwhile.
College Junior,2,"In terms of ethnic/racial diversity, Mount Union is very diverse. A lot of students choose to attend Mount Union as a foreign exchange student. There are also a lot of African American students at Mount Union, as well as white students."
College Senior,2,The restaurants in Alliance could be better. We could use more variety instead of the same fast food places and handful of restaurants. When we want variety we have to go to Canton.
College Sophomore,2,"Only about 30 percent or less of the study body is involved in Greek life. Occasionally the frats have parties. Both sororities and fraternities have date parties, which are fun to attend with a Greek if you're not Greek. There is no Greek housing for women but the men can live in their frat houses. It's not a big deal if you are or aren't Greek."
College Sophomore,2,"Snow in Ohio – The snow in the winter can be brutal to walk around on campus with, but other than that the fall and spring times are beautiful!"
College Sophomore,2,"I've walked into the library on several different occasions and was not able to find an open computer to work on. I think it's a little ridiculous I can't be guaranteed a computer when I go to the library to study, and that's not even during finals or exams. Forget finding an open work area in the library during exams time. As for printing, you are allotted so many pages, but it's definitely enough to get through the year. That is not a concern ever."
College Sophomore,2,The parking is okay. It can be very hard to find a spot to park close to where you want to be. And there are some problems with people vandalizing the cars that are parked on the streets.
College Senior,2,"Its Not Too Bad – I do not see too many drugs at our school, although I do see drinking. It is enforced pretty strictly. It's sometimes unfair though."
College Sophomore,2,"Because Mount Union is such a small school, you could easily survive without a car, but having one makes having a social life much easier. However, parking at Mount is pretty terrible. Oftentimes it is hard to find a spot in the middle of the day, and students are left to either park far away and walk (which defeats the purpose of driving), or to park where they are not supposed to and risk getting a ticket. The ticketing fees aren't too terrible, but after your third one in a year, your car receives a boot, which I personally think is a little extreme. However, everyone on campus is allowed to have a car,  including freshmen, which is something that many schools do not allow."
College Sophomore,2,"Strictness Policies – The policies on underage drinking in the dorms are especially enforced. First-time offenders and second-time offenders are sent to the ""judge"" and are given probation. Third-time offenders are at risk for being kicked out of the University. Also, underage drinking at frat parties is also very risky because at times adult faculty members will show up at the parties and confiscate alcohol from minors and bust them for drinking. The police are also known to bust parties on a pretty regular basis."
College Senior,2,"Choose School Again – I probably wouldn't choose my school again knowing all the information I know. The school costs too much. They don't lock the tuition for students, and so far it has increased every year."
College Junior,2,"There are always parties going on at the University of Mount Union. There are bars around the campus, but if you're underage, you can forget about going. Frats always have parties going on, as do people who live off campus. If you attend a party on campus, you can call Campus Security to pick you up and take you back to your dorm. There aren't any clubs around, unless you want to call Mango's a club. It is 21+ except for on one night."
College Junior,2,"You need to go somewhere? Find a ride yourself. Luckily, everything is fairly close to campus, except Walmart, which could mean trouble if you need to get something at 4 a.m. Since everything is within a 15-minute walking distance it's not too bad unless it's freezing or pouring rain, which frequently happens in Ohio."
College Junior,2,"They need to have more variety, not the same food every week or every other week. They need to not have fries with everything. They need to have the people from different cultures making the food because they try, but it's just not the same. The value of the food is good but not all the time. They make their own bread but it gets hard and people don't like hard bread. They like it soft and fresh. Fruit should always be fresh, not canned. We should be able to use our unlimited meals at the B&B. The food in there is way better and we are paying for it in our tuition, so why can't we eat there like we can in the cafeteria?"
College Senior,2,"What's for Dinner Today? Mount Union provides AVI Foodsystem services at three different locations on campus: the Kresge Dining Hall, the Campus Grounds, and the KHIC Coffee Bar. Freshmen and sophomores are required to have meal plans, but by your second semester you may start to get sick of the usual food in the cafeteria. My suggestion would be to get a 10- or 14-per-week meal plan to the cafeteria, which also comes with 50 or 100 dollars dining credit at Campus Grounds. Those dollars can be a lifesaver when the dining menu in the cafeteria doesn't sound good to you."
College Student,2,"That's all we care about. Or at least that's all they make it seem like they care about. I wish I participated in sports (Track/XC), but I didn't. Our new facilities are amazing though and I like them."
College Student,2,"We're often the D-III football champions or close to it. That's about it. We have a good solid academic program and social scene. I wouldn't go here again though. Now, after studying abroad and moving to a larger city, I'd much rather go to a larger school that could offer me much more professional and social growth. I liked Mount Union for my first year, but after that, I feel like I've outgrown it. Their policies are childish and excessive. They have an excellent administrative staff though, and I would love to keep that; however, overall, I just feel like I could have gotten more out of my college experience at a larger, more urban school."
College Student,2,"We're Like the Postal Service. Through hail/sleet/snow/rain we go to class. I've never heard of a day of classes being canceled due to inclement weather. I don't even remember a day starting late because of snow. Yet we have the worst snow next to where I used to live (western NY). While other universities around us are canceled for the day, we blaze forward and trudge to class in 3 feet of snow and 10 degree below zero (or more!). The snow removal of the sidewalks is okay if you live close to essential buildings. Otherwise they may clear it after you've had your first few classes. That means if you have a 7:45 or 8 a.m. class, you will have to brave the elements on your own."
Freshman,1,"Think twice about engineering here!  Check out the graduating class numbers, small, because nobody is passing the classes.   Started last year with over 75 engineering students, we are down to single digits! Cost is over $40,000 and you will get admitted, they are happy to take anyones money, but good chance you wont return.  The instructors are happy to weed you out.  Math classes are horrible, fail 90%.   Physics classes are worse.  If you want engineering consider another college that will help you succeed, not fail.  Trust me you dont want to make this hefty donation and come out with nothing but debt"
Sophomore,1,I am transferring due to the fact it is way to expensive and my intended major is ending because none of the upper class men students were not passing. Why pay that much to not pass due to lack of teaching materials. Not to mention the way I was treated trying to transfer and them doing their part to release my transcripts.
College Freshman,1,If you are thinking about frat life here at mount just know what you are signing up for. They have weak parties the first half of the year then the second half they don't do s***. If you want to sit in a sweat and big house with no girls and no parties this is the place for you.
College Freshman,1,"BK, Taco Bell, and Sheetz are your only options without a car. Good luck staying healthy."
College Sophomore,1,Driving through Alliance is painful.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining is horrible. Students have one option, the cafe and it's not even open 24hrs. The options are very limited. It's horrible."
College Sophomore,1,Pretty much need to have your own transportation. 
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is not too good.  They took out the road running through campus so you can only drive on the outside limits of campus and the parking lots are across a busy street and quite a far walk from everything.
College Freshman,1,Not much to do around the city but this also is a blessing in disguise seeing that it allows me to stay focus on the football field and in the classroom.
College Freshman,1,"Going to Mount Union was the biggest mistake of my life! It is such a small school that it feels like I never left high school.  The dorms are small, old and offer no privacy. The bathroom has only 3 showers that have only curtains not doors.  The residence hall staff is useless.  They to nothing compared to RAs at other schools. They don't care about the residents. They don't feel like it is their responsibility to fix roommate issues and they just send you away.  Asking them anything was just a waste of time.  There is almost no nigh life and there is no where to go in Alliance. There isn't a Starbucks! The dining hall food is gross and there are not many different options and the hours are super inconvenient. It's not worth the money. I only lasted one semester and I'm transferring. My best advice is DON'T DO IT!!"
College Freshman,1,The dining hall is gross!  I stopped eating it the first week of the semester because I just couldn't eat it.  The hours were super inconvenient especially for athletes.  They aren't many options and the food gets old after a short period of time.  They don't offer take out so you have to stay there and eat.
College Freshman,1,Unless you play a sport or go greek there is no parting on campus.  There are no clubs or anything in Alliance.  I was went to Kent several times a week to get  my party fix.
College Senior,1,There is no where to park on campus if you need to hurry up and get to class. I sometimes commute and sometimes live in my on-campus apartment. When I commute I have to go to my apartment before going to class. I wish I could simply find a parking spot and get to class without frustration and anxiety getting a spot and not getting ticketed. The hand tickets out like candy here.
College Sophomore,1,"Tickets Galore – Very difficult to find a parking space, where you will not get a ticket!"
College Freshman,1,"Don't Get Caught – They are strict about parties, it is a huge bummer. It forces campus to be boring because campus security busts everything."
College Senior,1,"What Night Life? the majority of the parties are house parties and there about 2 good bars in alliance. One of them is only really popular on thursday nights and they let in underagers. The other bar (which is popular) is only for 21 and up so not many students can actually go. They have after hours activities that include bowling and sporting games in cleveland, but not many students really take advantage of them"
College Sophomore,1,One greek house has a bad reputation for sexual assaults
College Sophomore,1,This is one of the most boring places I've ever been to. People aren't very social at all. Nobody is really willing to take to people. Unless your in a sportor greek life don't bother even looking at this school.
College Sophomore,1,It's extremly strick when it comes to people that are underage. The fact that student affairs consists of all women makes it very diffcult to get off the hook with something if your a guy. The dean and res life is prettyy much out to get anyone. If your a dude you'll definetly put you on probation or even try to suspend you for the littlest things.
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Inside Scoop – Life at Mount Union was a constant drag. Very limited programs offered, and campus life was extremely dreadful. Most students went home on weekends, which is understandable since Mount was not a lace 'to be'"
College Senior,1,Everyone Is the Same. Lots of white narrow minded students from the same region. Minorities are mostly being ignored. Same race hangs out within themselves. Minimum mingle.
College Senior,1,"Nothing is here. NOTHING – If you are from a real big city. You will find it absolutely nothing here. Not convenient at all. And people here don't have a life, except drive 150 miles away to Cleveland or 200 miles away to Columbus. "
College Senior,1,No transportation available within the entire Ohio.
College Senior,1,Strict and Not Helpful – Rules are pretty strict. Lessons you have to attend after breaking the rules are not helpful at all. Don't do anything fun is the rule here.
College Senior,1,"If You Are Looking for Open Minded People, Don't Come Here. First of all, I hate this small town environment. Alliance Ohio is absolutely small and there is absolutely nothing here. If you are from a big city and don't have a car, please do yourself a favor by not coming here. Besides, people here really suck, most of them. There are good people, but you can count them use your ten fingers. Everyone is an athlete and zealous about sports. If you are a sports freak, come here! Another bad part about people here is that everyone is super super religious. They take it to the extreme, like literally in a personal relationship with God. I'm not saying being religious is bad, but when it comes to this point everyone will try to convert you. So if you are freethinker or atheist, you'll grow a hatred on religion. People in the office don't their job either. Trust me, they aren't not helpful when you are in trouble. The only good thing about this school is the academics, especially if you are a science major or the popular jocks' major exercise science. Professors here are responsible and nice. If all of these above don't matter too you only the academics, Mount Union is a perfect fit for people who are enthusiastic about academics but numb to fun and equality."
College Senior,1,"Lack of Help – The Financial Aid Office generally has not been helpful to me at all. I have done more for my own financial aid by mailing a letter to my financial aid provider than the office has been all semester. They may offer suggestions as to how YOU would provide your own financial aid, but besides that, the office doesn't help much. They may direct you to phone numbers and such, but they actually aren't doing anything besides that. Sometimes, I find them frustrating to work with, and they usually tell you that you need more help too late in the semester to do much about it.

As for getting financial aid at the University of Mount Union's office, I would suggest putting on some fake smiles and having a rather simple problem to fix."
College Junior,1,Ice Wolverine Eating Your Face – In January/February the ice and snow and wind are so terrible and harsh that sometimes you don't even eat because you don't want to leave your room. And classes are never canceled.
College Junior,1,"The Fines Here Are Out of This World Crazy. Some people really cross the line when it comes to breaking the rules and it seems like Mount Union officials were way too easy on them. But then security is ridiculous when it comes to giving parking tickets, so watch where you park. And the room cleaning fines at the end of the semester can also be unfair and ridiculous, so sweep the floor before you leave."
College Junior,1,"In some dorms, you are not guaranteed a spot, as most commuters will take spots that do not belong to them, as well as the staff!"
College Junior,1,"College Troublemakers – I lived behind one of the sorority houses for an entire year and it was so loud. I had no interest in being a part of Greek life on campus, but unfortunately, I didn't seem to have a choice. They were very rude to us whenever we parked our cars or when we were walking home. Overall, most of the members of Greek life at Mount Union have a bad reputation, and for good reason. Some members are great to be around, but most are not."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not a lot going on as far as an off-campus nightlife. There is one bar that kids can go to, but no clubs. To go to a bar or club beyond that, like a restaurant/sport bars, you have to travel to Canton, Akron, or Cleveland, which is a far drive for one night. More bars are beyond needed around the college! Yes it is a small school, but I think anything that would be put in would definitely be utilized by students."
College Sophomore,1,"Security Busting Campus Parties – All Campus Security looks to do at Mount Union is bust parties. They think they are big city police and they are not. They need to be more relaxed-it's college. They are not worried about things that are stolen, they just care if they can get more underage drinkers or not."
College Junior,1,"There are parties, but they end too early. One a.m. is not a good time to end because most people want to have fun all night, not when MUC thinks it's time to stop. MUC should have a bar on campus so people who do drink won't have to drink and then drive back to campus. It's a safety thing. They are trying to make the campus bigger by buying out all these local places and forcing them to move there businesses, not thinking about the kids who go there. Now they have to either not go or have someone else drive. A lot of students don't have cars so if the school had had a liquor license, the students over 21 would be happy and the students under 21 will be happy that they have a dance floor. And no one will have to drive. It's convenient for everyone."
College Sophomore,1,"My experience with dorm life was not too good. My roommate took a lot of my things and misused my items, as well. Also, I did not get along with a majority of the people in the hallway. The process to get a new roommate was too complicated to do, so I didn't feel like having more stress."
College Senior,1,"While there is plenty of parking, students without cars face a bit of a problem. There is a very limited public transportation system in Alliance. Off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you where a bus stop is. I know there is a line that goes into Canton. But when and where is another matter. Therefore, most students bring their own cars (it is free to park!) and students without cars ride with them around town."
College Senior,1,"The limited amount of parking located outside of the dorms I have lived in is awful. I should be able to park by my dorm without much trouble; however, it is always a hassle trying to find a spot."
College Junior,1,"The smell of pot is present nightly, and alcohol is EVERYWHERE. It's a shame that this many people are drug users! It is also terrible that the school recommends attending Greek events when they are supplying most of the school's alcohol and drugs! Peer pressure is terrible here cuz everyone is doing it and I'm made to feel like a freak because I don't drink or smoke!"
College Junior,1,"There are way too many cars on campus and not nearly enough parking spaces. If you are in the wrong designated area or are parked in a 15-minute zone for 16 minutes, you will get a ticket and probably a boot on your car as well. I don't bring my car to school because there's no parking space for it."
College Junior,1,"Not Too Shabby..Except Wireless. There's plenty of computer labs in the library at Mount Union. The Mac lab is nice because many students choose Macs over PCs. It would be much better if all of the computer labs were open 24/7 instead of just the few in the 24-hour area. The computers in HPCC could be accessible longer, as well. Wireless is a whole different story. It's almost as though it doesn't exist at Mount Union. It's such a struggle just to log onto the wireless network, and then trying to keep the Internet connection is impossible. You would think at a small school like Mount Union where students pay hand and foot to attend that the school would purchase a larger bandwidth. When the connection does hold for a few minutes, the server is extremely slow."
College Senior,1,Commuter Parking Is Horrible – There are too many parking lots set aside for every student and not enough for commuters. They filled up too fast and I was late to class numerous times trying to find a spot. Parking in any other zone would result in a ticket. It was a nightmare.
College Junior,1,"AVI Is Horrible – The food service is horrible at Mount Union. They do not have what you want and they do not accommodate their students. The best thing about being in the dining hall is the help; they are friendly and act like moms away from home! Also, the meal plans are horrible because you cannot use money anywhere but the dining hall. We should be able to use a swipe at the cafe."
College Senior,1,The weather at Mount Union is horrible. The winters are extremely cold and the school never salts the sidewalks. Classes also never get canceled so don't get your hopes up.
College Senior,1,"Almost Always Bad! The weather in Alliance is almost always bad. There are more rainy/snowy days than anything. I've heard it has something to do with the city's elevation. But on stormy/blizzardy days, everyone is less likely to go to class. And classes are never canceled, so even when the sidewalks are covered in ice, you still have to walk."
College Senior,1,"Almost Always Wrong – My financial aid statement is almost always wrong. There were perhaps two semesters where I didn't have to call the Office of Financial Aid to set it right. Applying for it and that sort of thing isn't a difficult process, but any further interactions are a hassle."
College Sophomore,1,"If there was not a good wrestling team at Mount, I would transfer. They are strict but the police are even more strict. Once I graduate I will never return to the city of Alliance again. The police will actually pull over anyone for anything just to see if that person is drinking. They even have something called ""Operation Last Chance"" where they drive around looking for underage drinking in a city full of other crime. The police force is pathetic, and I pity them."
College Sophomore,1,Not Very Good – I can't wait to live off campus so I am not forced to have a meal plan for a cafeteria that I don't enjoy. The workers are great and always smiling but the food is not very good.
College Junior,1,"There are few things to do off campus. I am a biology major, and the department is designed to be difficult but it's too difficult and it appears as if most professors don't care about how the students are doing in their classes. It's hard to contact most of the teachers, and it's very disappointing. Mount Union does a great job trying to put on programs for campus life, although most end up being boring or not well advertised."
College Freshman,1,"Even though I do not have a car, the parking isn't great. There are more parking spaces for teachers and commuters than there are for students who have cars and actually live there. Most of the time students need to park across campus from where they actually live."
College Freshman,1,"There Hardly Is Any – Bottom line: If you want to go to a good party, you should probably take the short drive to Akron or Kent. Yes, ATO and SAE have some good parties every so often, but overall, the campus just hosts lame get-togethers. Students would rather sit on Facebook in their dorms than go to them."
College Senior,1,The Dorms – There is not enough housing on campus for the incoming students and the school has done little to address it. They are eventually building more upperclassman housing but for the cost of the housing students would still rather move off campus because of the freedom they enjoy from the strict rules that tend to be broken by those who are meant to enforce them.
College Junior,1,"As far as nightlife goes, there are no bars around Mount Union. There is one down the street and another one that is around the corner, but the one around the corner doesn't have a student ID night, and I'm pretty sure they charge a cover.  
The other bar down the street used to be right on campus and they had a very fun student ID night that was always packed, but MUC bought out the bar to use the land for more housing so that bar had to move down the street. There are no 18+ clubs/bars anywhere, so if you are underage, your best bet would be to go to house parties."
College Freshman,1,"Everything is too serious, not even a DD will keep you safe, you will get busted. And their punishments suck and are way uncalled for."
College Freshman,1,"IT SUCKS. It sucks-people gave up trying to find anything on Fridays and what happens on Saturdays, the APD finds out before you do."
College Sophomore,1,"No Clubs, but Improvements on the Way – Mount Union is not known for the surrounding clubs, but all fraternities hold parties almost every weekend. The school is also trying to make improvements by adding a group on campus dedicated to creating a fun and safe nightlife experience."
College Freshman,1,"Go Out of Town – In Alliance, there is almost NOTHING to do, except go to Walmart. All the good shopping restaurants and nightlife is in Canton. It's a far drive and most freshmen don't have cars."
College Junior,1,"If you don't have a car or a friend who drives a car, then you are pretty much out of luck. Alliance has nothing worth seeing within the city. I don't recall seeing any local buses, either. The campus does provide transportation for certain off-campus events (such as ice skating or bowling), and sign-up is often limited; it's first come, first serve."
College Student,1,"Not Good at All – Alliance is a horrible town in terms of local atmosphere. While there are a few local treasures, finding them and the safety in getting there, in my opinion, isn't worth it. It's a dying town in the Rust Belt, and each year, more and more shops close."
College Junior,1,"My junior year I had to move off campus, not by choice, because Mount Union was unable to house all of its students. That is ridiculous. Then when senior year came around, I thought we would get an email about trying to get back on campus; however, since we were already off campus, they didn't feel the need to keep us on the email list. What a joke!"
College Junior,1,"The only places to eat around campus are the new Mexican restaurant, Applebee's, Texas Roadhouse, which doesn't open until 4, and fast food places. I have a gluten allergy and cannot have dairy so it really stinks for me because I cannot eat fast food, and I am a healthy person. There is however one healthy food place to eat, which is very good! When it comes to discounts you can pretty much use your Purple Plu$ card anywhere because we are such a small campus."
College Freshman,1,There needs to be more parking. Campus Security and the local police department need to find more important things to do instead of giving everyone parking tickets all day long.

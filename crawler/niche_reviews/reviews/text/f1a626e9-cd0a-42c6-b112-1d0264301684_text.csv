Alum,5,"I took some classes online and a lot on campus. I loved the college experience; I became & found myself & my capabilities. I became a self study person, depended on myself and learned a lot. Professors were supportive & knowledgeable of courses they taught. Students in the classes were friendly and easily approachable. With online classes, you feel overwhelmed, but at the same time, they’re flexible and time managed."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus with a lot of opportunities. Students are independent, friendly and always working hard to achiever their goals. When you are there, you feel encouraged, supported and you’re always working hard to get to your goal."
Junior,5,This school is fine as long as you can go to campus and access resources. During the pandemic however the school has quickly degraded to barely functioning as a learning institution
Senior,5,"I'm very happy that my classes are now online. I do not prefer online classes, but given the circumstances, I think it was the right decision to make. The teachers are being very cooperative  and encouraging and I don't feel like I'm compromising my learning at all."
Senior,5,"Wayne State has opened me up to a lot of opportunities. They've given me a research position, teachers that care and work to push their students, and a great campus. They take racism and this pandemic very serious and I'm grateful for that."
Senior,5,It made Nursing School 10 times easier. The professors and students really came together during this semester. The professor answered everything readily online and was very helpful through the voyage of school.
Junior,5,"So many opportunities to get involved with student organizations, Greek life, research, internships, and on/off campus jobs."
Sophomore,5,The teachers weren't all friendly and some didn't care if I succeeded personally or even showed up to class.
Sophomore,5,I like the campus and the dorms were beautiful. I wish the food was a little better for vegetarians because I didn't have much options.
Freshman,5,I haven't gone to Wayne State for classes yet but I have visited and did summer camp there and it was very nice. The people were friendly and the food was great! I expect the classes to be great too. Please don't let the fact that it's in Detroit turn you away. I was born in Detroit and I find it to be a nice city with many nice people. Yeah there is crime every once and a while but what city doesn't have that.
Senior,5,"The admissions process what somewhat confusing, but the staff and faculty are amazing. I enrolled into an online program that was set up well and allowed me the ability to create my own schedule. The diversity of the faculty is what I sought out, and I am glad I did."
Senior,5,Wayne State has done a great job with online program classes. I have had only one class convert to online for COVID-19. The professor was dedicated to our learning and keeping the experience as group oriented as possible.
Sophomore,5,"Last year as an incoming freshman, I absolutely loved how open and welcoming WSU was and still is. I felt at home, extremely safe, also how so many amazing places were so close to campus."
Junior,5,I love being in the heart of Detroit with a diverse student body and staff that is all very welcoming and helpful. I still have yet to have a bad professor and it is my junior year.
Sophomore,5,"During this hard time causes by the pandemic, Wayne State professors responded appropriately to accommodate students to their needs. Personally, my professors were understanding with the planned curriculum and worked with students one on one to help them with technology issues or deadlines."
Senior,5,"My experience with Wayne State has been extremely easy and convenient.  I am an Online student and I have been very happy with the quit response with the professor I have had the pleasure of being in their class,  Also, when having to contact the school for any reason I am guaranteed to get through."
Senior,5,"I have taken all of my classes online at Wayne State and I was very please with my professors.  I utilized my time online classes with the same amount of time as if I was in person.  My professors, we easy to contact and responded back within 24 hours."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience was great! The past winter semester I took 2 classes online and to be honest, I was a bit scared on how it was going to be, and if it was going to be easy to follow up and actually learn. It was! For both of my classes, they put ""modules"" every week with the lecture, videos, and the homework that had to be done. They posted everything week by week to not confuse the student. It had the assignments, and the lectures for that week in separate folders with the due date and time. Also, you can email the professor if there is any confusion and they will get back to you within 24 hours, sometimes even faster. 
I had a great experience, and they are actually very easy to follow up. Also, you have an entire week to turn everything in, the good thing about this is that you can do it on your own time."
Junior,5,I truly loved my online class. I could go at my own pace and get the assignments done on my own schedule.
Junior,5,"Wayne State University provided incredible diversity in higher learning, opportunity, and community."
Junior,5,I have taken a few online classes. These classes were perfect to take online. I feel that Wayne does have a good selection for online classes.

Freshman,5,Most of my classes are online due to covid19 but its okay I dont mind because WSU is very accomodating and advisors reach out for help.
Graduate Student,5,"I did not do much online work. The
Work that I did complete online was very easy to access with the platform they use."
Junior,5,"Yes, after the Pandemic all of the classes were transferred online and the professor made it so easier for us to take it from home. Some of my professors used a zoom call for taking classes and some used canvas Conference systems to take the class."
Senior,5,"My experience at Wayne State was an amazing one because I had wonderful professors, tutors, and classmates. The program I went through was very educational, that I learned to take what I learned in my classes to my field placement site. It was very rewarding for me because I earned all A's in my classes for my major. In addition to that, I made the Dean's List every semester for my hard work."
Senior,5,"My online experience through the last almost two years were very educational. In the fall semester of 2018, I took my first online and it went very well because the teacher was helpful when I had concerns. The rest of my online classes went well but some were difficult because of the teacher and homework load. I usually prefer a face to face class over an online platform because I learn better in the class room where I can ask the teacher questions I am not sure of."
Sophomore,5,I love it all. It’s really diverse and there’s so many resources to succeed. There’s also a really supportive staff and amazing student community.
Sophomore,5,I took a few and we had recorded lectures and online exams. We also had meetings on Zoom and virtual office hours
Freshman,5,The online classes were great! The professors made the material very easy to keep up with and understand. They were also always there to help if needed.
Freshman,5,"My first year at Wayne was amazing! I loved the campus and living down in the city. The professors were extremely helpful and the classes were actually fun to attend. The diversity there was also one of my favorite aspects, it was nice to have so many different people in my classes. I liked being able to hear different perspectives and meet all types of people on campus."
Junior,5,The online classes at Wayne state have been amazing. My professors are always at an emails reach and the Canvas platform is very easily laid out.
Junior,5,There was no question or hesitation when I was accepted to Wayne State University in 2016. Every moment has taught me a life lesson in some way.
Freshman,5,"Wayne State University opened up my eyes to how diverse the world is. Not only does Wayne offer a phenomenal education, it also teaches you of the variety of cultures/individuality among people and how they can interact to make a positive impact. Something I would like to see change is the involvement regarding athletics. I believe that something should be done so there is more turnout to support our teams and dedicated student athletes."
Senior,5,My experience with Wayne State has been a rewarding so far. I like to attend the classes and they are very helpful.
Freshman,5,Wayne State is a very unique school. I am very honored to be studying here for my 4 years at college because it has brought me all new experiences with new people who have eventually become some of my closest friends.

Niche User,5,One of the very few who give undocumented students a chance to dream of going to college. Heart of Detroit scholarship is also available for Undocumented students. Amazing institution.
Freshman,5,"Wayne State University is one of the most ethnically diverse campuses in Michigan, and it is located in the heart of the city of Detroit. The professors do a great job at what they do."
Freshman,5,"Wayne State has the best programs, greatest team, and overall great staff. As a freshmen attending Wayne State University, I am happy I chose this school over Michigan State."
Junior,5,"Wayne State University is an excellent institution. Upon entering as a transfer student my initial concern would be a lack of one-on-one instruction due to the immense size of the student body. However I was pleasantly surprised that each class I've enrolled in thus far has had a small student to teacher ratio, allowing each student the chance they need to succeed. Wayne State has the amenities of a giant institution, but the quality of education of a small one.
Additionally, Wayne State has a huge responsibility on their hands to keep their students safe. Despite being located in one of the most crime fueled cities, Wayne State has reported lower crime rates, both violent and domestic, than the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. That is pretty incredible. I have felt completely safe taking night classes and walking to my car. There is a large security premise at all times on campus.
Wayne State University is one of the finest colleges in Michigan."
Freshman,5,"Great community, very diverse. Great teachers who care about you and your grades. In the center of Detroit and has great culture opportunities. Great campus, everyone is very friendly and loving. Counsellors care about you and are willing to do anything to help."
Freshman,5,i love the area and the friendly environment. All the counselors are very helpful and they make my college experience very easy. I've made new friends and a whole new community has made me see more of detroit.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Wayne State University, I can definitely say that I made the right choice when it come to deciding on a school in the state of Michigan. The campus is not to big, but not too small, it is very diverse, there are also many on campus resources to aid students physical, mental and academic well-being."
Graduate Student,5,"It is one of the best universities you enroll in as there are a variety of options in different social life at the university.
The university may need more research programs for graduate studies in order to be able to acquire more new graduate students"
Freshman,5,The environment is great and the campus is beautiful. I've only had great professor so far. I enjoy everyday there and everyone is so friendly and helpful. I've taken a few review classes and learned so much that high school hadnt mentioned before.
Graduate Student,5,Wayne State University has many  programs of study and extracurricular activities. Wayne State is a very diverse campus which is important because you get to study and work with people from not only your own background. This allows students to work with others and effectively prepare them for the workforce which is very diverse. There are many clubs on campus and many resources for help in many different subjects.
Niche User,5,I loved the environment when I visited the campus. Everyone was so welcoming and nice. The classrooms seemed very comfortable. The dorms looked nice and clean. I’m learning more about the medical program and I love it!!
Niche User,5,"I love how diverse Wayne is and all the academics it provides. Being an incoming student, I attended a college tour and I absolutely loved it. The students and staff were very welcoming and respectful. If I could change one thing about this college, it would be the safety. It is a little scary walking alone. I believe there should be more security to provide more protection."
Freshman,5,"The thing I like most about Wayne State is that it has diverse group of people and respects every religion, culture, and ethnicity. Also, comparing to other universities this one has lower tuition fees. The people in WSU are friendly and very well determined. The advisors and professors help you to succeed. They help you to track your plan more than anyone else. The organizations are also something to talk about. I really liked joining public health; being connected to the community is a different kind of happiness and achievement."
Freshman,5,"I was very happy with the safety on campus. There was never a time where I felt threatened or unsafe, I always felt there was someone I can turn to if I felt uncomfortable. Being a student who stays past sunset on campus can be very scary, but there are always police driving around campus or walking and they are always happy to help with whatever you need. I am also very happy with how many different clubs are available for the students to join. There is a club for basically anything that interests you and it is really cool meeting people with similar interests and helping out the community."
Sophomore,5,The staff at Wayne state university make everything run smooth! I have honestly have such an amazing experience!
Sophomore,5,Wayne State is a great university. It’s very diverse and helps you emerge into different cultures that aren’t similar to yours. It opens your eyes to different experiences and people you wouldn’t have at other universities.
Senior,5,Wayne State University is a great college located in the heart of a growing city. Detroit is home to rich culture! Students get an amazing education while being exposed to the urban environment. The campus is extremely safe and kept well clean. I cannot wait to continue my education here and expand my knowledge in my field while watching Detroit grow as well.
Senior,5,"What I love about Wayne State University is that there are many diversity students to meet with, professors who motivate and encourage you to reach your goals in class, going to libraries where you can study in peace, meeting new people this year who know everything about God and how he works in mysterious ways. I participate in the group because it makes me feel so much comfortable being spiritual and learning everything about Christ. With him I believe in myself and praying with other people makes me feel great.I also enjoy exercising to maintain my health."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere and the overall vibe of the college. I think I can gain a lot of experiences from the opportunity they have.
Sophomore,5,"All my professors are very nice and great teachers. They all are very helpful and provide me with all the tools I need to succeed. I also love all the restaurants on campus! I appreciate all the services provided to students, such as caps and the safe walk program."
Freshman,4,Some professors were able to adapt to online and others were not. Some classes are taught (poorly) by grad assistants.
Freshman,4,I am in my freshman year during COVID so it’s been a transition but all classes were online from the beginning and cases are to a minimum
Sophomore,4,"On-campus experience is amazing, there are lots of helpful programs and individuals. Having on-campus experiences is a lot better than online."
Junior,4,My online learning experience so far has been good but it just takes time to get used to it. Many professors are understanding and can make adjustments based on the students needs. I also like it because many of my professors upload a lot of lectures which helps me learn more rather than just a zoom meeting once a week. I also feel that it is easier to get access to the professor since I do not have to find them in the building on campus but only join their office hours on zoom or email them.
Junior,4,"Wayne State has been a great University. I am currently in my third year and doing online school but the first two years were great. I would say that the science courses are very tough and require a lot of time put in to learn and understand the material. Other than the courses, people there are very nice and welcoming and I feel that I have met and learned about many different people from different backgrounds. The campus is also nice because there are so many places you can study at and sit in instead of only the library which I love to go to. Its also a great campus because you get to walk around a lot and enjoy the scenery before classes and sit outside and do some studying as well. There were also great organizations that I think many people would enjoy."
Senior,4,"My experience was 4/5 because sometimes I had snobby professors who were rude but gave the grades that I deserved. Another reason is that I have come across bullies in college but, I also feel that the professor does their best to crack down on the behavior and address it. Another thing that I like about Wayne State is they record their lectures and put them online which I find to be very helpful through my curriculum."
Freshman,4,"I just recently joined Wayne state university this year as a freshman and so far as far as signing up for class online tool there has been little to no struggle in terms of set up. However, the only current discrepancy that I ave is that I can't seem to reach the financial aid office which is a bit problematic."
Junior,4,It has definitely been a transition but most professors have been more than willing to provide whatever help is necessary.
Freshman,4,I have not started Wayne State yet but I expect the online experience to be very good since I have already taken there online placement test which I found pretty straight forward as it was pretty easy to learn so I hope this helped a little.
Senior,4,"A lot of professors did not communicate well, but were swiftly checked by their departments. Theres a lot of changes that need to be made but it was the best that could've been done."
Senior,4,A lot of the school is focused on expanding and construction when that money could be going towards helping students with academics and providing more resources.
Sophomore,4,"I had a few online courses, and after COVID-19 hit, a majority of my classes were switched to online. Professors handled the transitions with care and understanding, they were also extremely helpful."
Freshman,4,"I haven’t taken any classes online yet, but I am soon. I haven’t had any problems with them so far. The professors teach as if they actually care for us and want us to do good on life."
Freshman,4,"I like that Wayne state has a diverse and medium sized campus. There aren’t too many or too little people, it feels just right. There isn’t anything I think they should improve on so far."
Sophomore,4,"I feel as Wayne State University is a very great diverse school however it has its pros and cons. If you plan on attending this university be prepared to get ""Wayne stated"".  ""Wayne Stated"" is a term used by students that attends Wayne State that happens to get the short end of the stick. Whether that's from the financial aid office or the administration and staff. One pro of attending Wayne State is how diverse the school is. If you are coming from a high school where you were exposed to people of different cultures and ethnicities now is your time to shine and learn much more about new people. Overall I believe Wayne State University is a great school for you as long as you do not get ""Wayne Stated"""
Sophomore,4,While attending Wayne State University I have taken 2 online classes and they both turned out very well as long as you stay on top of your game. I had an anthropology professor that was very lenient on due dates due to the covid-19 rise.  I will say some professors are not that great at communication via email and some email back right away.
Junior,4,Online learning with Wayne state is easy. They have accommodated with people so that everyone has the ability to learn.
Junior,4,Wayne state has a very diverse culture and a lot of things you can do on campus and in the surrounding area. They are also partnered with a lot of companies that can help you pursue your career.
Sophomore,4,"I think Wayne State University is a great school to attend! Diversity, academics, and campus activities is what amazes me the most. Everyone is accepting from the professors to students to other faculty. My experience at this school has been a joy and I can't wait to start the new academic year with WSU!"
Sophomore,4,"Wayne State University is a great and friendly school for people who like to be close to a big city like Detroit! It has beautiful and comforting housing, staff members, and the school buildings are modern and easy to get to. 
Wayne State has a great security system that makes you feel safe at all times, and not worry about something happening to you while going back to your dorm or apartment. It has areas to hang out in with your friends and meet more people, and even a after hours cafe in case you didn't have time to eat, you always have that option!
In my personal experience I love Wayne State because when I first started I was not far from home and I could go back every weekend. But, I do understand that some people come from farther cities in Michigan or even a different state. Therefore, I think it's good because you have the airport, and train stations not even a half hour away from Wayne State."
Junior,4,Wayne has given me many opportunities and I am so lucky to be apart of a great school. Being in Detroit is an amazing experience and not like other colleges.
Graduate Student,4,In the masters chemical engineering program. The faculty and campus are great. My only hang up is that the MS process is not very straightforward and there is little information on it.
Junior,4,"As a transfer student from Oakland Community College, I am fascinated by the variety of resources Wayne State offers to its students such as the lab settings, lab course coordination with the TA and the professor, which allows for greater comprehension of the material , discussion sessions for lectures, various peer-mentors appointments to assist you with a variety of questions in the way of helping you understand better and enjoy your experience on campus. One thing I would like to see changed is the format of lab settings during the pandemic as it is really challenging to do online labs, which are not any different from lectures, which makes the meaning and the purpose of lab abstract, so I would suggest at least making the labs in-person or other appropriate format to somehow lessen the burden."
Freshman,4,"Since quarantine, my professors made online learning easily accessible and I was always able to contact them for questions."
Freshman,4,"I believe the balance of fun and learning is definitely the strong suit of the university. I am able to join many activities around campus, while still finding quiet places to study and do homework."
Graduate Student,4,"All of my classes were in one building. This made it very convenient for my hectic schedule. Also, this was extremely helpful with parking being that Wayne State is located downtown Detroit."
Sophomore,4,"Taking classes online was very difficult with the quick transition going online . But the instructors did the best they could with the circumstances, and made adjustments to the requirements which made online classes easy for me."
Junior,4,"I really like that Wayne State University is a diverse campus, all the students are really helpful and engaging. The professors and peers are helpful and open-minded. At Wayne State University there are many resources we can take advantage of to be successful, there are many organizations that help us to be an all-rounder and get closer to our career. Some of the organizations like NSBE get us ready for the actual job outside of campus. The only thing that I would like to see the changes at Wayne State University is a better communication system."
Junior,4,I really love how diverse the school is. There are also many different clubs and organizations that you're able to join. There is literally one for every type of student. The dorms are kept up and are always neat and clean and there is hardly ever any violence on campus as far as fights and things go.
Freshman,4,Wayne State looks like a nice University to attend. The staff look like they really care about your education and they want to help you achieve your dreams. It’s a great school if you don’t want to be far away from home.
Sophomore,4,"WSU has been a wonderful experience as my first year in college. I can easily say that I am excited to continue pursuing my degree here. My favorite parts about Wayne State are the professors who (mostly) care about their students' well-being, as well as the diversity of the campus community."
Junior,4,I like that there is a large amount of things to do on and around campus and that there is always resources available to me when I need help with something. However I feel that some of the people who are there to help do not do the best job and I have to rely on other students for assistance
Sophomore,4,"Wayne State University is a great school filled with amazing programs, a beautiful campus in the Midtown of Detroit, and an out of this world diverse student body."
Niche User,4,"Wayne is a great school, a little expensive but most colleges are. They are very helpful to high school students planning on attending their school."
Freshman,4,I like the diversity at this school and all the different backgrounds that everyone comes from. Everyone has their own story. The education here is good and the teachers are nice. Teachers are often willing to help you out if you are struggling in their class. It is mainly a commuter school so there is not much campus life. I am on the premed path right now and so far am enjoying my studies.
Niche User,4,"Overall, Wayne State is an excellent school and very good for native detroiters who can commute. They have excellent housing as well as good campus life and  safety."
Junior,4,"Wayne is a very diverse university with many opportunities available for students. There are always job fairs and research opportunities around campus. They have really good medical and sciences programs. They do, however, lack on cost. It is very expensive to live and go to Wayne State University if you are not receiving a scholarship. They tend to add on additional costs too, which is something to be aware of."
Senior,4,Wayne State is a great! The professors here helped to propel me into the community as well as enriching my education.
Freshman,4,"Since the school is mostly a commuter school, it’s hard to find new people to connect with. However, the school’s location in midtown Detroit is very exciting and can provide opportunities professionally."
Freshman,4,"I really like the campus because of how close to the city it is and I really enjoyed there was always something to do. All the classes I have had to take for my major I’ve also enjoyed, the staff was very supportive and helpful with the transition from high school to college and preparing me for my future career."
Senior,4,"The Diversity is very cool, I like how everything is great walking distance so you save gas and get good exercise. Pretty Good Staff and Professors that care!"
Freshman,4,"Wayne State University is a great school. I am only a freshman, but so far, I have really enjoyed my time here. What I like the most about this school is the vast amount of diversity. There is always a chance to meet someone from a different walk of life. You get to connect with people you never thought you would interact with before. The only thing I would like to see change at Wayne is the fees students have to pay. We do pay for a lot of different things here. I would say the ability to have free parking would make a huge difference for all. Overall, Wayne is an amazing school and I am looking forward to my next few years here."
Freshman,4,Wayne State is located in Detroit and it is one of the most diverse universities in the united states. The university is quite big and has a very large population. The professors are also very kind and easy to communicate with outside of class. I would recommend the university to anyone who would like to come to Detroit for his/ her college
Sophomore,4,"I like the math PREP program, the additional work is worth it and very helpful. I would like some of the professors to change the way they grade and run their class to make it more fair and likely for students to get better grades."
Freshman,4,I have only been at WSU for a short period of time. I have great things to say about the staff and resources available to the students. There are many opportunities presented throughout campus to better accommodate a young adult. The only change I would like to see is the the initial advising meeting you get as an incoming freshman. There were many things that weren't mentioned and could have helped me out financially and academically.
Junior,4,I wish that more affordable housing options existed. The worst part is the commute. It can also be difficult to get ahold of people over the phone who works there.
Niche User,4,"My experience with Wayne State University is pretty good.  I haven’t seen any red flags, it’s a good establishment."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy my time at Wayne State University. Before actually going to college I was quite apprehensive about the whole idea, but both the professors and the consulars have made my experience surprisingly enjoyable!"
Freshman,4,"I like Wayne State University because it's the perfect size campus. You'll definitely meet a lot of new people, but it's not too big. The professors are also extremely helpful and really care about you. There's a lot of diversity and a lot of activities available to get involved in."
Graduate Student,4,"This is a great place to attend for university, but the best part of it is definitely the people. Midtown Detroit is an area that is growing faster each and every year and going to school at Wayne State gives you the opportunity to see that and take part in it first hand!"
Freshman,4,I love Wayne State University for the most part. Most of the time the food is amazing. My safety is #1 and thats one thing that they're really big on here. They also try to make everyone feel included.
Niche User,4,"Went to Wayne State for a college visit and had a great time. The campus looked amazing and it was so much fun! The restaurants near by were delicious, there was a great variety of restaurants and businesses. There were also many dorms to look at and so many other opportunities that are offered at the university. Can't wait to attend Wayne State as a freshman."
Freshman,4,"It very open and welcoming. It's in the middle of a very busy city, and there's always something to do."
Junior,4,"Wayne State is a very diverse community, it's a school that has a lot of events that try to bring everyone together. The scenery is very beautiful especially since all of the new renovations. There are so many different originations that are offered that are targeted at so many different types of hobbies, beliefs, interests, even some to expand your knowledge, or see the are dedicated to community service. Wayne State university is an university that can really bring people out of their comfort zone and be very involved."
Junior,4,"It is a great school, but if you are looking for the full college experience, you won't get it at a commuter school."
Junior,4,"I like how diverse the university is, I can meet many types of people with the same interests or learn more about theirs. I just wish there were more campuses near my area, us Wayne State Students always risk our lives driving to Wayne in the first place and I don’t believe Wayne keeps this in check."
Freshman,4,I like that the campus is small and intimate. I like the diversity of the student body. I like the easy access to the professors. The program that I chose is what I wanted. The on campus housing is safe and secure and is new or newly renovated. There are many organizations on campus and lots of programs to assist with student success. The campus is easily accessible to commuter students and is in an urban setting that allows access to many different cultural events and establishments around the campus.  The college's public safety department is in connection with the City's police department and handles any and all safety issues just as the City's police force would.
Senior,4,"Wayne State is a good school. If you live here, you are in the city so there's lots of places to go to if you're bored. If you're a commuter than parking can get a little crazy, but if you buy a parking pass then its very easy to park. The classes are challenging enough to prepare you for real life and grad school. There are lots of possibilities to work in labs, research and internships. Its a nice campus to go to."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are great, it’s very diverse, great programs, always people around who are willing to help you further your education. They strongly believe in leaving no one behind"
Senior,4,"Wayne state is very unique and is very diverse. It has people from almost all over the world. The campus is awesome and the people are great. They offer so many courses and the teachers are great.y They really care about you. WSU has so many clubs to join and meet new people. I really liked how they have different clubs to join and get to know people. They also have table tennis, 8 ball pool, dancing, chess and other activities to play when you have time in between your classes.
One thing I would like to see change is student parking. They are keep selling parking buildings and making it hard for students to park their cars. They also have very high parking tickets per semester in my opinion. If you buy parking ticket then it should be no worries for you to find parking spaces. Other than that Wayne State is great."
Senior,2,"The online experience has been okay so far. For nursing, definitely not getting the patient experience we need."
Senior,2,"I came to Wayne State, already having a bachelors degree from Grand Valley, to pursue another degree in nursing. My problems were mostly with the financial aid and student services. I can't tell you how many times I have had to call the financial aid office or the student services office because I didn't have enough aid, needed aid applied, or needed anything else related to aid. Every single time I called or visited their office, I had to wait over an hour, (2 1/2 hours one time), just to speak to someone. Once I did, they were extremely rude and did nothing to help out students, which is what student services is for. Every semester they would give me late payment fees, when it was their fault that they didn't apply my aid yet. When I would call about it they said they wouldn't waive the fee and wouldn't give me a reason. I dealt with late payment fees every semester because of them. This is fraud and is the norm in our country."
Sophomore,2,"With online, I have issues personally grasping concepts. Not all of the professors are adjusting well to the online learning environment and some are giving more assignments than it would usually be. Time management is the biggest help a fully online student should have."
Junior,2,Online learning is not going well for me. With almost no access to my peers and professors struggling through the problems completely alone is very depressing and discouraging. During the time campus was open the university was great but during online in my program at least it feels like professors dont know how to engage the class. Class prices remained the same while cutting our access to resources dramatically. Financial Aid department is unreachable most of the time without waiting 3 hours on hold. After 3 years attending here I still have struggle to register for classes despite having all prerequisites met. Basically this school has always had a beaurocracy problem that I've seen and during the pandemic it has become much more noticable. I start every semester extremely excited to learn but this semester has been a real let down so far. Still learning just almost entirely by myself.
Senior,2,"If I had to do it over again, I would suck it in and travel to another school.  I generally like my classmates and most of my professors.  However, there is just so much that Wayne State does not get right.  The curriculum in my major is disappointing and does not include some classes that I would consider fundamental.  Advising is poor: every time I have talked to my advisor, he says something wildly different, with no recollection or consistency as the time before.  My thesis advisor failed to provide me guidance that could have saved me half a dozen credits and provides minimal guidance on what to do when.  Some of the professors are amazing and marvelous while others could not care less.  I generally enjoy my peers.  There are lots of great and incredibly well qualified students from outside America. 
 But too many of the students are happy to lunch off your work."
Senior,2,Limited classes online since the coronavirus and since everything went online.  Some instructors make a real effort to bring as much as they can online from the classroom.  Others have tried nothing and counted the saved time in the plus column.  It is possible that dedicated online classes are better.
Freshman,2,"I ended up having all of the problems that I could. There were bedbugs in my dorm room and I had a lot of problems with financial aid, they are not very helpful."
Graduate Student,2,"As a fine arts student I would not recommend this school. The art studios are in desperate need of repair, and there are a limited number of courses available for each department because the University is mostly driven towards science, engineering and health care. Art students tends to get categorized into one group are find themselves taking other classes as a requirement that have nothing to do with their career simply because the University doesn't have a wide range of classes for most art majors. Some professors were excellent but others seriously should consider retirement or going back to school for more training. This college needs more structure and organization especially within their senior seminar classes."
Junior,2,the admission office and student service are not helpful what so ever and it takes weeks to get a reply.
Junior,2,"Wayne State University was an institution that appears nice on the papers along with a nice, clean, and fresh area of Detroit, however, there seem to be some overarching problems with the school. The big ones are that the classes are lackluster and disorganized, there is no general regard for the pursuit of knowledge, and overall it is depressing."
Freshman,2,"Although the people on campus are not representative of Detroit, but rather the surrounding suburbs, there are many amazing individuals and professors at this school. However, the entire administration is corrupt and does not look after the interests of the students. Not a party school by any means, the campus is a ghost town on the weekends, being a commuter school, and can get pretty lonely. Dorm life is hell, especially with a meal plan that makes you crap out fire. Do anything you can to avoid the cafeteria. Roaches, rats and a french fry reuse policy. (that's right they take people's uneaten food and reserve it) Just avoid paying for the dorms, or better yet, save your money and avoid Wayne State."
Junior,2,"My experience at Wayne State University was pretty decent. What I really loved at this University were the amazing professors; I honestly learned so much and the education here is the best. There’s also so much to do on campus and so many sports, activities, communities, and clubs you can join. There’s so many opportunities for free tutoring and extra help which I definitely took advantage of. The only things I would like to see change would be the tuition pricing which is outrageously expensive and the paid parking which forces students to pay almost $300 per semester, insane! I would also like to see a stronger enforcement on safety at this school, there are always scary incidents happening and I think they should definitely find a way to make it safer."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life at my school is alright.  I'm not a huge fan of it so I'm not all that sure.
College Freshman,2,We barely hear about athletics due to the fact that it is a Division III school.
College Junior,2,It's a whole lot of hazing going on.
College Senior,2,WSU is more of a smaller school as well as a school that's directed forward graduate students and research therefore I believe traditional things reflect that. The Greeks they definitely have an impact on the social atmosphere as an undergrad student you really appreciate those moments because they are really hype and enjoyable. There is a Pike house that everyone goes to once in their WSU lifetime but to know if it's your crowd you would have to experience it .
College Freshman,2,Wayne State isn't really a party school. Theres barely any parties I hear about and if there are they're not really talked about because they're not all that great.
College Freshman,2,"I've tried looking into moving somewhere off campus yet still close to campus. But it has been pretty difficult. Rent is fairly expensive unless you have more than 4 people living in the place with you; and even finding reliable roommates can be a headache. All I've heard from people who live off campus are horror stories. From having cockroaches in their apartment, to not feeling safe, and/or not being able to pay for bills."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people leave campus on the weekends (including myself), when most parties happen, so it's hard to find a lt of people to go to parties with. Our campus is kind of anti-social on the weekends because of this."
College Junior,2,It is mostly bad due to the neighborhood
College Freshman,2,"The food itself is ok, but the fact that freshmen residents have to get unlimited meal plans for both semesters is really dumb and a waste of my money."
College Freshman,2,"One frat has a house and they're pretty yucky. My friend is having a terrible experience with her sorority. Some of them seem okay, but I feel like it's hard to have a tight knit greek life when the school is so huge."
College Freshman,2,"There are only 4 sororities, and they don't have houses."
College Freshman,2,"Wish there was more of a variety instead of Jimmy John's, Subway, Starbucks...OKAY WE GET IT now get some healthy stuff in here that actually has quality food not ""Gold n' Greens"" nasty food. WE NEED QUALITY AND VARIETY."
College Freshman,2,We did not get to leave campus at all which was sad
College Freshman,2,not a lot of options
Recent Alumnus,2,"Don't live in the dorms...find a place ""off-campus"""
College Senior,2,Im still having a hard time getting school paid for
College Junior,2,The rooms are pretty small comparable to other facilities I have been to.
College Sophomore,2,Financial is very difficult here. They would take forever at getting your financial situated. Sometime they would tell things at the at the last minute. So you wouldn't know if you received financial or didn't receive until the last minute.
College Junior,2,"Field work along with four classes

and working outside of school part time."
College Senior,2,Not enough options late nite is the worst.
College Junior,2,They made me do an unrelated program
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of dining options that are a part of the meal plan, and the food isn't really that great."
College Sophomore,2,"not that big, no sorority houses, housing not that great"
College Sophomore,2,I applied for sept. 2014 program but was denied because of too many applicants. I received the denial letter two weeks before the start of school so was left scrambling to take classes. They asked if I would be interested in their online wow social work program which started in jan. of 2014. again I was denied because of too many applicants and was only given a week and a half notice to scramble again for classes to take in the winter semester. I've been accepted for the fall of 2014 but am still hesitant about the program and the support from the school of social work
College Sophomore,2,I'm not sure about all students but I would not be able to attend without owning my own vehicle. I commute from home and it is a thirty minute car ride. I could possibly arrange public bus transportation but it would take several different buses and would probably take several hours to get there.
College Freshman,2,The meal exchange is cool but we're only limited to one swipe per meal period and there is only three on weekdays and two on weekends make people hungry!!
College Freshman,2,"Detroit as a law, that prohibits Sororities to have a house which prevents Wayne State to have anything. I believe the law is more than a certain number if girls that are not related in one household is considered a whore house or prostitution ring which I believe is very sexist, but that is Detroit's Law not Wayne State Policy. There is only one Frat house I know of and that is PIKE and a lot of people could careless for PIKE after the first two weeks of school."
College Freshman,2,"In the winter time, they don't shovel the snow making it hard for people to walk to class and park. This is definitely and issue, considering the fact that we live in Michigan."
College Freshman,2,"There are very very few options for off-campus housing, either its extremely nice but extremely pricey or its really cheap and really broke down, and anything that you can find in between the two have a huge waiting list or you need a car because its quite a walk in the winter without one"
College Freshman,2,"There isnt a lot of parties that go on on campus, a lot of the fun comes from off campus events once it gets later into the school year"
College Sophomore,2,Snow in Michigan is pretty epic and it sucks being a commuter during the winter months.
College Senior,2,"Greek life is barely there, zero special housing available, and really only one house exists only for a frat. Laws make it illegal for any type of sorority house to exist, really makes the whole ""college feel"" less like the ""college feel"""
College Senior,2,Parking is horribly hard to find and so unreasonably priced
College Freshman,2,"Our teams aren't great, and I don't think many people go to the games."
College Freshman,2,"As a non-Greek, I don't like the Greeks. They are always throwing parties and distracting students from their education. Having a Greek as a partner for a project is the worst."
College Freshman,2,I don't think off-campus is a good choice. They are always either expensive or trashy.
College Sophomore,2,"Overall it has not been very positive. Having to take medical classes that have nothing to do with my degree, listening to professors teach those classes who don't speak English, and listening to professors go on about things that are not pertinent to the class makes me wish I did not come here."
College Sophomore,2,"Nobody goes to the games, and the teams aren't very good. Most of the students are either Michigan or Michigan State fans and it's too hard to compete with that."
College Sophomore,2,I have enough financial aid to cover my classes but for some reason they won't let me apply it to cover my classes so I had to pay a lot out-of-pocket.
College Sophomore,2,Students and teachers/professors brag about using openly.
College Sophomore,2,They make me take medical classes that has nothing to do with my career. My counselor keeps telling me that they're going to remove them but obviously it's too late for me.
College Sophomore,2,"I know multiple people that have had cars broken into, and had personal belongings taken from them. I feel uneasy about parking my car anywhere but the designated parking lots and structures. Since I have been going here there have been at least two armed robberies on campus. It's not the safest place in the world."
College Sophomore,2,The physical education program is bad because they make you take hard classes in the medical school that are in no way going to prepare you for your career.
College Sophomore,2,The night life here at Wayne State University is pretty bad.
College Sophomore,2,Parking always seem to fill up fast during the week. on the weekends it's really not to bad.
College Freshman,2,The nightlife at Wayne State University is pretty bad.
College Freshman,2,Greek Life is in the process of making a full comeback in the coming year.
College Student,2,It was difficult for me to get financial aid because both of my parents work and they are still married.
Senior,1,"this has to be on of the worst schools. the bathrooms never get cleaned, theres rarely any soap or toilet paper  in the bathrooms. This school does not care about its students. i will never recommend it or send any of my kids here. The worst part is how the Wayne state staff does not do their jobs. when you have a problem they just redirect you to a different department and you end up in a loop. If you try calling this school you will be on the phone for 1-2 hours and this isn't because their busy, its because the staff would rather talk to their co-workers bout their day instead of answering the phone and doing their jobs. they also put the worst teachers and teacher with the heaviest accents to teach the most important classes. this school is only good at charging you stupid fees and draining you of your wallet. do yourself a favor and DO NOT go here."
Senior,1,"terrible. teachers are taking advantage of the fact that theres no one to get them in trouble. they're making the exams ridiculously hard. but its Wayne state, you cant complain here. some teachers are understanding but thats only 3% of teachers. do not go to this school."
Junior,1,Terrible place to study. I would never enroll in this school if only it is not near where I live. Everyone in there trying to find a way to get money from students. They treated me like a toy when I went to them for a solution. I had to pay 3067.00 dollars out of my pocket for a mistake they made. I had to borrow money from so many people.
Senior,1,"I have attended WSU for 5 years . WSU is a major institution that does not focus on helping students return.  I have made many pleas to get assistance and it was always  a negative outcome. At Wayne State University, the graduation rate is 39 % within 150% normal time, the retention rate is 82 %, and the transfer-out rate is 38 %."
Niche User,1,"I am in the process of transferring, and every time I call them with questions regarding my application, the person who picks up the phone is rude for some reasons. The people who work at their admission office have to be the worst I have ever had to deal with.  I have talked to the admissions office of different school around the country and the one at Wayne State University is very unprofessional. Adding to the fact that what they say regarding their own policies is either different or inaccurate compared to what you read on their website. They need to either update their website, or the people who work for them. I had my concerns while considering Wayne State University as a possible destination, and their admissions office is making my decision a lot easier."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't live in a dorm due to financial problems, but everyone that lives in dorms talks about how terrible it is. It is so expensive and the dorms are really dirty. I hear that people have problems with the RA's and how unclean everything is."
College Junior,1,They make take all these classes that don't involve your degree and you gene to pay for them
College Junior,1,Nasty and not up to date facilities
College Junior,1,The tuition prices is ridiculous. Room and board is outrageous. And they don't offer enough financial aid to cover everything and the professor ate horrible.
College Senior,1,"WSU does have their own police, however there are a lot of robberies and assault on the actually campus. In the city of Detroit it's a HUGE problem. I would just recommend being with a gropi of people especially during the winter when it starts to get dark a little early. Staying with a group of peopl minimizes your chances on becoming a target. And ALWAYS ALWAYS be aware of your surroundings I don't know how many e mails campus security sends out about being awar of our surroundings and I still witness so many people with their nose glued to their phone screen. But, if you consider these two tips being on campus o believe you will be okay."
College Senior,1,"It's a third division school , most events are free for students. As a student , I rarely attended things but as the school gets bigger and broden its events I think students will begin to get more involved. Allowing for better performance of the teams and raise the school's student spirit ."
College Freshman,1,"Long process, didn't end up receiving any aid in them end."
College Junior,1,It is hard to speak to someone and when you finally do they dont give you any options as if they dont want you to have aid it seems as if they want to tell you to continue paying out of pocket
Recent Alumnus,1,Wayne stated--meaning the Wayne state has royally screwed you over or out of aid.
College Senior,1,I have yet to receive any scholarships
College Junior,1,Not really alot of off campus housing
College Senior,1,"After just experience the record worst winter Detroit has ever had, its safe to say walking to class is terrible."
College Sophomore,1,If you like snow and temperatures below 10° then this is the place for you.
College Sophomore,1,The speed is terrible and it keeps disconnecting your computer from Wi-Fi frequently.
College Sophomore,1,"The strictness in the dorms is crazy, you have to show the card every time you re enter the building, like physically show them. they check the picture to make sure it's you. I think that's overboard."
College Junior,1,"They don't want to give you money. At the most, they will do their very best to give you loans but that is never good. I can't afford it now and I won't be able to afford it later. If you do get financial aid, they will keep it from you as long as possible, lose your paperwork, and royally screw you over."
College Sophomore,1,We need more funds to attend college on these levels since they increased tuition and the finanical aid barley covers any of the costs of classes.
College Junior,1,"Two weeks ago it took me two and a half hours hours to get to school from where I live. Two days ago it took me one and a half hour. Usually it takes me 50 mins to drive to school. So, the local weather affects negatively the campus experience."
College Senior,1,I was a member of a sorority and it was the worst experience ever.  They treated me and my sisters horrific.  I would not recommend this sorority to anyone.
College Senior,1,The parking structures are very expensive and packed. If you want a good parking spot you have to be there an hour early.
College Senior,1,"well the WSU police come to scene too late. usually police wont realized the problem before it occurs. the police are doing their best to help students, my believe they need to be really trained pretty well be for staring their job."
College Senior,1,"the nightlife  at WSU is totally bad. its like living in the zoo or force with out protection from WSU. don't get me wrong WSU does have cameras but they don't like to catch the robberies and the thieves in campus. WSU library at night could be dangerous for a lot of students. example, if you are studying at night at the WSU library by yourself you will face trouble by either a student or non student. instead you concentrate on your study you will be 25% concentrating on who will come and rob you or heat you from behind."
College Senior,1,"facilities are good with students, athletic centers doesn't has all supplies available, student center is about average, libraries are good, green spaces are okay, but campus events and traditions has not been good at WSU. THERE are a lot of thieves and robbers and bad people in campus. the libraries camera's responsible are not working with students to catch the thief. even thought you give the WSU the timing you got rob and the place it took place, they will say we can't show you who stole your items for WSU privacy. another word they are saying they are allowing robbers to steal from students and the help the robbers by not catching them or even show them who stole your items."
College Junior,1,"I am not familiar with any Greek atmosphere on campus especially in the graduate school. I have a couple Greek friends, but that is as far as it goes..."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They are available, but not as good as they could be"
Recent Alumnus,1,HORRIBLE FACILITIES! The school makes so much money and barely does anything to benefit the students. They just charge for every little thing!
College Freshman,1,The weather in Michigan is unpredictable so it's best to be ready for anything.
College Sophomore,1,"Since Wayne state is in Detroit you are safe in the campus. The dorm expenses are expensive and so students decided to live off of campus. However, outside of campus is very dangerous, even though the apartments are cheap in Detroit, the safety is a concern."
College Junior,1,"Parking is terrible. It would be nice if the meter would take our OneCards. The parking enforcement people camp out and wait for your meter to expire. 

If you want to park for free you can park far down on Trumbell or some of the side street but then you have to walk a pretty good ways and be mindful of all the parking signs and fire hydrants."
College Junior,1,Wayne State approved my financial aid. They paid for my classes and deposited the remaining amount to my bank account but then 3 months later I received a email saying they made a mistake and needed ALL of their financial aid back. So I had to come up with 4000 dollars; they were rude. I asked for a payment plan. They said no and told me even though they were the ones who messed up that it was now my problem.
College Freshman,1,Off-campus dining is pretty much nonexistent on the weekends if you don't have a car. If you live on campus you will be starving. You are better off going back to your mom or dads house since you are familar and aware of that area.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid""office"" is reall a desk where everyone can hear your business. Dispursements take forever and fin aid documents are often lost."
College Junior,1,"In the way I look at diversity, which is by thoughts and ideas, not racially, Wayne State is not diverse at all. It's a far left liberal place, and there's absolutely  no welcoming of any ideas that are slightly different. If you're looking for true diversity, you will not find it here!!!"
College Freshman,1,The business department especially the management department is one of the worst i have ever seen.  The professors do not care at all and the classes are extremely boring.
College Freshman,1,not many people use drugs. it they do they use it in their rooms or at parties
College Freshman,1,"I am a resident in Ghafari housing. I stay on the all female floor and I am having continuous problems with my roommate. It has been brought to the attention of the Dean and the Housing Director but they are taking no action. My money from my debit card was spent without me authorizing it, my roommate allows her friends to eat my food, my property has been vandalized and all this has been reported to my resident advisor, the housing director and the Dean and there has been no action taken. I still have the same roommate and the same things are continuously happening. I would not reccomend the fifth floor in Ghafari hall or residential housing in Ghafari Hall period. "
College Freshman,1,"Tuition continues to increase, however the effects are not evident on campus."
College Junior,1,"No Point – We pay way too much for parking! If you can, go to school with free parking, saves you money and time."
College Senior,1,"Expensive and Old – The off-campus living is expensive and all buildings are old. On campus living is twice as expensive but newer. Be careful of landlords looking to rip off new renters. Look around a lot, before signing anything!"
College Junior,1,Language Barrier – I am in information systems management and i am currently finishing up my general requirments. I think the fact that they have professors that you have a very hard time understanding isn't fair. They have an accent and to pay that much money to drop a class because you can't understand them isn't fair. i understand this is america and we have very many opportunities and freedoms however when it comes to teaching students we shouldn't have to fight to understand the teacher when we are already fighting to understand the material.
College Senior,1,"The transportation here is absolutely terrible. There's a shuttle, but it's unreliable."
College Senior,1,This school is in downtown Detroit and it's dangerous.
College Senior,1,Parking permits are expensive and ticketing and fines is ridiculous. The City of Detroit targets parking in that area. It is better to spend money on a parking permit than risk getting fines and possibly towed.
College Senior,1,"Wayne State University is a commuter school, which means that most students live off campus and drive to school. Moreover, the majority of those students who live off campus are also don't live in the city of Detroit, but in neighbors suburbs. Therefore, the campus is almost always empty, specially after 6 P.M. or when it gets dark. The student center as a result lacks activities. The swimming pool is separate from the gym, although I'm not an expert on university's gyms, I find this strange. All of the DVDs that were required in my film class were not available in the libraries when I inquired them. Rarely I would say flyers around campus that promote activities or parties or something like that."
College Junior,1,"Use of drugs are very obvious at Wayne State University. With it being located in one of the most dangerous cities in the United States, obvious use of marijuana and alcohol are probably the most obviously noticed. Also with it being an open campus, many people are on our campus that ask for money for drugs. There is no enforcement that I have seen to stop this activity."
College Sophomore,1,IT's OKAY – IT'S OKAY. THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IS NOT AS ATTRACTIVE. I WITH THE CAMPUS COULD BE A MORE GATED IN SCHOOL.
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid is a pain in the butt. Every time I contacted them via phone, they could not tell me what I needed to know. Then I finally made a few visits to the office in person and they told me too little too late. I ended up with a bunch of late fees because they couldn't tell me what was wrong with my loans and I didn't receive them in time. Overall, it was a terrible experience."
College Senior,1,Its Michigan Winters and Snow Is Horriable – if its not snowing really hard than its bitter cold during the winters. the parking lots are pretty far so its a dreadful winter
College Senior,1,"The parking fees for the parking structures keep raising the prices every year, more than a dollar each year. There arent enough structures on campus that are located in safe, close locations; most of them are halfway across campus in the opposite direction of where you need to be. The parking enforcement does a half and half job of enforcing and not caring where students or public employees park their vehicles"
College Freshman,1,"Personally, its horrible! They do not give a lot of options and the one's available, are not very affordable and those that are, have massive long waiting list. You have a buy $50-100 parking pass each semester. The only positive aspect is the apartments are very close to campus; in walking distance."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is terrible. I only get a good spot because I have a permit for one of the parking structures; all of my friends who don't are always complaining about not being able to find a parking space or getting a parking ticket because they ran out of time on the parking meter but were in class.
College Freshman,1,Nightclubs Downtown – There are a selection of nightclubs downtown but I wouldn't recommend going. There are lots of fights and gang activity found at african american clubs downtown.
College Sophomore,1,The cost of parking goes up every year. It is impossible to park overnight anywhere anywhere unless you have a parking pass. Police give a lot a tickets. The shuttles are unreliable.
College Junior,1,The off-campus housing is not good.  Dangerous for parking cars and walking.  Not in good areas.  Not a lot of it
Recent Alumnus,1,Not So Good – There are very few spots for parking and students are always receiving tickets.

Senior,5,I did not expect to like Rutgers as much as I do. It is a very nice campus and has very nice academics with highly qualified professors. I love the psychology program here.
Junior,5,"I love Rutgers. New Jersey is the best state in the country. Rutgers is the best school in the state. You can literally find anything you are interested in here ( I walked in on the LARPing club in a lecture hall last semester). Late nights with friends at Olde Queens hit different, not to mention 50 cent slices at Olive Branch. Our basketball team would've won the NCAA tournament last year if corona didn't kill the vibe. Yeah, the campus is split into a few sections, but each campus has a different vibe and honestly feels better apart. College ave is by far the best campus and that's where everything happens. Yeah, our football team sucks right now but in four years we are going to be a top team in the Big Ten. Yeah, sometimes you get RU Screwed, but it only helps prepare you for the real world. And all the bullshit Rutgers throws our way during the week we make up for on the weekend (we don't disappoint Jersey in terms of partying). Rutgers is better than your school. Accept it."
Alum,5,Incredible school with top-notch professors and the most diverse study body. I don't regret going there at all.
Alum,5,"Online or in-person, Rutgers professors always delivered the best instruction. I took Comparative Politics online and I don't regret it. Many students took Music Theory online and said they enjoyed their experience."
Senior,5,"I love how I had the opportunity to get a Rutgers NB BSN at the convenient location of my community college (Camden county-backwood campus). Although there have been problems with scheduling or clinical or now COVID, my professors and program director have been extremely informative and compassionate to my and my fellow classmates since the very beginning. Great professors and thorough education!"
Graduate Student,5,"I love Rutgers. Rutgers has multiple campuses with total different look and feels to the campuses which makes it a great experience. I have learned so much from the faculty, and have met long term friends at Rutgers."
Alum,5,Online classes at Rutgers are excellent and professors are always helpful and engaging. Sessions leave students to be well informed in the subjects.
Alum,5,Rutgers is a great school. Some instate high school students tend to dismiss Rutgers and do not realize how great of an education many receive at Rutgers. Rutgers is known all around the U.S and is a well-renowned school. I've traveled a lot throughout the world and have met many people in academia. Most people know of Rutgers and are aware of its many contributions to research and education solutions throughout the world. Great school!
Junior,5,The faculty and professors here are great and they provide a lot of resources to succeed. I haven't had trouble finding a major that I enjoy here and being involved.
Freshman,5,"I liked how they were willing to help students during this hard time. Though times were not easy, Rutgers tried their best to accommodate everyone."
Alum,5,I’ve had many classes online throughout my college experience. Most professors really give you a lot to work with online especially when they pre record lectures or use live video chat classes to convey the material. I personally like the idea of doing work at your own time which online classes let you do more. Most professors I had did an excellent job of giving us online materials that helped us understand and learn concepts for the course. There are many different ways to conduct an online class but I felt pretty much every way a professor conducted it I understood and did well in! I would very much suggest doing online courses at Rutgers
Freshman,5,Rutgers Univeristy has a great campus. When I first stepped into the the building it came me friendly vibes. The people who escorted us were really kind and playful. The campus students were ready to answer any question I had. They described their experience really good and said they mad e a lot of new friends.
Junior,5,I️ am currently enrolled and will be starting my classes online this fall. I️ am very excited to be enrolled in such a big school.
Junior,5,"Rutger's is everyones dream. It is an all in one school. From academics to the party scene, it has it all. Especially, the numerous of programs it has to offer."
Freshman,5,It is a great school and Is a great environment to learn in. The people are nice and they care about the students.
Freshman,5,It is a great school and Is a great environment to learn in. The people are nice and they care about the students.
Senior,5,"Rutgers University- New Brunswick is an incredible school. It offers lots of opportunities for all types of people whether you are into sports, greek life, robotics, nature, foreign languages (etc). There's a place for everyone at this school which makes it so great. Another awesome factor is it's proximity to big cities like New York City, Philadelphia, and Newark which creates a lot of opportunities for jobs and travel. All around great school."
Alum,5,Working through online systems was quite easy. Everything was straightforward and easily accessible.
Freshman,5,I did not take any classes online. I did not take any classes online. I did not take any classes online. I did not take any classes online.
Freshman,5,All good at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. All good at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. All good at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.
Alum,5,"Amazing college life, great students, and amazing guidance. I personally was a commuter, therefore I was not on campus as much. However, I tried to visit the University to experience vast events and programs."
Alum,5,I've always taken advantage of online courses since it is easier to manage than a set schedule. I wish there were more online opportunities because I was commuting for 45 minutes. I definitely would recommend it to anyone.
Sophomore,5,"Although the sudden shift from physical to online classes caught many off guard, Rutgers made sure to create a safe place and flexible schedule for everyone despite their different situations at home. I had 5 classes online this last semester and although it was a bit challenging to work hard. Teachers, other students, organizations, clubs, advising centers and many more made sure to reach out to every student and help them gain their motivation during these times."
Sophomore,5,"Rutgers University is a great fit for me, let me tell you why! Entering college as a first-generation student, a minority, and from poverty was a challenge itself. Thankfully Rutgers offers many and many programs that can help you easily into college easier! For example the EOF Program at Rutgers, which not only helps you financially, it also helps you gain many college experiences before entering. I have also come across many interesting clubs that Rutgers offers, in my opinion, it is hard to feel left out. The many organizations and clubs help students feel more relaxed and enjoy the full college experience while gaining the most valuable education.  Diversity is a very big thing in Rutgers, many different students fit in very different areas, the college itself is very accepting and open to making students feel comfortable as well."
Junior,5,I think Rutgers University offers a wide variety of options in every field possible and a huge diversity of people helps you get settle around the campus very well. The only thing I would like for them to improve is their Bus shuttle system as it needs better planning to make it more convenient for students and less crowded.
Junior,5,"I think during the initial stages due to COVID-19, online classes were a challenge for me as a student and as well as the professors respectively. I think my professors did a great job in reaching out to each other student and making the whole plan clear for the rest of the semester and thankfully it worked and the semester went really smooth for me."
Freshman,5,"I like that Rutgers University provides the student with great professional staff members, who encourage and inspire the students every day, and are a reminder of how successful you can be in the career of your dreams. Rutgers also offers an almost interminable list of resources, where a student can find anything! 
One thing that I would like to change is the bus services, which is very slow and therefore students are sometimes late because of this."
Freshman,5,"My online experience was really good, my professors made every effort to make the students feel safe, and comfortable to be able to continue with our routine. The professors were very understandable and considerate of our situation, always supporting us and reminding us of the importance of being safe to rapidly go back to campus."
Alum,5,Rutgers is one of the most diverse colleges in the world. The environment expands your mind in ways like no other. I also loved that it was it's own mini city. People from other colleges would come to RU for entertainment. It was an amazing experience. I love Rutgers so much.
Junior,5,I am a rising Junior and I love Rutgers. It is such a big and diverse university meaning that there is so much you can do. Students are able to find their find in this school since it is big and diverse.
Junior,5,The professors have been so patient and understanding with the transition to online and I am so grateful for that. The professors have made the transition as easy as they could and I do not complain about it.
Freshman,5,"i love everything about Rutgers University.  The environment there is really clean and beautiful, and the all the teachers I had are so friendly and helpful!"
Freshman,5,"at the beginning, i really thought transition into online learning would be pretty bad just because some professors don't seem like the people who know how to use technology.  However, everything turns out pretty great."
Senior,5,"This university offers everything that you can think of. It's a major school with hundreds of options for study. It's also easy to explore different clubs and associations because there are many available. In terms of academics, the classes are very challenging for students, especially in STEM but the education is completely worth it. There is a huge opportunity to conduct research in any subject that intrigues the student, and an extreme amount of professors/companies to network with."
Graduate Student,5,Online classes at Rutgers are fantastic. They are extremely flexible and have become my preffered way to take graduate classes.
Graduate Student,5,I've been an undergrad student and currently a grad student. I have nothing but the best things to say about Rutgers. It's a fantastics college and I would recommend it to anyone.
Freshman,5,They tried to keep us safe during the pandemic. Gave us the refund on our room and board in a quick manner.
Freshman,5,"Rutgers New Brunswick is really what you make of it, in that way it's very similar to high school. There are thousands of students, relatively good professors, and relatively bad professors. Even though there isn't much going on in the surrounding areas, Rutgers is massive with tons of events. You can have the time of your life here, or waste four years doing nothing."
Sophomore,5,Rutgers is such a unique community filled with life and ideas. People are accepted and feel welcomed no matter their background.
Freshman,5,"Although Rutgers was not my first choice, I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. I have received tremendous support from the EOF family and from many students. Many may be intimidated by Rutger's huge size, but students are very kind and it was very easy to feel welcomed. The school pride is what unites everyone no matter major or any other difference."
Junior,5,Excellent school with amazing opportunity’s first networking! I know that I will be able to get a quality education through Rutgers and will forever benefit from being an alum.
Junior,5,Rutgers has so many resources for students from academic advising to tutoring. The faculty wants to see the students succeed and helps everyone as best as they can.
Senior,5,"Not bad, I have to write 100 words for this scholarship because no money that's why I don't know what to say, nothing bad nothing good, mediocre. Granted I haven't been to other colleges so what's my point of reference? What is other people's point of reference?"
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience at Rutgers has been amazing. I am now in the process of enrolling and the staff and students are extremely helpful with helping me find my way. I plan to major in criminal justice with a minor in finance, as they claim to be flexible with what the individual wants. I cannot wait to start my semester there!"
Alum,5,It's great everyone is cool. like how its close to home and everything in the campus is either walking distance or i could a bus/car.
Niche User,5,I have enjoyed my overall experience at Rutgers University. The professors have been extremely helpful and kind. I enjoy the campus and the many things to do.
Alum,5,"I can only speak from a Veterans point of view, living off campus. 1990, after earning AA at RVCC, I thought I had some advantage. When I got to RU, the people talked differently, dressed differently, acted differently. I went into culture shock. I never had difficulty getting into classes, or GI Bill benefits. I always heard of the proverbial RU screw, but I didn't experience it.  Probably due to my age, mid 20's.  Now that Rutgers is in B1G, it has the likes of Princeton caliber students studying there.  I found therapy while there, going to alcohol studies program which I felt privileged.  My issues were Al-Anon related.  Livingston campus had much to be desired when I was there. But now it's phenomenal with their dorms. Fortunately athletics now has a phenomenal practice facility, whereas prior to, RU athletic facilities were in despair. RU is becoming more and more top shelf.  And it is growing in reputation, character and academics.  I now have two MA degrees."
Sophomore,5,"Rutgers helps you to become an independent adult while still providing an amazing support system. A plethora of courses so you can really find what you like. So glad I came here, even as an out of state student!"
Freshman,5,I love the industrial engineering program! I will be joining in the fall. The class sizes are smaller than most schools and the professors were very informative and engaging. Rutgers also has one of the greatest percentage of women in engineering which was really exciting to see!
Sophomore,5,"I love it here! There is so much to do and learn at Rutgers University. First the location of Rutgeres New Brunswick is in the heart of central jersey with so many work, entertainment and food options. I work at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and the fact that Rutgers is so close to work is an amazing advantage I have of going to school there. The academics are amazing! Rutgers has taught me how to study and how to build a sustainable work ethic that will allow me to work while studing what I love. Rutgers has so many major and minor options, there is something for everyone here!"
Alum,5,"Rutgers University offers a wide variety of majors and courses to develop and fulfill any individual's thirst for knowledge. Located in central NJ, the Jersey shores, NYC, and Philly are very accessible if you wanted to have an adventure for the day or spend a weekend to relax and get away. The campus food was quite impressive, but there were also many options off campus. I loved the diversity and the numerous clubs/organizations to participate as a student and alumni member."
Freshman,5,Rutgers is a welcoming campus that has a huge diversity of people. Their education system is one of the best and the university provides its students with the best resources.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Rutgers. Having 5 different campuses in New Brunswick / Piscataway allows each student to get a unique experience at Rutgers. Each student has a different experience depending on where they live, their major, and their extracurriculars. What is so special is that students intertwine amongst each other, and groups of friends consistently overlap. Rutgers is so diverse, and so many people learn about new cultures, religions, and ethnicities from attending school here. You gain so much more than just an education at Rutgers. Lastly, the professors at Rutgers really care about each student. Professors are extremely diligent in providing one on one assistance whenever needed, and go out of their way to ensure every student feels comfortable with the material. Overall, I could not imagine myself anywhere but Rutgers!"
Alum,5,Outstanding university. Strong academics and very diverse. One of the best values in higher education.
Freshman,5,"I like the amount of opportunities it has to offer as well as the environment around the campus. It is know for being big on research and offering lots of research opportunities. It has a large pre-vet animal science program, with lots of hands on experiences."
Junior,5,"Rutgers was never my dream school but since coming here I’ve fallen in love. With so many different programs, clubs, student organizations and sports teams you will find your best friends and be able to follow your passion."
Niche User,5,I like that Rutgers New Brunswick is very diverse and the campus is aesthetically pleasing. There are many schools within the university and in may fields.
Freshman,5,"I love Rutgers, It is a great University with so many diverse people. The school offers so many opportunities and it is located in a city and just a train ride away from NYC."
Freshman,5,They have a vast number of programs that fit the majority of people. They have many services that can help students during their time at Rutgers. There is a lot of diversity on campus so you can find your group of people rather quickly.
Niche User,5,"Rutgers University has wonderful scenery for as which College Ave makes up the entirety of the university. Everything is located on one big street, which may seem horrendous in the sense that things would be far, yet, shuttles are provided! Wonderful people and wonderful food."
Freshman,4,"This was a great campus with good teachers and academics, I would like more on campus security. Overall, great diversity and a good education."
Freshman,4,"I thought the online experience was pretty good considering the circumstances, we had good professors and a clear timeline on the semester."
Freshman,4,"All my classes are online. It's very weird to watch lectures online and talk to professors through Zoom, but I'm adjusting well to online learning and my professors are overall very nice. They are always willing to help and they are being lenient with the quizzes and exams, everything is open notes so I do not have much difficulty completing them."
Freshman,4,"I love how Rutgers is always willing to help and support their students whether it is academically or financially. With the COVID-19 happening, they are funding students who are financially affected by the current situation and they are always willing to guide students who are struggling with their studies especially due to the fact that everything is remote. I definitely wish that I could be on campus. Experiencing college in-person is totally different from experiencing it through online. It is not as enjoyable and exciting but overall, my first year at Rutgers is good."
Senior,4,It is pretty okay. It is a bit of a challenge but I think it is being handled well. The thing I miss most is the on-campus experience and student life.
Freshman,4,"I like that Rutgers offers a wide variety of clubs and organizations, which allow for students to be involved in anything they are interested in. Rutgers also has a lot of support for students. This includes tutoring and other services for students. All the student services are open as well. So, it is easy to get any assistance that a student may need. This is great for any questions or concerns regarding academics that one may have. I like that the Rutgers New Brunswick Campuses are open. Its always nice to go there and hang out."
Sophomore,4,I took some classes online and most professors were accomodating of the situation. It shouldn't be a problem to take online classes at Rutgers.
Junior,4,Mason Gross School of the Arts is a wonderful learning environment. I've grown so much as an artist over the past three years.
Junior,4,"During the COVID era, the environment of rutgers has been challenging. I am happy with the effort my professors are putting forth."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Rutgers has been amazing. The atmosphere is welcoming and inviting. I have met incredible people through the events and clubs that are held at Rutgers. Genuinely, I made the best decision coming here."
Sophomore,4,I have taken several online classes and the overall structures of my classes have been organized. Rutgers did a great job preparing the professors for the transition to remote learning due to COVID restrictions.
Senior,4,Online classes have been difficult. My professors usually posted all their powerpoints anyway but still held live lecture through Webex meetings. This allowed us to get immediate answers to questions and see one another as well which was nice. Yes there have been technical difficulties here and there but professors adapted and have been understanding and compassionate as well.
Sophomore,4,I liked Rutgers Unviersity because I got to find communities and friends that made freshman year a little more bearable than I would have thought of. I would like to see the bus system changed. Sometimes the drivers take longer breaks than usual and this could make students be late to their classes.
Graduate Student,4,"Rutgers did its best given the current circumstance. Overall, I think the online learning experience was good."
Sophomore,4,"Rutgers has been a great overall experience, and I am excited to be on campus once online classes finish along with the COVID-19 pandemic."
Sophomore,4,"The staff have been very helpful and supportive, even though online classes have not yet began. While registering for classes and beginning my transition to Rutgers, everyone I have talked to has been more than eager to help."
Junior,4,"Honestly, I am just an incoming transfer student at Rutgers. The following fall semester will be my first one to attend. Even though I have not met any teachers or advisors personally or face-to-face, they have been very helpful and kind to me, whether the matter was related to registering for classes, keeping up with the events at college, advising about various majors to consider, or transitioning from one college to another."
Junior,4,It wasn't horrible doing online learning. I honestly ended up doing better in my classes because I had a lot more time on my hands. I do hope more classes will be live in the fall rather than recorded or just postings.
Freshman,4,Most of my orientations were online. I say that the professors and students tried their best to make this experience as easy and enjoyable as possible.
Alum,4,"There was a lot to do at Rutgers, a lot of clubs, courses and amenities. The school’s size was an advantage and disadvantage at times but it really depends on one’s preference. I personally liked that there were so many people to interact with. RU should improve on their prices for dorms since it’s way too expensive for what you’re getting. Also tuition is raised every year for seemingly no reason, defund football they aren’t doing well anyways. I would like more money to be put towards things that benefit the students, so better living conditions, activities everyone can participate in, and better functioning classroom amenities. Overall good school, lots to do, I personally have an issue with allocation of funds."
Freshman,4,"I have not started learning anything yet, but the way they send out emails to us regarding the online schooling is amazing."
Junior,4,I had to take classes online due to COVID-19 and all my professors where very nice about the situation. My favorite type of online learning is when professors would post recorded lectures so I could manage my day better. I must say it was annoying when my computer crashed during an exam or when I couldn't log into class because my professor accidentally locked it. It was an experience to say the least but it wasn't a nightmare.
Junior,4,Rutgers is nothing like any other school out there. It is a school so big that it carries so much potential for every student since it has everything a person could want. Youre basically a commuter since you live on one campus but have to take different buses to get to the other campuses. I find myself never bored here at Rutgers.
Junior,4,My experience has been well. Even though the surrounding areas of the campuses are somewhat dangerous you always feel safe on campus.
Sophomore,4,"My Rutgers experience online has been interesting due to the fast adjustment of many classes due to COVID-19. My professors seem to be doing the best they can, but it is still hard for everyone overall. Rutgers itself has been pretty accomodating accept with a couple of things, but that can be expected at all universities."
Sophomore,4,"Rutgers is a great school that has so much to offer. There are multiple paths academically available to all students. The staff throughout the many campuses are generally nice. It is a diverse school with so much to do during the week and on weekends. A lot of people are nervous about the buses at first and getting to class. Students are very helpful in aiding other students in all areas of Rutgers questions and especially when it comes to the bus. After learning a routine, you are good to go and you will learn the buses so fast as well as the rest of the schools culture. I wouldn't trade Rutgers for anything. I am so happy I made the decision to go to this school."
Freshman,4,"There are definitely fewer chances to have discussions and Q&A compared to in-person learning, but most of the professors are really trying to make online experiences as good as in-person experiences."
Freshman,4,"I'm glad to be a student at Rutgers University. I think it is pretty cool for students who attend class via school buses since college is huge. As an international student, I do not feel lonely here since school policy is very kind to us, so I can make friends across different nationalities. The quality of philosophy class here is excellent, no matter metaphysics or philosophy of law. According to this, I think some classes related to philosophy are difficult but worth to take. You can learn a different world or think differently in these classes."
Junior,4,"Rutgers New Brunswick is a very nice college. It has an impressive campus, students, sports teams, and so much more. The campus is like its own little town, with so many people that come from all around the world. There is so much diversity, and so many different mindsets and personalities that come from so many different people. There are buses that take you from campus to campus, at many different times of the day. They have their own health center for students to go to whenever they get injured or sick. They also give students the opportunity to be flexible with their lives on campus. They have multiple housing options, parking spots, and meal plans. They even have their very own movie theatre, that students get discounted tickets to, and as well as their own stadium, where students get free admission to the games.  Rutgers University New Brunswick is the school for me."
Alum,4,"I'll start by saying that Rutgers enables you to experience the hard knocks of being a student. New Brunswick is a rather old and dirty city, with some crime from time-to-time. You won't find yourself living in the best off-campus housing, but it humbles you. The bar scene is average, but there's MUCH potential. The education itself is exceptional if you try and apply yourself. It's proximity to places like New York City, Hoboken, Princeton, and Philadelphia really can't be beaten. So much to explore if you're not staying in NB. Rutger's sports haven't been the best in recent years, but if you're a sports junkie like me you'll realize they're a few years away from being exceptional in the big sports."
Senior,4,I took online classes once the COVID-19 pandemic started. My professors were very accommodating when it came to making sure we were provided all the material and that we understood it. The lectures were uploaded with voice recordings so that if we missed something then we were able to stop and rewind the video. They also held review sessions and additional office hours to make sure that we had chances to ask questions because online instruction might not be efficient to some people compared to in person. They also answered very promptly to emails that were sent as things felt a little bit rushed during online classes.
Senior,4,"I like how diverse this university is. You get to meet people from all over the world with different backgrounds and also meet some people surprisingly similar to you. I got to meet some of my best friends in college just because of the clubs that Rutgers offered. College Ave has so many restaurants that you can choose from even when you don't have a car. I had a lot of fun just hanging out with my friends or going to the clubs together whenever we had a free night. The surrounding town, Edison, also had so much variety of foods and thats what I'll be missing most when I head off to graduate school."
Sophomore,4,My professors accommodated very well to all of their students. They posted pre-recorded lectures so we could learn at our own pace and were more lenient on assignment deadlines to better accommodate us during these times. I also received a lot of support from my professors and felt they helped me through the ongoing stress I was faced with.
Sophomore,4,"At Rutgers I have been able to meet and connect with people of all different backgrounds that I wouldn't have in any other situation. There are unlimited opportunities and great experiences. There are so many different classes and majors to help students find what fits best for them. It offers a place for everyone. I enjoy going to a big school that can also be small with the separated campuses. I am grateful for having the opportunity to attend a university that fits me so well. However, it has been hard to get enough financial aid and the housing lottery can be stressful. I would have a better experience if they could better improve these aspects."
Freshman,4,"Rutgers University is very diverse, giving students the opportunity to meet different types of individuals. It also offers a wide variety of clubs and ways to get involved in smaller communities in such a large school. Something I would like to see change is the safety and security on campus. My building and other residence halls I've been to do not have someone sitting at the front desk at all times. Therefore, making it very easy for people that do not live in the building or aren't even from Rutgers to get into the buildings."
Freshman,4,"I took all my spring semester classes online due to COVID-19. All my professors constantly made an effort to reach out to the students and always offered help. Some of my professors did a voiceover on the powerpoint, allowing us to access all the presentations just as we would have in class. Others did class conference calls, which allowed us to still interact with our classmates."
Senior,4,Professors acted quickly and put their best efforts forward in order to transition from in person to online classes. Some teachers provided some leniency and the overall structure for most of my classes continued the same.
Sophomore,4,Online experience was better in many ways because of the lack of commute problems and overcrowding. Some math and CS departmen teachers though were VERY disorganized and unfriendly in this time! They made schoolwork and examinations 10x harder than they need to be in the online format!
Sophomore,4,Online learning has mostly been better because of the lack of comute issues and crowded buses etc. Math department teachers however made testing ALOT harder and stressed students out alot more!
Alum,4,I only took one class online and it was a science intro course. The professor taught other courses on campus so they had office hours where you could make an appointment. The exams were also in person or by way of a remote proctor.
Alum,4,"This university is known for their research and academia. They have classes that  will challenge you intellectually and prepare you for whatever career path you're going to take. They also have a lot of research opportunities for students. Come to this school with an open mind and network like your future depends on it because it does. The professors are there and willing to provide extra help. Form study groups and make friends in your classes and you'll be fine. I enjoyed going to all the on campus activities and joining different organizations. One definitely needs a non-academic outlet to relax, unwind and meet more people. If I had to do it over again I would attend more events and volunteer more. There is food everywhere and upperclassman housing is very nice. If you don't have a car, you can still get around on campus by way of bus or if you need to leave the state, you can take the train. Overall I don't regret going to this school and would do it again given the opportunity."
Freshman,4,It was hard at the beginning but got easier as the time went on. Teachers were great. Hope we can go back to school this fall.
Alum,4,"Considering it was about 6 years ago, the online classes were pretty good. There were discussions and the professors were engaged."
Alum,4,"Rutgers was a very good school, there was something for everyone and it really opened up my mind about what college was. I truly wish I had taken advantage of all the opportunities it offered. But because I was there I got to work with NIEER and it was incredible for my career."
Freshman,4,"I took a couple of classes online. The school provides ample resources for everything, so you really have no excuse not to succeed, even in online courses. Professors are very accommodating, and some are true gems."
Sophomore,4,The thing I love the most about Rutgers is that the different clubs and activities they offer. I loved being a part of the WRSU and it's amazing team. Looking forward to joining more clubs once we get back on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I took online classes during the quarantine and my professors took it very well. For physics my professor replaced two exams with vigorous labs that tested what we were learning about. Additionally, my nutrition and health teacher uploaded various lecture online and we had open note exams."
Niche User,4,Rutgers is a popular and affordable state school. There are many extracurricular organizations to choose from and a place for every person to fit in. The professors are easily accessible and willing to adapt to the restrictions put on them due to the pandemic.
Sophomore,4,"I feel like a lot of students give the school a bad review when talking about the aspects of it, but I feel the school really does a lot of the best things it can for its students."
Freshman,4,It's a great vibe and very well known. The networking is insane as they have so many affiliations and tools for students!
Freshman,4,"Rutgers is very big but the community makes you feel at home even if you're quiet and shy. Academics are pretty good and there's a lot of cutting-edge research done by many professors. Some of them may lack in being able to teach, but most of them are super nice. The food in the dining halls could be better but the food trucks are super good. Dorm halls has its ups and downs, but for the most part, you should be fine."
Freshman,4,"Growing up in Bergen County, New Jersey, I was always drawn to the towering buildings of New York  City and the bustling, ""the city that never sleeps,"" attitude. When began my college experience at Rutgers University, I wasn't met with the tall skyscrapers I had pined for, but I certainly experienced the hustle and bustle of walking through campus filled with over 40,000 students. My only complaint concerning Rutgers University- New Brunswick would have to be about the lack of modern dorms that can be seen on other college campuses. Regardless, the academic rigor and passion of my many Mathematics and Economics professors certainly made up for this small fault."
Senior,4,"Awesome school, great diversity, great community and fitting campuses. This school allows you to experience the college lifestyle that you desire. This school is literally big enough to have the college dream life that you wanted. The school provides great academics for those interested in pursuing higher learning. Or if you still want a degree to just graduate, there are majors and a great community for you to join that will allow you to have the dream college experience that you want. The only bad side is that the school is TOO big. It is hard for your opinion to be heard because of the sheer amount of people, but it is not impossible. If you work hard enough to make yourself known it is possible."
Senior,4,"Rutgers is a great and prestigious school that has provided the best possible education I could receive. While the school is challenging, the professors are devoted to genuinely teaching the subject of the class you are attending. It is difficult to move around the campuses since the school is large and requires a bus to move from campus to campus."
Niche User,4,"Great University,and various programs for students to choose from. Also great location areas for students and employees."
Freshman,4,Rutgers University has many food options. I love the nature of this campus with a lot of diversity. There are many dorms on each campus.
Sophomore,4,"I go to Mason Gross and there are a lot of opportunities there from the computer labs, to the different electives, to the guest speakers."
Sophomore,4,My experience has been so great due to the friends I have chose to surround myself with and my amazing professors. I am a linguistic major and I could rave about the department all day. Rutgers itself is cheap and too much money is allocated to the athletic department.
Sophomore,4,I love the school but the area itself is just very sketchy. Often times I fear walking alone. My friends houses have been broken into. Join a club if you arent going to rush it is the best way to make friends.
Alum,4,"I liked the big, state university feel along with the exposure to all kinds of people different from myself.  My professors were a mixed bag in regards to their ability to teach without sounding condescending.  As a research institution. Rutgers University prides its faculty to push the frontier in their field of study, and sometimes teaching feels like an additional duty.  The dining halls were all good, and the bus system is well-organized.  The party scene is good, lots of fraternities on campus.  Also, there a lots of house parties if the fraternity scene isn't your cup of tea.  The Rutgers name lives up to the slogan, ""Jersey roots, global reach"".  A lot of employers know the name and it is well respected.  They've turned down invitations to the ivy league on multiple occassions to remain a public institution.  Yeah, depending on your major, the education is that good."
Junior,2,Online courses are fine but some professors will not accommodate date for certain situations. Other than that it is just like being in the classroom.
Freshman,2,"Due to coronavirus, I have to take online class after Spring Break. It is tough for me since there are so many factors distracting. Many professors who teach us so well in-class cannot adjust online. Hence I do not want to take online classes again."
Senior,2,"With online platforms, classes are basically do-it-yourself. The professors are there to give the material, but don’t do much for structure and they do not answer questions effectively. While it may be easier to take classes on your own time, it is not easier to learn from reading powerpoints. Most of the time, students will end up using google anyways to get their answers."
Freshman,2,I did not like how big the University was. I figured out this type of college experience is not for me. Also I disliked the location very much. There is no
Freshman,2,"To be honest you can tell how much of a scam college is by attending Rutgers. You can tell they grab money from you at every possible opportunity and all that money doesn't actually go to funding programs for students. For example, the infrastructure at the school is awful, the transportation they provide is absolute garbage, and while there's a few professors I like, a lot of them are complete trash and some can barely even speak English.  Meanwhile, they decided to hire out a helicopter to fly the football coach to the middle of a campus for no reason, and are paying him a few million dollars to lead a football team that hasn't had a .500 record in a decade."
Junior,2,"They do not pay attention to their students. Very overpriced, they love screwing you over and overcharging you. Terrible social culture as well."
Niche User,2,"Rutgers is a good school if you want overly packed classrooms and teachers who will barely remember you. This school makes you feel like a number, and since the school is so big, your concerns will barely be heard. It takes forever for the administration to get back to you, but if you're willing to put up with that go for it."
Sophomore,2,"Professors are a either by the book specific, or strays very far from the book. The students are too loud, even if it is late at night. The RA's are not very good at being attentive to the noise levels in the halls, and the administration are money hungry or lazy. The academic services gives out horrible advice, and some of the professors are outrageous with their demands."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not know much about Greek life on campus, but from what I have heard, despite the pledge not to haze, many fraternities and sororities still do so. I do not take part in much of Greek life, but it is prevalent on several campuses."
College Sophomore,2,School spends too much money on athletics.
College Junior,2,I get crime alerts all of the time. I feel safe during the day.
College Freshman,2,Not a great experience. A lot of the teachers don't care if you pass or fail. If you have personal problems or medical problems they give you an extremely hard time especially when you are falling behind on class work and homework. Once you fall behind it is difficult to catch up. It is not all bad because they do have people that try to help you but it most likely will not work out.
College Junior,2,"The campus is open to the public. This increase the safety risk on campus. The school updates us about suspected crimes, incidents, and health risks so we can better prepare ourselves."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a fan of Greek life and, frankly, I don't care about it. They're campus annoyances."
College Freshman,2,"I get a crime alert on my phone almost daily, and my roommate and friends were victims of crime this year. There is gun violence, knife violence, and assault on a regular basis."
College Sophomore,2,"They do not give fair housing to everyone. I understand there are many students, however we all should have equal housing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Housing is only guaranteed freshman year, all other years are lottery system and very difficult."
College Freshman,2,Rutgers housing is hit or miss. A person can live in one of the nicest apartments they will ever live in or one the oldest and grossest hall in the country. If you do not live in a apartment at Rutgers almost everything else is not worth it.
College Freshman,2,We are only good at certain sports but we throw all our money at football.
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to get housing
College Junior,2,My personal experience freshman year in a dorm was bad. My RA did not care at all and would not even be there for fire drills or if someone was locked out of the room. She never made any efforts to help us get to know everyone in the house and was not helpful at all.
College Sophomore,2,"The athletics in my school are lacking. We have major programs that cost the university a lot of money, but our school's performance is horrible."
College Sophomore,2,Too much money is put into football.  How about lowering tuition!!!
College Junior,2,"I receive crime alerts everyday of someone being mugged or a house being broken into near campus. There is a large police presence, but not during breaks when there are still many students living off campus (off campus is basically on campus). Also, during finals when the libraries are open 24/7 around 3 AM there are no signs of police or public safety even though many student are walking home."
College Junior,2,"I am a student not very fond of the Greek life. In Rutgers, the College Ave campus is just full of Greek life students. The experiences I had with some of the students are not too great."
College Freshman,2,Crime happens almost always on College Ave but the other four campuses are pretty safe
College Freshman,2,"Players arrested, coach and AD fired, the team performed badly this year."
College Junior,2,I got placed on a campus the furthest away from my classes with a tiny room with the smallest bathrooms I think a broom closet was bigger than the bathroom the carpets were dark but when I would wear white socks they would turn black and there is no air and the heat is always on way too high. Way over priced not worth it at all
College Sophomore,2,We get crime alerts almost everyday on campus and a lot of them are near dorms or apartments housing students. This makes me feel very uneasy and so I dont go out on my own when its late at night but the school police department is very quick to respond to any security concerns we have.
College Senior,2,The school is too big to accommodate students and see each individual as someone more than a number. Students are easily overlooked and professors in certain departments are unconcerned with student success and they only teach because they're pursuing research at the university.
College Sophomore,2,"They pick and choose who to deal with and who not to deal with. This school is known for its diversity however, certain minority groups are not given as much help as others."
College Freshman,2,I haven't been to a real party yet . It is  important to be very careful at parties.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is such a scam! Rockoff Hall charges $1000 per person to sleep in the same room. Its absurd. Other apartments charge an absurd amount per person utilities not included nor furniture. Rockoff might be the best option but the landlords are very sketchy and give off a con artist vibe. I do not trust them, not at all."
College Sophomore,2,"It's not that the financial aid process was terrible, but my dad recently losing his job, and now he has to take care of another sibing coming to Rutgers, and two other siblings who are significantly younger... It is not that we are not able to afford this university, but it is a lot of hard work from my dad's end to find a new job and be able to afford college for the future siblings when they 're going to college... So any amount of money we can get (which isn't a lot from financial aid) would be helpful"
College Junior,2,"The plans are a jip, if you buy too much you do not get a refund/do not have the meals roll over. If you buy a small meal plan it is very expensive to add more meals. Also, the food in the common areas sit around if not eaten."
College Freshman,2,"The people who party can make the dorm a very loud place for those who sleep early, prefer quiet, or don't go to parties themselves."
College Freshman,2,I did not receive any aid but I do still need it.
College Freshman,2,I had to go through a lot for the financial aid office to provide me with the best assistance
College Freshman,2,I wish i went somewhere else
College Freshman,2,Brower commons serves the most disgusting food in Rutgers University.
College Senior,2,"I wish they weren't so stingy. Many people I'm friends with had issues with financial aid, in which they charged them for strange things, and they sometimes they don't give enough."
College Freshman,2,"Walking on College Ave, especially at night, is a bit scary. I think this fear is mostly psychosomatic because of all the crime alerts we get about armed robberies and criminal sexual contact. I really wish they would make the libraries more off-limits to non-students. Homeless people and general creeps are especially found in the library on College Ave. I hate feeling like I can't go to late night club meetings on College Ave because something might happen. I would also definitely say there is poor lighting on all of the campuses; it gets very dark."
College Junior,2,I don't seem to see nor find the type of men that I'm interested on campus. They are some attractive guys and they dress normally (casual).
College Freshman,2,"I ended up having a lot of difficulty with my roommate. I tried to have my friend switch, but the resident assistant is taking a very long time to reply."
College Freshman,2,check your term bill once in a while cuz they will not give you emails if you have missing papers or owe money which becomes a big hassle especially for out of state kids
College Freshman,2,"Many of the rooms have asbestos, the heaters don't work, the showers are cold, the walls and ceiling have damage and are pealing, the windows don't shut entirely. The living conditions are bad and not worth the amount that it costs, but the dorm advisors are good."
College Sophomore,2,Some students go off campus after their freshman and most are off after their sophomore year.  Many go off because of the added freedom while some may go off simply because they weren't offered on-campus housing. The cost of living is generally the same as living on campus.  The quality of most off campus housing is pretty poor and is definitely not worth the price tag attached to them. Many projects have been started to create higher quality off campus housing but have increased the cost of living in some parts to an almost unaffordable amount for most students.
College Sophomore,2,"Rutgers is not exactly located in the safest area. The area of New Brunswick between the College Ave and Douglass campuses be pretty dangerous on most nights.  Although the Rutgers University Police Department and the New Brunswick Police Department have been more diligent with their surveillance recently, crime alerts about robberies, burglaries, and muggings are not uncommon."
College Sophomore,2,"It seems that Rutgers administration is stepping into something left and right. Every decision has become pretty controversial one way or the other, bringing negative attention to the school..  Campus police does crack down, and does a great job of keeping a seemingly uncontrollable party scene relatively tame. But there are fewer people disliked more than the parking association; they will write you up a nice fat parking ticket two minutes after you walk away from your car."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing system at Rutgers is pretty tricky after your freshman year.. You're not guaranteed housing after your first year. If you get a high lottery number, you better start looking for off campus housing. If not, be ready to spend a lot of time arguing and complaining to the housing association until they put you somewhere."
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are horrible I had to switch to commuting, live off campus if you can"
College Freshman,2,The school is too big to give lots of scholarships or aid
College Freshman,2,I am vegetarian and try to eat healthy and it's impossible. I usually just bring my own food.
College Sophomore,2,Heavy workload for a school who has easy requirements to get in.
College Sophomore,2,"The few is pretty bad, although a lot of students eat it. I would say to eat off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Hardly any good looking guys, I mean almost none, however the TAs are usually decent."
College Sophomore,2,"Hate the administration, easy to get in for admission just have to have a good gpa/sat scores. However, once actually attending, you will experience something called the RUScrew, which is unpleasant to be nice."
College Freshman,2,"I had trouble with the financial aid process because on my final balance it stated that I received financial aid so we paid the total amount after that had been taken out. About a month later, they email me stating that I owed that money again so I had to pay them. It was such a hassle and I should have gotten the financial aid for this semester."
College Junior,2,The dorms are very small. Not enough space.
College Junior,2,"The football team has a lot of fans, but every other varsity sport have only a small fan base. The Girl's soccer team is one of the best in the nation, but barely anyone shows up to the games."
Junior,1,"Rutgers University financial aid is the worst.  This semester they completely took away government sub/ unsub loan b'cos my parent's tax did not match up and her income seems to be 7k over than their calculation! Really it's one thing if her tax is under since we may possibly get more but it is over.  They put my account on hold though 70% of the bill was paid off and we were waiting for gov loan to be cleared.  Not sure why the people who work there have to be so anal, so by the book making it difficult for students to sign up for classes / go to school!! Don't contact me after my graduation asking for money as my answer will be a no as should most of your alumni. In NJ we pay a ton  of taxes, tuition should be much lower with better management!!!"
Graduate Student,1,"Terrible experience at Rutgers as a graduate student here. Professors are not helpful and supportive at all. Department staffs are not friendly. The department hires a lot of part time lecturer as course instructor, and on-campus courses are limited (most of them are online courses). Terrible learning experience.
The campuses are too big, and not walkable. You either HAVE to buy a car or make friends who can get you a ride. Even if you buy a car, you still need to take the bus because you can only park in one spot, which means if you have classes in multiple campus you have take the bus. The graduate student dorm is fine, no complaint. Food is affordable if you go to faculty dining hall.
Overall, the academic is ok, but the learning experience is terrible. It seems like the school doesn't care about the teaching ability when they hire faculty member. All they care about is research."
Niche User,1,"Look elsewhere if you want a quality education. Professors are not good, housing is horrible. Overpriced. More concerned with good-looking statistics, athletics, and school image than giving students their money's worth. Don't be RU-Screwed."
Niche User,1,"A bunch of sensitive children, being taught how to he weak and sensitive, by weak and sensitive professors"
Freshman,1,"Rutgers does not care about people and their futures. They are rude and do not answer back when you have a question and or need help with something. They do not try and help you on your path to success. I know people who are in the military with good grades and they wont accept them yet they will bring in ""ex-offenders navigating recovery and a life beyond bars."" I do not recommend Rutgers."
Sophomore,1,"Here you're not a student, you're a number. Advisors both don't care or understand ways to help students, professors seldom know how to properly teach a class, there is a slew of unnecessary classes for each major, the bus system is atrocious, the party scene has become abysmal in the last few years with Dean A trying to ban greek life entirely. There are no more house parties and most frat parties are stuffed in disgusting basements and busted too quickly."
College Sophomore,1,"Housing on campus is poor. Many dorms do not have air conditioning or heating. Those that do are controlled by a central system. Bathrooms have no ventilation. Students are loud and disrespectful of sleeping times. Rules and regulations are rarely enforced. The Rutgers department that handles room swaps and room transfers are incompetent in doing their jobs. I applied for a room transfer last December and never got a response. I also applied for room swaps, none of which were enforced. After the second room swap failed, Rutgers made several mistakes in correcting their records. This mistake could potentially have incurred additional, unjustified charges on my bill, as the other party I was trying to swap with was known to be disorderly, careless and not well-liked, increasing the chance that damage had been done to the room. I do not intend to live on campus again."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not good at all. The housing situation has it's up's and downs. Either you love it or you hate it. Most students typically dislike their dorms, they claim it as being too small. Also the lottery system is not so favorable."
College Sophomore,1,Courses are very difficult and professors don't help enough to succeed in class.
College Sophomore,1,"campus crime has a horrible rate. get crime alerts of robbing, sexual assault every single day. drugs and cases of rape fill the dorms. the faculty pretend to do a lot while actually not doing anything."
College Sophomore,1,"revolved around bullying, hazing, accusations of rape, sexism, alcohol and drug abuse. should definitely be eliminated to save the future of this university."
College Sophomore,1,"the athletic teams take all the money which should go to other facilities and financial aid, and regular non-athlete students have to settle for smelly and busy gyms only."
College Freshman,1,Where is the money going?
College Sophomore,1,meal swipes should be able to be used at the student activities center as well as other mini marts
College Sophomore,1,the parking tickets will never get old here at rutgers!
College Sophomore,1,I need much more aid than what I get and the financial aid office is never of any help. Last year I didn't get my aid for fall semester (due in August) until the following April.
College Freshman,1,"I don't find it 100% fair that with parents who are making decent money that still isn't enough, determines my getting no financial aid."
College Senior,1,The houses are disgusting and the landlords are monsters.
College Junior,1,This new policy in which students must have a roommate in order to apply for housing is poor and shows a lack of interest in student need.
College Freshman,1,People going crazy all over.
College Freshman,1,The off campus housing is very limited
College Freshman,1,Be patience and make sure you communicate well with someone who knows how to deal with financial paperwork.
College Freshman,1,"The parties are great but compared to other schools, it can be way better."
College Freshman,1,rooms are small and there are high chances you will get stuck in an international dorm.  Hard to make as many friends if not on college ave campus.
College Freshman,1,I was accepted to the school after the scholarship deadline had passed
College Freshman,1,"I can only think of Halloween. Police and ambulances rushing everywhere, hospitals overflowing with alcohol poisoned students, buses's windows being smashed by drunkards, muggings in once safe places, everyone on every campus bombarding buses and streets trying to get into a frat party... The buses still run with the broken windows."
College Sophomore,1,"They suck. Because there are so many students, there's rarely any personal student attention and it's really bad if you have an issue"
College Sophomore,1,We get crime reports almost everyday. It's dirty and their always construction. It's also very freaking expensive to live there.
College Freshman,1,Horrible food especially if you are vegetarian
College Senior,1,"Rutgers is the worst school. It's so expensive, extremely exclusive about who they give aid to, and give you a hard time in the process. Not to mention it's like winning the lottery if you actually get to speak to a representative when you call."
College Sophomore,1,I don't feel safe leaving the campus very low class people living around the school
College Sophomore,1,The parking permits are absolutely ridiculous in cost and in access. Each permit costs about $200 and only allows you to park in one lot on one campus. If you park anywhere outside of that lot you will get a very pricey ticket.
College Junior,1,Limited housing available and most commute.
College Freshman,1,"I am commuting from Union City NJ. I have tried to look for the best option to get to school but I found nothing except driving. In order to get to College Avenue Campus I would have to take at least 3 buses or 2 buses and 1 train. It is extremely expensive and I have no choice but using my car which also costs me 20 dollars back and forth each time I to go to school.

I would love to have a bus that I could board somewhere here in Union City and would drop me off in New Brunswick, but even from New York City there is no direct bus to New Brunswick! Public transportation is just terrible and expensive in the United States. People are forced to use cars."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Rutgers is notorious for its parking! The amount of money made on parking tickets is unbelievable and even the faculty, staff, and volunteers need to pay about $200 per year!"
College Senior,1,"They ticket you for everything. there are no spaces unless you are really early or don't mind a mile walk to the nearest stop. You have so many limitations and the tickets are outrageous. The cost of a permit is also ridiculous, and the popular ones sell out fast. You pay for the entire year but may only be using it for 1/3 of the time. they don't shovel the snow and let it build up dangerously, no salt either, so bring ice hiking boots. they also don't stop ticketing at any hours of the day-- you can get a ticket at 11pm."
College Senior,1,"Too much money spent on the football team-- not even all the athletics, instead of being spent on students. New stadium? well that's great we still have dilapidated buses and health hazard buildings."
College Junior,1,parking is HORRIBLE. 75 dollar ticket each offense
College Sophomore,1,"It snowed entirely too much this winter, which resulted in a lot of cancelled classes and a lot of hassle getting anywhere."
College Junior,1,Sometimes the bus stops are not sufficient for shelter.
College Sophomore,1,I don't like the bus system at rutgers
College Sophomore,1,Rutgers pd always ends up ticketing everyone. They make so much money off of rutgers students
College Sophomore,1,Last week on the first day of spring semester it snowed and the buses stopped running. I then had to walk from one campus to another because the bus just didn't show up even though it should have been running after 3 pm
College Sophomore,1,"I have a big family, with three other siblings, and my father is the only one that works, but yet I do not receive and money at all. "
Recent Alumnus,1,Snow and rain are your worst enemies here since walking is a huge part of being here. Everybody will push and shove to get on the busses on cold and wet days.
College Freshman,1,I received no financial aid and it is extremely difficult for me to pay for my tuition.
College Sophomore,1,"They moved our famous grease  trucks (phat sandwiches) so far away. Not near anything and they won't even give these guys electricity!! Shame, shame, shame"
College Senior,1,Permit costs are expensive and it is not uncommon that all the spots are filled up forcing students to park elsewhere (which usually results in a 75 dollar ticket)
College Junior,1,"I absolutely HATE the parking situation at Rutgers New Brunswick.  The NBPA (New Brunswick Parking Association) is relentless on handing out tickets to those who violate the Ward parking rules and failure to show a parking permit.  Each time you get a ticket its $32.00 coming out of, already broke college student's pockets.  Though you do not need a car on campus, it really is convenient to have one but at what expense?  If you do not have a parking permit for specific lots on campus expect to rack up $100's in fines before the school year is over which will have a negative effect on your ability to register for classes or even graduate.  One positive thing out of all of this is the efficiency in which the buses run.  Rutgers does have a great bus system that will get you where you need to go, on time, if you plan accordingly.  I have never had anything to say about the bus system."
College Sophomore,1,"You can do whatever you want, whenever you want here. I am giving it a D because this is a rating based off ""saftey"". HOWEVER, this is how you really want it to be at college. Whatever you are looking for it you can find at Rutgers. Alcohol is easy to get, just find someone who is 21, and drugs may be even easier. This does not mean that everyone is drunk or high all the time, it just means you can have fun and not have to worry about getting in trouble for it."
College Senior,1,"Hard to find parking, but you'll usually find a spot -- though it may be far.  Plus, the cost for a permit is rather expensive."
College Junior,1,Most off-campus housing is in very poor condition and the landlords are usually mean.
College Junior,1,"The drug scene at Rutgers University is somewhat alarming. On the day to day it is not in your face obvious, but on campus drugs can be easily accessed anytime of day or night."
College Junior,1,"Rutgers parking is an abomination. You pay money for a parking pass and they only give you ONE lot on ONE campus to park in. You park anywhere else, you will have a ticket waiting for you when you get back."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are considering having a car on-campus I would highly suggest you do not! The amount of money you have to pay for selective permit parking on certain campuses is ridiculous and you are inevitable to rack up parking tickets throughout the school year. Campus officers will find the smallest thing to ticket you for and believe me, they are far from cheap tickets!"
College Senior,1,"When I attended orientation, they specifically told people to plan to take the buses. There is not enough parking to drive around to each class so people have to purchase a parking pass for one campus. I do not drive and I am glad I do not have to worry. I hear complaints often."
College Student,1,its awful! RUPD will ticket any car that even looks like it doesn't belong. But seriously they are very strict about decals and permits. They are usually more lax on the weekends but its still possible to get that $75 ticket. Parking lots are limited to faculty most with some specifically designated for commuters and visitors. On the street parking on College Ave is metered. Residential parking often requires placing your car on a different campus where you will need to take a bus to get to it.
College Student,1,They do absoulutely nothing to help transfer students.
College Freshman,1,"It is very hard to stay away from the drug scene at Rutgers.  Depending on your RA, the kids in your residence hall can be smoking and you can be subject to smelling their drugs in your own dorm.  If you go to College Ave to find a party you are also walking straight into the drug scene.  There is alcohol at every party or gathering, and if you're not careful with your drink there could be drugs in it too.  However, it is very easy to stay away from the drugs you just have to be smart and make good decisions.  Not everyone does drugs at Rutgers. There are so many different kinds of people."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a treacherous task on the Rutgers campus. Parking spots fill up rather quickly and if you do not arrive to campus on time it is guaranteed you will be late to class, reason being you either wait for a close spot to be empty or park far and have to walk for a while to the bus stop or class. Parking permits are expensive, especially when you are a broke college student. For resident parking permits the cost is about $200. Parking tickets are very common because the police are always checking to see who has a permit or not."

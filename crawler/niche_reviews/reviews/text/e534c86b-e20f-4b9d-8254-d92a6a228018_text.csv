Senior,5,"During my time In south bend, I have been able to connect with many people.  Getting to know your professors having one on one time with them is one of the best things. For me being in a smaller school setting it just fits me right and they do a great job at helping and being there for students the staff does an amazing job."
Junior,5,It has been an enjoyable experience so far. I have met some great people from being in a club. I wish that IUSB had more engaging activities and that advisors would be more willing to drop everything and help you.
Junior,5,"My overall experience with IUSB  has been good, the education that I receive is very good and professors are very helpful. I feel like the cost of education could be a little less considering the area and the cost of living in the area. Apart from the cost of education I find IUSB to be a good university to attend."
Junior,5,My online experience with IUSB has been good and I feel it allows students to study at their own pace.
Freshman,5,"IUSB is a fun place to learn at! The dorms are very different than many other universities. You have your own space and more than enough resources to excel. The libraries, the student-life activities, the food, the environment, and the people around are all great as well! I highly recommend Indiana University - South Bend!"
Junior,5,"The professors in campus are very ambitious and hardworking. I am a nursing major and although it is challenging, I know IUSB has all the resources I need to become a successful nurse."
Freshman,5,"I love the professors and how they interact with every student. They care about the knowledge we know and questions we have. Iusb is the perfect college for students looking for a small to attend !  Professors will help you out with every question , abs they’ll answer every question. They will especially help you with Exams and questions on the final! This us the best college to attend !"
Niche User,5,"They answered all of the questions we had very well. Also, they have a system to keep young women safe on campus at night, which is very important. The campus is small and feels like home. They also have a five level library which contains a wide variety of resources.  They have tours on different days throughout the week, that way anyone who wants to look at the campus can do so. They also offer many classes online, as well as at their Elkhart campus. So the commute time is cut. IUSB also has a wide variety of food options available on campus so everyone can find something that they like."
Freshman,5,They have a mixture of classes to choose from that can fit in your work schedule. I also love how small and secure the campus is with many free tutoring that can help with classes such as Algebra I.
Sophomore,5,"Indiana University is a excellent college! My first semester was in the spring of 2019, and it was very educational. The professors are very respectful, helpful and were really good at making themselves available to students. The student life needs some improvement, it seems like if not athlete their is nothing for students to do on campus; other than that I really do enjoy my university."
Sophomore,5,I transferred from IUPUI and it was the best decision I have ever made. Within 2 weeks of being on campus I have felt more confident in my studies and overall happiness in the choice I made to come home to South Bend.
Senior,5,I love the small class sizes that provided a family-type feeling with the other students and professors. The professors are always there to help you succeed!
Freshman,5,Helpful staff. Clean Environment. Campus easy to get around. The is a variety of ages for students. Professors help when needed.
Freshman,5,"I like Iandiana University because there Canvas is very is to interpret your assignments and easy to turn in.  The Professors take an interests in your major and are very helpful when it comes to meeting with you for better clarification on an assignment or subject,"
Niche User,5,It is a very concise and direct school.  Multiple options and great Faculty to work with you and get you going.
Sophomore,5,"I like Indiana University for offering quality education. The professor are amazing the the student diversity and interaction is beyond measure. Help is always available to anyone in case someone need to ask directs or instructions concerning a particular issue. The students are given a voice, and a sense of studying in a safe environment is always there."
Senior,5,"You get an IU diploma, and classes are small, which makes it easier to improve professor/students relationships. Also, the cost is very affordable. Go IU!"
Sophomore,5,I enjoy my time at IUSB so far as I am in my sophomore year. The professors are always there to help and encourage me to do better. The only thing I would change would be for the professors to release the syllabus a couple weeks before classes start to get the materials needed.
Freshman,5,I like how the professor are approachable and take their time to explain everything. I like how the campus is.
Freshman,5,The campus is very comfortable and is a perfect size for me. I came from a smaller school and my graduating class was about 130 students. So I am not used to anything big and this campus is just the right size.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Indiana University South Bend has been wonderful so far. I just finished my freshman year and the student life there treated me very well! I loved the effort my professors put in with teaching not only their classes, but providing extra time outside of class to further cover material."
Sophomore,5,"I really love the time I have spent at Indiana University South Bend! The proffesors are amazing, class sizes are perfect, and the opportunties provided by the campus cannot be beat!"
Junior,5,Most of the teachers are intelligent and helpful when you come to them. Some of them teach courses at Notre Dame so you're getting the same kind of education for an affordable cost. The class sizes are small so you get more individual attention.
Niche User,5,"When I went on the IUSB campus tour, I felt like the director really explained himself with everything. He was very thorough with explaining how each department worked. The only thing we did not get to was the Housing because the office was closed, also it was pouring down rain. I think IUSB is well maintained, and a awesome looking college. I can not wait to extend my education further at IUSB in the fall."
Junior,5,"I have been going to Indiana University South Bend for 3 years now and I have enjoyed my experiences even through the rough patches, because without those I would not be where I am today."
Junior,5,"What I really like about Indiana University South Bend are the opportunities for students to learn. IUSB has plenty of programs and courses for students to take that will challenge people, and help them learn.
If there is one thing that could change for the better, it is the food. It would be awesome if the campus could offer better quality food for its students and staff."
Freshman,5,I love that it is a small campus and personable. My professors try really hard to help everyone and they are the bet teachers I’ve ever had. Everyone at the school is willing to help the students in anyway and it’s fantastic to see everyone succeeding because of them.
Junior,5,"I am very glad that I chose to go to IUSB. Not only because it is affordable but because the classes are small so the professor gets to know you personally and helps when you have questions about the subject. It is very different than the typical lecture you would get at a bigger University and it helped a lot for someone like me who learns better in smaller groups. I've made so many friends because of the way IUSB is set up! If I had to choose it all over again, I would."
Niche User,5,I really liked the modern impression that the school gave out. The staff was nice and welcoming. Definitely one of top college choices.
Niche User,5,"I've had a great time while attending. The professors I've had have all been professional , helpful and kind."
Freshman,5,"IUSB is a beautiful campus with highly sophisticated professors, and great students! I always enjoy walking through campus, or sitting in the library to study or in The Grille which is the campus cafeteria. The environment is refreshing and judgement free."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and how they allow people to be themselves. I wish more students would get involved in the activities around campus.
Sophomore,5,"Let me start by expressing how underappreciated this school is.The housing is amazing, the professors (at least for business) are top notch, and the diversity on the campus is unbeatable. I met people from all walks of life and we collaborated so well together. There are tons of clubs, which really make the experience to me! The reason most people complain about the school is because they are not taking advantage of the resources.The professors are always willing to help, the tutors have taken the same courses so they know how to help you ,and any professor or many students are nice enough to assist you tool.  I love this place and enjoy being near Notre Dame and the mall. There are 5 colleges in South Bend (not including Ivy Tech) so if you say this school doesn't give you the college experience you're doing it wrong. The SAC is amazing and Free to students! I really do not know what more you could ask for out of a school, at such an affordable rate none the less."
Freshman,5,"IU South Bend is great! It is a small sized university, but you are still achieving the same degree as if you were at IU Bloomington. The connection and one on one time with professors is something I cherish because that may be more difficult to do at a larger university. The people here are really nice, the courses actually help you learn, and the clubs/athletics are very fun. I would highly recommend IU South Bend to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall IUSB is a really good school. I know I will receive a top notch IU education here without the being far from home. Housing is amazing, the apartment style makes me feel like I have actually moved out of my parents home and like a 'real' adult. The size of IUSB allows you to have a personal relationship with all of your professors. At a larger university this wouldn't be possible. Even in my 100 person chemistry lecture I don't feel lost in the crowd because my professor actually knows my name. I feel this allows my education to be more successful. I am so happy I chose to attend IUSB. :)"
Niche User,5,I love the homely environment. Everyone that I met there was incredibly nice and I can not way to become enrolled into that college. 
College Sophomore,5,"There's a campus police station between the Riverpark Public library and the parking garage for campus. Every class I've taken outlines the 0 tolerance policy in the syllabus, and alerts are sent to students when an assault occurs. IUSB works hard to prevent assault, and does not turn a blind eye when it does happen."
College Student,5,"Before you go and put yourself into silly amounts of debt so that you can get drunk every night, consider investing in your future at a great price with IUSB."
College Sophomore,5,I was in Greek life back in the day when I went to college 25 years ago. I'm a returning adult student now.
College Student,5,I don't see any drug abuse or drugs at school.
College Student,5,I really like most of the Professors that I have had.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus has a police station right across the street from some of the main buildings, and also everywhere you  walk your in sight of an emergency phone at all times. This phone connects you right with the campus police to report a crime or even if you locked your keys in the car they can help assist with these too. I feel safer on campus then I did most of my high school career."
College Freshman,5,"I love how easy it is to navigate throughout the campus. My professors are all down to earth and easy to get along with, they help when asked and make homework something that does not seem to be overwhelming. The class sizes allow for extra time for questions and personal one on one time with the professors. Also the staff in the advising offices are always so helpful and are pushing for us to do the best we can. IUSB is a great school for one to continue their education in."
College Freshman,5,The security throughout the school is great. There are emercency phones set up in all convenient lactions
College Freshman,5,The people are great and teachers are extremely helpful
College Junior,5,"Since class sizes are not like in huge universities, professors are able to cater to students at a one to one manner. The registration process is extremely easy. The workload is difficult for science majors, I think. Especially those classes with online homework, in class homework, and in class quizzes, etc."
College Junior,5,The diversity is great! In most of my classes I at least have classmates from at least 4 different countries. All of them are accepted.
College Freshman,5,I do feel rather safe on campus. There are phones outside to call security if needed and the campus is pretty well lite at night.
College Freshman,5,"It makes me very happy to see and hear many international students attending IUSB. I'm glad that they get an opportunity to attend college in the US. The majority of my classmates though are Caucasian, but I have never had a problem getting along with anyone because of my ethnicity."
College Sophomore,5,Affordable. Efficient. Helpful. IUSB will give me the tool I need to succeed in my future with out being in debt. The facilities are very nice and the people are all so friendly
College Student,5,"my school environment is best with friendly study atmosphere. in my school, professor love to help us in studies."
College Freshman,5,"At IU South Bend, I can graduate in four years with an Indiana University (Academic Honors) Bachelors Degree in English Secondary Education with minors in Political Science and Spanish. This will allow me to get licensed in multiple subjects. Ultimately, I will be able to teach half the high school curriculum going into my first year of teaching. This will also give me a platform to get my accredition from the International Baccalaureate to teach a worldwide, rigorous curriculum, again, all in my first year of professional education. This will ultimately help me to get my Masters and Doctorates Degrees in Education, so that I may go into education adminstration, and ultimately Washington DC. And the best part of IUSB- I will graduate debt free. IUSB is one of the only affordable 4-year universities left in the country. This also makes it one of the best!"
College Freshman,5,"I would choose my school all over again because the amount of money I am saving is great. I live at home, still eat dinner with my family every night, and save gas by living 15 mins from my college. I will be in no debt after school and have a nursing degree.  The advisors are great and so helpful."
College Student,5,I live at home so I think its better then on campus
College Freshman,5,"I live on campus and have a kitchen, my own room, closet, and bathroom.  It's great."
College Student,5,"Everyone is very nice, and it's easy to get into programs"
College Sophomore,5,I love almost all aspects of being in the music program.
College Sophomore,5,Really Easy to get in.
College Sophomore,5,No internship required for nursing degree.  We do have many hours of clinicals during the program but they count towards your degree.
College Sophomore,5,The computers have just been upgraded to log you in so much faster than in previous years.  It makes it easy to pop in log in and print out power point slides or a paper real quick.  Also IT responds to problems very fast and I have never had a problem finding a computer available throughout the semester.
Senior,4,Great school! With great caring professors! Campus is small but that makes it easier to get around to each class
Senior,4,Since the COVID-19 pandemic remote learning has become a must! I will say that IUSB has done a spectacular job at readjusting from face to face to online learning very smoothly.
Senior,4,Taking some classes online can be difficult at times. One thing I would say is to make sure you always stay in touch with your online teachers. They will always answer emails and make sure you are on the right path.
Junior,4,My online experience was okay but I just felt like the professors were not very clear on what they needed from us as students. I also thought that it was harder to stay in touch with professors and to hear from them.
Junior,4,What I like about Indiana University is that everyone is nice and willing to help you and they do reach out as well. One thing I do not like is that some professors judge you based on their first impression of you. I would like to see changes in the judgement of professors towards their students.
Sophomore,4,I loved the diversity. You are able to see so many different people and cultures all being combined into a unit. Everyone stands out and are there to study about anything. They let their minds open up for anyone.
Senior,4,"It's close to home, was able to finish a little earlier than expected. it's nice to be in an area where there is four other surrounding colleges, you get to experience the student life"
Senior,4,"Overall I really appreciate the experience I had at IUSB. I feel as though I got a high quality, state school education for a reasonable price. I'm thrilled with the quality of education I received. I also feel like 95% of the support staff (those in the bursar office, career services, etc.) are passionate about helping students and willing to do whatever it takes to make sure you succeed. The biggest drawback about IUSB is the campus itself. It is, overall, in very poor condition. Northside Hall is all but falling apart. Most of the buildings are outdated, in poor condition, and in some cases, even unsafe."
Freshman,4,Its a decent university but it has an overall good environment. The people and professors areI have encountered are always friendly. I would say that if you are looking for a party school IUSB would not be a good school for that. I f you want to get a good education without breaking the bank IUSB is the one for you.
Junior,4,Mostly very good experiences. I am a physics major and the physics professors are all really wonderful. They treat us very nicely and work hard to help up be prepared for the future.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere and experience is uplifting. 

Communication and early career seeking from advising is needed."
Graduate Student,4,"Not a bad school, small class sizes and close to home. Professors are down to earth and are willing to work with you to make sure that you understand the material. Some programs have to a drawn out process to complete them or I would rate this a 5 star."
Senior,4,Excellent classes for my majors; pych offers more classes but both have equally good faculty. Financial aid and the bursars office handle inquiries well/relaticely quick.
Junior,4,My overall experience has been pretty well. Any time I need help from a staff or faculty member they're always willing to help. When I have taken classes on campus I've always felt like I was valued.
Sophomore,4,"Throughout high School I took many dual credit courses through South Bend, and after my freshman year at IUPUI, I decided to transfer back to IUSB."
Senior,4,"Overall I like this school because it's close to home, a 4-year university and has a lot of diversity. There's not enough food options available in the diner. Only like chicken nuggets and pizza. It's also very expensive. I don't live on campus so I don't about housing. Commute is pretty easy. Most  of my professors were great.  Nursing program has a lot of things they need  to fix including the outrageous nursing program fee. I have friends who go to other universities and I think IUSB is superior. They are offering more programs which is great. The university is pretty and clean. The North Side building is falling apart and they keep putting bandaids over it instead of actually fixing the problem."
Sophomore,4,"It seems that IUSB is generally most people's last choice. I think very few people are like ,""ah yes IUSB my dream school"". However, overall this is not a bad school. All of the professors really try to help you in the classroom and outside. I have had professor even help me with other classes other than their own. So yes it's cheap and often not a first choice. But it's also not a bad choice."
Niche User,4,Lovely campus and amazing people to talk with and work with. a lot of compassionate people.have treated my sister very well the dorms are very nice clean well organized and plenty of living space very efficient use of space and community life style is wonderful
Junior,4,"I like the size of the campus, it is easy to get around. I wish that there was more options of food available and longer hours. I have been to a previous college where they had food available until midnight. This would be really nice, because it would be a great place to study and grab a bite to eat later on."
Senior,4,There are many opportunities to get involved and try new things. I love the social activities and leadership roles students can participate in. It truly has helped me become a confident young women.
Senior,4,Small school but it is what you make of it. Many commute and never get involved in activity. Those students usually do not enjoy their time here as much. Still if you get involved it’s a great school. Housing is very nice too. Sports are also growing.
Sophomore,4,Everyone on campus has been very kind and helpful to make college a lot easier to go through. Faculty and staff are easy to talk to and are very relatable.
Freshman,4,"I like the class sizes.  I like the fact that they're fairly small.  Also, it's close to my home.  Since it's close to my home, I get to see many of my friends from high school still.  The professors that I've had are very professional and care about their students."
Senior,4,"I personally have never had any problems at IUSB. Every experience is great. they have hundreds of clubs and there is always an event or activity available. Most students don't realize there is so much to do and experience so i would recommend that the university start posing the activities for the day on the school website. Some activities include plays, the entrepreneurship lecture series (listen to an meet very successful local professionals), career fairs and much more. There is also a free gym for students."
Junior,4,"I love the small community at IUSB. Coming from a small high school, it was important to me to be able to have small enough classes that I could connect one on one with my professors. The professors at IUSB could not be more welcoming, helpful, and excited for you. It really makes a difference in your education."
Freshman,4,"My first semester at IUSB has been good so far. Most professors are nice and make it slightly easier for freshmen to adjust to college. The campus isn't hard to navigate because there are always signs and posters telling you where stuff is located. The buildings are also nice and modern except for Northside. Most buildings are cold, which needs to be fixed since it is winter."
Sophomore,4,I like that it's close to my home and that it's affordable. I also enjoy being on the campus because there are a lot of places for you to study and to go and get help with your class or homework.
Freshman,4,With Indiana University - South Bend being a local college to me I was not expecting it to be as diverse as it is. The professors and advisors are also very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Close to home, good curriculum, low cost. 
allows me to work part time and still achieve my education."
Sophomore,4,"I just transferred. The transfer process was confusing, but overall, I have been enjoying my first semester."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman that has just finished my first semester, I have to say that I love this campus and overall teaching. The campus is just big enough to where there is always something new to find out about and the teachers here as so nice and accepting. The academics provide students to push themselves to succeed and come out learning new things every day."
Niche User,4,The professors are all great to work with. Class sizes are small and personal. They were accommodating of my disability and service dog.
College Student,4,"So far I love my Professors. My math teacher is the best, as he is very casual but cares a lot about the personal and academic success of his students."
College Student,4,"It is a well known school that educates half of our community, so its very credible."
College Sophomore,4,I really have enjoyed my time at IUSB. The teachers help out with every question and my first year was great. Hope my second year is even greater.
College Sophomore,4,My dentist co-owns his own facility; he as well as several of the hygienists employed there proudly display their IU diplomas.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty and staff here want to see the students succeed; they're not just here for a paycheck. Everyone I've worked with is knowledgeable and prepared to work with pupils towards their goals.
College Sophomore,4,I did not expect much from iusb because it was my safety school but I'm glad I am attending
College Sophomore,4,I have never heard of anything happening at iusb so its great
College Sophomore,4,Everyone that goes to iusb is there to learn not party and hope they learned something from their college.
College Freshman,4,I love the face they have such a variety of different teachers. The courses are fun and engaging. And class sizes aren't too big.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus-- I've met so many people because of it. It makes you so much more involved with fellow classmates. The housing process was super easy, and very well explained."
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love it here. So many great people, teachers, and leaders. I felt welcomed the first hour I moved in. The one thing I dont really like is lack of security. Other than that, it's awesome."
College Student,4,Everyone is aware of the sports teams and the younger students seem to really support them.
College Student,4,"For your dollar, you're going to get a great education."
College Sophomore,4,I feel very lucky to go to a school where it is affordable and i will gt the same degree as my friends who go to bloomington and spend way more money.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus because there is always a cop within a short distance.
College Junior,4,I think it's a great school. I just wish it had more groups and activities for the students to join and more food options.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe. Just be smart about your own well being.
College Freshman,4,"so far IUSB has been a great experience. I think IUSB is unique because it's a small school, but there are many options and study groups and activities to do."
College Sophomore,4,"The security on campus is very good, always feel safe."
College Student,4,There are police officers if needed.
College Student,4,I really like IUSB. I enjoy the classes and the teachers. One factor that I am going to have to work on is staying focused on schoolwork. I like how there are different types of ethnicity and religious people at school. I would want to choose this school all over again because they have a great teaching program.
College Freshman,4,Just like any other campus the degree is the reason we are all at IUSB. There are many available ways to make money on and around campus.
College Freshman,4,All of the options we have to pick from are great. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The professors know who we are and could pick us out even if we aren't in the class anymore. I have never really had any issues finding courses that I needed for my major or with dealing with the courses in general. I love IUSB
College Sophomore,4,"There are emergency phones all over campus, and during orientation, they give you the phone numbers to security and others."
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers really do care about the students, and with the classes being on the smaller side, they are able to get to know their students."
College Sophomore,4,"My campus is very nice, and the people and teachers are very helpful."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes range between small and large. Most basic 101 classes are bigger but once you get into specific classes needed for your intended major the class sizes decrease.
College Freshman,4,Overall I value getting a degree and the school seems to think so too
Freshman,2,My overall experience at IUSB has not been the greatest. The food is actually decent but there is hardly anybody on campus on the weekends since most people commute. Hardly people participate in events leaving you quite dissatisfied. Overall the Financial Aid here is awful they can never give you clear answers on anything and the dorms have mold issues. The biggest issue I'd say is the communication this campus has is awful it seems like no one know what they are doing.
Freshman,2,I just did not feel like I fitted in well at IUSB. And I also found that it wasn't too student friendly I guess.
College Junior,2,They have a lot of reports of girls being approached by strange men at night when they're walking to their dorms or cars.
College Freshman,2,I feel like when most employers see that someone attended college here it is looked poorly upon. There are hardly any internships brought up by your counselor.
College Sophomore,2,I get emailed about interships in my major but a degree is required so its annoying.
College Sophomore,2,I dont care for them.
College Sophomore,2,"compared to other college experience I have seen or been around, mine is not impressive and not worth the money. I would rather transfer to Bloomington or another school away from this area."
College Freshman,2,It's okay for what it is but honestly I would rather walk down to the gas station and buy a sandwich.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't any specific ""Greek Life"" to speak of.  We have service fraternities and things like that, but not traditional frats and sororities"
College Freshman,2,Personally I don't party but I have heard some inappropriate stories especially from our building. I attend this campus because they said it was dry however it is not true. It extremely loud in my complex with immature students who vandalize property.
College Freshman,2,"It's really bad for college students if they're intending to live with friends and/or on their own. The places that college kids could afford are some of the absolute worst places in town. They're in crappy neighborhoods with bad crime rates. The safe, nice places to live are pricey as heck and are hard to get into."
College Freshman,2,"I don't live on campus due to the fact that I live so close to school, it's cheaper to live at home. However, I have a friend that lives in the campus housing and at night it's dangerous to walk around because she says several students have been sexually harassed ."
College Freshman,2,"Everything closes at 2 p.m. except for the coffee place in the education and arts building, and the sub connection in the SAC.  If you have classes all day, pack a lunch, and don't get the meal plan, unless you drink a lot of coffee."
College Student,2,"They barely give financial aid. It sounds cheap but it isn't. I wasn't granted any scholarships and the aid is distributed only a little at a time, leaving a 2K-3K bill each month. My parents had to take out a very high interest loan in order to ensure that I would have everything paid for so that I could sign up for classes."
College Student,2,There have been multiple sexual assaults on campus and the safety in the apartments is terrible. It's easy for people to break into the rooms on the bottom floor and the area the school is in is unsafe. Just one road away from one of the most dangerous roads in the city where many assaults and shootings happen.
College Sophomore,2,"Every encounter I have had with administration is bad. First, the financial officer wouldn't help me. Second, the counselors were completely useless. Third, security is NOT well trained or involved. And lastly, some professors treat you like you're a child when you ask them a question. It just feels like administration only wants what is best for the school money wise and don't really care or are concerned about the students."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus security seems like they are always busy or sleeping whenever something goes down on campus. I have been on campus late at night and saw a campus officer sleeping in his car. We have had many incidents of sexual assault at the on campus housing complex. Students get emailed every time something does go down on campus, but IUSB seems to just forget about it after it has happened. There are no follow ups as to what is going on."
College Freshman,2,"The people there aren't very helpful to a student that knows nothing about financial aid. I had many unanswered questions and had scholarship information lost. It was very frustrating. Make sure you're on top of everything, keep track of your financial aid at all times!"
College Senior,2,"Greek life seems rather boring and expensive. The people there seem nice, but I have other things I'd rather do."
College Senior,2,"No one cares about the athletic teams. I did not attend a single athletic event, nor did I really know IUSB has any teams for the first couple years of attending the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a great part of town, and it's far from the more vibrant part."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many sports activities that go on around here.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the places immediately around campus close in the evening, so accessing anything that isn't the typical McLateNight meal is a good jaunt away. If it is before 10pm, there is a nearby grocery store which has great options."
College Freshman,2,"I don't participate in anything on campus. There's a few clubs around, but they don't seem to be too safe any more."
College Sophomore,2,None that I am aware of
College Freshman,2,The professors do not take the time to help you.
College Freshman,2,I have yet to hear of any greek events happening within the 2 semesters i've been there.
College Freshman,2,Theres only a basketball team and a volleyball team so not alot
College Freshman,2,This winter was horrible a lot of snow and ice.
College Freshman,2,Not much goes on around school
College Junior,2,"The winter REALLY sucks! The school does a good job of cleaning off the sidewalks and keeping it ice free, but it's still cold and gross!!!!!!"
College Senior,2,The food is actual pretty good. Variety is the obstacle to overcome.
College Senior,2,I only received fafsa money and never really understood the scholarships offered from IUSB.
College Sophomore,2,As an international student i find the apartments to be costly.The apartments are many with enough security and well governed.They are close to campus and well connected with public transport since i don't have a car.
College Junior,2,They have been working on expanding parking but as of last year there were still parking limitations. Depending on the time of your class it could be impossible to park. Show up early at first until things settle in.
College Senior,2,"Greek life is for the younger students and to my knowledge there are no sororities/fraternities for older/non-traditional students. This is a lack, as students such as myself bring a wealth of experience to our college classes and could be a very good source of knowledge for younger students."
College Senior,2,"In the 2+ years I've been on campus, I've only seen security/police once. I've read about strangers on campus harassing students and in one case making threats to those students, but to my knowledge, nothing was followed up on with the city police. As a disabled and older student, a more visible security/campus police presence would be reassuring to me, especially since I take night classes and walk to my car in the dark."
College Sophomore,2,"Permits don't always get charged to my bursar bill each semester even if I click the option for it to be added. So if I don't notice it, I get ticketed for not paying it, I am forced to pay the ticket in addition to the permit fee. Trying to find a parking spot is often difficult if I can't get to school before 9am. People don't know how to park, which often results in less parking spaces."
College Sophomore,2,IUSB doesn't provide transportation. The city bus is fine.
College Freshman,2,It is harder in the winter because it is a very far drive for me and I do not want to have to drive in those condtitions.
Sophomore,1,"Indiana University South Bend is a good commuter campus, If you are planning to live on campus, this is not the school to get a good ""college experience"""
College Junior,1,Only say the worst because we don't have it
College Sophomore,1,Im pretty sure there is only one sorority and I dont think it is a full out sorority (living together and such)... not sure about the frat part of it.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life at Indiana University South Bend.
College Freshman,1,"I think there is one or 2 frats and sororities, its sad. There is so much potential here, just seems like everyone who attends here is just here from commuting so they dont have time to do that stuff."
College Junior,1,"I receive a grant that I qualify for through the state, but the school won't give it to me half the time because it doesn't follow their standards.  I'm a full time working mother of 2 and I can't afford to pay for college out right. They have completely took away my financial aid and I only have 2 semesters left!"
College Student,1,"The grille has decent food and the salad is okay but they close at 2PM. Not open on the weekends. Yes that's right, 2 in the afternoon. And then there is only one other place and that is a sub place that is always out of stuff and only offers subs and some gross premade stuff. The options are terrible."
College Student,1,"The teachers I have had weren't bad but the head lady in Office of Admissions, Constance, is TERRIBLY RUDE. They lost my papers that said I had received college credit. When I tried politely explaining I had two classes for credit, not one, Constance rudely interrupted me and just kept repeating ""No you only have one."" I handed in a sealed envelope I had gotten in the mail. I had gotten two copies, one for my keeping and one for the school. I opened mine and kept the one for the school closed. It in fact showed credit for two classes. They lost my paper and instead of admitting to the mistake and apologizing they tried blaming me saying I did not hand in both papers. The housing acts like they have set rules but they don't. I had many many issues with roommates including tampering with my belongings and being so loud my music on my phones, with headphones in, couldn't mask their voices at 5AM ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. I tried filing a noise complaint. Nothing. I made many complaints and the only thing they say is ""We can switch you and put you in a new room"" instead of fixing the problem. It is terrible."
College Student,1,"It's not that there aren't parties, there are, but they are terrible and not worth going to. The people are just awful and its always in the dorm rooms and they are loud and the campus is tiny and they always get caught it's ridiculous. If you say you're going to go to an IUSB ""party"" you'll get laughed at."
College Student,1,"This city used to be really nice and have a lot to do, but now it is full of criminals and you have to be careful walking by yourself. There are always shootings and deaths even very near the housing. The people here are rude and unintelligent. This is not a good place to be,"
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid from IUSB is the absolute worst. On FAFSA, it might say that my parents make enough to pay for only my college, but that is not true whatsoever. I have an older brother who goes to IUSB as well and my parents struggle as it is just paying for bills or catching up on bills plus having to pay for college on top of that. I am paying for my own college because I feel bad for my parents so I went to a financial officer and she explained to me that I make too much for financial aid. I work part-time all year round and don't even make $12,000 a year so I was really frustrated with the financial officer. IUSB only gave me one scholarship, which covers only $250 a semester, which is not a lot. I have a cumulative of a 3.46 and I think I deserve more scholarships from IUSB since I have such a high GPA compared to most students here."
College Sophomore,1,"There is an apartment complex right next to IUSB and it is very sketchy. One of my friends lived in them last year and we came home late at night and had to call the on campus security because there was this group of men that started to lurk their way towards where we were standing. It was terrifying. IUSB does post up some flyers for off campus housing, but IUSB promotes on campus housing more."
College Sophomore,1,Not much except for city busses.
College Freshman,1,"It depends on where you live, because I live where no public transportation comes through."
College Freshman,1,"I don't like it so much, that I have decided to switch majors."
College Freshman,1,I don't know of any parties around here and don't participate
College Junior,1,I don't think this is a thing..... But most people who go to this school live here so they wouldn't need to do any ride sharing to get home. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Awful, just awful! The parking lot looks like there should be plenty but never a space!  For what students pay for parking, the lack of spots is very irritating. :("
College Junior,1,"The sports don't mean to much for the school. We only have a couple bigger sports and while they get some attention, they are not very big."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is HORRIBLE! It takes forever to find parking.

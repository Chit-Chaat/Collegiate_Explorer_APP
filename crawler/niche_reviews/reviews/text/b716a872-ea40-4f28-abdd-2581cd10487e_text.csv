Alum,5,I did not take any classes online while attending. I did use online services in the student lab while attending but my classes were all in person.
Junior,5,My experience at Grambling has been a roller coaster. I moved 900+ miles from Michigan to Louisiana. I had no one there with me as I was by myself without any family. There are a lot of changes that I would like to see as in regards to the food and professors. I also think that Grambling needs to hire different on campus policeman because they do not do their job. They engage with students but not in a way that is appropriate.
Senior,5,Got a chance to experience an all black college. I connect with peers. Learned more about being a black professional.
Senior,5,"My online learning experience was great with Grambling my teachers kept me informed through our school websites such as outlook, and canvas. If I had a problem and seemed helped my teachers had zoom meetings and in the background boards to perform the work"
Senior,5,"Grambling State University is a place where everybody is somebody and no student is left behind. The teachers and staff are very helpful and you can sure depend on them. They offer tutoring not only during the week but on the weekends as well. They keep the labs open on the weekend to ensure every student has access to do any homework, research, applications and anything else they need to do wirelessly they offer WiFi campus wide they have councilors and clinics for those who need it"
Sophomore,5,"Grambling is literally the place ""where everybody is somebody"". Soon as I arrived on campus I felt like it was where I belonged. The professors are genuine and will make sure you are well equipped with the knowledge you need to continue on to the next level. I'm glad to call Grambling home!"
Freshman,5,I cannot wait to go to Grambling. After narrowing down which college I wanted to go to I decided Grambling is the best choice for me and will not only help me succeed in improving myself as a student but also prepare for the real world as well as providing me with once in a lifetime experience.
Senior,5,"As an International Student, I can most definitely say that attending Grambling thus far is truly an amazing experience. Grambling State University is a highly acclaimed school with great academic reports and a historically black college that embodies young African American men and women on successful paths. I chose to attend this school because I like being part of a large group and diverse student body. The Lecturers at this University care about the students and they are very helpful. Grambling State University just feels like home while it gives you a great feeling of school pride. The only thing I would like to see change here at the university is that there should be more opportunities for international students. With just more help to secure that perfect internship during your academic school year."
Senior,5,My experience at Grambling has been wonderful. This is my first Historical Black College/University and the experience has been amazing. The staff and students has been very welcoming. Also the staff is always available for assistance. The campus size is not to big but also not too small. The community as a whole feels like a family. The encouragement is impeccable. I would suggest anyone to attend. I love it here
Freshman,5,This is my first year here and I didn’t know what to expect. However now I believe that Grambling State University is the best HBCU there is. I feel comfortable being here and everyone here is very nice. The professors are nice and they are willing to work with us if we need. The only thing I wish is that our stadium was a little bigger. And that they would blacktop all the roads to the university.
Alum,5,They genuinely care about you and your success at the school and after graduation. They believe your success is their success.
Niche User,5,"What I love about Grambling is that their hospitality is amazing. They have amazing parties, they also have good food but the lines be too long to something that your waiting to get."
Graduate Student,5,"Love Grambling. Humble people who care about their university. Great part of Louisiana to live in with Ruston just two exits away (3 miles) has restaurants, theaters, gorgeous lakes, parks, and entertainment. 20,000 college students live within a 6 mile radius of GSU between Tech and Grambling. I'm a minority here (white) but the people are nice and usually smile and ask how I like it. So far so good. Its what you make of it. President Gallot, the best leader ever. He is single handedly turning this University around."
Freshman,5,"I loved the school sprit and pride the HBCU had. The positive point of view and energy that students, along with teachers had was really encouraging. They acknowledge all their students, and don’t tend to “neglect” another students personal or academic needs based off that person’s financial stability at that moment."
Sophomore,5,I like Grambling State because the Professors there they seem to care about their students and I really like to earn a scholarship so I can pay for college
Freshman,5,Grambling state University is such a welcoming campus. The People greet you with smiles and don't shy you away with any questions or concerns you approach them with. The campus is beautiful and the environment seems very adaptive.
Sophomore,5,"I am going into my sophomore year at THE Grambling State University. So far, I am absolutely loving my time at my HBCU. I have completed my first year on the Orchesis Dance Company under the direction of Diane Maroney-Grigsby. My education here is so informative as well. I am thoroughly enjoying my professors and everything they have to offer. Our athletics, fine arts and other organizations are exceptional and even our food options are great! I am so proud to be a Tiger at THE Grambling State University and I am ready to see what the future has in store for me."
Niche User,5,Grambling State University was very lively. Students were active and it is clear that there is a lot of appreciation for the school. I am looking forward to being apart of the Gramfam within the next few months.
Sophomore,5,Grambling is overall a school I don't regret going to.  This school has taught me a lot about myself.  No school is perfect but I love my HBCU.
Sophomore,5,This is the best HBCU ever. It a place where everybody is somebody. All the professors and academic advisors are very helpful and will do the best they can to see you walk across that stage in the year you are suppose to graduate. Grambling State University may be in a small area but everyone’s hearts are big and we welcome everyone to our school.
Niche User,5,I loved my visit to GSU. it was very lively and informational. All of the workers made it very comfortable and made everyone feel welcome.
Freshman,5,I really like Grambling. The students are friendly. The professors are friendly and great for helping you. The work really prepares for life after school. There are different clubs and organizations for students to join. I would recommend Grambling State Univeristy to any student that’s looking for a diverse environment
Junior,5,What I like about Grambling State University is that all the staff members in all departments are willing to help each students with there registrations. Everybody in Grambling is somebody and they make you feel that way. There nothing I feel they need to change. This university is a great university to attend.
Junior,5,My experience at Grambling State University has been absolutely amazing. I've met the most amazing people and the professors are great as well. Attending Grambling State University is one of the greatest decisions I've made so far. There are many great academic programs to become a part of as well as great athletics programs. There's even a place for counseling on campus for students who need someone to talk to. Grambling State University is an HBCU but everyone who attends is very diverse and come from many different backgrounds. Every since I became a student at Grambling State University I feel as if I became a better person because I was surrounded by so many great people.
Sophomore,5,I love that it was diverse and they take care of they own.i love how the dorms are and how that it was fun and people come back even when graduate. I love the food and the different event around campus . My teacher are very helpful and they were nice and cool . Grambling hell they alumni and they help with student jobs and they help with all kinds of things. I love the parties and the homecomjng and different events and even I like spring fest and things.
Junior,5,"I am junior at the Grambling State University college located in Grambling, Louisiana. What I love about Grambling, besides it being a HBCU, is that everyone is like family. I was welcomed into the Grambling family in 2016. Grambling falculty and staff help with you when you are down in need and even when you just need someone to talk too. Grambling gave me a chance to better life and love everything they have done to me. 
Things that I would love to see change or grow in the Grambling community is the donation to all the sports and broadcasting. We are known for our football team and world fame tiger marching band, however; in the sports industry, being a kinesiology major, I would love for that energy to spread all over our athletics as much as it does for football."
Junior,5,The atmosphere is simply amazing. I love my hbcu! Grambling State University has changed my life completely and I can’t wait to finish & officially become an alumnus of THE Grambling State University.
Freshman,5,Grambling state university where everybody is somebody and believing is achieving. Students success is the number one priority on Gramblings campus. I’ve had nothing but the best experience while attending Grambling state university.
Sophomore,5,"Quality of people who attend Grambling and the local area of Ruston. Great southern charm. People are friendly, Ruston is a peaceful town of about 30,000 people located 3 miles from the GSU campus. Has great food, affordable entertainment for the college scene, and is a beautiful area with trees, lakes, and outdoor rec available. This has been my favorite college campus I've visited in the south and would highly recommend it to any student wanting an affordable education. Its not a Harvard high priced get in debt University, but its good enough to get a degree and attain job opportunities for your future."
Senior,5,Grambling was the best experience ever for me it taught me how to be a man and a educator the classes we easy and fun there were time I was homesick but the student Life kept me going cause their were thing that kept me busy there was alot of partying but through it all I would do it all over again
Sophomore,5,"Grambling State has come along ways in the past few years for improvements under former Louisiana Senator, now GSU President Rick Gallot. President Gallot was just voted one of the national college top University Presidents and is very deserving. Turning around academics at GSU, getting state approval for a thirty million dollar library now underway, a new student rec center that begins construction this month while adding new tech degrees at GSU and overseas an enrollment surge of over 6 percent going on three years in a row now. GSU has finally become a quality University to attend again for education reasons, and for having a sense of school pride and optimism amongst the student body."
Niche User,5,Well grambling state has been a school I've been looking at for quite some time now. The band they have is wonderful and I plan on joining in my freshmen year. From what I've heard and seen is that It's day by day school you learn your surroundings and get to know a lot of people. The party life of the campus is also well known on campus and off of it.
Alum,5,wonderful HBCU where everybody is somebody. Very diverse. Excellent professors. Students are generally nice/accepting. Good tutoring programs. Great extracurricular activities
Niche User,5,"i loved touring the campus and seeing the beautiful scenery and really amazing students, they all seemed happy and outgoing and i would really like to be apart of that"
Sophomore,5,"The one thing I liked the most about being at Grambling is that everyone is one big family. Everyone is so friendly, if you get lost or have any questions about anything there is always someone to help you."
Sophomore,5,Coming to Grambling State was the best choice I could ever make. They truly make you feel at home and proud to be apart of gramfam.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Grambling State University was wonderful. Everybody there is like family. Getting to meet new people there is the best thing because everyone is friendly and we always have stuff going on so we can meet new people. Everything there is fine, the buildings are okay and the only thing that I would change is the road work. The roads are really bad there but when the Spring semester was over, they were working on the road and fixing most of them. They redid our basketball cage on our campus and they are redoing our football stadium as of now."
Senior,5,Grambling State University is a prestigious University where everybody is somebody. Students that attend this University always leave with the knowledge they need to excel. I recommend Grambling State University because it just feels like home!
Niche User,5,Grambling State University is a Historically Black University that allows students to achieve academic excellence as well as celebrate African American culture and pride. This university offers many diverse fields of study to a number of students with differing interests. Students are taught in a relatively personal educational environment in order to allow for academic achievement.
Alum,5,"Grambling university is a great college to attend. It has a fantastic school, students, and even workers. The greatness is spread from the famous band to the championship winning football team."
Alum,5,"Attending GSU was one the best experience I have had yet. I started as a child and came out a full grown woman. I learned about myself, my culture and history of it past to present. The diversity of GSU prepared me for today's realities that I come face to face with rather public or personal. I feel so strong about GSU that my only child is now in her third year at Grambling, and loving it to the fullest. She has it much better then I did. She has maintained to stay on the DEAN'S LIST, and is involved with a lot on her campus.  I was the first generation and didn't know of about the ins and out about attending a HBCU let alone a 4year University.   The downfall is as a paid Alumni to GSU my child has NOT to this day been offered NOTHING from GSU or the Alumni Association, no support, no scholarship's no incentive what so ever. I've been supporting her 100% on my own. But I will continue to what I have been doing and trying to do more with recruitment."
Junior,5,This is truly a Place Where Everybody Is Somebody.  The teachers care about the quality of education that each student receives.
Senior,5,"My experience at Grambling State University has been great. After spending the last four years here,  I can truly say it's been enjoyable. The overall staff at Grambling is very caring. They perform all actions necessary to help students be successful. I would have to say that the campus need more cameras for security purposes."
Senior,5,While at my HBCU I experienced a lot of things but the best thing I can say with proud is how actually seeing the people that came the same time as me not on get their education but changes their whole mind frame & style. I done saw young men go from wearing baggy clothes to wearing suits & that really amazed me
Freshman,5,Great place to grow up and learn how to interact with variety of cultures.  You will meet individuals with down south roots and hospitality.
College Senior,5,I'm so proud to have received my Bachelor's degree from GSU and even more proud to be working on my Master's degree with them.
College Senior,5,"Grambling really makes you feel like you are somebody, there's no other place like it!"
College Senior,5,I have never heard about a sexual assault incident in Grambling...
College Senior,5,Grambling is a nurturing school.
College Senior,5,"Grambling has two types of housing, west and east, or north and south, how ever you want to look at it. Continuing on, the north side has the apartment style dorms (there are some on the south but it's very few of them), and on the south side they have the combined 2 people dorms. The apartment style cost more. It's probably best to stay in the regular dorms."
College Senior,5,"We have the Deltas and the AKAs. the Qs, Kappas, and also the non Greeks like UAAM and the others. They don't have the big frat houses like you see on tv..."
College Senior,5,"Everyone goes to the football games! Especially Homecoming and Bayou Classic in New Orleans! The GSU vs PV game, in Dallas, is very popular as well!"
College Senior,5,Grambling is a place like no other. #GramFam
College Freshman,5,Grambling is a great school if you want to further your career. You do on hand experiences and I think you will enjoy them.
College Freshman,5,This school will make sure you're not doing anything illegal on campus
College Freshman,5,This school is very protective
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love staying on campus
College Freshman,5,I would love to join any sport
College Freshman,5,Grambling is one of the best schools you could possibly go to I absolutely love it and would not transfer schools.
College Freshman,5,We have a very safe campus and if you need help buildings are close by or you can call someone
Alum,4,"What I like the most about Grambling State University was the culture and atmosphere. I left Columbus, Ohio an inner city boy and turned into a country boy. I enjoyed the on campus activities very much. I sang in the campus church choir, I was apart of the campus ministry and student government association. I was a photographer and journalist for the campus newspaper and Media bureau. There were a lot of activities to participate in and become a part of. I had a couple tough professors that were very stern with their grading system which became stressful at times but I managed to find my way through and pass all my classes. The only thing that could have made it better for me personally would have been more jobs in the area."
Junior,4,I loved my online classes. I prefer online classes over in class teaching because I feel as if it’s just not as affective for me. It’s more of a challenge to get your work done because their is a deadline versus waking up in the morning and scrambling to do work that was supposed to be done yesterday. I did have a class that we sat in front of the teacher but did not do any work in the class but online the entire semester. We only went to class for attendance.
Freshman,4,I have not taken any online classes but I do know they offer online classes. I look forward to taking online classes.
Freshman,4,The people seem really friendly. And the education is all that but the acceptance and graduation rate is low. Everything is pretty and every body is socializing🤗🤗l
Niche User,4,the environment at the school is relaxing and quiet as the area is a bit secluded and away from the city. i must say the security service is exceptionally good and teachers play a keen role in assisting their students throughout the semester.
Junior,4,"Grambling ""Is the place where Everybody is Somebody"". The environment is great and the teachers are really there to help you. If you're a minority, especially black, then this is the school for you! The teachers actually take the time out of their busy schedule to have hands on in helping you with whatever you may need. Over 90% of the students that attend graduate and then not only get jobs, but careers. The whole purpose of college is to graduate and do something in the field that you love. The President is really nice and down to earth. All in all, it's a great environment and I wish more people would attend."
Freshman,4,Grambling is a very great college. It’s great academically as well as the environment. Although I would like to see some things change. Overall it’s a university I wouldn’t second guess!
Freshman,4,"Grambling students are in for an experience. With 24/7 cafe hours, students often find themselves waiting for the employees to bring out food that has no flavor. Academics are sub-par. Student life is what you make it. Being on such a small campus, there is plenty of time to balance school work and parties."
Sophomore,4,"Grambling State University is a very good hbcu.the atmosphere is so surreal there on campus.i met a lot of great people and intelligent people on campus.I do still currently go there as we speak so I have a lot more experiences to go trough this semester but as far has I seen it’s been great so far and I love to call that place my second home. academic wise the is ok not the best but you have to pick the right professors and the right courses to suite to be successful there.you just can’t go there and not now what’s going on etc.even know I did praise grambling campus life and all, still be careful who you call your friends there because not everybody is in favor of your best interest"
Junior,4,Grambling is very family-oriented there is literally something for everybody so nobody ever feels left out. They are dedicated to your success and making sure that you are comfortable with campus life and your studies.
Freshman,4,"I love that Grambling State University is a place where everybody is somebody! Everyone is given chances to improve themselves & make something better out of it. I would like to see sororities and fraternities change, every 2 years should be whenever students should be allowed to join."
Freshman,4,As an incoming freshmen I have visited GSU at least 4 times on high school visits and meeting with Alumni and students. The environment and community is amazing and I was immediately drawn to the campus from my very first visit.
Sophomore,4,Grambling is a wonderful HBCU there are so many activities and opportunities. No one is left out. At Grambling it truly feels like home. The professors really care about their students and want to see the best from them.
Sophomore,4,I love everything about Grambling. Overall the professors are hands on and are respectful to the students needs. Grambling is a very involved campus with millions of things to do for the staff and students.
Graduate Student,4,"As an international, Grambling State University bridged the gap between my ancestoral and historical knowledge, breaking the culture shock experienced. The place where “Everybody is Somebody” is the slogan indicating that any individual who attends GSU will find “a home away from home”. The community of student, faculty and staff are remarkable and accepted me for who I am while we exchanged culture. Teaching styles are tailored for the classroom and online, and faculty are willing to listen to students problems, offering the help needed but not “spoon-feeding” students. At this college, student life is fairly balanced with work, classroom and extracurricular activities with several clubs and organizations providing opportunities to be involved on campus and in the community, while also building a sense of belonging. I would not change my decision for anything in the world."
Sophomore,4,The professors and students are very welcoming and the school is very diverse. However  the food at the cafeteria can be improved greatly.
Junior,4,"Grambling is what you make it. There are teachers that are going to go above and beyond to help you while others are going to expect you get your life together on your own. Find a good support system. Make good friends and stay away from the fake ones, they are everywhere. Go to class and study and you can do great here."
Sophomore,4,Being a current student at Grambling State University is one of the best choice I could've ever made in my life. The professors are always willing to give extra help along with the tutoring sessions that is offered. The student life has greatly impacted my life as far as networking. GSU really is a place where everybody is somebody!
Freshman,4,"Grambling state university is a wonderful college, all the activities are awesome. Many Extra curricular activities, the professors are nice and hard working it's a really great school"
Sophomore,4,My experience at Grambling as been amazing. I love the fact that everyone is a big family. I would change how some of the professors do not put in grades until it is time for midterms or finals. I feel they should be in before that.
Graduate Student,4,This was a very interesting experience for me. I am a white student and Grambling is a HBCU so that was a big change for me. The students and teachers were really opening and didn't judge me for being a white student.
Senior,4,"Grambling State University is a very closely-knit, family-oriented school. Everyone cares for and looks out for one another. I have learned and achieved so much during my time here. I have become a part of several organizations and made friendships that will last a lifetime. The faculty and staff have big hearts, and we all want nothing more than for our university to continue to prosper. Most of my family attended and graduated from Grambling, so it had been familiar to me my entire life. I am very grateful for my experience here and would absolutely recommend the school to others."
Senior,4,Grambling State University is a wonderful environment for aspiring individuals to grow in many different fields of interest. The institutions faculty and staff are outstanding and interested in the success of their constituents.
Sophomore,4,"I love Grambling State University's academics , professors, student life, party scene, athletics , and dorm life. Campus wide the university has some working on when it comes to campus safety."
Freshman,4,"Grambling State University is a great school which is diverse and is located in a great area to reside in. Grambling State University has done a splendid job in welcoming their students, and the faculty is always there to help.  Grambling State University's motto is ""Where Everybody is Somebody"", and the atmosphere is very friendly! The professors teach excellent and are there to help you along the way. It is truly a home away from home."
Alum,4,"I think Grambling is on the right path to returning to their exemplary form. However, there is still much work to do in academics, student affairs and financing. Grambling has a great president but needs more people in leadership authority who can help bring the vision to light. It may help to recruit Grambling Alumni who have experienced and know what the school needs, exactly. I hope to be apart of that team one day. Grambling is a family school, full of legacy's, old and new. It's history supercedes what it is now, in regards to what it should and could be for years to come.

Senior,4,Grambling State University is a great College if you are looking for a family feel. They take you in and treat you like one of their own. I love my crazy college #gramfam for life
Niche User,4,"this school is nice, and offers a lot of opportunities. I really see myself going here. the dorm rooms look great, they have a great department revolving around each of my favorite interest, and the campus is nice. no one is a nobody there."
Sophomore,4,"Grambling is an HBCU and an overall great place to study. It has a very active social climate. The school is very supportive of it’s football team and marching band, and there are numerous student organizations that organize student activities.  The lecturers make it really easy to learn, and they are super kind. My favorite thing about Grambling is that there is always somone/ organization there to help. There is a career services office that helps with everything career related; from building your resume to assisting with finding internships, to mock interviews ! The area around the university is practically dead. There is nothing to do outside the school. The nearest grocery store is 15 mins (drive) away. This works to your advantage because it makes the environment more conducive to learning . Otherwise, there is a police station, church and fast food express on campus. I would recommend Grambling to anyone who is serious about learning."
Niche User,4,"After visiting about 6 other Colleges (four being HBCU's), I went on a campus tour of Grambling State University and absolutely fell in love. I started off my tour in the Eddie G. Robinson Museum and got to learn about Grambling's history. I then got to take a walk on the campus viewing all the beautiful historical buildings while learning more about what they have to offer. The feeling I received while being on campus was very welcoming, making me feel at home. The thing that absolutely sold me were the dorms. Unlike other campuses where rooms are so confined, at Grambling, there is room to breath and be comfortable with a range of dorm styles. Overall my experience was wonderful and I look forward to attending."
Freshman,4,Grambling is defiantly a place where everybody is somebody! Some cosmetic issues are visible but Grambling is a great place to attend college.
Freshman,4,Very nice campus! The food is good. The staff is very helpful. Not much around the campus by way of businesses. But Good learning environment.
Sophomore,4,My first year at Grambling was a amazing year. The campus life was great to. There was a lot of activities going on that you never got bored. The professors there were great to me in helping that I got all the work I needed because I was gone for baseball. The baseball season the most exciting part of the school year. I can't wait for next season. This year we were the western division champs and next year I hope to be the SWAC champions. The only thing I think they need to do is upgrade all their facilities and the campus will be a great environment.
Freshman,4,My freshman year at Grambling State overall was pretty good. Grambling is a school where just you have to make the best out of it.
Freshman,4,I have had a wonderful experience at Grambling so far. The perofessors make sure that you get a well taught lesson and they want the best for their students. The campus is always full of people enjoying themselves and having a good time.
Freshman,4,Grambling State University is a great campus to study on because they really do live up to their motto: Where Everybody Is Somebody. The school offers plenty of opportunities for their students to achieve and build themselves up for success post college graduation. They also have plenty of social organizations around campus for the students to get involved in. I has a unique culture that makes everyone within the campus feel at home. The school could add some variety to the meal plans I will say. Its also important to pick your math and science professors wisely. The Mathematics and Science department are filled with foreigners which make it very hard for the students to understand the professors during lectures.
Junior,4,"Grambling State University is a fairly large campus where we take pride in our motto, ""where everybody is somebody."" From the student to the staff we treat each as family no matter the the color, shape or size; We are one! We take pride and support  in our athletic team win or lose, and we party hard, win or lose. We are known nation wide for a wide range of things. Grambling teaches their students where they come from, self value and most important prepares you for the real world."
Junior,4,"What I like about Grambling most is that everybody is truly somebody. You can change everything about you and be whomever you desire to be. Another great aspect is the culture of my school. Our band and football team ring bells. There's no better place to be than Grambling during homecoming season! The amount of support that my school has amazes me. While all of these things are great, it only gets better! Every year, thanksgiving weekend is the bayou classic held in New Orleans where we play against our rivalry school Southern University! As far as the school it's very historic. The staff members are always there to help you. They might be rude but they'll help you. I can honestly say that I haven't gotten the full college experience due to me working at least 2-3 jobs as a full-time student. I'm hoping that my last year here (Fall 17-Spring 18) that I'd be able to work less days but somehow cover my bills so that I can get that college experience my last year here. Overall I love it"
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy being here. The people are extremely nice and they make me feel welcomed. At first i was scared because i was away from home in California and that i didnt have any friends. But that changed rapidly and i can call this my home away from home.
College Senior,4,We do great things for the school. No housing though
College Senior,4,My professors are the best!
College Freshman,4,They will help you with whatever all you have to do is ask
College Freshman,4,"We have wonderful courses and professors, classroom size is average, we have many courses as well."
College Freshman,4,Once you are ready for internship someone in your field will help you with that it is the easiest process. Alumni network is awesome because they will always offer help.
College Freshman,4,You don't have to be a greek to enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,"At first I was very nervous, but now it's a warm and friendly environment and the professors actually care about you. You also can always find help"
College Senior,4,"I feel safe on campus, if we're in danger we usually get a text message or some kind of warning to let us know if we're in danger on campus."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at Grambling State University has been a wonderful experience from meeting new people, having a great relationship with my professors, and getting the college experience that I always wanted. I think everyone has a different college experience and it vary with age, so me being an older student I can honestly say I've enjoyed all the good and bad times."
College Sophomore,4,Well the most drugs I hear about or smell is marijuana anything else I really don't know.
College Sophomore,4,I have not heard of anyone who has experienced sexual assault. As a young woman you should always be careful who your around and who you allow in your personal space.
College Sophomore,4,"Grambling is a school where it makes you want to be involved in what's going on in athletics, like attending games and having the overall gramfam spirit. The football and baseball teams are great however the men's basketball team need some help or a bit more practice other than that athletics are very much so important."
College Sophomore,4,Grambling State University is a wonderful school to attend. The atmosphere and the many events on campus get each and every student involved in the social life. The professors are great at encouraging a student to be great in everything they decide to do and do it to the best of their abilities. I'm proud to be apart of GramFam!
College Senior,4,"Greek life is a big part of this campus atmosphere. The most popular Greeks are Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and the Omega's or ""Q dawgs""...these are major African American greeks that surround themselves with sorority brothers and sisters and represent their membership to its fullest! The campus has step shows and line crossings for the public to attend but no housing arrangements on campus. Most alumni pledged early on in school and associate with new members. These greeks will persuade you to join a sorority or fraternity because they show their pride and knowledge of their institution and make it look fun and interesting."
College Senior,4,The football team is most popular among the campus. Every year there is a game against Southern University called the Bayou Classic held in Baton Rouge that almost everyone from the surrounding areas attend. There is a battle of the bands and halftime show with the GSU cheerleading and dance team that gets Grambling the famous recognition it has held throughout the years.
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my overall experience at GSU. The students are active and the teachers make learning interesting. There is excessive school spirit and pride amongst the faculty and staff, which upholds the school motto : ""The place where everybody is somebody!"""
College Sophomore,4,"We had an awesome football team this past year. They made it all the way to the championship with a fight, but at the end we fell short with the W"
College Sophomore,4,Diversity isn't a problem everyone gets along with everyone
College Sophomore,4,Greek life on campus is amazing they do all sorts of things like have school meetings for students that are serious about helping out the community
College Sophomore,4,The Athletic department is great
College Sophomore,4,"I Love Grambling State University because it's a place ""Where Everybody Is Somebody"" and they allow you to be yourself. The teachers are lovely and the President is one of the smartest people i know."
Senior,2,I wish they had more online course choices. Sometimes I had to find myself settling for classes that i did not want. it was hard working around my work schedule
Sophomore,2,"There isn’t much to do if you plan on being a global or a very big figure in life. This school is best for people who plan to live a small town and average lifestyle. Entertainers and People that want to be involved in the Media , the Mainstream Media, I don’t recommend this school for you. Won’t be able to get a job & nothing in the area that helps excel with your art"
Freshman,2,"They are behind in a lot of areas such as technology, their facilities, staff, advisement and the registration process. They focus too much on football and the band and neglect to put emphasis on the money they put towards academics and their honor students. They do not have many places to accommodate the students needs and over charge for things on campus. Their Financial Aid and advisement is terrible, there are just too many staff members that do not want to do their job and it makes it hard on the students who are trying to get their education. Overall it was not ""the HBCU experience"" I expected. You spend too much money to attend college in general and to not receive what you deserve out of a college is rediculous."
College Sophomore,2,"As far as sexual assualt I have not heard any cases about it, but like I said security need to be more enforced on campus. My room got broken in to twice and I ask campus police to check the cameras they told me they didnt work. So someone got away with a 40 inch Tv. How is that not easy to spot Idk ask them."
College Sophomore,2,"The student involvement, fan suppor, and school spirit on campus is very very poor."
College Sophomore,2,The only good parking is in the former tiger village. Parking everywhere else is pretty much a headache. You get fined parking beyond a certain point when you live on campus but sometimes you have no other choice. Now that they have moved the upperclassman girl's dorms to the former freshman village it's gonna be even worse now. So thanks for that Grambling
College Sophomore,2,People can get away with just about anything on Grambling campus.
College Freshman,2,we need more options and most of the time the resturants run out of food
College Freshman,2,The greek life is not popping you don't heard about the greeks just the non-greeks
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation on campus is okay. They have a bus they will drop and pick up students from the airport, an appointment is required. There is also a bus that takes students to local stores to allow students to grocery shop. The only opportunity lacking with the transportation is for off campus students. That would be great."
College Sophomore,2,Grambling State is located in a small town. So you have to travel a good distance to get to your local stores and restaurants. This is a negative about attending the university.
College Sophomore,2,My freshman year financial aid process was very stressful because I procrastinated. The financial building on campus is extremely busy and stressful if you don't organize and finalize all your information. My best advice is to take care of all your financial information before coming to school that you will not have to deal with the hectic lines of the financial aid lines.
College Junior,2,The administration is not together as a whole
College Junior,2,Our sports hardly get any support 
College Junior,2,Girls dress Half naked going to class
College Senior,2,students come to school to dress up 
College Sophomore,2,"If it's raining, most people want go to class."
College Sophomore,2,I don't see anything unique about my school.
College Freshman,2,the school is unorganized in how they deal with financial aid
Recent Alumnus,2,There could be some provisions made on rainy days. 
Recent Alumnus,2,You have to be proactive or you will go through the wire. 
Recent Alumnus,2,It's a small town where the college is the heart and soul of the community. 
College Junior,2,The financial aid process was so difficult and long!
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus is fine if you like small/college town and not a big city. Its quiet for the most part (you can only hear the sound of the famous band practicing). The housing process can be somewhat confusing if you don't know the dates of when certain paperwork is due. Also some of the dorms are very expensive so be mindful of the one you get/want.
College Sophomore,2,It really depends on what's happening. If two students have a disagreement then they'll usually work it out amongst themselves i.e fighting until campus police show up. However if things like drugs or drinking of any kind is happening the offenders run the risk of being permanently expelled.
College Sophomore,2,Our financial aid office doesnt really help as much as they should.
College Sophomore,2,The weather is humid and sometimes cold sometimes hot. It's to unpredictable.
College Junior,2,"There are not a lots of off campus close by, but there are apartment in different areas if you have transportation.  I whether have off campus housing because it is much cheaper.  Since my family want me on campus, I will stay on campus."
College Junior,2,SLOWWWWWW. I always just go to Starbucks or Crescent City.
College Junior,2,All fast food options. I hate that because some of us try to eat healthy!
College Junior,2,they need to be updated but it looks as though so renovation are occurring
College Freshman,2,"Grambling is pretty basic for most things, aside from the band, there really aren't too many unique things about it."
College Freshman,2,"weather is off and on, mornings are cool , maybe nice ,sunny ,raining are even warm in afternoons now. summers are nice some rain, but hot and sunny mostly during summer time. when weather is nice everyone can get an to classes ontime ."
College Sophomore,2,"The local atmosphere is not a good one. In order to go out to big events or to simply shop, the closest place is Monroe, La which is 30 minutes away."
College Sophomore,2,"Night life is pretty dead especially for persons who don't have their own vehicle, because this is required to get out to actually find a good place to hang, not many clubs and a couple bars which are really cool great hang out spots but I repeat only if you have a ride or can afford a taxi everytime which BTW stops running at midnight."
College Freshman,2,Grambling is the true definitin of a college town. It is a very small town with a college in it thats all. The town is so small there are only 5 stoplights. So there is no shopping or dinning places only activites are school sponsered.
College Freshman,2,"Greeks are normally treated like regular students. They can be seen just like anyone else, but they're not treated any differently. The Greeks usually have some of their own campus events but they're aren't exactly big news. There isn't any Greek Housing available at GSU, they stay in dorms or off-campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,Grambling received large cuts in their budget. Many professors were laid off as a result leaving few class options each semester. The workload is light but it may take more than four years to complete your degree if you do not take a heavy load. Most students study in crammed computer labs on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The places around campus are not for the health conscious student. During most visits to the dining hall, you will find pizza, burgers, and sometimes even nachos served for lunch and dinner. Most of the fruits and vegetables served are not fresh. Sometimes stir fry or pasta is available that allows you to pick and choose your own ingredients. Many students flock to the student union to indulge in Burger King, Starbucks and Panda Express using there flex dollars. I would encourage students to get a meal plan with more Tiger bucks to spend in the union than a plan with more weekly dining hall meals."
College Junior,2,"I feel like Grambling State University is too open, any outsider could come on campus being a intruder and you wouldn't be able to tell. I don't feel as secure in Grambling."
College Freshman,2,The Local Atomsphere around Grambling is not very great. Grambling is city as well as a school. I'm from Orlando and coming to Grambling was a big change especially since there are no big store around. There is plenty to do in the next city over in Ruston.
College Sophomore,2,Not the Best – The parking at Grambling is not always the best. It's best on the weekends when some students choose to go home. But during the week... you have to either be early or lucky to find good parking. The issue is there are not a suffient amount of parking spots for the amount of students that have cars on campus. The ratio of parking spots vs. cars is completely off.
College Sophomore,2,"It Is What It Is – Knowing the rules will get you by but knowing your ways around the policies will also get you by. But if you dont follow policies especially in the dorms, fines are issued and they range typically from $250-$1000. It just depends on the policy broken"
College Senior,2,"Pretty Strict – I understand the necessity for certain rules, like not allowing alcohol on campus and not allowing visitors in the dorms past a certain time. However, the housing department is pretty strict when it comes to disobeying certain rules, and you could pay dearly for it. The residential assistants check your rooms on a regular basis(they can come in your absence and late at night), and if they think your room is untidy (eg. if your bed is full of items and your desk is messy) they can charge you. It's around $100 dollars for an untidy room. That's just one rule, you can be charged for leaving items in your room at the end of the Spring semester, for not attending meetings, you can be locked out of meetings if you are a few minutes late and there are a million other rules you can be charged for. I don't have a car but I've heard that parking tickets are pretty expensive, and campas police are very strick about parking violations."
College Junior,2,"I do not drive as yet but i have seen from being in the passengers side and what friends have told me. with so much students attending school that drives and facalty members and other workers it is really hard to get a good parking close to classes buildings without a good walk that is free but those that are paying to be parked in different areas, most times out of 5days of classes they don't park in that area in which they pay for because it fills up so quickly. on average i think they could make more parking areas free that are closer to the students classes."
College Junior,2,"Student Involement in Sports – on average everyone loves to support the athletes if it comes at a price that it is free or affordable. Going to games is a some what must, fans and supporters in the college town comes on campus for the games and meets. as for support internationally of state wise is very poor due to the lack of funds. overall its good, it can be better. Don't get me wrong. there are days when everyone is goes all out for a particular sport or event but the way inwhich to inform everyone is poorly done."
College Freshman,2,I am not familiar with the Greek life at my school.
College Junior,2,"Needs to Be Improved – The problem with the school is money spending most of the facilities like the pool have been shut down. The air conditioning systems aren't always working. Overall, the school is good just needs to be more lively."
College Freshman,2,"Eveybody seem to look alike and dress alike. It's a historical black college so all you see is blacks. Some have different styles, but most of the time every body dress and do what everything the same."
College Sophomore,2,"there are alot of opportunities that are offered through internships,but they go real fast I haven't had one yet."
College Senior,2,"Yes, there are some great professors employed by Grambling State University. But for the most part, teachers don't take the time outside of classroom hours to make sure their students can reach them or have a clear understanding of what was taught in the previous class session."
College Sophomore,2,The guys and girls are nice enough but not friendly. Students are interested in having a good time. The dress is very causally hip and fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Reasonable Food Experience – The food in the cafeteria is not that bad but can be improved. Also, the eating areas are the same. We need  diverse dining options."
College Freshman,2,"The parties are really supposed to be for the college students,  but the parties thrown on campus have been known to have young kids, as well as older people."
College Freshman,2,Computer Labs – The computer labs are good and quick and easy to print things outs. But sometimes the computer labs are crowded with people occupying the computers with things not school related.
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of students on campus take or use drugs, especially marijuana."
College Freshman,2,"My Time Here – Grambling is an okay school but it is not the best. However, the cost and the benefits of being a student is wonderful. There are very rewarding activities to take part in."
College Freshman,2,"Inactive Greek – Greek life is not active at the school. Greek life should do better to improve the quality of student life at the school. They do engage in activities, which benefits the school but there is a lot more they can do."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty Decent – Grambling is a small area, so what's off campus may seem like on campus, too. There is Cains, Subway, and others. It's $7 for a burger, but you also get fries and a drink. Subway charges from $5 to $8 for a combo. At Cains, you have to pay extra for a soda but it's about $7 or $8 for a burger meal. There are many places in Ruston, but you will need a car to get there."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug Use – Well, it is clearly visible that the majority of students use marijuana. I do not know if there is peer pressure, but I have seen some students smoke in public. There is little police enforcement."
Junior,1,This school is very unprofessional and it does not seem like the administration cares about their students . There are also many renovations that need to be made to the buildings.
College Junior,1,Most apartments close to school are either too expenisve or the landlords do not keep their properties clean
College Junior,1,Going to ruston for food is a hassle ... especially for students without vehicles
College Sophomore,1,It's too much of an issue to finding a place
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid took longer than ever, and they lose half of the information you give them."
College Freshman,1,"It's the worst where i go to school at because we are in the country, which means there are always spiders,lizards and other sort of bugs found in my dorm. There aren't much to do here also, because we are in the country, like shopping. The only thing i do is workout and that is about the only thing there is to do and go to anything is held about sports.For ex. ""basketball, football,softball,baseball,and volleyball."" no one really likes soccer."
College Freshman,1,"To begin with, to get into the program at my school is very difficult. They lose your information, and care less about helping you until the last minute. Yes, they get applications pretty fast, and also respond pretty fast. I encountered many challenges throughout getting registered and being here. As you can see, with that being said they should do better, and communicate more with ""us"" students."
College Sophomore,1,"Grambling has one medical center. I got sick once and went there and they weren't very helpful, I would have been better off going to the hospital."
College Sophomore,1,"Grambling is a party school, meaning drugs and alcohol are everywhere. If you go one Friday night without seeing someone drinking or high you've accomplished something."
College Sophomore,1,Grambling only offers scholarships for select majors so choose your major wisely before applying.
College Sophomore,1,"There are only two clubs within walking distance of the campus and both are unsafe, unclean, and generally unsavory."
College Sophomore,1,The off campus apartments are run down and look more like cracker boxes than a suitable place to live.
College Freshman,1,Most out of state students don't receive anything. Grambling has no scholarships available and financial and doesn't help you at all
College Senior,1,theyre all about the tuition 
College Senior,1,Very secluded city.small town with nothing much to do
College Freshman,1,the school is isolated and if you don't have a car you are stranded here
College Freshman,1,It gets really hot around Aug. and Sep. If your not use to the heat it can really hinder your walks back and forth to classes. There aren't any shaded pathways.
College Sophomore,1,"There's not alot to do on campus at night.  This is a small country town and the nearest city is in Ruston, LA."
College Freshman,1,"McCall Dinning Hall needs major improvments! Students are served the same food everyday, no variety whats so ever!, they constantly give surveys and ask for feedback but never comply. Overall students living on campus  have no choice but to eat there so the food should be something tolerable!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most people are of the same race, religious background, and economic status. The campus is composed of mostly black students and staff. People here are open to different sexual orientations and often embrace it. There's a large Caribbean that hosts events to introduce students to their culture which is always exciting. It would be nice to see more races and cultures on campus."
College Junior,1,"On-Campus students aren't allowed to drive to class. If ticketed, it can be up to a $500 fine. Also, in residential areas, students DO NOT respect handicapped spots. They will park their regardless."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Expect to Get Money – Honestly, the school is more interested in taking your money, than giving you money. The financial Aid office is a mess, filled with workers that hate their jobs and just want to stress you out. It's a pain trying to even get a hold of anyone, and Grambling is known for ""accidently"" losing papers and misplacing things. Financial Aid will be your worst nightmare, the good thing is you're not the only one."
College Junior,1,"although it is transportation fees included in tution, half it not 96% of the students don't use the school buses because they have time management or running time schedule is when  most students have classes thus to most students its a waste of money. also even students who live off campus have to pay that fee and don't use the school buses at all."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid process is really intense and many people in the financial aid office is extremely rude and give you the run around.
College Sophomore,1,"If You Dont Have a Car You Are Not Going Anywhere – If you do not have a care it would be impossible to get around. Everything is in the next town which is 5 minutes away. Walmart, Food Shopping, Banks, Shopping, everything is so far away"
College Freshman,1,"I dont like the idea of the housing with the boys and girls so close together, It was so much diffeent when i went to school boys were allowed in the girls rooms back then only at a certain time now they come all the time all thr the day and night, and you cant really study in your room for all the noise they make, and no room monitors no house mothers.  It is so different from what i thought it would be, My daughter  did come to get an education but its hard with no peace. All others are pretty good....This is a mother voicing her disapproval."
College Freshman,1,"I'm a student-athelete. I play soccer for Grambling, but I wont be returning in the fall semester because I really don't like my surroundings."
College Freshman,1,You dont get scholarships here unless you are an athlete
College Freshman,1,Sun and Rain – The weather here is so unpredictable. One day it was storming and raining then about thirty min later it was super hot!!!!In the winter months they cancel class for the smallest reasons
College Junior,1,The library is in need of an upgrade. The books are outdated. All the students complain and hardly use the facility as its useless.
College Freshman,1,It takes you only to certain places and the hours are not great. The people driving the bus are sometimes mean.
College Freshman,1,"Fines Are Severe – There is a fine for everything. Parking in faculty parking lots, not having a student decal, walking in opposite sex dorm, and noise complaints are not as severe, but smoking and drinking are!"
College Senior,1,"Tarnsportation Is Lacking – Public transportation is really bad around Grambling. They have one bus that run at certain times, and the hours aren't too flexible."
College Sophomore,1,"Level of Participation – Greek organizations are pretty hard to join, sign-up fees are huge, and you have to go through some initiations before you join the rest of them. There are benefits but they are minimal. Most students don't participate because of the disadvantages."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Do – Grambling is a very small town in between two major cities in Louisiana. You must go out of the city to get to most activities, and it is not a party city at all. The only thing in Grambling to visit is the school, so it's very boring."
College Sophomore,1,"At Gram, you can do basically whatever you please. You could never attend any of your class and won't get kicked out. You could fight, drink, and smoke without any consequences. Although, I will say this: If you're caught (probably won't happen) doing anything against school rules during fall or spring semesters, they will discipline you harshly."
College Senior,1,There is little to no parking and you can get ticketed everywhere you park.
College Sophomore,1,"A Lot of Smoking – There are drugs on campus. Marijuana is the most popular. It's smoked at parties, in rooms, and even outside."
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife at Grambling State does not exist. The only ""club"" that's near campus looks like a warehouse. Most parties are far off campus and you have to find your own transportation."
College Freshman,1,"Discount Not Worth It – It's mainly all fast food and two buffets, three of which offer student discounts. You'll find the usual: Burger King, Taco Bell, etc.-nothing fancy."

Junior,5,My major is an all hands on experience so online classes aren't really an option. We transitioned to online due to COVID-19 and I honestly didn't like it. I felt like I was missing out on so much.

Sophomore,5,"Although online learning has been difficult, the professors have been helpful and understanding in these difficult times."
Junior,5,"Half of my spring semester was online. Considering the classes that I was taking, MSU did a very good job with handling it. I was taking chemistry, physics, biology, and some veterinary classes that all had labs. The professors handled the classes well, regardless of the boundaries."
Junior,5,"The main reason that I chose this college is because it is a medium sized campus.  This has many great advantages such as a good community, wonderful classes, and it's just a better environment. With all of this, studying has been easier for me to do, whether I need to talk to a professor or if I need to go to the library."
Senior,5,"learning online made things easier to remember because teachers dont waste time to type things that arent important , it really highlights the important information!"
Freshman,5,Everyone is so nice and made me feel welcome as a future student.  MSU has a well established Agricultural Education program.  My desire and dream are to become an AG teacher and touch the lives of young through FFA.
Freshman,5,Murray State University overall has been an amazing experience so far. I am so thrilled and excited to continue my education for these next few years. The academics and the programs that are offered at Murray State are so broad basically anyone could go here. The environment is so positive everyone is accepted and the safety is so enforced walking at night is not a problem. The housing feels so at home it is basically a home away from home. My roommate is my best friend and I never would have met her without coming to Murray State and deciding to choose to live on the campus.
Niche User,5,"Murray State University has a beautiful campus. I'm especially impressed with the Hutson School of Agriculture, were I'll be spending a great deal of time as a pre-vet student. The campus is quiet and cozy and there is everything a college student needs in the surrounding community."
Freshman,5,"I was in love with Murray State as soon as I took my first tour with the Women's Head Golf Coach. All the staff made me feel welcome and were very friendly. The athletic facilities are great along with the dorms. Both are updated and clean. The new building for biology, chemistry, and engineering is pristine and gorgeous. After looking at multiple colleges, I knew that Murray was the best overall."
Alum,5,I attended Murray State University during my undergraduate and postgraduate 2012-2017. I really enjoyed my time at the school. I was traditional and non- traditional. The professors were caring and encouraging.

Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere and the location. It's absolutely stunning and the people there are nothing short of amazing.
Niche User,5,They strive to keep you feeling like you are at home and they are super friendly but keep it professional.
Freshman,5,"I couldn’t of found any better place for college, this is a small campus and the professors are excellent!"
Niche User,5,"Murray is a small connected campus which makes it easy to make new friends. The food is average but with the new Chick-fil-a added, it will be the best in Kentucky for sure! Most dorms are big and spacious, and they give you a variety of options to chose on how you live your dorm life. Personally, Murray is close to home which makes me love it even more. Being close to home makes me a little bit more comfortable and not as homesick. Overall, Murray offers classes for so many different programs and is very good to accommodate your schedule needs. However, the food in the dining hall is where it goes kind of down hill. On the bright side, I lost 10 pounds in three weeks!"
Sophomore,5,Murray is a wonderful school in a wonderful town. You can not go wrong here. There is a 15 to 1 faculty to staff ratio and they are very helpful to assist you it making your dream career a reality.
Niche User,5,"Murray State University is a great university because they offer a variety of majors and minors. Not to mention, they really help students who need financial aid to make sure finance is not an issue for students' education. The class sizes are actually pretty small which allows students to seek more help and establish close relations with the amazing professors. There are a very diverse group of people, therefore, it allows students to communicate with people of different backgrounds and create stronger relations with new people which is one of my favorite parts about Murray State University."
Alum,5,"Murray State University failed to disappoint myself, and also my father. I visited while attending a soccer ID camp. While driving through the campus, on the way to the soccer field, I immediately felt a feeling of safety, happiness, and calmness. Considering I am an 18 year old girl, safety is a main priority while thinking of college campuses. While touring the campus, I fell in love with the overall scenery."
Freshman,5,Murray State is a well divers school and had something for everyone that comes here. Alumni of this school came and join the current students for community events that the students put together. Overall Murray State is an amazing school to attend.
Graduate Student,5,"Biology hands-on opportunity is higher here due to the lakes surrounding the campus. Murray State has plenty of social, club, and academic opportunities. Professors try their best to aid their students into a career right after graduation."

Freshman,5,I love Murray state. I went to summer orenintation and it was amazing. All of the counselors were amazing.
Sophomore,5,Greek Life is amazing!! T-Room has the BEST food!! The Murray community is nice every time I step off campus because people are so friendly!!
Junior,5,"Murray State's close community is definitely one of its biggest draws. The university isn't small, there are always new people to meet, but the class sizes allow students to have personal relationships with their professors that are essential to academic success and comfort. There are activities and organizations for every interest, whether that be Greek life or fencing. Murray State has the best of both worlds, all while providing a quality education that allows its students to pursue their passions and meet their goals."
Freshman,5,"The campus of MSU is very home some to me. I am comfortable with the space and size of the campus; it's not too crowded. The academics are very well put together and professors teaching you are very experienced in their skills. The faculty staff are helpful for any needs or questions you might have, and they focus a lot on getting you where you like to go in your future career."
Freshman,5,"Murray State University is a great school. I came here as a transfer student and i absolutely love it. The food is hit & miss but other than that everything is great. The dorm life is even good. Most dorms, you have your own bathroom in your room or you share a bathroom with the person or people next door to you. I love having my own bathroom and not community bathrooms. I think Murray State could really improve on the advisors. My advisor is so rude and he does not care about the student just about himself or how the professor would feel. I just wish I had a better professor because mine is very rude. Other than that, I love Murray State. I picked the best college to come to. Granted its not the best place because there’s not a lot of stuff to do in Murray, but the college itself its a really good school. The people are nice, and the professors are nice and they are very understanding."
Senior,5,"Murray State University has been like a home to me. Being in a small town, there is just a southern hospitality. The teachers and staff are so friendly and caring. All of the professors I have had put in numerous hour on and off campus for their students. MSU was a wonderful school choice for me and I cannot imagine going anywhere else. My degree program has done a great job preparing me for my career."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful school with great staff and educational programs. The teachers are generally very good at explaining the content in a way that is understandable. All the facility are very nice and easy to work with, and will try to work with you however they can."
Graduate Student,5,"Wonderful acedemics. This university is invested in it's students and takes into account their opinions. I have enjoyed my time here and will continue to honor this school. The food is high quality, or the most part. The student activities arw abundant and easily found. I felt welcome in any aspect I decided on."
Freshman,5,"I personally love it out here! The campus is beautiful, there's plenty to do, and the area is mostly flat so it doesn't take you too long to get across campus to any of your classes. It has a very homey feel to it and a great community of students."
Freshman,5,I love the nursing professor and I'm so excited to attend Fall 2019. The food is so amazing and there's a lot to choose from. Murray is not a big university but there are enough students to give a good campus life.
Niche User,5,"I am a senior at Marshall County high school, and a racer academy student, at Murray State University. Every Friday I travel to Murray to take two courses on campus. Since I have been spending time on the beautiful campus, and get to see the amazing professors, I know this is where I want to continue my education."
Sophomore,5,"Murray State is the place to go if you are looking for helpful, accessible, friendly people! Whether you are contacting an office here or speaking with a professor, you can expect quality conversations. I have been in three dorms, from the most expensive to an average, older one, and all three have been great! Murray State has become my home away from home and I am so glad I decided to come here."
Junior,5,I just started at Murray State as a transfer student from military college. The place is great. They provide a good transfer program where everyone who is involved is very helpful. The classes are nice with great instructors. Great student environment. Everyone is kind. The food is great. Overall a really nice place and I am glad to have picked it!
Niche User,5,The campus is absolutely breathtaking. Everyone is very welcoming and the community is amazing! Everyone at Murray is there to support you and answer any question you have. As you tour around campus people say hello to you and make you feel like you belong there.
Freshman,5,"A very welcoming college with so many friendly people. I was worried about a smaller university at first, but this campus came to be my new home in less than a week. I’m so glad that I picked Murray, because since I’ve got here, I’ve only been more determined to get my degree."
Sophomore,5,"Murray State University is a fantastic place to learn and have your college experience. The staff is always friendly and helpful, throwing events for the whole campus to get together and enjoy. The professors are extremely involved in ensuring the success of your studies and even willing to make time in their busy days to make sure you are progressing successfully in not only their course but in your whole area of study of well.
One of the things that drew me to this university was the representatives that came to my high school when we had a college fair. The representatives were nice, outgoing and could tell you about any area of study they offer.It was extremely helpful in making a decision because they were very open to questions and even went the extra mile to get back to you if they didn't;t have the answer right away. Murray State goes the extra mile in everything to ensure your college experience is a positive one."
Senior,5,I feel my school has great students and friendly teachers. It has really helped me decide what career I wanted to pursue.
Junior,5,My experiences at Murray is great. The community are very welcoming and nice. The campus is beautiful and the staff are very helpful to our needs.
Freshman,5,I’m just finishing my freshman year at Murray and I am very happy with my decision to attend this college. The small class sizes make it easy to communicate with your professors and they genuinely care about you succeeding. This is a very friendly place!
Senior,5,"I am a Senior at Murray State University studying Communication Disorders. I have loved my time here at MSU and have had a much better experience since transferring here. The community is small but the most friendly and polite people that you will ever meet. Our college has a lot of pride and President Davies is the best. He is very involved in the college community and the student's lives. It is not rare that you will see him walking around campus conversing with the students. One thing that I would change is the campus food arrangements. It is nice to have Winslow cafeteria and all of its options, but sometimes I wish that we had some chain restaurants to choose from."
Freshman,5,The campus is great at making anyone feel like they are at home. I feel comfortable and safe here daily.
Sophomore,5,"I love Murray State with a burning passion! The community they've built on campus is amazingly homey and comforting. There are always people willing to talk to you and it's a smaller school so there aren't a million people on campus, which helps. When you come in as a freshman, you get to do great beginnings which is basically just a giant ice breaker and really helps to get you started in that homey vibe. A very diverse population on campus and so many services I probably don't even know all of them, including free counseling services and free gym."
Senior,5,I have loved my experience at Murray State! Through the rigorous curriculum and excellent professors I feel prepared for life after graduation!
Sophomore,5,"Murray State University has a very friendly campus. It's so nice to walk around campus and be able to say hi to your friends.  The professors are always willing to help you and they are at the top of their game. You're learning from the best here. There's something for everyone here. One thing I would like to see changed is the rule about guests after nine pm Sunday-Thursday. This is college, not high school and I think if you're paying to stay here, you should be able to have whoever you want, whenever you want."
Niche User,5,"The campus is fantastic, I utterly love it. It makes me feel at home and the students there are very nice and welcoming from what I've experienced. They have a great gym, a small class size, and lots of students:professor interactions. I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a great college with a good accounting or engineering program."
Freshman,5,"Murray State University is a very safe and positive university. All of the staff and professors on campus are kind, love their jobs, and are good at what they do. Student life is very welcoming and positive and there are always activities happening on campus to get people of all backgrounds together."
Junior,5,My experience at Murray State has been great. The professors for the most part are great and cooperative. The area is nice and everything is really flexible.
Freshman,5,"Murray State University is a great place to go. The faculty, staff, and students are all very nice and helpful. The campus is beautiful. You have multiple opportunities for free stuff and extra help. I would definitely recommend it. It's like one big family, especially in housing."
Freshman,5,The community is great. The campus is gorgeous. The professors are willing to help and work with anyone who needs help.
Freshman,5,"Murray State so far has been the best choice I have ever made in my life. Murray itself is one of the best campuses I have ever been on. Everyone is super sweet and nice, the professors wants all their students to succeed in life. They are all willing to work with their students as much as possible to get them where they want to be. The other students on campus are just as nice. If someone needs help and they are alone a person could easily ask someone passing by for help and they would gladly help. All together the whole community surrounding Murray is the best place you will ever find. It truly is a college town and that is in a best way possible."
Sophomore,5,"As a transfer student I thought making friends and fitting in would be hard, but all of the students here were very welcoming! The professors also genuinely care about the students and want to see them succeed."
Niche User,5,"On my visit I absolutely loved Murray! The college and the town are both great, full of friendly faces with a plethora of surrounding opportunities."
Niche User,5,I went over the summer for the Common Wealth honors academy. It was an amazing experience. They professors keep you engaged and really care about their students. They take pride in educating their students. The campus is very safe and very clean. There is also a lot of diversity.
Junior,5,"I love how the academic buildings are separated from the residential buildings, but still close.  I also enjoy the campus environment and community."
Sophomore,5,Murray State University is an outstanding university that ensures the success of each student.  The dedication of the professors is clearly seen in the success of each student.  The campus is well kept and everybody is extremely friendly.
Graduate Student,5,"Great school. Great campus. Great class sizes. I loved my time here. Take advantage of the student events, greek life, and get involved on campus."
Junior,5,"Great atmosphere, great chance to succeed, and great chance to get involved on campus. There are always people coming to talk to you, or that you see on your way to class. There are at least 100 different clubs/sports/programs that you can get involved in and the campus is always buzzing with excitement about something.  Overall, wonderful school."
Sophomore,4,"I haven’t had many problems. Most of the faculty and staff I've met are amazing and accepting, students are a hit or miss really."
Sophomore,4,"This year, with COVID, two of my classes are through zoom and both of my teachers for those classes are handling it amazingly."
Senior,4,"Wonderful, caring staff. They hike the tuition up every year, but it's still cheaper than going instate in Indiana. Great Japanese program!"
Junior,4,My professors did their very best with helping and zooming classes. Online classes were made easier for me than difficult. They were always available to help.
Senior,4,"I loved all the activities on campus, there is so much to do all the time, there are so many opportunities for students and a million organizations that not only do things for their members, but also do stuff for the entire student body. One thing that can change is getting a restraining order for that guy who keeps harassing students and telling them they are going to hell for wearing leggings . Also, Less student teachers please. the student biology teachers do not help students at all ."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere and community at Murray State University! Everyone feels right at home there, and makes sure that the new incoming students do as well. I feel safe on campus, and there is always activities to do to make sure you're getting out of your dorm and having fun while making friends. They have great Greek Life opportunities. They even provide free therapy to any student struggling with absolutely anything."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed face to face classes at Murray. I have switched to online due to home needs.  I have had some fantastic teachers for the most part. The academic material has been beyond my expectations in each class I have taken over the past two years.  I highly recommend Murray for science majors.
Alum,4,"Food is getting better, dorms are average. Small town but very nice community. Professors actually care. Students are friendly and helpful. Basketball school. Highly recommend. You will meet friends and you will have a good time."
Sophomore,4,I feel very at home at Murray. The professors really seem to care about their students. It's nice when you can say hello to a professor in the quad and you're not just another face.
Freshman,4,It's a pretty good sized campus but not too big to where it's crazy so you can still meet a lot of new people
Junior,4,"I believe Murray State's communication professors are quality humans with impressive experience. Their abilities to teach and make class interesting is imperative to my love for this school. However, I do wish the community would branch out. There are not many things for college students to do in Murray, Kentucky. Furthermore, I also believe one of the major downsides to life on campus is the old 20th century dorms. I think MSU's potential is not able to be reached because it is not investing into the needs of new students. Younger generations have a higher standard of living and expectation for fun, and they compare these qualities with other universities."
Freshman,4,Im still an Freshman and incoming freshman but I’m having and good experience. The Professor also really cares about the student and their success. But the Financial aid office is an sort of funny. It’s takes forever for them too check on your loans.  They miss place your money sometimes and comes up with prices of amounts of money you owe. After the fact you seen the ebill. Also the food isn’t that really good but they make freshman be on a meal plan with a choice . Also we have too pay an large amount as $100-$300 for a parking sticker when we play about $8000 for an semester.  Then we have food we have too pay for with our “ Flex dollars “ when we’re paying For a regular nachos or taco. But chick fla is sort of free with the meal plans when they should be charging flex dollars for it. Instead of switching the taco and nachos place to straight flex dollar
Freshman,4,"As a Freshman at Murray State University I have experienced a diverse group of not only students, but professors as well. Murray State University is a college that I would and have readily recommended to those who interested in the continuation of their education. While Murray is a smaller school it is not one to be overlooked. This University offers a wide range of courses and a plethora of resources to achieve ones goals while enrolled and even once graduated."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Murray State thus far. The campus is great and the people are friendly. I have not had the full experience yet since I am only a freshman, but all the professors I've had so far have been knowledgeable and dedicated to helping their students succeed."
Freshman,4,"Though the campus is relatively large, there is a closeness about the student body. There truly is a place for everyone who wants to get to know people and also plenty of places for those who don’t care to mingle. Academically, I was very impressed my first semester. The professors are so far incredibly attentive and knowledgeable but also very likable. I worried about the reputation that some public schools have, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they take academics very seriously and you won’t find a party in sight unless you really want to find one. Lastly, the food was a big concern I had when leaving home, but Murray state offers many great options as well as a Chick fil A on campus. The town of Murray also has any type of restaurant you can imagine within walking distance of the school. Overall, I wonderful place to be, one that people always respond fondly to hearing the name of in conversation."
Freshman,4,Murray State University has great programs to involve new students in the campus life. They make you feel like you’re at home. I am currently on break right now and can’t wait to go back to school. Murray has great professors that are very passionate about what they teach. The Greek Life at Murray State University is beyond amazing. Everyone can find their home at one of the sorority or fraternities.
Sophomore,4,"Murray State is pretty cool. I came for Racer Band and am staying for Racer Band. The departments are pretty okay, some are extremely toxic though. I enjoy being on campus, it is like a home away from home. If it wasn't for my poor experiences with people and terrible professors I would give it a 5 star, but I genuinely enjoy the college culture and everything they try to do for us."
Junior,4,"This will be my first year in Murray State. So far, my experiences have been great. This only thing I have seen so far is the communication hasn't been great, but that is understandable due to it being a large campus."
Freshman,4,"Murray State is a great middle ground for those who can’t find where they belong in either a small community college or large private university. It is very much average as far as campus, student body, and class size, but it turns out average is pretty great. The surrounding community is small but incredibly welcoming and comfortable. Every professor so far is not only professional but also personable. There are a million different student organizations and clubs that are extremely active and offer a place for everyone. The price was the best for any state school I found, and though it isn’t a private college, being a part of the honors community gives the feeling that you are part of a smaller and more refined group of people. The only thing I could complain about is the lack of parking, which truly reflects well on the school because the student body is growing so fast they can’t keep up construction-wise. Overall, it’s been truly a great place to be."
Sophomore,4,"Campus is always well maintained, the people are very friendly. The housing makes sure you feel welcomed and wanted. My advisor was very friendly and helped me with every question I had."
Niche User,4,"I was an undergrad student from Spring 2012 to Summer 2013, joined the military and transferred my credits to Cornell University. This school is competing and compares to the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky, but I would definitely recommend it for any first-timer going to college. The food is phenomenal! You won't ever go hungry or be bored with their food choices, as well as the mini food mart next to it. Students are the most friendly people I've ever met, greek life thrives on campus, one of the best basketball teams in the Ohio Valley Conference and a select few dorms are very good!"
Junior,4,I love the small town that it is located in. The professors and staff are always nice and welcoming.
Junior,4,"Murray State is the best school in Kentucky for the price! I enjoy going here so much and truly believe there is something for everyone. My major and minor are an unlikely pair, but the professors and academic advisors truly want you to succeed and have made me feel like my decision is perfect for me. I wouldn't want to attend anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"I love it at Murray. I have had a wonderful time meeting new friends and fantastic professor's. The dining hall, Winslow, is not the best and apparently cannot label allergies but other than that it is quite a good campus."
Freshman,4,It is a very welcoming environment and always makes you feel like you are part of a big family. It is especially nice for those who are further away from home. The staff is always there to help and support you in your academics. Super friendly and nice.
Junior,4,I love how friendly and helpful everyone is on and off campus? The only thing I would change is more things to do on and off campus.
Senior,4,"Friendly students, friendly professors, I have helpful professors. I like the environment of the area, there is good options access to stores and good food. Currently however, my college program (Computer Science) is short on faculty and has to share buildings with Accounting and Business, and the program as a result offers 4 classes only in the Fall and 4 in the Spring. If the program had more funding, maybe it could grow and even have its own building."
Sophomore,4,"Overall a very good establishment. The professors are always willing to help and answer questions, and are always willing to meet one on one. Some things are over priced on campus, but that is about it."
Freshman,4,"Murray is an extremely friendly town with a beautiful campus. The staff is very professional, easy to work with, and want to see their students succeed. However, it is a very small university  and does not have the resources like some of the bigger state schools."
Sophomore,4,"So far I’ve had a good experience at Murray State. The majorities of my professors so far have been extremely good at their job, and they’re happy to explain whatever you don’t understand. The class sizes are also relatively small, which is a big help.  The dorm rooms aren’t great, but most dorm rooms aren’t. It’s also difficult to get into the dorm you want as a freshman, since current students take priority. On-campus freshman are required to have an unlimited meal plan for Winslow dining hall. The food there isn’t bad, but it gets boring really quickly. As for student life, there are almost too many clubs and organizations to count. If you know where to look, it’s easy to find a good fit for you. Don’t be afraid to ask around and get as involved as possible. School is a lot of work, but it’s a lot of fun too!"
Freshman,4,"I would change the parking. Maybe add more and charge less .i love that I can live on campus and walk to my classes. I love the town of murray, as well. The atmosphere is close knit and protected."
Niche User,4,"Everyone you talk to is very informative and always has good things to say about the campus. Since I know I'm going to Murray State and I've already been accepted, they always have someone from their staff emailing me making sure I know about upcoming events and things I need to know."
Sophomore,4,"The small town atmosphere truly makes Murray State feel like home.  The teachers, students, and residents of Murray are so friendly and welcoming, making the transition to college so much easier.  The class sizes are small and manageable, adding to the adequate learning environment.  There are many options for dorm living, food, and activities.  The large variety adds a place for everyone to find something to do.  Most professors truly want to help and see you succeed."
Freshman,4,"I visited and everyone was on nice and friendly, you could really tell the professors cared about you and put your needs ahead of yours. The campus was super pretty and the students all were super helpful"
Freshman,4,Murray State University feels like a home away from home. The people here are so kind and the professors actually want to see you succeed.
Junior,4,"What I love about MSU are the various opportunities, the music business program, the classes provided, and the community. 

Something I would like to see changed is the way the transfer center works and how Murray State University handles transfer paperwork in general. Currently, when transferring to MSU the student has to contact multiple people in various offices to get the paperwork needed. It is very time consuming and tiring. In addition, the transfer center needs to be trained to work faster. It has been over 7 months since I sent my paperwork and my credits still have not been transferred."
Senior,4,"Friendly staff. Friendly students. Diverse in offered courses, majors, and minors. Only real issue is that acceptance GPA is 1.75, wish it would be higher."
Freshman,4,"Murray State University is perfect for anyone who wants to go to school in a small town setting. The professors are more than willing to help their students learn and grow and the university provides many on-campus employment opportunities. Overall, Murray State University is a great school built upon an even greater community."
Niche User,4,Murray State University is a spectacular educational administration.  The professors are wonderful. They consider Individual Education Programs for each student. I appreciate how much time the faculty spends making lesson plans that meet the needs of every  student.
Junior,4,"From my experience with Murray State, I would like to see the change of how admissions is done. I had issues with admissions due to the fact that my ACT score was low. I would like for the admissions to focus less on test scores because that doesn’t prove what a student is capable of and once I got accepted after an interview, i told myself that I wouldn’t want any one else to get in that situation. I want everyone to have the opportunity to learn and grow as an individual at Murray State! Overall though, the community is amazing and the feel of campus makes you feel home away from home. If someone is thinking about Murray State, I would definitely reccomend it for them."
Sophomore,4,"Murray State University has great academics and student life. The people in this city are just so nice that they make you love living here! I have made some great friends whom I will never forget. My only complaint is the lack of things to do; however, it is easy to make your own fun with the people at this university."
Sophomore,4,Murray State University has an amazing environment. The students and staff are very friendly. There are so many opertunities involved when you attended Murray.
Freshman,4,I love how hopeful the staff is but I hate how they don't have better emergency plans for disabled students.
Senior,4,This university feels small but has many opportunities. They have almost any program you could want and all the help a student needs to succeed in college.
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and how beautiful it is. The food has gotten a lot better as well. I do love how close it is to the lake and i love the games and wellness center it provides  to ease the school stree.
Freshman,4,Murray state was an outgoing place. There is a place fore everyone here and no matter the class everyone reached out to make new friends. Making Murray a very easy place to make friends. Pulling all nighters with a new study group for each class each semester was always fun.
Sophomore,4,"It felt like home at times and the professors seem to actually care about the students, a 15 to 1 student:teacher ratio means that teachers will email students individually as to why they’re missing and will help with a solution."
Sophomore,4,"I honestly love going to Murray State University. The classes are challenging yet realistic, and professors really try to connect with you and help you in any way that they can to ensure that you understand the material."
Sophomore,4,It's a nice campus and has lots of good scholarship and study abroad opportunities. It is generally affordable compared to other universities. It feels like a safe place.
Senior,4,"MSU has a very ""homey"" feel. It is comforting for those who come from small towns and a nice change of pace for those who come from large cities. There are plenty of eating establishments and coffeehouses essential for college students. Everything on campus is close together, so you do not have to walk for miles and miles to get to class/food/dorms. The class size is smaller than what would be at a larger institution, so the professors have more time to work with you one on one. The faculty/staff is very helpful and concerned for your future. It is a wonderful place to attend school."
Sophomore,4,"Murray State University is your one-stop-shop when it comes to education. Between the affordability, diversity of majors/minors, Greek life, and student opportunities, it is easy to love it here and be involved!"
Sophomore,4,"Amazing community - professors genuinely care about their students. The advisors are there when you have questions or concerns and the campus, in general, is good at bringing students together. Plus the campus is not huge so walking to classes isn’t difficult and the scenery is beautiful."
Senior,4,"Murray State University is a very good college choice for me. They offer online courses which work very good for me being a non-traditional student. I attend the Regional Campus in Hopkinsville, which is close to home. I have three grown children and four grandchildren. My daughter earned her Bachelor's degree, working on her Master's, and my oldest son is finishing his Bachelor's degree. After raising my family, I felt that it was my turn to earn my degree. Murray State offers a very flexible schedule program for Bachelor's degree in Integrated Studies. I am in the Health Care Administration field of study."
Niche User,4,I have many friends who attend Murray State and they have always talked highly of it. I was not going to the college I was meant for and I found Murray State and I have been to many events there and seen the academics to know that it is the fit for me.
Freshman,4,I love the beautiful campus and how friendly the people are. I'd like to see Murray offer more activities on the weekends.
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers at Murray generally want to see you succeed. There are some tough courses but that is to be expected at a college or university. Greek life there is amazing as well as the clubs and other activities on campus. Some of the dorms are old but overall the dorm life is good. The Winslow dining hall is not that great and I would like to see better options in the future.
Freshman,4,"Everyone is so friendly in Murray, KY. That's exactly what you need when you are new to the whole college thing. They go out of their way to help you in any way that they can. It's a diverse place and there is something to do for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Murray State University has excellent professors. It is not fully safe at night, however. The professors at the university are helpful. I plan to transfer. The people are nice and the RA's at the residential colleges are good people."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is pretty chill on campus. Everything is pretty close, and they have a pretty good diversity of things to do. The art program is really good, and the teachers really want to help you."
Senior,4,"The campus itself is pretty nice. The area of the town, not so much. The food on campus is boring too. Most of the people are friendly on campus except for those in fraternities. The professors are very nice too."
Senior,2,"Online was fine, but some professors just give up and don't do anything or they assign extra busy work because they think online is too easy. It's not great, but I don't necessarily think they're at fault."
Senior,2,"Murray State is a cheaper option, but they nickel and dime students every opportunity they get. The staff and professors are fine, but occasionally you will get a terrible teacher that they can't afford to get rid of. Their parking and housing services are the definition of brutal and so are the people in the billing office. Overall, if you can spend the extra grand or two to go to UK or U of L, it would be worth it. The college experience is pretty minimal and definitely not the best."
Senior,2,"I'm bad at online classes, so I'm not a good judge, but they're pretty rough. It's probably because the Professors were thrown into it and don't know what they're doing yet."
Niche User,2,Online classes were not very involved. Teachers were mostly unavailable when help was needed and the assignments felt more like busywork than anything educational.
Alum,2,I had a wonderful time in the English department and my mentor for costume design was fantastic. The professional and personal dynamics of the rest of the theatre department were incredibly harmful and toxic. They led to various mental and emotional health issues.
College Sophomore,2,I have no confidence in anything health and safety related.
College Freshman,2,Here you really have to know some-one in order to get a great job or internship.
College Senior,2,"Regional campus in Henderson Kentucky needs to accommodate security for students, during evening and night classes."
College Sophomore,2,You can apply for a lot of scholarships and basically receive none.
College Senior,2,"This has been one of my only bad experiences at Murray State University. There always seems to be some issue in this department.   I'm not the only one who encounters problems, either; I know of two other people who have issues every semester."
College Senior,2,"A lot of the locals don't seem to like students ""encroaching"" upon their territory. Shopping and dining options aren't all that diverse. If you want to enjoy a decent meal or go shopping, you almost HAVE to drive to either Clarksville or Paducah."
College Senior,2,About 1/4 of students are involved in Greek life. The chapters are very much like high school with their cliques of students and fit the unfortunate stereotypes of American frats and sororities.The frat houses are better than most campuses.
College Senior,2,"I don't feel safe at all anywhere on campus after dark. I was stalked last year, a friend was raped, and another was choked outside her apartment. Campus security tries to be helpful, but it just isn't enough."
College Senior,2,"If you're an in-state student, financial aid is pretty straightforward and is easily attainable. Out of state students tend to have a lot of issues with getting enough aid, and actually having it show up on their accounts. If you come from out of state, plan to get to know the people in the financial aid and bursar's offices!"
College Senior,2,"Many students don't seem to be interested in academic achievement or actually learning. Classes that don't require attendance are almost always very empty, except on exam days. Student appearances are rather homogenous and most students belong to a certain 'clique.'"
College Senior,2,"Unless you're involved with greek life, there aren't much in the way of parties. There are very few local bars and the drinks are expensive."
College Senior,2,"All guests to the dorm must be checked in at the front desk, escorted by a dorm resident at all times, and present ID to the RA at the desk, no matter how brief their visit. You are also limited to the number of guests (2) that you are allowed to have. Parking is a huge issue and the officers are extremely quick to ticket for any/all violations, sometimes even if you aren't doing anything wrong. Tickets can be appealed, but are rarely, if ever overturned."
College Senior,2,"If you don't tend to fit within the realms of what is considered 'normal' or typical' in some manner, it can be a real challenge here. The school is very ""clique""-ish."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the campus dorms are terrible. Example walls are thin, limited space, walls and floors are not that good. The bathrooms need updating, more space in the shower would be great. But other than the few people that talk loud its okay."
College Freshman,2,"It is hard for middle class, white, students to receive any aid."
College Sophomore,2,Finding help for twins of a single mother is hard and gives me a headache.
College Sophomore,2,"For students you have the ""public transit"" aka the school buses. They take you around town, from Wal-mart all the way to the hospital (from one side of town to the other). There's no public transportation like city buses, but you can call Murray transit to take you somewhere. Usually only older people tend to use the Murray Transit. We also have cabs, but they're expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"The only dedicated off-housing there is in relation to the campus are the campus suites. It's so high price that not many people use it, to my knowledge, unless you're ""a rich kid that mommy and daddy pay for your room"". A couple years ago there were some kids going around stealing and slashing tires at the campus suites, which turned off a lot of people from staying there. It's also located in the strangest of places, down the road from Lowes. That's a little far from campus, in my opinion. "
College Freshman,2,Theres literally nothing fun to do in Murray except go to the movies. Theres no clubs just bars that you have to be of age to get in to.
College Freshman,2,Since Murray has over populated the dorms you can hardly find a parking spot close to your dorm if you live in the main circle. The parking for commuter students is very low and fills up quickly.
College Freshman,2,The new visitation policy in the dorms is crazy. You have a certain time period when guests are allowed. It really takes away your freedom of becoming an adult and coming to college. The drinking on campus is very strict especially in the dorms..
College Freshman,2,If you're over twenty one theres a few bars but for anyone under 18 then youre pretty much stuck to greek parties if you can get in or find one off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have your own lap top, don't expect to go to the library to write an essay or do homework, more than not most of them are already taken by students on social media pages and playing games between classes."
College Freshman,2,"It's practically impossible to find parking if you're a commuter, and if you do find parking it's usually some where you're not allowed to park so it's either get a parking tag or be late to class."
College Freshman,2,I love athletics and wants be a part of school team but even i am state level winnner from my country i cant be able to play sports here just because they dont want more player they full . this is really bad .
College Freshman,2,"Not much well , it is good only for the students who eat non vegeterian but not good for students who prefer vegeterian."
College Freshman,2,"The amount of attractions in Murray, Kentucky is very limited. If somebody wants good shopping or to go see a sports team they have to drive about an hour. The locals in Murray are always friendly and polite towards students and safety is strictly enforced."
College Sophomore,2,They are really strict about tickets for cars. Also the residential colleges are strict on guest policy and it really bothers me.
College Junior,2,"The food is decent, but there are only one dining hall on campus and one small lunch hall."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is crazy competitive if you're a sophomore or above. There isn't much parking around the dorms, so you have to really search for a spot sometimes. If you're a freshman you have to park at the stadium, which has lots of space and isn't too far, but you have to walk up a fairly steep hill every time."
College Junior,2,"A year ago I felt a great deal of pride in admitting that I attended Murray State; after all, the campus is gorgeous, the atmosphere is electric, and the faculty and staff involved in most of the academic and extracurricular programs are wonderful. However, as of late, I've been very frustrated with my school board's ability (or rather lack of) to handle money--a mismanagement which puts students like me in a difficult dilemma. Because the school's recruiting students faster than it can accommodate them, there's no longer enough computers in the labs to go around, the housing situation is atrocious, student jobs are almost impossible to obtain, tuition/dorm fees are climbing by 1000s of dollars, and bus routes are both being reduced and spiking on the prices. I'm now paying through the roof for dozens of services that I have very limited access to. Meanwhile, there is absolutely no improvement in the quality of my education or campus life in general."
College Senior,2,I received two scholarships. One was for my grades which I didn't even have to sign up for. The other one was for being a resident advisor.I gave it a C because I applied to about 15 for this next semester and didn't get any even though my grades were competitive.
College Junior,2,Most of the off-campus housing is kind of run down and needs to be re-done. The cost is reasonable in relation to how good of a living area it is. There are a few good ones that are reasonable but they fill up quick depending on if you want roommates or not. most of them are very close to campus but the traffic can slow you down in the mornings. There is plenty of parking for all attendants but parking on campus can be a challenge depending on the time you have classes. There are a couple that are very safe but most of them are open to anyone.
College Junior,2,Off-campus dining is limited to only a couple fast food and only a select few family owned. The cost is cheap and some diners will give you a student discount if you show them your I.D. Most of the restaurants are on the main street that the school is on. There is not much variety between the different restaurants.
College Junior,2,"There isn't a lot going on around here, it's usually pretty quiet. But you can more than likely find a house party or a gathering at an apartment complex."
College Freshman,2,Parking lots crowded and freshmen have to park at football stadium.
College Student,2,alot of white people. not a lot of black people. barely any mexicans. mostly white people.
College Junior,2,Winslow is horrid. I always get sick to my stomach after eating there. The T-room is great as well as Dunker's Deli. You can only use flex dollars at those two places though.
College Freshman,2,"Campus Police is always on call, so no worries. Campus Polie will bust you if your parked in the wrong zone! RA's are strict about drinking in the dorms."
College Junior,2,"Parking for commuters is great! If you live at the dorms, though, parking is hard, especially if you want to park close to your residential college. It's almost impossible."
College Freshman,2,"I am only 18, and Murray just recently became a wet county, so I honestly do not know much about the bar/club scenes. There are quite a few frat parties on the weekends and that is what a lot of students go to. Honestly, Murray is a very small town and there are not a lot of places to go to, so if you need constant activities and new things to do, Murray is not for you. There is one small theater and a few places to shop. If you want to have fun, go to the frat parties and there are a few hookah bars right off of campus."
College Junior,2,"The only campus transportation is racer routes. Nobody ever uses them, except occasionally to get to walmart. They're pretty much pointless."
College Junior,2,"There is not many parking spaces and the way they have it zoned is not smart. I have been late many times because of bad parking situations and have gotten tickets for parking in the wrong zone because they only had my zone in one place. Even as a junior, the parking is still a nightmare and you do need a car to get some places, so you don't have much of a choice."
College Junior,2,On Campus Only – There is a bus system that is free to Murray State students but it only runs to and through campus owned properties. It is also difficult to find route and schedule information if you do not live on campus. Route & schedule flyers are rarely available. There are a couple of maps posted on campus but they are no where near any for the stops. There is no public transportation system.
College Junior,2,I like the facilities they are new and improved. One thing that i don't like is that the some professors only teach for research facilities.
College Junior,2,"Hometown Humble – Not too much to do, but everyone is nice and will help you out if you need it."
College Freshman,2,"Times Are Hard and Money Is Low – I recieve financial aid and its a blessing that I do, but I don't always get the amount I need. Since Murray State costs $13,000 a semester, I've had to take out over $11,000 in students loans which are not going to be easy to pay for in the end."
College Sophomore,2,In the middle of December it can be 60-70 (F) degrees one day and 30 degrees (F) the next!
College Freshman,2,I personally do not have a good time by drinking but a lot of my fellow students do enjoy drinking and partying.  Most students get away with drinking too.
College Senior,2,Parking in designated areas are not reall infforced until closer to the end of the semester and not at all in some locations.
College Senior,2,"Academia in Murray – My major, creative writing, offers a challenging and rigorous curriculum that involves a lot of reading and writing. The facilities are average, but I have not found many opportunities at internships or job opportunities. Through study of classic writing styles and works, the professors hope to educate us as to how to use our writing skills and improve them in the workplace."
College Sophomore,2,Best bet is to go to a fraternity party rather than a club or bar.
College Senior,2,Moist County – Basically no bars unless attached to restaurant and then all close at midnight. Fraternity parties are limited. Cabs are CHEAP.
College Freshman,2,i hated murray im from st. louis and i can not wait to transfer after this semester . I was beatin up twice last semester both taken to the emergency room . i have gotten great grades though
College Sophomore,2,"Bodunk Ammenities – Murray has a few local eateries that I've heard are decent, unfortunately, Murray as a town is low-class white American at its very best. Your typical choices are Arbys, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Cracker Barrell and of course... Wal-Mart."
Niche User,1,"Murray State is a JOKE! They are more worried about getting as much money as they can from you rather than trying to help you with anything. When trying to apply for financial aid they needed my moms 2015 tax returns which we couldn't use because someone tried to steal her identity. When I went up there to tell them my situation they told me they would do everything they can to help me, and to not worry about the deadline because of my situation. Well when the deadline came around they told me there was nothing they could do for me. Screwed me big time! I have been paying off this debt for 3 years now. They past couple of months I have been tight on money cause I'm about to lose my job, so I havent been able to make the payments. They told me that it's ok if I cant my payments, and to just pay when I can. I got a letter in the mail from The Commonwealth of Kentucky saying that they were gonna seize everything I own. I cannot stress this enough when I say DO NOT APPLY TO THIS SCHOOL!"
College Sophomore,1,The older buildings are horrible. The students pay too much money for building floods to ruin property that belongs to the student. I say its best to live off campus because of the kind of dormitories that are there.
College Freshman,1,It's one of the worst dorms on campus
College Senior,1,"There are not that many places to party here at my school, so the party scene is really at a sports bar which can get boring."
College Senior,1,"There aren't many dining options available on campus. It's usually at least marginally edible, but the Winslow dining hall tends to make students sick on a regular basis. The required meal plan is definitely not worth what it costs."
College Freshman,1,I am not a fan of on campus housing. I feel like they took a lot of freedom away with their new rules. Its also a pain to get exempt from housing even though they are completely full and even housed students in the lounges and the student center. 
College Freshman,1,"Parking at Murray State is ridiculous, and unless you live in the dorms you hardly have a shot at getting to class on time. You have to choose between being late or getting an expensive parking ticket."
College Freshman,1,"the reason for this low rate is . I had applied for many scholarships here but i have not got a single scholarship, and no cares about that ."
College Junior,1,"It's hard to find commuter parking spots close to campus. Also, they give out way too many parking tickets for parking anywhere that's not a ""red zone."""
College Junior,1,"The doctors will help, but the y make you seems as though you are wasting their time. The nurses are nicer depending on the day and who is there."
College Junior,1,"Murray doesn't have much of a night life, period. There are about three bars spread throughout the town, a hookah bar right beside campus, and a bunch of fast food restaurants. If you're looking for a good time your best bet is to get in good with some frat guys or a sorority and then crash their parties."
College Freshman,1,"If you want to park on campus, you have to buy a parking pass. It's fifty dollars and a recent change was that the city of Murray requires students to pay and get a ""city sticker."" That is also fifty dollars. As a freshman, you get the worst parking. The rest of the student body can park at their dorms, but must have the correct color parking pass.  Cops usually stop checking parking passes after 3:30 pm, so if you have a red pass and are parking in a ""yellow zone,"" you'll be fine!"
College Sophomore,1,I think the financial aid office is a waste of time. They only thing they tell you about aid is what FAFSA has you eligible for and that is it.They don't help you with finding other aid.
College Student,1,"poor parking if you are a commuter.. there are enough spaces, but you have to walk a mile to class.."
College Junior,1,Hard to Find – the parking situation sucks. so many students not enough parking
College Freshman,1,"Murray State is terrible! The nightlife here is one of the worst on college. Some nights nothing is going on, and you end up sitting in your room some friends and drinking. Its a dry county so you have to drive 15 to 30 minutes for anything, and everything is over priced. The greek life is terrible. For some of you who loved high school, this place is just right for you. Because this isnt college, all this place is is an enormous high school. So dont make the same mistake i did, i warned you"
College Senior,1,"Murray in Park – The only transportation system at Murray State is the bus system. While it seems to be a good idea on paper, it is marred by inconsistent schedules and lack of synchronization with student schedules. Long-distance transportation is virtually nonexistent."
College Sophomore,1,"Murray state seems to be like every other college in Kentucky placing emphasis on parking, even going as far as charging fees to your student account. It is outright ridiculous."
College Junior,1,"Not Very Diverse – At MSU, we mostly have an all white, all straight student body. I have commented before that I have maybe seen 10 black students EVER at my school. However, we do have a fair number of Asian students, mostly exchange. Also, I understand that we have a Lesbian-Gay-Transgender type club at my school, but I have rarely seen any of the members because it is a small club in ratio to all students."
College Sophomore,1,Rain Never Goes Away. Murray's drainage system is awful. there is always a lake you may or may not step into on the way to class. This year we've also had snow every week... the school does not shut down class. For anything.

Niche User,5,"I took a few classes online and was easy to navigate through the Canvas website, which is very standard even if you don't take online classes. The teachers love the subjects they teach and are willing to be lenient in certain situations or emergencies that fall on the student. Students are expected to do the work, so it isn't just a free pass to get an easy grade (although, many of the 100-level online classes are fairly straightforward). The layout of assignments is dependent on the teacher, but most of the time is very easy to follow and understand. All the teachers I've had posted their syllabus before classes started and is a very helpful tool for deadlines, learning outcomes, office hours, etc. Discussions force you to interact with other students, but any other interactions take effort since the class is online. Time management is key to passing online classes. Most teachers in my experience are super flexible if you turn in a day late if you explain your circumstances to them."
Niche User,5,"Very great school with diverse students. Classes and class schedule is usually very easy to work around. The advisors are there to help you! They want the students to succeed. Many of the teachers are friendly and have good office hours. Campus life is fun and it is very close to the heart of downtown, about a 10-15 minute walk.
One thing I really like about this campus is that lots of students gather in Red Square to promote political issues, clubs and activities, concerts, speeches, etc. and have the freedom to do so. Lots of art exhibits and displays from professional artists and student artists alike.
The info fair at the beginning of the year lasts 2 days and showcases a variety of activities and clubs to partake in on campus and around Bellingham. This is very much a college town, but not so overbearing. The rest of the city's population are easy to get along with and very open-minded. There are many hang out spots. The campus also does a good job with emergencies on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, great educational opportunities and many ways to get involved! I got involved with Intramural basketball this Winter, joined the Black Student Union, National Society of Black Engineers, and African Caribbean club as well. I have now been elected as the Retention and Outreach officer for BSU for this upcoming academic year."
Sophomore,5,All of the professors I had for online schooling so far have worked with me and made sure that I was doing okay and making sure everyone understands the materials.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere at western perfect for my undergrad journey. The staff really care about you and all professors I have had are wonderful people.
Sophomore,5,"I was force to take it due to the COVID19 pandemic, and working with professors who have never done an online class, it wasn't too bad. They are very adaptable and are truly doing everything they can to make your education work. So if that is already good, taking a course where they specialize in online learning should be even better."
Junior,5,My professors always made sure to follow up with students and provide extra resources to make sure we can all be successful during our time at WWU.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love WWU and Bellingham! It’s just a beautiful campus and they care so much about how you’re doing while being there!
Alum,5,"Western Washington University provides a wonderful, student-focused undergraduate education.  At Western, the focus is on students and student education.  Professor advancement and tenure is based primarily on their teaching ability and evaluations.  Undergraduate students benefit from small class sizes and the opportunity to carry out independent research."
Alum,5,I loved Western Washington University. It was perfect for me at the time. Bellingham is one of the most beautiful places in the state of Washington. The town is small enough that you feel safe but big enough that you rarely get bored. There are lots of things to do in town and tons of outdoor activities in the surrounding area. Most people are friendly and accepting. Very positive experience!
Sophomore,5,"Western is an excellent, underrated school. Beautiful campus, small classes with good professors, and less competitive than larger universities. It isn't the most diverse school and sometimes it feels like an ideological echo chamber, but that's a problem with most colleges. Living in the dorms during my first year was a great experience and the food wasn't bad, either."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Western Washington University and I live on campus. So far, I love all the professors I have had and classes. However, the food on campus diners is poor. For vegetarians there is not a lot of options and sometimes the food tastes gross."
Alum,5,"Strong sense of community and many opportunities to find like-minded individuals. Music program faculty is fantastic, Woodring professors also do a wonderful job making sure their students are thoroughly prepared for their roles."
Senior,5,This is a great school. Check if they have the degree you're after though. They can be specialized. Bellingham is a beautiful city. It was my favorite place to live ever. I'll probably move back there.
Freshman,5,"Western Washington University is such a welcoming and inclusive community. Professors and school administration see you as a person and not a number. (I am in WWU Honors, so I must say I probably had more exceptional academic classes than those not in honors.) WWU also has a gorgeous campus, with a forest on one side and a bay on the other. There's so many student activities, especially outdoorsy ones. In terms of political leaning, Western is very liberal, so I would not recommend attending if you identify as a conservative. Overall, Western is a nearly perfect school with affordable and exceptional education."
Junior,5,"Its a very welcoming school, everyone is very friendly and many people go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The atmosphere in Bellingham is so amazing and theres always so much to do. The academics are challenging but almost all professors have flexible office hours and are willing to make arrangements to meet outside of their allotted time."
Freshman,5,I love the area around the campus and the campus is beautiful and a good size. Lots of housing options to find what fits your style. Very progressive.
Sophomore,5,"Western is an underrated school. Academics are very strong, but the environment is supportive rather than competitive. The campus is beautiful and the location between Seattle and Vancouver is convenient. Campus food isn't bad and there are lots of different dorms to suit different students."
Sophomore,5,"WWU has lots of places to go hiking, running, boating, swimming, and biking. Many of the people that choose to attend this school do so because of these things. The people are nice and the professors are very good. It rains a lot more here than in any other part of Washington stat"
Sophomore,5,The environment is amazing and there is a ton of resources for any freshman to help navigate college life and adulting.
Freshman,5,Very welcoming and friendly school! Great diversity and encourages equality. Most of the professors are great and really want to see the students succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment, how open and accepting everyone is. I love that you can get lost in the crowd, and everyone is friendly because we're all just trying to make it. It's so chill and nonjudgemental. The campus is beautiful, and there are so many awesome clubs and resources."
Freshman,5,"Western is a wonderful school. Academically, socially, and within the community, western prevails. I just got here, but I know after four yars, I will have learned enough to get a great, high-paying job all due to the students and staff of Western."
Niche User,5,"I haven't attended yet, but I've frequented the  place and the facilities are amazing, especially for fine and performing arts!"
Freshman,5,"So far my experience with WWU has been great, they are extremely helpful with all the questions I've had as a new student. The application process was relatively simple and easy and all the resources the school has sent in both paper and digital have been engaging and informative."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so kind and welcoming. The campus is gorgeous and very clean, with a plethora of trails and whatnot for hiking and running. Very enjoyable."
Freshman,5,The sense of community in Bellingham is overwhelming & wonderful. You rarely find a town with so much love & passion for each other and for what is right. Western is my home!
Freshman,5,"I'm starting in the fall, and they are being incredibly helpful with the process. Very easy for incoming freshman to figure out what they're doing, as well as getting help from admin"
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and how inclusive everyone is and the wonderful campus. It really makes you feel at home. The dorms are wonderful and so are the RA's. The roommate matching system is sweet and Overall very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"So far WWU has been an amazing experience, I truly cannot imagine myself going anywhere else. Bellingham is a beautiful and lively city and the campus is a fun and cool place to explore and hang out at (check out the rock collection in the basement of Artzen! ) My classes and professers have been so kind and passionate for the most part, and have seriously enjoyed going to class. The only problems I’ve experienced  here is with the transfer of IB credits (especially with math and science) and difficulty getting into needed classes for my degree. But overall a fantastic school!"
Freshman,5,"My WWU experience has been one of beauty, pain, and learning. Western is like a large family, it is a beautiful campus I got involved in one of the many communities of Western. I lived in the Fairhaven dorms my freshman year, I became a stack rep and later joined its hall council. I made strong connections with the residents of my community, the RAs, and even the RD. Western gave me a family. At Western, we say, “Make Waves”. As a first year, trying to find balance, trying to fit in, I made some poor choices. I struggled with depression; being away from home and coping with the loss of a friend. If it wasn’t for all the support from Westerns’ staff, mentors, and remarkable students, I would not be able to say that I am returning. I believe this school is one of a kind because of the sincerity that you see every single day. I choose to “make waves” because if someone hadn’t chosen to make a wave in my life, I wouldn’t be who I am now."
Freshman,5,"I just finished my freshman year. My dorm experience was wonderful, professors great, on-campus job was good, the only thing that I would change is that I was pretty nervous registering during the freshmen orientation."
Freshman,5,My first year of college has been amazing. I feel included and and accepted at WWU and have made so many amazing friends and have had an amazing academic year.
Alum,5,Western is a great college for the independent type. You definitely don't get a lot of guidance from academic advisors but if you know what you want to do and are driven you will enjoy Western very much. Wonderful town and student body.
Niche User,5,I attended WWU for one year before my husband and I had to move to California due to the military. I was so sad to leave this school. The professors became like family and I had never felt so much support. This school will always hold a big piece of my heart and I will always consider myself a Viking!
Freshman,5,Western is a wonderful school for anyone who loves the outdoors and learning. They are very welcoming to everyone and have a great staff. You never get bored because there are so many  things to do around campus.
Junior,5,"The student involvement is phenomenal. The way students run nearly all events and faculty taking mentorship roles has given the student body a stronger platform on the changes they wish to see on campus. There is a clash between the actions actually done, but the conversations are continuous. There are many programs, scholarships, and most especially, research grants available to students along with the advising of faculty. Diversity is not scarce for LGBTQ+ communities, but POC populations are highly limited and may nearly be exploited for their experiences. Western folk have shown their respect to indigenous lands and continue their efforts to allow indigenous people to take active roles in power."
Freshman,5,"it was new and refreshing. I was excited to meet my new friends and the course work was, although tough, it taught me what I needed to continue on to become a doctor."
Junior,5,WWU is a great school with a great atmosphere and professors. Bellingham has lots to do and I have enjoyed living here immensely.
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment, the campus, and the class structures. Also has a good level of competition within majors, so that its not to easy, but is still possible to get in with hard work. On campus job opportunities are great and plentiful"
Niche User,5,"My experience at Western Washington University was beautiful. Western has a beautiful campus and has the friendliest faces. Located in Bellingham, one of the biggest cities in Washington, has a ton of different activities for anyone of age. For my hobbies, Bellingham has it all. The hiking, biking, skiing, Canada is very close by. Western has everything. It has the diversity, it's a great school academically and offers many programs and great programs if you must. The professors arrs and with not very large classes it helps a lot to get one on one time with your professor. I recommend this school. It's  agreat school in a beautiful area with so many activites anyone can enjoy."
Freshman,5,"I liked Western Washington University because Washington State is known best for the University of Washington, which is set in the big city, so it was nice to visit up there and interact with the campus during the day and get peace, quiet, and fresh air."
Freshman,5,Western is a very open and supportive school. They support the students and listen to their thoughts and ideas as well as their complaints. They support students individually as well to ensure a successful and supporting environment. They also have a number places to get specified help for many different things!
Alum,5,Western Washington University is a beautiful campus with caring professors and education team that makes you feel right at home.
Senior,5,My experience at WWU has been excellent. The program I am in has really made me step up and better myself as a person. I transferred from a different university and have had a MUCH better experience then I thought possible.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Western Washington University. Bellingham is such an amazing area and has a great community. No matter where you go you will always be included.
Freshman,5,The campus is very dog friendly and feels more like a open park rather than a college. Everyone is very nice and friendly to each other. The city of Bellingham is within walking distance to the campus and the local bus system offers free fares to students that have their ID. You do not need a car to get around campuy as everything is in walking distance and very close to each other.
Junior,5,Very streamlined admission process with an excellent manager to their Huxley College of the Environmental!
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus and city, friendly staff and students, a wicked bagel shop in the library; WWU is a haven. It is only about an hour away from the border and a 30 minute kayak trip to the San Juan Islands. Academics are engaging and fun. If you're thinking about applying to WWU, visit the campus and soon you'll be packing your bags!"
Alum,5,"Since I lived off campus, I don't know what the dorms or meal halls are like, but I loved everything else!  The one drawback I found was that although the school is very liberal, people are quick to judge if you don't fit in that liberal bracket.  Despite this people are friendly and always willing to help!"
Alum,5,"WWU is a wonderful school that represents itself incredibly well. The academic programs and professors are not only well qualified, but amazing. The return on your investment will be worth it as they connect you with many of the local employers in Washington State. The campus not only bolsters itself with the beautiful scenery of the ocean and the nearby North Cascades, but it looks amazing with the red brick and the open atmosphere in addition to a sculpture garden. The University offers immensely talented sports with multiple olympians, and over performing Women's Rugby and soccer. Bellingham itself is an amazing college town. 

Drawbacks include average college style buffets and aging housing. THe diversity strugles outside of white individuals, but the LGBTQ+ community thrives at WWU as the student body remains incredibly supportive. Safety has become an issue following multiple incidents of Voyeurism, sexual assault, and lack of prosecution but otherwise is incredibly safe."
Niche User,5,"The campus guides were amazing and friendly. The campus was very nice and clean. The campus location was also very unique; placed in the bay area with a great view, and the beautiful hiking trails surrounding it."
Freshman,5,"If you want to go to a school that is filled with accepting students and professors alike, live in a town with lots of fun shops and things to do, and never be any further than 5 minutes away from a scenic view/outdoor recreation... then look no further than Western Washington University! It's really got it all... great college atmosphere, lots to do just minutes off campus, and more!"
Junior,5,This is my second year at Western and I've really enjoyed it so far. The transfer process was seamless. My professors have all been pretty good and I've enjoyed my classes. The campus is really beautiful and there are a lot of activities and clubs for students to participate in.
Freshman,5,Western has so far been very kind and communicative with me and thats something I can appreciate when I have very few ideas as to what i am doing
Sophomore,5,"Western is fantastic. Bellingham is beautiful and there is a lot of cool stuff to do around town. I've loved most of the classes and professors that I've taken, and wouldn't say I hated any of my classes. I love the liberal setting at Western. There's a lot of open-minded people here and I feel right at home. However, I would like to see more diversity, as about 75% of Western is white people. Also, the party scene is pretty lame compared to UW and WSU. I'm not a party animal, anyway, but just know that parties in Bham end early."
Freshman,5,"This is a wonderful college! I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my time here and I am excited to continue attending. The campus feels small despite it being a fairly large college, and everyone is very friendly. The class options are wonderful and most of the teachers are great!"
Junior,5,I love the culture on campus. It's very inclusive and supportive of all students. I always feel informed about campus activities and appreciate the hard work of the Associated Students.
Junior,5,I like the commitment to diversity at this school. Diversity is really important to me. They also have a very reputable education program that I am in.
Niche User,5,I attended College Quest at Western during the summer before my senior year in High School.  It was an amazing experience.  The minute I showed up to check into my room I felt very welcome.  I was even asked right then and there if I wanted to play basketball later.  I got a chance to experience dorm life white there and it was just fine.  I no longer have a fear of what to expect when I arrive there as a student.  I participated in a Marine Science course where each day involved going on a field trip to a local body of water.  Our group was divided into groups of 3 and each group had to present their findings to the other groups at the end of the week.  Overall I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the college.  This adventure convinced me that I want to attend college at Western Washing University to pursue my dream of becoming a marine scientist.
Senior,4,"I love being a part of the music program at Western. There are so many opportunities for me to perform and the faculty members are talented and also great teachers. I have also really enjoyed taking General University Requirements at Western. These classes have expanded my knowledge of the world, while also providing a nice break in the day from my major-specific classes."
Sophomore,4,"Western Washington is university where you are made to feel very welcome. Most of the faculty there care about the students and their well-being. The teachers here are an excellent resource to go to, and most care about if you succeed. Also, my experience in the dorms my freshman year was very good, as the students were very nice. There was no alcohol or marijuana as well. You get a good balance of socializing and education, but the ratio is your choice. Students who want to focus on education will do well in my opinion. I do not have any major complaints besides the cost of college being way too high, which is why I am applying for scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"During the pandemic, they did decide to shut down the university, but they allowed people to continue living in the dorms, which I deeply respect. The food is decent, the campus is absolutely beautiful, but the math department is not one that I would recommend. There are teachers that deeply care and are fair for the circumstances going on, but I have had only one okay experience with a teacher in the math department. The campus is very open and supportive of all communities and people are open to express themselves."
Sophomore,4,"Every single of my teachers made accommodations and exceptions for grades or the curriculum but my math teachers (plural). My current math class has had 2 tests that were graded and the averages were 46% and just above 50%. He claimed was the student's faults for not showing up to the Q and A. No ownership on his part. The videos he posts are from months ago, meaning that we are not getting lectured based on our strengths and struggles as a class. The videos are so unhelpful that over the last two semesters I am one of usually 6 other people who have continued to view them. I paid too much to watch his unhelpful youtube videos and be a part of his MOSTLY FAILING class.

Besides math classes, every teacher has gone above and beyond to make themselves accessible and be fair. I have had finals canceled, made optional, open note, or weighted less. Office hours have been added to weekends and teachers have been willing to walk through the labs with me step by step twice a week."
Alum,4,It is a beautiful campus with a lot of new renovations this year (2020). There are some older buildings still that could get an update. The campus itself isn't the best for students physical disabilities because some buildings don't have elevators or the best access and the bricks can stick up and be a hazard. The University itself does try hard to be the inclusive to everyone but their programs aren't fit for the growing size of the community. Overall it is a very good school that is open to new changes to the university. I had a good experience within the departments I was a part of. They were very supportive and did try their best to accommodate the students with the best of their abilities.
Alum,4,"The professors that have had experience instructing online classes have perfected it to an art form. However, some of the older professors or non-tech savvy professors struggle a lot with the programs. I have heard from other students that had professors that aren't as accommodating as others during this time."
Sophomore,4,"I personally am not a fan of online learning, but Western has made my experience a bit easier by communicating with my professors through canvas and easy accessibility."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy Western. I feel as if I have found my place in the world, at least for now, and I can't wait to continue my education there. I have not had a bad teacher so far, and I have been consistently challenged which has been a nice change of pace. I enjoy the quarter system because it keeps me on my toes and allows me to experience so many different kinds of classes. There are only a few things I believe should change. I think that there is a lack of support for people of different ethnicities, and that there is a lot of under-representation of different ethnicities in the faculty."
Sophomore,4,"I was not a huge fan of how some of my teachers handled online classes. The school changed the grading scale to pass/fail unless we wanted our letter grade, and my history teacher made each assignment pass/fail, which was extremely frustrating because I would have done much better if each assignment was not only out of 2 points. On the other hand, I understand that it was difficult to adjust to, and it would be difficult to ensure that kids are putting forth genuine effort. Overall, I liked how my classes went online."
Sophomore,4,Teachers are excellent and club and activity selection is great. However the lack of a central sports team really lowers the sense of community and overall school spirit.
Sophomore,4,"It's a beautiful campus overall, with cherry blossoms and lots of greenery. The fall is also exquisite, the bright orange leaves and cool air is astonishing. However, winter at times is an absolute nightmare. The campus grounds are not flat, there are constant hills of various material and when the snow and ice comes, good luck! You're going to need traction, and if you don't have it, say goodbye to your knees and butt, because you'll be slipping every few steps. Granted the school does a decent job putting salt on the main roads, but that only applies to that. So if you need to walk out of campus, you're out of luck. Still though, that's only certain parts of winter, usually late December to January."
Junior,4,I honestly think I got very lucky. My professors adapted to online learning  very fast. They were very quick to responding to emails and keeping us up to date with assignments and grades.
Freshman,4,"Having classes online this spring quarter has been alright. It’s been pretty easy to keep my grades up. It’s slightly easier, but I would prefer in-person classes since I learn better that way."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman this year here at WWU. This year has come with so many new experiences. My first quarter exceeded what I had imagined my college experience to be. I was very nervous to be alone in a new place. I decided to take a fig my first quarter and it was extremely helpful. I was able to interact more with my professors And it helped me to be more comfortable. This also allowed me to meet some of my very best friends here and have a support system for my classes when I had questions. I also really enjoyed intramural volleyball. Overall, I have had a great experience for my first year of college."
Freshman,4,The University is in an amazing area and the college has great values. I have loved being there and there is so much to do around town and campus.
Senior,4,"The reason I originally came to Western and the reason I loved being here was all the same, I just felt connected to the vibe of campus and the people here. As I am graduating soon, I now have the chance to look back on the three years I spent here. The main reason I grew to love Bellingham and Western more over the years was through the connections I made with the people. Founding my own student club, being a part of many other clubs, working on campus, and calling a small Chinese learning department my home, I was able to develop a close-knit community. Western is the kind of place people call Belling HOME. Besides that, if you like the outdoors and want to be surrounded by chill yet motivated individuals, I recommend that you attend! Western may not be the most prestigious school, but it is through the smallness that one finds opportunities and growth. In addition, whatever major or department you choose will completely change your experience."
Senior,4,"I am currently in my 4th year at WWU and I've really enjoyed my time here. Things are obviously not the best right now with the given circumstances, but this school has taken quick action to ensure that the students can still receive the education we need."
Freshman,4,Western provides a wide variety of opportunities to its students. Western has a great community surrounded by a beautiful landscape. Western feels like a second home. I feel so comfortable there and I can't wait to meet new people and participate in clubs and athletics.
Niche User,4,"Western has been great, and Western's website is the only thing that really needs to change, because its not easily navigable."
Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are excellent and willing to work with you! There is plenty of activities for students and the campus is rather lively most of the year! The location is great you are right next to the ocean and not to far away from the mountains. you are located in the city but not far from the country!
Senior,4,"Everyone always has some issues with their university, but overall, WWU tries to be accommodating. I have had great and caring professors, many learning opportunities, a supportive community and more. Of course administration has things that could be changed, but that is every school."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my experience with Western Washington university so far. They have a really good education program for those who want to teach. This is what I originally wanted WWU, but later I switched to majoring in communication and science disorders. This program is also really great because they also have a clinic where you can get experience  in the field of audiology and speech language pathology. Most of my teachers have been very kind and are very willing to help when you need it."
Alum,4,"I liked the fact they had an undergraduate Marine Biology Degree, a marine science center in Annacortes and a school of the environment, Huxley."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have loved WWU. Apart from the beautiful campus, all the professors I have met have been extremely knowledgeable and seemed to really care about the students. Bellingham is an awesome city, and has truly become my home. I was also lucky enough to be housed in mathes with a view of downtown and the water, which made the less than appetizing feed and communal bathrooms worth it. I'm genuinely excited to continue my education, and start my career here!"
Junior,4,I really like how many different places that are available for students to turn to for community and help. The academic clubs are very beneficial to those in the programs and help guide students on a successful future career. These clubs have helped me feel prepared for my future and next year of academics. Something I would like to see changed at my school is more mental health resources. I felt ignored with my struggle with PTSD and did not get adequate help from counseling services or outside resources. I would like to see my school have more help for people like me or just better outside help from the community.
Freshman,4,"Western Washington University is a great school for anyone who wants a relaxed and supportive environment. There are many resources available around campus in order to help you make the best of your time there, and the atmosphere lacks the competitiveness that some students may find daunting. While the school may not be the most rigorous academically, it provides a quality, well-rounded liberal arts education."
Junior,4,"The university has any great social activities to attend both on and off campus and faculty is friendly for the most part. They have many great resources for students including a giant library and free bus transportation. I wish the dorm rules were enforced more for the safety of residences, but the dining halls have surprisingly great vegetarian and other healthy options! The restaurants on campus are great as well! I believe that some classes can't very political, which is not my favorite thing."
Freshman,4,"I am a current freshman at WWU and have had a wonderful experience so far! the professors are friendly and genuinely want you to improve and grow as a student. We are encouraged to go to office hours and get to know our professors. The campus is absolutely beautiful and very close to Bellingham Bay. The transit system is also very well run, so it is easy to get anywhere in Whatcom county by bus."
Senior,4,Beautiful location. Hard to connect if you are living off-campus. Most professors are great people who enjoy what they teach.
Niche User,4,As an incoming Freshmen it is an amazing campus. I love the environment I have gone to most of the colleges in the west coast and I love it.
Sophomore,4,I love the academics and the community that western accepts everyone and makes it a very welcoming and fun place to be. I'd like to see improvements in the nutrition of the dining halls and better service employed.
Sophomore,4,"I like the size of the school, not too big and not too small. It's easy to talk to your professors in and out of class, and walking around campus you will see people you know. It's not too small that you feel like you know everyone, it's easy to blend in. The campus is beautiful and has lots of interesting buildings and artwork."
Freshman,4,"Western is a beautiful school with a lot of great opportunities for student involvement. Obviously no school is perfect and Western falls in line with that. It is occasionally frustrating to figure out financial issues, but once you do, the classes are great and the professors are generally intelligent and kind."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the teachers at this university love to teach, they are passionate about what they are teaching and love feedback on how they can better cater to your learning needs. 

One thing I would change about Western is our dining hall contract with Aramark, which is a corporation that benefits off of jails and mass incarcerations."
Sophomore,4,I personally think school is what you make of it. I have had pleasant experiences with teachers. The food is okay. You'll get tired of cafeteria food no matter where you go. The campus is very pretty in spring.
Junior,4,Western has very enthusiastic and approachable professors as well as an all-inclusive campus where you will find varieties of people and personalities.  My only complaint is that I wish some programs were more well known...
Alum,4,"I was interested in WWU because it’s close to home while still being far enough away. The campus is beautiful too. Bellingham is such a nice town. There’s a lot of good places to eat and things to do in the area. 

Almost all of my professors were really good. Campus life is nice. There’s over 200 clubs so you’re bound to find something that interests you and find people to meet. There are not any fraternities or sororities but I prefer it that way. It’s not known as a party school, which is nice.  I never felt unsafe on campus. Some classes have a long waitlist and it will likely get worse as time goes on. They keep admitting too many students. Psychology and Computer Science classes were very hard to get into. I overall really enjoyed my time here. I met a lot of cool people and made some of the best friends I’ve had here. I miss it. It’s definitely worth going here! It’s cheaper than a lot of colleges in Washington state but that isn’t a bad thing in this case!"
Alum,4,"I'm so glad that I went to Western Washington University.  I enjoyed the location in Bellingham, WA.  The student life was bustling with many clubs and extracurricular activities.  I met some of my best friends in the improv club that met weekly, ultimately winning a national college tournament.   Living in the dorms made it easy to get to class, find other musicians to jam with, and explore downtown and the surrounding areas easily.  One thing I wish was different was that it would be more diverse of a university."
Freshman,4,"I have just started as a freshman at Western. It was an amazing first quarter and definitely a good change from regular school work. The dorms are pretty nice, but since I am not one to party the noise can be a little much in the Ridgeway Dorms."
Junior,4,"The environment at Western Washington University is very friendly, the atmosphere of the students here feels inspiring and makes me more motivated to study hard and do the best to my abilities in all my classes."
Junior,4,"It's a pretty good school. I'm a transfer junior, and there are a lot of us but I feel like a lot of programs kind of forget about us. That's kind of a bummer, but on the other hand I feel like I also don't need as much hand-holding (especially considering registration) than the freshman, so perhaps that is by design.

A big thing worth mentioning is that the mental health resources are kind of a joke. There's a huge wait time to even be seen by a provider, and even then they have to refer you off-campus for on-going care. 

The academic side of things is the best thing I've experienced at Western so far. Which makes sense, I guess, because that is the main reason I'm here. The communication sciences and disorders major is super well put-together, organized, and well-staffed. The professors are experienced in their fields and are experienced teachers, so that makes it easy to learn."
Freshman,4,"Western Washington University is a great school if your looking for higher education. The academics are great and the teachers are extremely helpful and care about your success. The classes are small, besides a few lecture classes. Lots of resources for students to reach full potential. The student events are very diverse and try to involve everyone. The food could be better, but hey it's college food. The experience has been great so far. There are so many clubs and sports or tutoring that helps you get involved as well. This is a great choice of a school if you are considering it!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the school. It is located in great city with plenty to do and lots to see. The campus is gorgeous, even on rainy days. The class sizes are generally very small and the professors are excellent."
Freshman,4,If you are interested in environmental science this is the place for you. They have several specialized majors within the field and have many options without the grading system if you have grade anxiety.  This is an amazing school for those with global help interests with the peace corp certificate and many activism based clubs.
Alum,4,"This is an excellent school if you apply yourself and use your resources. There's an insane amount of opportunities, but they aren't always right in front of your face. Another thing to note, especially for incoming students, is that among students, WWU is known as a five year school. I don't know anyone who graduated on time, even those entering with college credit."
Junior,4,"I love being at Western, and I love my cohort in my major! Super supportive staff and mentors available at any time!"
Sophomore,4,"While western could use a better philosophy department and is missing a comparative literature program, the campus has many great attributes worth speaking about. Instead of Greek Life, there's a myriad of clubs to choose from, meaning the campus all around achieves a safer and more inclusive environment. The location, albeit windy, is beautiful with forested land all around. In addition, the faculty is incredibly friendly and helpful all around."
Alum,4,"I had some trouble getting into the CS classes I wanted, but that's because there was so much demand for it. Some classes were really hard to get through, but I'm really glad I made it through with so many great projects."
Sophomore,4,"Western Washington University has been a great experience so far because I fell in love with the atmosphere and the town of Bellingham. At the university I was able to get an adviser that had experience in the exact major which I want to go into which is marine biology. Then I was able to join a research group for seals in the area through my adviser. I felt like I was provided a lot of opportunities to explore what I am interested in at Western which makes me know I chose the right place. I didn't put full stars because there were a bunch of hate crimes on campus this year with homophobic and racist slurs and the administration didn't do much to make the students of color feel safe. Therefore as far as academics, WWU is great; however, they need to work on the campus safety/community more."
Sophomore,4,"This is a very good school with a few downsides, the main downside being it is extremely hard to get into the base level biology and chemistry classes that are required for most biology related degrees, the school simply does not offer enough classes for the amount of students."
Niche User,4,The location was nice and not busy. The buildings and programs are great. It kind of sucks that the terrain is very hilly and often is scary to turn into or out of some parts of the school
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Western a lot. My experience with the professors has overall been very good. They are all highly intellectual in their field and are able to relay information very well. Western is a very inclusive campus that values all of its students. It is a mid-large sized college which I like, although, because of its size it can be hard to work with the administration. It can be hard to get professional help with logistic problems. Many students work on campus so if you have an issue they often aren't able to help you much. It can be hard to get in touch with someone who is a professional in that field. Overall I do like Western and it is a good place for me. If you are interested in environmental studies or science it is a great place to be. WWU environmental program was the first and one of the best in the country."
Junior,4,"Western is in an great location with a lot to do and a lot of opportunities, but the school is barely diverse and has had issues with identity politics and sexual assault every single year I've gone here."
Sophomore,4,"Western is great in so many ways, one of which is the very easily accessible counseling services offered for free, on campus. The school is clearly very concerned about the mental health of their students and they take care to have counseling be something that any student can have access to. The campus is beautiful and the free bus fare, as well as the late night shuttle for students, makes it easy to get around Bellingham. My two issues are with the lack of reliable internet for those living on campus and the quality of food offered at the dining halls. Other than that, this school truly is incredible."
Freshman,4,"WWU is a place for all students who are still undecided about their career path as well as for those who have their paths all figured out. It is a place that holds a diverse, and well-rounded education to the highest degree and shows genuine appreciation towards students who strive to be the best they can be. It has many resources for all types of activities, as well as provides all of the essential aids for those who are in need. They encourage students to branch out and make new experiences and meet different people, as they believe it is important to Western experience of learning how to be a well-rounded, liberally educated individual."
Senior,4,"WWU is in a great town, but campus itself is really low in diversity. 
Academics were good, all my professors were happy to chat during their office hours and encouraged curiosity. The school has lots of clubs and is just uphill from downtown so there is plenty to do, not to mention the endless recreation."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at WWU. I was a little older when starting college, but loved every minute of it! I wish the school had more diversity and school spirit, though. The professors were great and I loved all of my classes. Bellingham is a great town if you're looking for somewhere not too big. Western is great about sustainability, recycling, and is surrounded by beautiful nature. You'll walk to class right next to a deer and watch black squirrels running all over the place. Go to WWU if you love nature, a smaller town, want to be close to Canada, and want a great liberal arts education."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, and I’m enjoying the classes I’m taking. I’ve also made some lifelong friends here."
Senior,4,I loved the campus. Very beautiful. There are a lot of really good professors and it is overall a good learning environment.
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus. Helpful professors. Great tutoring center and library. Lots of hidden spots to study that are quiet. I wish the dorms were nicer. Dorms are not bad just not great. Great town that loves the students as well.
Sophomore,2,"Having to go to remote learning for Spring Quarter of 2020, I saw exactly how useless some of my professors are. It really highlighted how unnecessary some instructors are and came across as an excuse for them to put in less work than usual."
Freshman,2,"To be completely honest I have struggle this quarter. Each professor is different and has gone about teaching different. I really benefit when my professor incorporates zoom to have a lecture because it feels as though I am attending class. It has been so nice to be able you spend time with my family and be able to complete my school work. However, some classes have been hard to learn material through. I put a great amount of stress on myself to get good grades and understand the concepts being taught but right now I’m more focused on trying to turn everything in on time. I really miss the in person classes with friends that can help and the overall experience and growth that should come with this time. Though these problems do not make or break my overall experience of this year because it has been amazing. I’m so grateful for all the effort put in to make Western a healthy and fun atmosphere."
Alum,2,"The only reason I give western more than 1 star is because I had a couple great professors that I am still in occasional contact with many years later. The class options are a joke. The advisory department is nearly non-existent. They are very unorganized and way over priced. Too many professors teaching one sided beliefs. Too many young sheep incompetent enough to believe every bit of the bias. Way, way overpriced. On top of all that Bellingham has continued to get more gross every year. Vagrants, garbage, and drugs litter the downtown area."
Senior,2,"I am attending a Teacher Education Outreach Program through WWU and my experience has been nothing but rocky. The first quarter I participated everyone in administration from the director of our location to the dean of the College of education quit, and so many things have fallen though the cracks."
Graduate Student,2,"This is one of the worst run schools I have ever experienced. I guess there are a few good professors, but most of the ones I have met are really checked out. The vibe on campus is depressing, and the students are weird. It's just a really strange place."
Freshman,2,"I was extremely disappointed with WWU. This school has some major problems. One of them was actually one of the reasons I chose to come here-- it being a liberal school. This school is probably 99% liberal. I, myself am very liberal, but the problem with such a large political majority is that people stop challenging their own beliefs. There is no plurality of thought at WWU. The whole school lacks diversity. This school is so white it’s a joke. It's like going to school with 15,000 Mac Demarco's. And yet there's no sense of community on campus. The most SERIOUS issue about WWU however is the ResLife situation. I don't have enough characters to explain, but look up the WWU ResLife petition and you will get a small part of what is going on here at WWU. Their actions show how little they really care about their students. I have had some amazing professors, so shout out to them. They were the only reason I didn't transfer sooner."
College Junior,2,no greek life but I am glad
College Sophomore,2,I hate Western and I plan to transfer. The people are terrible and my overall experience has been negative.
College Sophomore,2,No one is interested in sports at Western because the students don't take pride in their school.
College Sophomore,2,I don't like Western and plan on transferring. Everyone is the same. They all like hiking and weed. No one works hard or cares about grades. The students aren't very ambitious.
College Student,2,"This school is mostly white. People try very hard to be tolerant of everyone, but unfortunately they can fall short when it comes to race. There are only like 400 black people to the 13,000 white people on campus, which makes it difficult and obvious to be a minority."
College Junior,2,"I've had pretty terrible encounters with the administration, I think it's better if you don't transfer in."
College Freshman,2,"Hate it, gross and dining hall workers are rude."
College Sophomore,2,"As someone looking to live off campus next year, there's not a ton of options and I'm worried about finding something before December."
College Freshman,2,"It is hit or miss, either great of terrible and never really in between. I chose bad, because its bad more than it's great."
College Freshman,2,"I just felt that it was very far from campus and the nearest dining hall making it inconvinent to go to classes, the rec, or to get food."
College Junior,2,There are lots of huge and impersonal classes. A lot of programs are ridiculously understaffed so what professors we have are so overworked that they don't care about connecting with individual students. Western puts in a place a lot of totally useless GUR requirements so your first two years is almost comically easy depending on what you take. They don't expect much from you. There are people doing interesting research etc but they aren't really accessible to undergrads.
College Freshman,2,"Most parties are off campus but there certainly are quite a few. It's easy to avoid if youre not into that, like me, but its certainly noticeable."
College Junior,2,Campus housing is at most a capable place to sleep. The community is what keeps housing an option in my books.
College Junior,2,Students could be much more involved
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process was extremely tedious, and I did not get much aid even though my family is under financial strain due to special circumstances. On the other hand, I have heard of other students being rewarded larger financial aid packages through being dishonest. When I applied for school I was presented with scholarship opportunities, but since I enrolled it is more difficult to find scholarships which I qualify for."
College Sophomore,2,Parking lots are terrible with many potholes and parking passes are way over priced!
College Sophomore,2,"When it rains (which it does half of the time here), walking on campus on the bricks is terrible and slippery."
College Freshman,2,IT RAINS ALL THE TIME WHO CHOSE THIS LOCATION FOR THIS SCHOOL
College Freshman,2,"It's a dorm. It's not fantastic and it's pretty expensive. I live in Higginson, which is nice because you don't have to share a bathroom with a whole floor, but the rooms are cold and tiny and there's kind of a weird atmosphere because you can't just leave your door open like you could in a dorm with hallways, which makes it a little harder to make friends."
College Sophomore,2,"I wish they had a solid Engineering Program or a Nursing Program. Other than that, it is fine."
College Senior,2,I've not been able to get help paying for school for years. I finally over the summer been able to qualify for a little help but with riding cost of tuition I certainly struggle.
College Freshman,2,I understand parking is very difficult and expensive so I left my car at home.
College Sophomore,2,"I hate dorms. You can't escape school and if you have weird neighbors, you're stuck. People are so annoying and weird here. Dorms just make you stuck. The WiFi is spotty and the rooms are tiny. The bathrooms are okay, but not stellar. The closet space is next to non-existent. The social system depends a lot on if you're outdoorsy or a party type and if you aren't either, you're out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,It rains a lot of the time. Campus is not very equipped for rain even though this is western Washington. There are often big puddles and lots of mess. There is usually wind as well. This makes walking around on campus a huge hassle and totally miserable.
College Sophomore,2,"Lots are located pretty far from most things, including a lot of dorms. The permit costs are reasonable for the quarter, but weekly and daily are super expensive. Tickets are given heavily if no permit is used. The need for a car isn't that big though unless you go far off bus lines. Parking spaces are limited and far from everything."
College Sophomore,2,"I can almost always smell or see weed. Same with alcohol. It isn't even limited to just the weekends; people partake almost any day of the week. People don't generally care if you don't drink, but if you don't smoke, you get some weird responses and pressures. Policy enforcement is average. Some people get caught, but a lot don't."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's not a good location and you will probably have to live in an unsafe neighborhood if you want to live next to the school. It will be about average or maybe a little more as far as price but it wont be nice.
College Sophomore,2,"two hours from a major airport, irritating shuttle"
College Freshman,2,I do not like the food. Poorly cooked and has no taste.
Recent Alumnus,2,It rains a lot so we can't do much. It's not fun when we have to walk outside in the rain.
College Sophomore,2,"MY COLLEGE TEAMS DO OK AT TERNAMENTS AND WHAT NOT, BUT I DO NOT GET TOO INVOLVED, TOO MUCH HOMEWORK. SCHOOL SPIRIT REALLY ISNT APPARENT."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug use is the single worst downside to my school. I do not drink or smoke, nor will I ever do any drugs. I don't judge people who do, I'm just a health freak. Unfortunately, people who do smoke a lot think it is weird if you do not. I have however, found many people who do or do not and simply don't care how I feel about it. The point is, if you look for friends, you will find them, no matter your social habits."
College Junior,2,"Parking pass is about $75 per quarter. Unfortunately they sell more parking passes than they have spaces. The lots are gravel and full of pot holes. Student parking is only on one end of campus, so you may have to park and run across campus to get to class.  Buses are a lot easier."
College Junior,2,Not very strict. Mostly police are concerned with parking violations.
College Sophomore,2,Expensive for food that doesn't even taste very good.
College Junior,2,"I would estimate the student body at western to be at least 90% caucasian. Most people are from Washington or Colorado or Montana and most international students or those who would be considered ""diverse"" ban together and the social scenes don't mix much."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of options when it comes to dorm life, and make sure to pick the best option that fits your wants, because I ended up making the wrong decision.  I'm a student who stays away from drugs, alcohol, and promiscuity and I was unaware of the prevalence of such on the Ridge my freshman year.  I lived in a 'substance free' dorm with the expectation that such a title would be upheld, but was not and I ended up changing roommates because I did not get along with my first one on the grounds of the substance free policy.  I received little help from the RA other than the expectation that I solve my own problems.  This being said, the other side of campus has a lot of pros to it, and I often found myself hanging out in the honors cluster in Edens where I made a good deal of friends."
College Sophomore,2,"I plan to have an intership, so I have more of a chance to get the job that I would like."
College Sophomore,2,"It's okay to be apart of my program.  The classes demand a lot in such a short amount of time, which is very stressful.  The teachers are not the best, so it adds on to the stress."
College Junior,2,"I didn't receive any aid, only loans. They didn't even offer me enough loans to cover my total coast, so my parents had to take some loans and pay a little out of pocket for my education, and we really couldn't afford that."
College Junior,2,Hardly any parking. And the parking maids are sticklers and the tickets are more expensive than the city of bellingham
College Junior,2,There are some good places but mostly bad. The property management likes to ding you for everything and get you for the most amount of money as possible.
College Freshman,2,"It's not too bad, but the drivers here are maniacs. They're completely awful, the permit isn't the best price. But, there are various locations that can get you very close to your classes."
College Freshman,2,It's average at best. They do not enforce safety concerns. I do not get any notifications of activity happening around campus for hours until it's resolved.
College Freshman,2,It rains almost everyday during the second half of fall quarter and the entirety of winter quarter. if you don't have rain boots your shoes will get completely ruined and you will constantly be wet from the knee down. Its really cold and when it is sunny it makes it even colder.
Recent Alumnus,2,I did not attend any parties at Western Washington University. I was an RA for two years and wasn't interested in partying my second two years.
College Freshman,2,"Dining hall food often lacks flavor although every so often, you will find yourself with a delicious meal. There is quite a bit of variety in dining hall food. The best dining hall is Fairhaven, though it is inconvenient for anyone who lives elsewhere on campus. You can also use your Dining/Viking Dollars at markets, cafes, etc. on campus. The best place to go is Zoe's Bagels in the library. They have the best bagels. You also can't go wrong with Subway or a smoothie from Haggard Hideaway."
College Freshman,2,"The only campus strictness I've really seen in action is that in the dorms. The drug & alcohol policies have a fairly high standard as Resident Advisors are there to do there job, and really act more as a parent. This policy as well as things such as downloading music/movies are taken seriously. After three or four times I believe you can be put on housing probation which means you're not allowed to live in the dorms any longer. Be careful or take your party else where!"
College Freshman,2,"Rainy, cloudy, very little sunshine; if you are looking for typical Washington, Bellingham is the place. However, when the sun does come out, and you go down to the beach...you couldn't ask for better weather than on those days!"
College Sophomore,2,Western is not helpful when it comes to getting financial aid
College Freshman,2,"It's great that the huge C-lots in south campus are free on the weekends, but if you want to leave your car overnight on a weekday, it's very difficult finding free street parking!"
College Sophomore,2,Parking passes are expensive and they are really good at giving out tickets for the school lots if you don't have one. The bus system in Bellingham is awesome and you get a bus pass with tuition. If you still want a car you can generally find parking within a decent walking distance on the street.
College Sophomore,2,Occasional snow in the winter. TONS of rain in the fall and winter. The spring and summer are absolutely beautiful.
College Freshman,2,Parking can be a pain in the butt depending on when you decide to come to the campus. The gravel lots seem to always have open places but you have to pay in order to park. They do have places where you don't have to pay to park on weekends but most of the time they are full. Need to be careful when parking on the side of roads and parking lots they can be full and a tight squeeze.
Works Here,1,"Diversity at Western means gender inclusion, not diversity. If you are black, brown, yellow, orange, purple, or any color other than white, do not apply to this institution. The roots of this town are racist, heck the entire PNW was the last area to abolish slavery—get yourselves woke. The university has roots and is easily recognizable if you see through the privilege and entitlement in students...and faculty. Undergrads you have options, grad students stay very far away.

Also, this is truth. WWU enrollment loves to report real world negative reviews on this site. -Student/Employee"
Junior,1,"I dropped out when quarter went online. Professors are incompetent with making a switch online (of no fault on their own.) 

WGU offers many degrees online for half the price as WWU."
Sophomore,1,"The students are not very accepting and the school's ""diversity"" is a complete joke. If you like a lonlier, watered down and expensive version of high school, this the college for you. Like someone else said, everyone here appears dead inside. Bullying and rumors run rampant, others are extremely delicate and lack basic social skills, but everyone has a sense of entitlement."
Junior,1,"Hate it. Pathetic loser of a university. The students are zombies. Seriously, just walk around campus and see how sad and depressed everyone looks. The administration is terrible and incompetent. Some of the professors are OK, but a lot of them have one foot out the door. HORRIBLE food on campus."
Alum,1,"They keep stringing you through classes if your Major is full of hundreds of applicants and there are only 60 spots available or what-ever amount. 

Point being they told me my Ideas of what I want to do in life, my business and goals are impossible. I had investors I found through networking and filed for a permit for an I502 grow processor. My professor said I’d never make it and denied my application to my Major twice and accepted people who don’t know what they are doing in life or even why they are taking that major and scored lower on tests than I did and the professor accepts to them. 

There are good professors but I don’t pay $30,000 to get an “education” and be told I’m not smart enough to live life and goals. 

I dropped out started my own business now make like $40,000 two years out and I keep making more money Every Day! Don’t let them suck your money away! Keep passionate to your ideas don’t let people discourage great ideas. Always keep learning"
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,"Buchanan Towers is terrible. Very far from classes and small, old bathrooms."
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek system at WWU
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek Life at all. I love it
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at Western and that is why I chose it.
College Freshman,1,I believe greek life is good when it comes to their community involvement but the rules and social norms they have are somewhat over the top.
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greek Life. Not having Greek Life, however, is the reason that some people are attracted to WWU."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek Life at Western Washington University.
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek system at Western Washington but most of the students like that about the school.
College Junior,1,WWU athletics is a joke. As far as I can tell no one even knows they exist.
College Junior,1,"There are so many academic hoops to jump through that it is impossible to find your own path, and very difficult to pursue your interests"
College Student,1,They continually lose my paperwork. I've been fighting with them for almost a year now.  Not helpful AT ALL
College Junior,1,There's very little in terms of financial aid that you can get without independently applying for scholarships.  Trying to find financial aid for studying abroad or summer term is a nightmare.  The financial aid office is extremely unhelpful.
College Freshman,1,"I didn't receive financial aid because my family doesn't have ""financial need"" "
Recent Alumnus,1,Our school is by the end of town so there is not anywhere close to eat.
Recent Alumnus,1,I have never been to a party at my school but I like it that way. I'm not a partner.
College Junior,1,Parking is terrible. Parking permits are ridiculously expensive.
College Junior,1,The purpose of Greek life is all wrong. It is a lame excuse to buy friends.
College Junior,1,"There is not much diversity at Western. It's kind of disheartening, to see but there is some diversity. Mostly Asian."
College Junior,1,"I've received some financial aid, but every year it become less and less and they don't give you any inkling as to what you'll be receiving until august so it's hard to know how many outside scholarships you should be trying to apply for. All in all the system has been difficult and tedious, especially the review and verification process."
College Junior,1,"In order to take art classes at western, you have to be an art major.  And in order to declare the major, you have to submit a portfolio of 12 images and artist's statement that is reviewed by a panel, determining whether or not you are allowed in.  Make sure you start this process well in advance of the deadline, because trying to contact the art dept. staff with questions via email is slow and unreliable, I've found.  Also, be sure which program within the department (industrial design, graphic design, studio art) you're applying to is really the one you want because while it is possible to switch from one program to another, you have to reapply to the whole department.  The entire process is really just a huge pain."
College Sophomore,1,"Western is a very liberal campus and somewhat because of this many rules are not enforced which can make life hard for a studious individual.  The substance free dorm I lived in was not substance free and more often than not a blind eye is turned towards any kind of behavior against the rules.  The only saving grace is campus security, which although I have never used it is nice to know the option is always there."
College Sophomore,1,"The hardest part of being a EET major, is that for every ETEC class you take, they only offer it once per year.  So if you miss it, or fail the class, your graduation is delayed by a year.  It is very stressful."
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do at western other than go to house parties. And those are hard to find if you don't know lots of people. Also the parties often get broken up by the police when they get too rowdy.
College Student,1,"The food is horrible in the dining halls on campus. I rarely ever eat there and chose instead to prepare food myself in my dorm. The food is very high in carbs, rarely ever seasoned, and the dining hall is very repetitive in what it serves."
College Junior,1,"They lowered the print quota this year, except for the first quarter for new students. It's very inconvenient to have to add money to your print quota because there aren't very many places you can do it. The print quota that is provided for each student is not enough to get through the quarter."
College Freshman,1,"I did not receive any financial aid whatsoever, and there were very few scholarships that apply to me. I rarely got calls back about potential scholarships and was left in the dark by my school."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not a lot of school spirit and there is no football team. Sports are not a big deal at all here. But thankfully, intramural sports are. I easily joined intramural volleyball my freshman year."
College Freshman,1,"I haven't noticed school spirit for sports and there is no footballteam at Western or in Bellingham. I grew up going to high school football games all my life, I thought it would be no big deal without them. Turns out, I really miss it alot. It's so nice to go to a football game and show your school spirit! It's just something comforting to me, coming from a small town. I hear we have a great Basket Ball team, but never bothered to go since sports aren't talked about much here. People are way more into Theater, Music, and other performing arts."
College Sophomore,1,"very little visitor parking, and if you want to park on campus you need a pass that cost $$$"
College Freshman,1,"Parkind on campus SUCKS. The free spots are non existant before 6 pm, and a permit is 320 a year. Just take the bus."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm not sure how all the dorms are, but at the ridge, people can do whatever the heck they want, as long as the RA doesn't see. I think its considered the party dorms though. People are always smoking pot 24/7."
College Freshman,1,"The sky=GREY ALL THE TIME. It can be pretty hard for out of state kids to adjust.. but I'm from California and I actually found the rain to be pretty peaceful. It definitely keeps you focused on academics, which can be good (or it can keep you focused on drinking in your room.. dont let that happen!) It's not the actual weather that's depressing, but the fact that you can't go outside to socialize as often as you'd like to. Don't let that discourage you though, when we do have sunny days, they're incredibly beautiful and everyone takes full advantage."
College Freshman,1,"Without Help, Another $20 Later – Parking was well, awful. We had to pay $20 for two nights during summerstart, and we ended up losing the receipt. Which, they had no sympathy for. We had to pay for another one. Thankfully we didn't get into trouble because they not only ticket, they also tow your vehicle."

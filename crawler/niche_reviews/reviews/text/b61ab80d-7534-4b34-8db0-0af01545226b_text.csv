Junior,5,"What I like about South University, is that the staff and the professors want to see the students succeed in the career that they are pursuing. I haven’t felt like I’m a inconvenience to them and that means the world to me. Unlike any other colleges or universities that I’ve been to or seen, they actually have an appreciation week for their students, and that’s honestly needed because college students are overly stressed out at times. One improvement that South University could improve on, is how certain programs are laid out, such as certain information is not always clear or presented. South University is a great school, and I recommend anyone who are looking to further their education to apply there."

I can not comment on the return on investment as I am only in my second quarter of prerequisites while I am continuing to work full time.

I feel that the professors that I have want their students to succeed and work with you on any questions or concerns you may have.  The location isn't too bad despite being located in busy Short Pump.  The parking is a little difficult at times, but totally manageable.  Overall I feel this institution is doing a good job with its students."

Junior,2,"The Dean at the school will say one thing and do another. I was in the nursing program and the teacher they have teaching the Fundamental's lab doesn't know what she is doing. They don't give second chances in the lab like other schools do. They treat everything you do in the lab like that is how you will be doing the skills when you get out of school, which is not the case, because most hospitals want you to do up to a year of orientation is a new nurse. The lady in charge of giving students access to the lab does not do her job."
College Sophomore,2,"It was difficult obtaining finiancal assitance for balance for semster,"
College Sophomore,2,"considering school is private, tution is extremly high which results in students not being able to attend such a great school"
College Sophomore,2,i understand college is expensive however I don't feel like my financial aid counselor was up front with me in the beginning and now I owe a lot in student loans 
College Junior,2,You pay more in tution at South.  When you get into the nursing program the rate goes up $2000 a quater.  To me that isn't fair to the hard working people of everyday life. Who don't get enough in grant and loans and have to pay out of pocket for the rest of there tution.
College Senior,2,"South University has a great library, some great professors, and great classrooms. However, if they made a cafeteria available to students, we could save more money. They could also lower tuition costs, because it is expensive."
Alum,1,"Expensive. Misleading. Did not encourage training before exiting the program. Said they only offer it through the master's program,  just so they can milk you for more money. I haven't landed a job yet because I don't have""experience"". I'm in over my head with loans I can not afford to pay back working an hourly job and supporting a family. Bachelor's in psychology, just a 65,000 dollar picture hanging on my wall now."

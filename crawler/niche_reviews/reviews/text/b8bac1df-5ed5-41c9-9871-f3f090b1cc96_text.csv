If you ever have any questions on anything in class I know that the professors will be there. Grays Harbor has a learning center with tutors for every subject if you need any minor extra help. All the staff is super friendly and always helpful with everything to point you in the right direction. The one thing I'd like to see change at Grays Harbor is to have more night classes. There are plenty of classes in the day but I feel like if they had more night classes it would give more people an opportunity to go to school without interfering with their everyday life."

I absolutely love GHC. I received so much support and encouragement and non-judgmental advice that I mustered the courage and changed my direction to going on to getting a bachelor's and possibly a master's degree because they have been so supportive of my dreams. GHC not only helped me academically, but also personally.

I am very pleased I chose to come here for my education. So many students are making leaps and bounds while attending GHC. Watching peers transform their lives and the experiencing the changes bring joy and excitement every day."

Niche User,4,"In a National state of emergency due to COVID-19, GHC has transferred all academic classes online. With classes being online, it is hard to contact instructors as you would in person. Classes are similar as it would be in person as well. The learning environment online is great and would definitely do online classes again."
Niche User,4,I'm so happy that I went here. I liked the people at Grays Harbor! The teachers were very friendly and helpful. Grays Harbor is very easy to have close communication with classmates and professors whether it is through the phone or through email. So many people in my family also went to Grays Harbor and they also loved it. My Uncle mentioned how the teachers will even help set up study groups to help student who needs extra help out of class. It is such a great environment to be around! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great education. The nursing program is also really good and many of my family members have gone through the program and are now great nurses.
Junior,4,"This school is a good school overall, the professors are great and very knowledgeable. The campus is clean and the staff is friendly. They even have some bachelors programs which is amazing. The only thing that I would like to see change is the communication aspect of the college. Things are often miscommunicated or not communicated at all. Students need to be strong self-advocates to get the information they need."
Junior,4,"Grays Harbor College recently went through a schedule change that myself and other students find difficult to work with. It seems to have negatively impacted the things we try to work around such as child care, transportation, work, (etc)."

Alum,4,Attending college here was an interesting experience. The shift was beginning from fresh out of high school students to 2nd career students.

Sophomore,4,I liked that I was so close with my professors in each class I had. I was able to get the help and support I needed to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Being a Running Start student (a high school student taking college classes), I actually really like Grays Harbor college.

Currently I am a part of the first Bachelor of Applied Science in Organizational Management there right now and there have been some some bumps in the road considering it is  a new program, but now everything is worked out and the program is going great."
Graduate Student,4,Grays Harbor Community College was really good with being open to ideas and to change. The professors were very supportive and they did their best to give you your moneys worth. The only thing that I would change is making the helpful programs more known.

College Sophomore,4,so far the students at Grays Harbor have been helpful and friendly . From the first time in the HUB I felt a welcome feel and a open environment...It was a nice feeling being Its been over 12 years that Ive been in school.
College Junior,2,I feel lost with the financial aid situation at my school. I feel like no one cane give me a straight answer.
College Senior,2,"Some professors are very organized and professional, but some are very disorganized and lacks discipline; some are regularly late for the class, and one was even 20 minutes late for the final exam and spoke loudly during the exam."
College Senior,2,"Again, some professors are good, but some lack discipline."
College Senior,2,"There are a few very good professors, but some professors lack discipline; some of them are regularly late for the class, and one of them even started a final exam 20 minutes late and spoke loudly during the exam."
College Sophomore,2,"I love the price, but the school is boring. "
College Sophomore,2,We need much better athletic options and activities for students to enjoy.
College Sophomore,2,The school has too many older people and not enough fun stuff to interest the younger crowd.
College Sophomore,2,The school needs to offer more help with the advisors on selecting classes and majors
College Sophomore,2,My high school did not adequately prepare me for how hard the classes would be.
College Sophomore,2,I would like to see more course availability and more online options
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot to do. I would like to see the athletics and the gym more available for everyone.
College Sophomore,2,Too Old – Many older back to school types who are trying to get a new career or better job
College Sophomore,2,"Not Sure – I will be transferring,  but I don't think post-grad students will be a priority"
College Sophomore,2,"Class Offering – More class courses need to be offered for students or open a larger classroom so kids can graduate on time, they close out way too soon."
College Sophomore,2,The first year I was not advised well and some classes are not offered enough or they fill up too fast
College Senior,2,The education i'm getting is worth the money in the long run. I was never able to get financial aid because I never qualified so I always had to take out an emergency student loan. Which was an easy and very helpful process.
College Sophomore,2,"Advisors Need to Be More Helpful – My first advisor did not seem to care what major I had or what my interests were. I wasted time taking classes I didn't need, because I was not on the right major track"
College Senior,2,"Could Use Improvement – The computer network at our school tends to be quite slow. It takes quite awhile to log on to certain computers, depending on the computer lab. Another topic would be printing on campus. Us students are only allowed to print out a certain amount of pages due to the budget which can be a disadvantage to those who do not own a computer. I have personally brought my laptop to school to work on assighments that I had saved but couldn't use the internet in most areas of the campus because it would be too weak of a signal. Fortunately, I can do my school work at home because I have access to a computer however some students do not have that privilege."
College Freshman,2,Post Ed – There isnt much post grad services or career center options that I no of.
College Senior,2,Internship/Job Opportunities – We have a limited amount of agencies in our community the pertain to human services.
Alum,1,"Very poorly run, but okay instructors and pretty campus. Classes don't transfer well to other colleges and universities. Not good prep for university. Low success and graduation rates."
College Junior,1,I dont take online courses
College Sophomore,1,Not Helpful – The school needs more advisor interaction with students who are not sure what classes they need to sign up for depending on their possible degree decisions.

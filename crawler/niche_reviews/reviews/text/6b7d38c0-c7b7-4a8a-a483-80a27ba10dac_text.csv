Alum,5,I didn't take any online courses but I'm sure that the caliber is similar to that of in person classes!
Senior,5,"What makes Brandeis special are the things between the lines. If you’re looking for the best food or the nicest housing, Brandeis might not be for you. If your priority is meeting people and having experiences that make you a better version of yourself, that challenges you and helps you grow, then Brandeis is the right place for you. Brandeis makes up for it’s meh housing options and mediocre food (they’re changing food providers this may improve next year) with intangible opportunities and experiences that you can’t find anywhere else. I became a leader, and activist, and a more confident version of myself there."
Freshman,5,"I love how accepting the environment is. I also like how Brandeis University emphasizes on exploring many different opportunities and supports double majoring, as well as creating your own major."
Alum,5,"This was life changing. I met incredible professors, diverse students and was able to be active on campus in numerous student activities and serve on boards."
Freshman,5,"Brandeis offers not only a competitive environment, but also a unique and welcoming environment as well. Known for its well academics, its great to be able to walk around and feel welcomed, despite the background in which they come from. The benefit of being a student at Brandeis University is having the ability to travel anywhere in the city as well."
Freshman,5,"I love Brandeis. I think the people here are all very kind and everyone genuinely cares about you, this includes the professors. There is something to do for everyone and everyone finds their place and like-minded group. There are so many resources for health, academics, etc. Brandeis is a small but close community with the access and resources of a big university, you get the best of both worlds."
Freshman,5,"I personally love how peaceful the campus is, it's almost like a bubble, but not in a super isolated way. The shuttles to Boston and Waltham are great to go out whenever you feel like it and they run super late as well. Not much Greek life or partying, but that can be seen as a benefit or a disadvantage to some. The dining hall food is average, and the dorming is unequal-some are great while others are more run down, it's really just the luck of the draw."
Sophomore,5,"Brandeis University is a great school. I think what I most value is how approachable the professors are. If I have questions or problems, I know I can always ask for help. The other students are kind and welcoming as well, and overall I am very satisfied with Brandeis University."
Sophomore,5,"Brandeis is a great place to be for your undergraduate education. There is a wide array of majors and minors and classes that will deepen your knowledge. The graduation requirements are flexible enough for you to explore your interests while receiving a great liberal arts education. I like the Usdan dining hall because it provides both healthy options and delicious desserts. The freshman dorming at North was good because it was convenient to access all the parts of campus, including classes, food, and gym. I was able to continue exercising throughout the year at the gym and in the pool.  I have enjoyed my experience at Brandeis so far and would encourage high school seniors to apply here."
Freshman,5,"The first time I visited Brandeis University, I was immediately struck with how dynamic the campus was. I saw people who appeared to be from all different backgrounds interact so naturally and enthusiastically with each other. It was honestly something I had not seen in other campuses I had visited. Living in a town where over 95% of the population is White, I don’t get to expose myself to people of different cultures very often. Attending Brandeis University will give me this opportunity. Brandeis University will help me grow academically and socially with its rigorous courses and diversity. The idea of being around these individuals, listening to their stories, sharing my story, and learning from each other and what we have been through to be where we are now excites me. Brandeis University is an opportunity for me to exchange knowledge and experience with individuals while getting one of the best educations in the United States."
Alum,5,"I cannot imagine having received a finer education in neuroscience.  Brandeis academics are extraordinary, and that was what I was looking for.  If you're not interested in a serious, hard-working environment, you should look elsewhere.  Every single one of my professors inspired me in significant and unique ways. My biggest criticism: the snowflakey student body, and the giant bubble in which most of them seem to have always existed."
Niche User,5,"The community is so incredible! The people are so kind, the location is so beautiful! I have nothing bad to say about the place! The weekend I spent there was so filled with love and friendliness!"
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at Brandeis, I made lots of great friends and was very involved in the clubs and organizations. One downside is that being a smaller school, some courses are only offered every year or every other year, so it requires some planning."
Freshman,5,"The classes are challenging, but the teacher are caring and devoted to both their work and their students."
Sophomore,5,"I have met some amazing people at Brandeis, and its location couldn't be better.  Boston is close, and the school offers the option to take classes at other area universities, including Tufts and MIT.  The professors are knowledgeable and, more importantly, very accessible to undergraduates.  The older dorms are only OK, but the newer ones are very nice, and with a small campus, everything is an easy walk.  Brandeis also offers a free campus shuttle both to area conveniences and into Boston.  I do wish the food was better at the dining halls but there are off-campus options."
Alum,5,"Brandeis is an amazing liberal arts school, diverse student and staff community, a wonderful support system and a platform to grow learn and experience!"
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the diversity on campus. It felt as if you were on a bigger campus but it was just a spread out campus which was nice. The campus food was amazing and there were so many different options to eat.
Graduate Student,5,"Great place to be. very welcoming, the instructors are very knowledgeable and experienced in their various fields of study. Coupled with the various scholarships available to international and domestics students. On a average a students get 50% scholarships."
Niche User,5,"Excellent science laboratories and diverse, international student body. The freshman dorm rooms are small, though."
Freshman,5,"I am loving Brandeis. My professors work with me, my friends are incredibly intelligent people who come from all over the US and the world, and there are always things to do on and off campus."
Niche User,5,I went there for a recruiting trip and had an amazing time.  Everyone I met with was so helpful.  The class I attended was informative and well taught.
Sophomore,5,The people here are so friendly. It's like its own town inside Waltham. Food could be better but overall the people and the professors are amazing.
Freshman,5,The faculty at this university is absolutely amazing with professors who are fully qualified experts in their subjects and are most often involved in research and contributing to their fields even today. There are many opportunities to be involved in research (even as a freshman!) and fun clubs and diverse organizations on campus.
Freshman,5,"I started about two months ago. I am taking a lot of courses, which comes with a lot of work and studying. But I have also made a ton of friends already. I love my roommate and close friends here. Meals are good too :) they cater to any needs. It's really wonderful. and the campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,I fell in love with this community from the moment I set foot on campus. It went from a safety school to my first choice for multiple reasons. This campus was home for 4 years and it still feels like home to this day.
Alum,5,"I'm grateful for the opportunities I found and received in Film Department, although the department lacks producing opportunities. Proud to be an alumna."
Alum,5,"Brandeis was a very good school with wonderful teachers and a plethora of educated professors. I learned so much and was involved in many extra curricular activities, while completing my triple major."
Freshman,5,"Brandeis University gave me everything it promised and more during my first semester as a student. I have been exposed to a wide range of highly challenging courses with top notch professors who are dedicated to their students' success. The campus is very well groomed, student life is full of a wide range of consistently active clubs and events, the students here are generally outgoing and diverse, and the entire university is dedicated to the social awareness of its impact on the world. 
What I would like to see more of is administratively led social diversity where not only the diversity of the student body is promoted, but also of the faculty. 
Also, the standards of our food desperately need to be higher in quality and nutrition not only within the dining halls, but also within the campus grocery stores especially for those who do not have the ability to take themselves food shopping off-campus"
College Senior,5,"Professors are challenging, many research opportunities, friendly motivating environment"
College Sophomore,5,Brandeis has a very safe campus. Theft is also generally not an issue. You can leave your laptop and bag at the library while you leave for an hour and still come back to find it untouched.
College Freshman,5,Almost all of the upperclassmen I know have internships. I feel as though you can say you go to Brandeis and you'll have a chance to get an internship.
College Freshman,5,Hiatt Career Center is incredible and so very helpful.
College Freshman,5,Professors are very passionate about what they do and want to see their students succeed.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,"The first six weeks at Brandeis, I could have been anywhere. I was constantly introducing myself and learning new names and faces, and I was getting accustomed to having a different schedule each day instead of the 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. school days I was used to in high school. By Thanksgiving, I had made enough friends I could not imagine myself anywhere else. The classes are difficult, but interesting. If I am careful with my schedule, I can make time for academics, spending time with friends, dance, church, keeping in touch with friends from home, and occasional off-campus excursions. Unfortunately, I had class during most of my professors' office hours, but the professors I was able to approach outside of class were usually very supportive. One of my favorite experiences was unexpectedly meeting new friends by volunteering to serve dinner during Codestellation."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I'm a nerd, so I had a really great experience at Brandeis. If you care about your education, this is the place to be."
College Sophomore,5,I have no problems with the academics whatsoever.
College Senior,5,"Love everything about my school. Even though it's not one of the most social, academics always come first in college. Engaged professors, interesting classes and good jobs after graduation."
College Junior,5,"Brandeis has the resources of the most elite of universities at its disposal despite being relatively small and secluded. Nevertheless, its size and distance from Boston serve as an asset, providing its students with a rich and diverse college experience unrivaled by any school in the area or country."
College Student,5,It is a top-ranking school that offers its students attention and opportunities many schools with a high status don't.
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of people who want to help students and want to see them succeed. There are many opportunities and a lot of different places to find help if you need it.
College Freshman,5,"I come from a not-so-safe area, but I never have to worry about getting anything stolen, getting jumped, or being hurt on Brandeis's campus. I always feel very safe."
College Freshman,5,"I have the MLK Scholarship which practically covers all of my expenses. I can't say I have any tips, as I did not have to apply for this scholarship, nor have I had much interaction with the Financial Services office."
College Junior,5,"So far, I have really enjoyed most all of my classes. I think that the professors and the academic environment at Brandeis is a huge selling point. Both students and teachers are extraordinarily passionate about what they do and have a lot of knowledge to offer. I like that for the most part, my classes have been on the smaller side, which offers a lot of time to engage with the professors. Most of my professors have also made themselves very accessible through office hours, meetings, email, etc. It has been a pleasure attending classes at Brandeis."
College Sophomore,5,"its adequate too, not too bad jsut don't cross a large boundary and everything is chill"
College Sophomore,5,This school gives very good finanancial aid. many of my peers are adequately helped for the schoool but some people cannot afford the school so they transfer out
College Senior,5,Brandeis offers a lot to students who need it
College Senior,5,"Brandeis really encourages first years to explore their interests, and ""shop around"" before deciding on a major. You don't have to apply to a certain program, though some have minimum GPA requirements. A lot of course requirements are cross-listed, making it possible to take a variety of courses. Brandeis wants you to have the full experience, and dabble --or not dabble- in whichever fields you choose. If you hate math, you'll never have to take it again. If you want to triple major in Biology, Music, and Anthropology- that's more than encouraged. We love diverse thinkers. That's a GREAT thing about Brandeis."
College Sophomore,5,"If you are determined, you can get into almost any class you want if you have the pre-reqs. Professors are usually helpful, informative, and some of the best in their field."
College Junior,5,The Boston area has such a diverse amount of options and many historic restaurants.  There are not many cities with dining like Boston.
College Junior,5,"Brandeis is very unique in that the student population is the most diverse that I have seen.  As a graduate student, I have classmates from dozens of different countries.  The campus is beautiful and the faculty really do care about helping their students to obtain the tools to make a positive difference in the world."
College Junior,5,Brandeis University prides itself on the incredible diversity on campus.
College Junior,5,Brandeis University is a very safe campus.  There is plenty of security around and there are rides available on campus if you are ever afraid to walk at night.  Brandeis is located in a smaller town outside of Boston and is a bit more secluded which adds to the safety as well.
College Freshman,5,"Although science kids seemed to be favored, there are many internship and job opportunities."
College Senior,5,"Drug safety here is great.  Some students drink, and some use marijuana, but it's not really a public thing.  There is zero peer pressure.  The motto is really: Live and let live.  You really can have a great time without (or with!) alcohol here."
College Senior,5,"I have always felt very safe on the Brandeis campus.  The campus police are helpful, but they're not overbearing -- it's a nice mix.  There isn't that much crime.  Sometimes a laptop gets stolen... but that happens at most schools nationwide.  Unfortunately, there have been a few sexual assaults, but again, this is not unique to Brandeis.  However, we do have an assault counselor now to address those issues.  Brandeis really has the interest of students' safety in mind."
College Freshman,5,"I love where I live. It is perfectly situated, the quad is beautiful, and I am close to pretty much everything. Just about anything on campus can be reached in 10 minutes or so at most from just about anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,Just about every minority imaginable is well-represented and welcomed here
College Freshman,5,"No better professors or favcilities, especially for physical, natural, and social sciecnes, and law and business"
College Freshman,5,lots of busses and trains and airplanes in boston
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere here. Many of the students are highly motivated and have multiple interests, which leads to many interesting conversations. The down side is that the financial aid is not great, which also means that a lot of students can afford to come here without aid. If you are a student that will rely on financial aid to attend college (like myself), it can be isolating, especially if you can't afford to go home for every break."
Alum,4,"At the time I didn't participate in any online classes, so I can't say, but I'm sure it held up with the other academics."
Alum,4,"Excellent extracurricular experiences available to expand cultural knowledge.  Although the sports culture has taken a footing in the school and lowered the admittance standards, overall the small school offers a variety of opportunities to broaden your horizons."
Sophomore,4,Small campus. The campus dining is mediocre at best. There are very few parties. Some professors are very helpful.
Alum,4,"Great academics and relationships with professors! Location is a bit far from Boston because of complicated transportation, and campus could be more attractive, but the value in the education was great and I enjoyed studying abroad!"
Alum,4,"Brandeis is an excellent school for academics, diversity, and social justice activities. Students are noticeably welcoming and kind. Brandeis emphasizes inclusion and provides countless clubs to ensure that every person is able to find their niche. Most Brandeis students are overachievers, which means that they have a tendency to over commit and over work. This can be frustrating if you are looking for a school where socializing at parties is a priority. The school does not have Greek life or a strong focus on athletics, so a lot of social events take place in student dorms or at club events. Since it is a university, administrative changes requested by students do take time to happen, but for the most part, the administration tries to be aware of student issues and accommodate as needed. Overall, Brandeis is a school where you will be sure to meet intelligent, motivated people who will become leaders and lifelong friends."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed my academic and athletic experiences at Brandeis. The professors are very passionate and dedicated. Athletic staff tries their best to make our experience better. I would like to see a better connection between the 2. Academia does not support athletics.
Freshman,4,"I love my first year here in Brandeis! The professors here really know what they are doing and really passionate about  their teaching. You can get any academic help as long as you reach for it. Most people I met are nice and welcome. However, we are not a party school indeed. The most common place for socializing is the library lol. The only thing I can complain about is the food. The dinning is terrible and no improved for many years."
Freshman,4,"In academics, this institution is excels without a doubt. The staff and the courses available along with the resources they make available to the students show that they really care. In that department, you really do get your tuition’s worth. The only thing that holds me back from giving this institution 5 stars is the lack of diversity. As a POC, I expected lack of diversity entering a PWI. I’m glad that there is a representation and accommodation for Jewish individuals at Brandeis, but it really feels like other cultures are washed out in the process. Over the years though, these concerns
Were brought to Brandeis higher councils; the University has really improved SO much in the realm of increasing diversity and awareness. In this semester alone I have seen so much positive change and progress on behalf of the university, which shows how much they are willing to adjust to a student’s demands."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are amazing...that’s the only reason I’m here (and the financial aid). The people are really overly sensitive and liberal to the point where it’s annoying. The parties are small and people don’t dance at them?? Depending on which frat house you go to they’ll most likely be playing music that sounds like you’re at a middle school dance (like Katy Perry “firework”). People here are very into their academics which is great, but when it comes to having fun they’d rather be in the library on a Saturday night studying. If you want a cool spunky diverse social scene of a school, this isn’t it. If you solely want to be challenged academically, this is the perfect place for it."
Senior,4,I appreciate all of the individuals I have met including students and faculty. All of my professors are very dedicated to their area of study which I can see in their enthusiasm while teaching and commitment to help students.
Sophomore,4,"I love my time at Brandeis! As a Stem student, there are so many opportunities for me to take. All of the professors have been great in their ability to explain difficult concepts and work directly with students. The introductory chemistry class was a bit difficult, but being able to work through it was a great achievement. 
In terms of housing, I couldn't have been happier. Brandeis has a policy where all incoming freshman must go random for roommates. Despite this being nerve-wracking,  I was put with two amazing people that I am glad to have as friends. I was also able to make lots of friends within my building since orientation was partially organized with people from my building. 
Many people complain about the food, but I believe the food is significantly better than what people say. My mother is a phenomenal cook so I have a good frame of reference.
Overall, Brandeis is a great school that I am excited to attend."
Freshman,4,It's very small and feels isolated at times. Food isn't great. The professors are great and classes are interesting.
Junior,4,The education I'm receiving is top tier. I just wish the food was better. No complaints. It's an all around great university and I highly recommend it to students who are all about their work.
Freshman,4,"Most of the people here are really nice. Most of my professors have been really good at what they do, and all of them were very passionate about their field."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently in my second year at Brandeis. I have found that it has become so easy to find my group of people. It has also been so easy to do what I love doing. I'm in classes that I enjoy, I'm with people I love, and I am just really enjoying my college experience."
Niche User,4,Everyone cares about you at the school. Very good academic rigor and they challenge you to be the best that you can be. It's very easy to get to Boston and adjusting is not difficult. It is a great school and is definitely under shadowed by its surrounding schools.
Sophomore,4,"The majority of classes are very well taught and headed by professors that are beyond over-qualified to be lecturing. While not a place for partying or excelling athletics by any means, there is a very lively community with plenty of opportunity for meeting social needs through clubs. If, however, one is not interested in a club or sport, or is not Jewish, then the social scene is a bit more trying, as many of the students seem to be less sociable outside of class."
Sophomore,4,"Brandeis has rigorous and challenging academic programs. The professors are all passionate about what they are teaching and will always take time with students whenever needed. The party scene and social life at Brandeis is easy to find if you want it, but there is definitely a strong community that shies away from it. The proximity to Boston is great and there are free shuttles to the city, where there is always something to do when you want to get away from Waltham and not so great dining hall food. One thing the school needs to work on is diversity and representation of different backgrounds in professors and staff."
Junior,4,I love Brandeis! The community is friendly and welcoming. The teachers are amazing and really care about their students. The only downside is the administration. They do not listen to the students. Financial aid is also terrible. They rarely give enough money to students.
Freshman,4,"Brandeis is a fairly liberal school. Academic-wise, cultural-wise, and the respect between students regardless of their ethnicity, gender orientation, and backgrounds truly gave me the impression that this campus is open to any students who have the aspirations of becoming part of a diverse and hard-working student body."
Sophomore,4,"I am majoring in chemistry. I think that the academics are good. I do think that some of the faculty could be improved. I hope that as the older faculty continue to retire, they will be replaced with young and newly impassioned professors. I think that the diversity is good, however many people seem to stick with their own race. This can be improved. I think that the athletics are okay but those who are on a sports team can be a little marginalized into their own group because they are always at practice."
Freshman,4,"Brandeis is a great school filled with great people. The professors are top notch and will help you if you are struggling. The dorms and food could be better, but are honestly not the worst around. I love Brandeis and I could not think of a better place to attend!"
Sophomore,4,"Brandeis University offers students a variety of extracurricular activities and academic challenges to push students to achieve their full potential. The class sizes are generally small and the professors are concerned with student success. However, the residence halls on campus are sub-par; the roof caved in in one building and the heating is either non-existent or unbearable. Additionally, there are kosher options available on campus, which are often more appetizing that the non-kosher options on campus."
Freshman,4,Lots of volunteering opportunities. Great big campus - greenery. Cold weather. Nice dorms. Teachers challenge their students. Majority is Jewish and Chinese students.
College Senior,4,"Not an ivy, but its pretty close"
College Senior,4,"close knit, good way to meet more people, and party more"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are great and really knowledgable about their respective fields.
College Sophomore,4,The value of a degree from Brandeis is high.
College Sophomore,4,"I would chose Brandeis again for sure. I love the smaller size of the school because its easy to get around campus quickly. The teachers are great, the food isn't bad, and the students and teachers are very open-minded and kind. The location is also perfect because its easy to get into Waltham and Boston on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,I haven't used a lot of the career services at school yet but I hear that they're pretty helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Brandeis is a great place if you want to make real friendships. No one judges you for the quirks you may have, and everyone is very accepting. If I could do it over again I would choose Brandeis 100%."
College Freshman,4,Expensive and some dorms need renovating but I barely spend any time in my dorm room. I usually just go to the dorm if I want to sleep or chill for a bit.
College Freshman,4,I'm on the swim team and they just redid the pool a few months ago so no complaints there. I haven't used the cardio rooms located in my dorm but I hear they're ok too.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a space for any student in Brandeis athletics. If you like to swim, dance, play sports or just workout, you could feel comfortable at Brandeis"
College Sophomore,4,"Brandeis is great academically. The social environment, however, can use some improvement"
College Freshman,4,"Brandeis is the first place I feel accepted for having goals, it's great. Everyone is so friendly and we all share such pride for being Judges."
College Sophomore,4,"Frat parties at ADPhi are the best, clean frat house."
College Sophomore,4,Teachers are very professional and knowledgeable in their field.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of international students, but people tend to cluster with their own race."
College Sophomore,4,"You smell weed everywhere, but it's like that at all universities."
College Sophomore,4,"I think Brandeis is what you make of it. You have to try to make friends but if you do that, your experience here will be great."
College Sophomore,4,"There is not a huge greek life, as technically the fraternities and sororities aren't affiliated with the school. Nevertheless, they have great events, and so many people are in it, it might as well be Brandeis approved."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of people complain about how small Brandeis is, how awkward the people are, but I think if you actually sit down and reflect on the campus and the community, it's actually not that bad. I love my friends here, and the small tight-knit community Brandeis has going on."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is okay at Brandeis. Only guaranteed for the first couple years, but there are plenty of apartments around Waltham for cheap rent, and there is a facebook page for sublets that makes it easy to get affordable housing off campus"
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is pretty standard at Brandeis. Rush week is crazy, then it tapers off. Many students are silently shunned for joining Greek life, just like at any university, but so be it. There is usually a frat party each weekend."
College Freshman,4,"Brandeis certainly has its perks and downfalls. I'll admit, I really did not wish to come to Brandeis. I had iffy test scores, and managed to get accepted as a midyear at Brandeis, and rejected at some schools of similar caliber. I didn't want to be in Boston, and especially didn't want to be stuck in a school with the stigma of being the ""lamest, most awkward, most religious, most-boring-school-in-the-nation"" University. That said, when I got here, many of these opinions began to change. I have had some excellent professors, some that are so great, they are making me reconsider my major. While the student body is just about as awkward as I expected, I'm finding that awkward really isn't the worst attribute in a person. When visiting other schools with students who are loud, dangerous, ignorant, etc, I feel thankful to be surrounded by people who I deem to be mostly harmless and intelligent individuals. The food isn't as bad as I thought it might be, as many people warned me about. The longer I'm here, the more Brandeis grows on me. No matter where you go, the first month or so is going to be rough. Stick with it. Eventually, you might just find your place."
College Freshman,4,"I've heard complaints about some of the sexual assault procedures, but I have never experienced them myself so I feel that I cannot accurately respond to these questions."
College Freshman,4,"I live in recently renovated dorm, no complaints."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school, be it on the track or in class"
College Freshman,4,"I haven't been to the gym often, but was happy with it every time I've been"
College Freshman,4,"I felt very welcomed, and it's true that everyone here is very nice. People can sometimes be annoying at times, but that's everywhere. The teachers will really try and help you if you ask, and most are very approachable. I have had a few professors, though, while very smart, are not great at conveying that information to a whole class. Overall a great experience so far. Food could be better."
College Freshman,4,I love the classes and the people
College Freshman,4,"Academics are pretty good at Brandeis. The work load is extremely challenging and there are no clear instructions regarding the scope of exam material at times. Classes with graduate students are really poor though. However, academics are not the only things that define a school. Brandeis lacks majorly in several other fields that are important in defining a college experience."
College Freshman,4,The career center is extremely helpful when it comes to sending out information on scholarships and internships.
College Freshman,4,"Fulfilling college requirements includes a lot of freedom, and most professors at Brandeis are continuing to do work in their field, making them very knowledgeable."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus. If I am walking around late at night, I take note of the blue lights. I also know the phone numbers for campus police and BEMCo in case of an emergency."
College Freshman,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed living on campus, and had a smooth adjustment to having a roommate and a communal bathroom from being an only child at home. My hallmates are very friendly. Of course, there is often more nighttime noise than would be ideal. Additionally, I have literally taken clorox wipes into the hall's kitchen because the kitchen is never clean."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never heard of any problems. There are always rumors, but the factual ones are very rare. Similar to other schools."
College Sophomore,4,The professors and the academics are great. Just some of the TAs are not all that.
Alum,2,To expensive for quality of education. Better to invest your time and money in a different school which will offer better value.  Campus is small.
Freshman,2,"This school is odd. There are plenty of resources, yet somehow, I feel like I don't belong. This school is not for the average student -- it's for those who feel like they don't fit in anywhere else. Also, incredibly hard course work accompanied by professors that aren't amazing."
Junior,2,"I found many aspects of Brandeis very disappointing. During my first year, the majority of my professors were't very engaging. They didn't seem truly interested in helping us students. The students on campus can be very awkward, so although some are nice, it is difficult to become friends with students beyond a classroom setting. Social life on campus is very slim unless you join a sorority/ frat or a sports team. The housing opportunities are tremendously over priced and low quality. The meal plans are also expensive despite being very low quality."
Senior,2,"Brandeis boasts the motto ""Truth unto its innermost parts"" and stresses their commitment to social justice, accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. Seems nice, right? Spend more than a few weeks at Brandeis and you'll see that Brandeis' motto and ""values"" are all a bunch of lies. The administration at Brandeis is broken, and the racism, elitism, and classism run deep. It's hard to know where to begin explaining how truly backwards this university is, so I'll keep it short: Brandeis is an incredibly greedy, money hungry institution. The academics are not worth what students pay for them, the campus facilities are abysmal, and those are just the surface level issues. If you're not a wealthy white able (physically or otherwise) Jew, you mean nothing to this school and they will make a point to ensure that you do not feel included on this campus. Do your research on this school, or better yet, don't come here."
College Senior,2,Very little diversity of thought. Very liberal. If you are conservative you run the risk of being blacklisted and getting hate mail. SJWs have routinely attempted to censor conservatives from the major newspapers on campus. Oh and if you are white you better be ready to admit your privileged and profusely apologize.
College Senior,2,If you want it and willing to put some effort in you can probably get it. If you don't you can avoid it.
College Senior,2,"Housing is bad for the most part. Most dorms haven't been updated in 50+ years and this definitely shows. Dorms aren't themselves bad just amenities. No AC and elevators in any of the freshman and sophomore dorms, as well as good chunk of upperclassman housing. $2500+ Meal plan is mandatory for everyone living on campus all four years regardless if your dorm has a kitchen. Lottery process is annoying and almost always results in backstabbing.  People with good numbers can pull in their close friends and thereby form roommate groups. They then select housing based on their lottery number. The problem arises when the dorm they are aiming for runs out before there number. Then say the roommate group was five people but the only good housing left is for four people. Well then someone is going be booted. There are a few really modern and recent dorms on campus for upperclassmen but to get them you generally need a number in the top 75 (out of 2000) or you need to be friends with someone who does."
College Senior,2,Greek Life is not officially recognized by the administration. All Greek Life takes place off campus and off the books. There are some good parties in the Fall and Spring when frats/sororities are trying to recruit but otherwise pretty bland.
College Senior,2,No real varsity athletics. No sports events. Club sports are okay but not great. One positive I would say is that there are a lot of different athletic clubs that are open to people with no experience.
College Senior,2,"There are some good things about Brandeis and many bad things. Unfortunately, lately there seem to be many more negatives than positives particularly in Computer Science. Firstly, if you are considering going to Brandeis for computer science I urge you to STRONGLY reconsider. In general classes are huge 100+ people and you'll most definitely have undergraduate TA's grading your work. Professors are very inaccessible and will almost always redirect to their under grad TA's before letting you speak to them.  Secondly, the course selection is mediocre at best and poor at worst. Absolutely, no coverage of Hardware or Cyber Security at all. Almost all classes are very theoretical too (not a bad thing if you are looking for grad work but not so good if your focus is software engineering).  If you are in the Liberal Arts however things are generally much better. In Liberal Arts you do actually get the small classes they brag about. Campus is very 'politically correct' and thus you must tread carefully or may be 'written up'. Despite being interested in Social Justice administration has no problem raising tuition and cutting your fin aid every chance they get. Housing is old and in need of renovation. Dining is very bad and in general getting worse every (see about this in the dining section). Administration uses dining as a chance to soak even more money out of you. Mail room is awful. This may seem minor but imagine all your prime packages getting to you a week after they are delivered. Location is not great but not awful. You are near Boston but it is still a chore to get into. Partying/Greek Life is very bad in general. Frat parties are okay but definitely not good. Sometimes there are good house parties. Altogether not a great school. I would recommend only coming if you plan on majoring in the liberal arts and are a hardcore social justice type."
College Freshman,2,The greek life is not even associated with the university. It is small and barely worth joining.
College Sophomore,2,"The housing buildings are very old, unless you live in village or ridgewood."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a lot of school spirit, as shown at the empty bleachers during basketball games, but that is also probably because we are division III in everything except fencing, which is division I."
College Freshman,2,"I've been unhappy with my experience at Brandeis so far. I feel like I'm stuck in a socially awkward world. People aren't the nicest to talk to and I have had a hard time making friends. Facilities are very poor at the school. The school seems to care about spending money on things that are less important than on those that are more important like dining hall food and dorms. The food at the dining halls is absolute rubbish for the high amounts of money that we pay. It is cheaper to eat outside. Even the dorms seem to be rotting with no good facilities as compared to nearby schools. Academics are apparently good at this school however I was unfortunate to have all horrible teachers my first semester. However, academics are not the only thing that define a school. This school needs to seriously work harder to improve its image. Barely anyone seems to know what this school is."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Brandeis is more of an intellectual school than a sports school, so no one really cares except when we win"
College Sophomore,2,The sororities and fraternities are not big on campus.
College Freshman,2,Curritos and Einsteins make up for the suckiness of lower Usdan and Sherman. Join Sodexo Fanclub on Facebook if you end up going to Brandeis.
College Senior,2,Local area seems to be really scary at night times.
College Freshman,2,"Well actually it's not all that bad. Only a small population is involved in greek life, but from what I've heard it is growing rapidly. You see people wearing fraternity/sorority sweatshirts all over campus. They seem be a good bunch, but most of the students are not involved at all. The houses are not on campus."
College Junior,2,"There is no official Greek life on campus. There are some unofficial fraternities and sororities, but they get their own houses off campus, like any other group of students might. They vary a lot in how serious they are. They aren't a huge part of the social atmosphere--you aren't any cooler for being in a fraternity vs. not or anything like that--but their parties are usually the most popular things to do on weekends."
College Junior,2,"We're definitely more of an academic-type school. There are a lot of student athletes, but I don't think there's very much support, even when one of our teams is doing really well. I don't think the average student pays very much attention to athletics."
College Senior,2,"Nightlife?  What nightlife?  To be honest, I always have fun on the weekends, but if you want to find a party, you have to work for it.  Chums is fun, plus parties are decent.  There is no club scene though. You have to go into Boston for that... but the shuttles aren't great.  Don't come here for the nightlife."
College Senior,2,"There simply aren't enough computers!  Plus, the printer in the SCC doesn't receive regular maintenance.  Tech support here is fabulous, though.  But seriously -- there just aren't enough computers.  Bring your own... or you're kind of up a creek."
College Senior,2,"The winter sucks; it snows quite a bit and is really cold. The spring, summer and fall are nice."
College Freshman,2,Nightlife and Brandeis parties on campus is pretty lame. I'm not really part of the party-scene.
College Freshman,2,Facilities are typically dirty. Some areas are nice like the village and IBS. But a lot of it is pretty fun down and old.
College Freshman,2,The facilities are not great. Most are run down and dirty.
College Junior,2,"The snowstorms during the winter months may lead to class cancellations, and it can get painfully cold."
College Freshman,2,I would not recommend freshmen housing. I am in on of the two freshmen quads and my floor is a mess. I even came back early this semester for sports practice expecting the bathrooms to be clean since no one had been around for a month but instead found that there was hair everywhere and that the showers appeared to have not even been touched by the cleaning staff. 
College Freshman,2,Really cold for a Floridian like me!
College Freshman,2,Not much to choose from.
College Freshman,2,          Have all of your necessary documents in front of you before dong the application. Make sure that all of the information is accurate. Check it multiple times if necessary.
College Junior,2,"People have a really hard time finding parking on campus in the mornings. So it is definitely better to just walk to class if you live off campus. Also, freshman aren't allowed to have cars unless there's a special circumstance. "
College Junior,2,"Girls - Hit or miss, really. Some are attractive and funny, others are a little crazy.
Guys - Bro, stop using those big fancy words. You haven't showered in days, and you're wearing Rockports with an Iron Maiden hoodie."
College Junior,2,"Waltham is more of a working class town and there isn't much contact between the students and townies, since you can take the free shuttle to Boston or Cambridge on a night out. You can order late night pizza or Chinese, but its of poor quality."
College Freshman,2,Can't have a car on campus until junior year without filing for it with legitimate reason (aka an off campus job or you commute). 
College Freshman,2,Most teams are not good. Team support is terrible. I'm a member of the track team and we're a developing squad currently. It feels like the athletics are up and coming in most aspects and should be good eventually. 
College Freshman,2,Very few parties. Not actually recognized by the school. 
College Sophomore,2,"It's much too expensive, very few kitchen facilities, and generally little community life."
College Sophomore,2,"The food on campus is alright, but students living on campus are required to purchase a meal plan and the meal plans are completely overpriced. Because I wanted to cook for myself, I am now on a meal plan paying $22 for a meal, even though the value of a meal is max. $8.50."
College Freshman,2,"Varsity athletics aren't really a part of campus life. No football or hockey team, students occasionally go to soccer games but that is about it. Weight room in gym is very small and can get quite crowded. Gym is old and in need of renovation.  "
College Freshman,2,Don't expect a lot of financial aid from Brandeis especially if you are middle class.
College Freshman,2,Buildings are old and outdated. The pipes in my room constantly make loud banging noises throughout the night and many of friends have told me they have had similar experiences. Buildings were built in the 50s and really haven't been updated much since then. Earlier in the year (when it was warm) there was also an insect problem but that seems to have gone away. Nothing too awful it's just for the amount of money paid in tuition you could expect something better.
College Junior,2,"On campus there isn't much, but you can find something if you look."
College Freshman,2,"It's cold pretty often, and when it snows, we still have to trek to class. I'm from the south, so I'm not used to it at all, so I'm probably biased. But once spring comes around, it's absolutely beautiful."
College Senior,2,"Classes are only cancelled when the weather is life-threatening.  That being said, Massachusetts winters are cold and long, so come prepared to wear your spring and summer outfits for a month or so before retiring them for coats and sweaters."
College Senior,2,"The food is mediocre at best, the buildings and study spots are overcrowded and the architectural aesthetics are far from aesthetically pleasing.  Campus activities are dull after the first few times you attend them and there are few traditions outside of the Jewish community.  Overall, campus life is pretty dead."
College Sophomore,2,barely any parties go on around campus. They are usually off campus with unrecognized frats. The bar/club requires traveling and the transportation is convenient for going out but limited
College Freshman,2,"Housing quality is fairly poor for freshman, but adequate for upper upperclassmen. Food services is absolutely atrocious. Disgusting. Not much healthy food, and it tastes bad. Needs to work on more recycling. Other than that the buildings are pretty nice, just a little old. Libraries fairly nice, but nothing special. Overall campus aesthetics, C-."
College Freshman,2,"High Fines!! You dont need a car on campus, but if you have one and park in the wrong spot, you will get fined heavily. Also, if you have a car on campus and are an underclassmen, the places you are allowed to park are really far from campus. It's inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"The only drugs I've seen around campus are cigarettes. People prefer to drink, if they do anything at all. It all depends on who you hang out with, and Brandeis is not a party-heavy school."
College Sophomore,2,"The only thing to do at night, other than homework, is frat parties. These parties however, usually have a cover charge and aren't very good.
It's also fairly hard to get into Boston, especially on weekdays."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty small, not many people pay attention. When something important happens, like a championship game, people come out to support their friends, but it's not an event people go to unless they know people who participate."
College Freshman,2,"social life is good but they are awkward looking and behaving. lots of group-ing. its ok, not the most attractive body."
College Freshman,2,"Both genders know their priorities in terms and academics, and socialization."
College Junior,2,Needs Improvement – printing is paid and students should be given some free printing
College Freshman,2,"So Much Work – New facilities on campus are beautiful, but Brandeis doesn't repair or renovate any of their existing ones"
College Senior,2,"Ha Ha Ha – Brandeis is not that athletic. I think some of our teams are decent, but athletes are a very specific crowd and not the majority. If you enjoy athletic schools, probably don't go to Brandeis"
College Junior,2,"Greek life is not endorsed by the college; however, the fraternities and sororities still exist. I am not part of one, and, honestly, I'm not convinced they have much of an influence on the social life of the college at all."
College Freshman,2,"It's Pretty Average – Everything is rather accessible here. However the gym and library close pretty early relative to other schools (on weekends almost everything is closed). Besides work, there isn't much to do around campus except for a few club events-and those are not well attended if there is no free food. On the other hand, there are a lot of community service events that are quite popular (ie Waltham Group). As far as the scenery goes, the campus is average-there is some foliage and the buildings are a hodge podge of old buildings and new."
Freshman,1,"Hated it. Teachers did not care, campus sucked, zero diversity, way too expensive, everyone is so strange and the food was disgusting. Going here was the worst decision of my life."
Freshman,1,"The social life sucks here so much, that it makes my preschool look like a party school. The parties are horrible: too crowded, bad music, and nobody knows how to dance. Even if you don't like to party, finding things to do on campus  besides homework is usually a struggle. On most Fridays nights when I ask someone if they want to hang out their response ranges from, I got to do homework, to I have to study for this test I have in a month. Most weekends I often find myself asking, ""where did all the people go?"" with the response being, ""they're all in the library."" The academics are pretty solid, but unless you find gong to the library enjoyable, I would suggest going to another school.  Eating off campus is a must otherwise you may go into good food withdrawal. Quirky, weird, or strange seem to be the words that best captures most students at Brandeis. Between the obsession over social justice and Quidditch I often question why I ever chose to go here in the first place."
College Freshman,1,Housing at Brandeis is not worth the money we pay for. Life in the dorms are horrible. They are sweaty and noisy and it is almost impossible to have fun in them. I hope to move off campus soon.
College Freshman,1,Brandeis University's greek life is horrible. Since the houses are off campus and the police know where they are situated parties get shut down very easily. The houses are not well kept and the drinks are horrible.
College Freshman,1,I haven't had much experience with athletic facilities but Gosman seems pretty substandard. The facilities aren't comparable to other schools I have seen.
College Sophomore,1,"I am extremely unhappy at Brandeis. It doesn't meet the standards that a world class school should have. The food is poor, athletics are horrible, social life is dead and the dorms are old. Even though the academics are good, academics, by itself do not define a college. This school needs improvement."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Where do I begin? It was hard to get anything worthwhile out of this school when there was such a systemic awkwardness and inferiority complex permeating every level of this institution. Social dynamics were like something out of ""The Office"" - the students are so anxious and high-strung about their perceived social status that they prevent themselves from actually achieving their full potential, bringing each other down and causing random controversy out of sheer and utter boredom (a Twitter fight between two students and the staff response to it even made national news). Most people were frustrated and jaded and nasty and so repressed that holding a conversation about anything normal was a struggle. Just accept that you won't be the next Harvard and live your life and stop hurting other people."
College Junior,1,Really bad food for crazy high prices and they force upperclassmen with kitchens to still pay for a meal plan
Recent Alumnus,1,"The buildings are in poor condition due to years of ""deferred maintenance."" Housing is very expensive for what you get."
College Senior,1,Do you like vomit? Join a frat! Cant speak much for the Sororities.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is not recognized by the university so their affect on campus is close to non-existing. Greek life is still a great option for friendship and networking, however, they do not hold a strong position in relation to the university's community or culture."
College Junior,1,"Get rid of Peoplesoft. Please. It's almost unusable.

"
College Junior,1,"Ever since Sodexo took over the contract we no longer have to eat the same three things every day being charged $15 per meal. But quality is still very subpar compared to similarly-priced schools.

The Usdan dining facility is crumbling to pieces and smells rank. 

I've only ordered pasta twice from Upper Usdan. The first time was when the cook decided to throw two spoonfuls of garlic into my food, because she simply didn't know any better. The second and last was when they ran out of marinara sauce, and while the freshman employee was frantically searching for the new container because the manager left and nobody else knew where it was, another cook placed my piping hot lunch into a plastic container, causing it to melt, and handed it to me. When I refused to take it, she put it on a plate and tried handing it to me again. 

I can only imagine what goes on in the back room..."
College Junior,1,"Atrocious. The Department of Community Living, first of all, isn't open during break. If you misplace your key you simply have to call the police to let you into the room every day. It usually takes about an hour for them to show up.

I went to the DCL after this nightmare ended and got a spare key from the office. After they scheduled me for a lock change three weeks later, and it was time to go pick up my new key, guess what? They did not have my key. Seriously.

This happened to be on a staff holiday, so the undergraduates who were in the office had the place to themselves and no manager was in sight. I sat in the office for a half hour watching half-alert students frantically open every drawer and closet while shouting expletives until finally one of them remembered there was a spare key in the back closet. 

What else? The Branvans which take you to classes are routinely late (sometimes by 15-20 minutes), which doesn't bode well for those of us who get graded on attendance.

I'd rather commute from Boston next semester, thanks."
College Freshman,1,"Dinning simply put, is horrible. The food is slowly getting better and more and more options are becoming available yet it is still considerably sub-par to other universities. Firstly, the meal plans themselves are atrocious. Whatever meal plan you choose you essentially get screwed. If you choose the 21 you get three meals per week (with one per meal period), however you can't use more than one per meal period. So say you sleep through breakfast than you're simply out one meal for the week. If you use your plan at a dinning hall other than Sherman and go over the assigned cash value for the meal then you have to make up the difference either in your own money or points. With 10 meal +points you have more flexibility however the high prices burn through your points rapidly. For example $5.25 for a jar of peanut, $10 for a salad...etc. The food itself is mediocre at best and gets old very quickly. "
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is nearly impossible on campus. You have to have a special pass in order to park, or else you will be ticketed. There aren't a lot of parking places, so be sure to accommodate that issue when arriving early before classes."
College Freshman,1,"No Options for Freshman and Sophomores – Sophomores and Freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus.  The entire campus is no more than a mile to a mile and a half from one end to the other, but you really need a car if you ever plan to leave and go into Waltham or Boston without only going on Thursday nights or the weekends after 3:30 pm.  Most people end up parking illegally and moving their car every few days."
College Sophomore,1,Rains A LOT. At least every other week. Floods in spring and fall. Snows a bit in winter.
College Junior,1,"Small part of campus – Barely existent, no affect of campus life. "
College Freshman,1,"Brandeis focuses more on academics. If you are a huge sports fan,then Brandeis is not the school."

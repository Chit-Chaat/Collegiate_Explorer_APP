Junior,5,Teachers were well prepared for the transition of in-person to online. It really made learning 10x less stressful because the University was so well prepared.
Junior,5,The faculty and staff really does want to see the student body engaged and become successful through their program. They set you up for positive changes in your life.
Niche User,5,The professors were easy to get ahold of and schedule office hours when necessary. They were understanding with online classes and would help make the class easier to understand and to schedule assignments and appointments.
Freshman,5,UPike has a great atmosphere. People are super friendly and it feels like home.  It would be even better if there were a few more dining choices on campus.
Freshman,5,It’s a great school I am in my second semester as a freshman. All the professors are great and willing to work with you and help you with anything you need. I love the campus and the people there. I’ve made a ton of new friends and some amazing professors and coaches. Everybody I've ever met has been super nice to me and always guided me in the right direction. I’m so glad I decided to attend the university of Pikeville to further my education.
Sophomore,5,This is my second year at Pikeville and it is an ok experience. I enjoy the area and I'll be here for another 2 more years.
Sophomore,5,If you are looking for a school that acts as a get away from city life then the University of Pikeville is a great school for you located in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled in my second year at UPIKE, so I will be a sophomore. Coming from Frankfort, I am so blessed to have enrolled here, and make the connections I have made. I wasn't quite sure about what was in store, but I'm so glad I took the chance to come here. There is such a caring environment for the students and staff that you should feel comfortable 24/7. Class sizes are fairly small, which for me, is fantastic. I am able to learn so much due to the fact that I can have a relationship with my professor, which is so uncommon at bigger colleges in which there is 300+ students a class. There is also so much diversity on campus, which is such a blessing. I can meet and bond with people from all around the world. I cannot wait for this school year, nor the next two after!"
Niche User,5,"I like most of their programs, they also have a really good sports program. It's not too big and not at all small, it is the perfect size."
Freshman,5,"I am a student athlete and when I visited the campus the coached and academic staff were very helpful. My family and I not only met with the coaching staff and academic advisers, we also were provided a city tour.  This gave me a better view of the school as well as the city.  although Pikeville is small it is developing, so with the continued student growth and campus development I'm sure I've chosen the right place for me."
Senior,5,"The University of Pikeville has many different features that I love. My favorite thing is how small it is and how friendly the people are. The teachers are so nice, and they care about you as the student the most. They are so understanding and willing to help. They become people you know well and not just your professor. They know you on a first name basis and care about your lives outside of school. The area is small but so nice. It’s right in the mountains so it is beautiful. Almost the whole campus is full of student-athletes, so everyone is so friendly and all the professors understand when you have a sporting event or practice. This college is like my home and I love that about the University of Pikeville."
Senior,5,The University of Pikeville offers an outstanding education in a small town environment. The professors know each student by name and care about the success of each student.
College Freshman,5,Probably one of the best i have encountered. Amazing!
College Junior,5,Very easy to find help if you truly need it
College Sophomore,5,The academic program is good because how they teach
College Sophomore,5,Theres something for everyone. From fast food to sit down and relax.
College Sophomore,5,"Close to home, campus is small, everyone knows everyone."
College Junior,5,I have seen no drug use on campus.  I have walked many halls and still haven't seen any use.
College Junior,5,Financial aid was very helpful in the area of assisting and letting you know the option available.
College Junior,5,"I enrolled in nursing a UPike because it is closer to my home.  However, I do think their tuition rate is a little over board."
Niche User,4,As a part time student I found that their professors were easy to get ahold of and schedule office hours when necessary.
Niche User,4,It’s a great place to stay and I love the classrooms. The campus is wonderful. They have different types of food. But I’d like the dorms to be sprayed more often.
Freshman,4,This is my first year at the University of Pikeville. I love the friendly and welcoming environment  the campus has. It has been a great experience so far!
Freshman,4,"UPIKE has such a welcoming vibe and uplifting atmosphere, with being such a small student body there's plenty of time and opportunities to get help from the teacher."
College Freshman,4,"I like the class sizes, it is easier to concentrate and participate in class."
College Freshman,4,"It is good, but Greek life should be more engaged with community service in town and with the school."
Recent Alumnus,4,The food in the cafe is usually pretty good. I have seen many people from the city hold meetings there.
College Senior,4,"If any of you were there before 2012 you would know that what we have now is a DREAM compared to the old caf. We've got one dining hall, and it can get a little cramped but we've beat record enrollment the last two years, so it's higher than what it was when these plans were drawn up. The menus are decent enough, there are rare days when I can't find SOMETHING that I like. The variety can sometimes be a little too varied - but they do have their menus up online if you ever want to check before you bother standing in line and swiping your card and finding a seat and standing in line more only to find out that there's nothing you like. If you live on campus you automatically get a meal plan which is unlimited meals 7 days a week and $150 in Bear Bucks which can be used to pay for meals for people who don't have a meal plan or in Java City, our coffee shop on campus which is located in Wickham next to the student lounge. You'll notice they're super busy the first few weeks and then that $150 starts trickling fast and so do the customers. lol. I just wish they were open a little later. I could have sworn my freshman year they were open until 10, and now it's 8 pm nightly, and they start putting away everything but the pizza, grilled/fried, the salads, and desserts usually around 7."
College Senior,4,"The policies are in place and the RAs are the ones who are supposed to be the liaisons between students and administration/public safety. So if your RA is pretty by the book like myself, chances are your experience is going to be on the ""stricter"" side of things. But if they're doing jello shots with you in their room with the door open and music blasting - you're gonna think the administration is lenient. But you should always be considerate of your fellow students and try your best to follow the rules."
College Senior,4,"They're really patient - the hassle isn't with the school it's with the IRS and the rest of the Federal Government. Somehow every year my file gets pulled for review and/or auditing and so I have to dig up my papers and forms all over again on the rare weekend at home and worry and stress those first few weeks to make sure that it's gone through. But I have the Pikeville Promise which covers whatever the CAP and PELL (and scholarships) don't of your tuition, basically, so I'm grateful for that."
College Senior,4,"I'm addicted to Papa Johns pizza. There I said it! They have the best prices and the sweetest delivery people and they're just really excellent. I wish there were more places than pizza that delivered though. There's a Chinese place downtown, Peking Express I think. It's not as sit-down oriented as the Peking in Coal Run. But neither place delivers. I saw a sign for a taxi and delivery service last year that I never got around to trying out so we'll see what that's about. But I mean, I love places in Pikeville to eat. Usually I end up at Applebee's at least once a week with my friends. I'll probably be going to the Bank more often now that I'm 21. ;3"
College Senior,4,"I'm on the housing staff as a Resident Assistant so I've seen the housing from both the student and administrative aspect. I hear student complaints - I have student complaints - but it's never anything major and when it is it's fixed as soon as possible. The most common complaints are washers/dryers breaking or the A/C not working properly. One of our biggest issues is the fact that elevators break down several times a week. I'm not sure what could be done about that. But other than that things are okay, and as far as the ease of the housing process it's based on seniority and first come first serve. The director of reslife will try to work around your requests as smoothly as possible to try to make everyone at least remotely happy. But you can't always get what you want out of life. That's just reality for you. You can't fit 800 people in the same building. Not everyone can be in a single room in Derriana. Not everyone can go into Kinzer's suites. The Greeks go in Wickham - try pledging and you might get to go there next semester. There are just things that some people don't realize because they don't see the big picture. But I've been happy with my housing assignment for as long as I've been there. I lived in Condit all three years, and I don't have a single complaint. Now this year I'm going into Derriana and we'll see how it goes. =)"
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of programs offered, but you can tell that the money makers get the most attention and funding. Like the sciences that will breed pre-meds for the med school or the business students that will be going into the MBA program. The Humanities often get the short end of the stick and nobody takes us very seriously as far as the student body is concerned."
College Senior,4,"It's grown in leaps and bounds just over the last three years so it's getting better - in fact my major didn't even EXIST when I first came here. But there's room for improvement. As my professor says ""Baby Steps""."
College Senior,4,"I love the town and can't wait to go back  after this summer. It's bigger than my hometown of 167 that's for sure. Most out of town students complain about there not being a mall, but I'm used to driving 30+ minutes to the closest Walmart here at home. So I don't think it's so bad. However, it's still a relatively small eastern KY town. It's not a hustling bustling city filled with people from every walk of life and every facet of hobby or interest to take part in. There's no public transportation - which sucks because I don't drive. BUT the university has a ""walmart wednesday"" van that they take at 5 and 7 pm for students who don't drive or just don't want to use the gas. And it's pretty cool. That's my main way of getting to that shopping center to get groceries and things. And then they also have ""What's Up Wednesday"" at 8:30 where local churches or other groups make home cooked meals and serve them to students, and then we do activities or just talk about what's going on or, ""What's Up"". It's pretty neat. Ambria and Mandy and their work studies really do a lot for us. =)"
College Sophomore,4,"The dormitories are pretty nice. They come with a desk and chair, dresser, and bed for each student, with normally two students per room. The beds can be stacked for storage space, but I recommend raising the bed and putting your dresser underneath. We have a library on campus with a fairly large selection of books for research and pleasure, including a small selection of children's books for education majors to borrow. The first floor is mainly desktop computers (Macs and PCs) and laptops (Dells from various years). The other two floors are books. With your student ID, you can also check out laptops for a few hours to stay in the library. The cafeteria is typical cafe-styled dining, but quite a bit better than high school (depending on where you're from, at least)."
College Junior,4,i like the securtiy we have
College Sophomore,4,"The people on campus aren't very strict. If you become friends with them or even respect them, they will be reasonable and lenient with you."
College Sophomore,4,"Most all students are athletes, so everyone is basically interested in athletics. Everyone knows everyone, so everyone pretty much gets along with everyone. It's a nice combination."
College Sophomore,4,"It really isn't all that bad. Since campus consists of only about 7-8 buildings, everything is close to your dorm room. It does suck when it rains or snows though"
College Sophomore,4,I love it! I don't think I've had teachers/professors that motivated me so much.
College Sophomore,4,I did not have to go through any kind of process to get admitted into the Sports Management and Business programs.
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite experiences include being on the Women's soccer team and spending all of my times with my teammates. Doing charity work, going to parties together, traveling together, and so on. I would choose to do it all over again because of my team and coach. I wouldn't be going back for a second year if it wasn't for them."
College Sophomore,4,"It is all great. Since it's a small campus, we don't need a lot of labs. Most students have their own computers and only use the library computers when they are in need of a printer."
College Freshman,4,They work with you. they really seem to want to see students succeed.
College Freshman,4,"If you like small and charming this is for you. If you like the whole big scene, then maybe not so much."
College Freshman,4,"Politics don't seem to be all that big of an issue. Although it is a Christian school, everything isn't thrown in your face."
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere is great! Especially for sporting events. the town and the school always has something going on.
College Freshman,4,The food is really good. there is alot of variety as well.
College Freshman,4,"From what i hear, campus security is really good. Students normally have good thing to be doing rather than something dangerous or illegal."
College Junior,4,The overall curriculum here is pretty good and it is very easy to find help if you need it.
Recent Alumnus,4,My instructor  has been to many seminars making me feel confident in her abilities
Recent Alumnus,4,The Teachers here really know their subjects and care for the students
College Junior,4,It is closer and has a better schedule for my family and workload.
College Sophomore,4,"Getting into this program is very simple. The only requirement of declaring this as a major is to take the COM courses that are offered at the University. There was no special application process to actually get into the program. You just declare it as your major when ever you would like to. There are also other courses required for the major that go out of the COM class spectrum. The courses that are offered here are geared towards making you a well rounded student and individual.The tips that i would provide to incoming students to the University of Pikeville would have to be, if you really wold like to major in Communication I would try and declare it as soon as possible so that you are able to graduate on time."
College Freshman,4,"There are many places to eat in Pikeville, a variety of places.  They are reasonable on prices and are very convenient. The Mexican restaurants here are very good and are at the top of the game.  There is also more common places like Texas Roadhouse and Applebees for others that prefer that."
College Sophomore,4,"There's not that many restaurants around but the ones that we have are good. A lot of people go to El Azul for mexican, and Applebees for a drink."
College Sophomore,4,"They always have a variety of food. Great desserts, nice salad bar and the view of the small town is amazing."
College Sophomore,4,They are great to help you and are very nice.  They take the time to help you out and explain everything.  They treat you as a person and not a number.
College Freshman,4,THE PLACES IN AND AROUND CAMPUS ARE DELICIOUS AND AFFORDABLE.  MAKE HAVING LUNCH ON CAMPUS MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.
Freshman,2,"not very diverse, not that many parties or campus activities. financial aid is not helpful at all but the professors are great"
Freshman,2,"I like the small class sizes and the small campus. However, the campus is very boring. I wish there were more places to sit outside and more places to do homework. The library is never the quiet space it should be. The cafe is pretty terrible. Selection is somewhat wide but the menu choices are quite repetitive. Parking on campus absolutely sucks. The parking garage is a complete disaster when classes get out for the day. I think Upike could do a much better job in admissions and financial aid with helping you find outside scholarships instead of just referring you to the internet. Overall my experience hasn't been anything like I expected it would be."
Freshman,2,"UPIKE's classes are easier than most of the classes I had in high school. UPIKE needs a GPA and ACT requirement. This will decrease the dropout rate. I don't feel like student surveys are taken seriously. The food on campus is, for the most part, rediculously disgusting. Room and board mirrors other schools, however, the dorms are not nearly as nice. I also feel a strong lack of diversity."
College Freshman,2,Too expensive. Not worth all the money.
College Senior,2,"There are very few places in the downtown area for students to rent. Most rental properties are miles off campus in different ""neighborhoods"" of Pike County even. Also, I'm pretty sure the school requires student athletes to stay on campus now. I may be mistaken but I know it was being discussed towards the end of my sophomore year. But on campus housing isn't so bad."
College Sophomore,2,"This university is in a small, southern town and very much NOT used to diversity in any sense of the word. Most of the students are caucasian and from the area and accepting when it comes to different races, the people who live here are very much not. Because UPike is affiliated with a Christian church and is still listed as a private Christian college in many databases, there is a chapel on campus and attending the 11AM services are encouraged. LGBTQ individuals are encouraged to STEER CLEAR of this school. I have seen many people publically ridiculed for being open with their peers."
College Junior,2,none at all wel we do but just not good greek life
College Junior,2,Not that many places to choose from.  You mostly only get fast food places really.
College Freshman,2,There are not many classes for Math majors at Pikeville.  All other majors seem very open with classes and have many people for each one.  I have maybe 5 people in my math classes and they are very hard.  I do not have any concerns finding a job because there are plenty of accounting jobs out there today.
College Sophomore,2,"Dining Hall – The food isn't the best and like most things nowadays probably isn't the healthiest, but it's not bad."
College Sophomore,2,"Provide Your Own – If you want to go somewhere, you have to provide your own transportation because school does not provide it for you."
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife at Pikeville College is very dead, there is really nothing to do. There are no places that students can go or visit at night other than a movie theater and a bowling ally."
Senior,1,"Teaching is way sub par, athletes allowed to miss unlimited number of classes while others failed for missed classes."
Senior,1,"There is no consistent y to online class offerings. Dean says, ""online classes are not what we are about."""
Freshman,1,The food is terrible period. Even when you get rid of the meal plan that is way too expensive already the only thing in town is fast food. There is a Texas Roadhouse and a bad Mexican place for restaurants. The ingredients at the local Walmart are also old and gross. The town is in the middle of nowhere. Be prepared for that because I wasn’t.
College Sophomore,1,"There is a serious drug and alcohol problem at this school. Although the campus is extremely small, we are advised to walk in groups especially at night and for good reason. Sexual assault is not uncommon. Although the school is now using services from WestCare, it's only a very small step in the right direction. Students are still not receiving the help they need when these situations occur because of the terrible track record of administrators often ignoring reports or choosing to ""sweep them under the rug"". The discipline system is lacking to the point of embarrassment. Penalties for crimes are high-cost, but don't help anything if they aren't enforced."
College Junior,1,Nothing ever really to do around here just school and tv
College Junior,1,No where to really go and the few bars that they do have are not pleasurable experiences
College Junior,1,The amount of females has increased but is still low and not a good selection
College Senior,1,"I live in a small town, so there are only 2 clubs here. However, there are not many house parties either because most of the students live on campus. Though, if anyone were to have a party on campus, it would be shut down immediately. Therefore, there is not much to do here at night."
College Sophomore,1,Student Discounts – There is only one or two places off-campus that offer discounts to students.
College Freshman,1,"Wireless Access – While the computers at the school are good, internet in the library is quick, and printing is free, the wireless access in the dorms is terrible. There are only some floors in the dorms that get wireless access. They are trying to fix this, though, to give everyone on campus wireless access."

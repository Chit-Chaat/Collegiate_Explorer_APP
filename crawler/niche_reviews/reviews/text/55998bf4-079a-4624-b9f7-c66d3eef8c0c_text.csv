Sophomore,5,The campus enviornment and culture is really excellent. I feel like I can do anything with a Fairfield degree.
Sophomore,5,"Every instructor handled the shift to remote learning with professionalism and compassion, making the transition easy."
Freshman,5,The professors are very understanding and are willing to talk and help students out. The professors are a part of what makes Fairfield so great.
Sophomore,5,The online schooling here is as good as it can be. The mission of teacher kids online is a hard mountain to climb and truthfully there is only so much a university can do when trying to accomplish it. As far as online classes go- Fairfield surely makes the mission as accommodating and easy for its students as possible.
Freshman,5,It's a very good school with things to do and good education. Fairfield u university is a very big school and is a very populated college.
Freshman,5,No I didn't take any classes online in Fairfield University yet but I did online learning when I was in high school as a senior.
Junior,5,This school is amazing and I have zero regrets coming to this school. It was somewhat of a random choice for me but the professors and students are great. There are a ton of clubs on campus as well as many different outlets to have fun on the weekends.
Freshman,5,"Due to the pandemic, we were online for the last part of second semester.  Teachers were awesome and able to work with students in the best ways possible in order to get their teaching across."
Freshman,5,Fairfield University has such a great student to teacher ratio and perfect class sizes!  It is a lot of fun and in the best location!
Freshman,5,"I just finished my freshman year at Fairfield and I couldn't have made a better decision in coming here. I'm a nursing major and the program has exceeded my expectations already. Fairfield is not big, with about 4,000 undergrads, tucked away in a quiet, residential area of coastal CT. There is an adorable town that is 5 minutes away, filled with charming restaurants and a beautiful beach around the corner you can visit and even live on as a senior! The campus is gorgeous, class size is perfect (the party scene is apparent but not crazy) and everything about life in Fairfield is incredible. As a nursing major the workload is difficult, but faculty are readily available, willing to help you through everything and there is a real sense of community with your fellow students. If you are considering Fairfield for your next four years, I couldn't recommend it more. Not only will you find a great education, you'll find a home, family and lifelong friends for the next four years. STAGS UP!!"
Junior,5,"Home away from home, no place I'd rather be. Advisors work with you to help you decide on a career path, help with landing internships and eventually jobs right out of college."
Alum,5,Loved Fairfield. Going back for a second degree because I know I will receive an excellent education. Great alumni network as well.
Senior,5,"Fairfield University is such an amazing school. They have amazing resources, no matter which department / college you are in within the school. The campus is beautiful and you can see that they are investing and putting money into the school and campus through the development of new buildings and dorms. The outside area around the school is such a cute and safe town. The beach is only around 3 miles from campus and it beautiful."
Niche User,5,As an incoming freshman I am so excited to attend this school. It's my dream school! I sat in on a marketing class once and spent an overnight with my friend there. The marketing professor was engaging and kind. He really went out of his way to answer any questions I might have and was so helpful. The students in the class were also welcoming and gracious. My overnight with my friend only solidified the kindness of the Stag community.
Freshman,5,"Fairfield University has a beautiful campus and while it is a small to medium size school, there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people and get involved. Overall, Fairfield has a good academic structure that prepares it's students for their future professions as well as makes sure it has connections for their students to gain internships and participate in volunteering opportunities in the surrounding community."
Graduate Student,5,Great school. Graduate nursing student. Psychiatric nurse practitioner masters degree. Love it.  Rated number 7 in the country
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus right next to the beach with so much to do downtown and such a safe area and only an hour train to NYC. The classes are small and professors are very engaged and caring. All buildings are brand new or being updated with the newest technology. Athletic teams are good and almost replace the fact that there is no greek life, but obviously as a smaller school without football, not all of the sports are on a national level every year yet. Not the type of party school where people go out every day of the week, but there is always the beach and townhouses when weekends come around and bars for Tues/Thurs. Overall, most people are fairly similar at this school but everybody is very caring and fun and there are so many resources to help you accomplish whatever you need."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman here and I love it. So many nice people and the professors are caring and always there if you need help. Academics are definitely difficult and be prepared to do a lot of work, but am glad with my college decision."
Freshman,5,"I love how all the professors show that they love their job and they are truly happy to see their students succeed. The campus is beautiful, and everyone around us seems to appreciate that and treat it well. The school makes sure to to provide the students with opportunities to make sure they can make is in the real world."
Alum,5,A wonderful Jesuit university that provides a well rounded education and lifelong friendships. Go Stags!
Freshman,5,The faculty and staff are very invested in the growth and success of the students as they are very easy to talk to and find time to make themselves available to cater the students' needs. The campus is also very modern with up to date technology that really helps with the learning and understanding of the students' lessons.
Niche User,5,"I committed to Fairfield University and from the vists, Fairfield is a school that will support you no matter what. Their campus is beautiful and in a location that provides food and entertainment."
Sophomore,5,"Fairfield is probably the best choice I have ever made. I have made friends that are like family to me now. Academics are great. The Jesuit education makes you a more well rounded individual. The Tully’s food is good. New sophomore dorm is beautiful along with the new nursing building and soon coming be business school and south side townhouses. Townhouses on campus have also recently been redone making them brand new essentially. The party scene at Fairfield is the best. You and your close friends pregame and hit the beach or the townies. Having a townhouse your junior year really makes the experience at Fairfield. My roommates and I have one for next semester and can’t wait for it to start. Plus you get to live on the beach your senior year. I don’t know of another school that allows that. I can go on and on but I hope I got the point across that Fairfield is not only amazing, but it is my home."
Alum,5,"Fairfield University was an excellent institution. It had a great pre-medical committee which helped me apply to graduate school. Additionally, the professors were amazing and helped me get successfully complete all the courses."
Freshman,5,"Fairfield University has become my home in just six short months already. All the students are happy and love to have a good time, while succeeding in school. Work hard. Play hard."
Junior,5,Fairfield has a great campus atmosphere and I love being there. I've met many great people at Fairfield. The professors also offer great support for your overall academic success. You also have many opportunities to get involved.
Alum,5,"I went to Fairfield for 4 years and it was an amazing experience. It wasn't my first choice school, however I grew to love it and met the best friends in the world! Everything happens for a reason, and Fairfield was my place. I excelled in academics, enjoyed the party scene, and lived on the beach, which is the most unique college experience by far."
Senior,5,"Fairfield has everything you need to define who you are as a growing adult and gives you ample preparation to become a functioning adult. Like most schools, your experience at Fairfield is what you make of it! If you are true to yourself and recognize the importance of the education you are receiving, it makes it that much easier to find people to hang out with and to establish life long relationships."
Senior,5,Fairfield University allows students to meet with professors on 1:1 basis;  make great lasting friendships; become a productive member of the community;  and prepares you for a life worth living outside the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Fairfield. The people, the town, the campus, and the education are amazing. I have found lifelong friends as long as a wonderful education."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love the campus and size of Fairfield! The Jesuit community mixed with the small campus makes for a welcoming school.
Freshman,5,Love the new nursing and business buildings. The campus is very pretty and I like how they are trying to put the Fairfield name out there.
Freshman,5,"Really nice school! Professional and knowledgeable professors and many new renovations and upgrades to the campus. New Dolan school of business building opens next year.
School sports spirit is really the only area that I’m feeling a little light on..."
Niche User,5,Wonderful school in an excellent location! Very friendly environment with many opportunities and benefits. Very small faculty to student ratio allowing a very home-like feeling.
Freshman,5,"I am only a first-year at fairfield, but I love it. They have a very diverse curriculum and excellent facilities upon which they are always improving. The disability services are excellent and the professors treat their students respectfully. The only thing I would change is the extensive core, which I believe is a bit too extensive to where it interferes with a student's chosen educational path."
Niche User,5,"What I know about Fairfield University, is that they help every one who wants to make their dreams come true. Fairfield University makes that happen, they help you with all the questions, or concerns you may have. When you decide to enroll in this University, is the best decision you can make. People help you without judging you. Also, they give you the best advise you need. They help you, even when you think everything has fall down, they give you hope. My dream is to graduate from Fairfield University, because they have given me this hope I was waiting for. A long time ago I decided to stop following my dreams. But I believe in a God that makes everything possible. I've found the University of my dreams, if I did you can too. whatever your status in this country is, do not stop following what you want to be in the future. If you have dreams, keep seeking them. A lot of people will close doors at your face but, God will open o lot more for you."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful school, with attentive teachers and a positive community! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reputable college in the area!"
Graduate Student,5,"Fairfield university has a very peaceful,serene and calm environment. I think that is one of the reasons i enjoy being there."
Graduate Student,5,My experience date has been limited to the inquiries regarding admission to graduate program Fall 2018.  Campus personnel and staff have been extremely welcoming and knowledgeable.  They seem very pleasant and eager to assist.
Alum,5,Attending college at Fairfield University was the best decision I ever made.  The small class size enabled me to foster relationships with my professors and allowed me to learn.
Freshman,5,"Fairfield U is a great school to go to. But just like anything what you put in is what you get out. If you just sit in your room you will be board. It is important to get involved. Professors are amazing, they want you to succeed. Campus is beautiful but the food could be better. While the sports are not the best, it is made up with the beautiful rec-plex. Over all a great return on your investment plus a great place to meet real well-rounded people."
Freshman,5,Fairfield University welcomes everybody. The staff and the students are friendly.  What I really love is that there is always something to do at Fairfield. FYE helps freshmen to find their place and make new friends.
Senior,5,Great school! Never want to graduate! Thinking about staying for a masters program. Well worth the money your parents will pay.
Alum,5,"Loved my time at Fairfield. I was able to make great friends and learn a lot from my professors. Living on the beach senior year is obviously a highlight but the townhouses junior year are even more fun. The party scene is great consisting mostly of townhouse parties, off campus houses at the beach, and of course the Seagrape."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Fairfield university is all of the faculty and students will make you feel like your apart of this big family, which is important i feel when your a freshmen."
Senior,5,Don't appreciate the negative reviews on this site. Fairfield University is a very respected college.
Freshman,5,"Really beautiful campus, the people are all very nice, the professors are very intelligent and successful in what they do."
Junior,5,I truly believe that I chose the university that best fits me.  There is nowhere else I would have liked to call home and fulfill my college career other than Fairfield University.  This prestigious school and close knit community made me realize that this is where I belong.
Senior,5,Fairfield university is a wonderful school with amazing faculty.  The professors go out of their way to ensure that all their student feel supported and succeed. The one down side would be the cost.
Freshman,5,Best first year experience I've ever had. I have met many friends here and the whole community is very welcoming and inviting. I would not want to be anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,Fairfield is a beautiful and rural campus set in a quaint town filled with plenty of eateries and beach front homes. The classrooms are updated and spacious do to the low student to professor ratio. Not to mention that over 90% of professors have the highest degree in their subject and have worked in their profession. 
College Sophomore,5,Theres like a 99% post graduate employment rate in the school of business so
College Sophomore,5,I love fairfield and my experience there has been amazing
College Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience thus far. I have learned so much, been taught by amazing professors, and obtained a great internship."
College Junior,5,I have seen other universities and their housing and Fairfield is definitly the best.
College Junior,5,It is a great school. The people are friendly and caring and everyone wants to be there so it has a very home feel.
College Senior,5,This program I am in is perfect for me. It is exactly what I need for where I am in life.
College Senior,5,This school is unique because you always have help right at your fingertips!
College Sophomore,5,"We have a good reputation in both nursing and business. I feel very comfortable telling people I attend Fairfield. The reason I came to Fairfield is because the alumni network is unbeatable. We have an alumni community in New York, Stamford, Boston and everywhere in between. Career planning is great. It's a staple of the school. There are even career planning professionals specifically for the business school."
College Sophomore,5,"Love this school. Would not trade it for the world. Great academics, great people. Pretty campus. Great town center. The beach is a mile away."
Freshman,4,"I am presently a Freshman at Fairfield University in the time of Covid. The experience is definitely what you make of it. I am in the honors college and those people are mostly kind and genuine. There are mostly snotty rich kids and you will feel judged as you are walking through campus, but once you find your core group Fairfield is a great place to be. There are many movements to increase the feeling of being accepted and there are many organizations and clubs to join to help you fit in. The campus is the most clean of those I have seen and is kept very well. There is landscaping weekly and cleaning the bathrooms by the hour. The food, even during Covid, is great and there are a lot of options. The dorms, especially Jogues, are clean new and beautiful. I recommend living in a LLC. It is a party school but you can easily focus on academics and find people with the same values. Overall, Fairfield is a great college to choose."
Sophomore,4,"I've been enjoying my time at Fairfield, it's a great community and I feel like a lot of the friends I've made here are family."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone I have met thus far is kind and inviting. The teachers take personal interest in each student and readily help them as much as possible. The campus is beautiful and the perfect size, everything is nice and close by but it's not so small that you feel trapped so to say. The only thing I have to mention that does not add an extra praise to the infinite list of positives I have for Fairfield University would have to be the price tag. Depending on personal situations this varys as an issue one might come across. Though this comes as a disappointing side to the school, the return on this investment is unmatched. Every alumni I have had the pleasure of meeting says that the ability to follow a dream job is easily found after graduating from this amazing university."
Sophomore,4,"Fairfield has a great sense of community within the student body. Everyone is friendly, always showing school spirit by wearing Fairfield merchandise, and overall very welcoming. With the exception of not clicking with a teacher every now and again, I've had a great experience in the classroom. Most teachers are helpful, open to answering questions, and are always available during office hours. I've been able to find clubs and activities around campus I'm passionate about which helped me make even more friends. As for the administration at Fairfield, I can't say they're great. It seems like students/guardians get many different responses from different departments for one question. Academic Advising at Fairfield should be much better than it is and registration is a nightmare that needs to be solved."
Sophomore,4,"Fairfield University is very known for the business school. The business school has much variety of classes and the courses are excellent. The students are very friendly and the staff makes you feel welcomed. At Fairfield, it feels like home. One thing that I would suggest Fairfield could improve on opening more sections or seats in classes when it comes to registration. This would help registration be less stressful."
Niche User,4,"The tour was just as amazing as the school. We were able to see the whole campus which was breath taking. The tour guide was student who was super nice and took us to the gym, dorms, library etc."
Junior,4,I am a nursing student here so I am dedicated to my studies. As a nursing student I do not have a lot of time to do other things on campus. However the nursing professors are caring and great people.
Niche User,4,"Just visited the campus and I’m very excited to see if I get accepted. The college seems very close and comforting, with much going on around."
Freshman,4,This school is great I love it. People are very nice and there are always parties in the townhouses. By next year all freshman houses will have AC!
Sophomore,4,Fairfield has a nice campus and atmosphere and it is great. You also have many opportunities to get involved and is hard not to. There is a lack of diversity but all in all a great place to be.
Junior,4,"My first year at Fairfield, I cried almost everyday. I wanted to come home; I felt out of place and alone. I enjoyed my classes, but I was undecided on a major and felt like I would never find my niche. However, I am so happy I stayed a stag. By spring semester, I had found a group of friends that I loved being with, and it turns out that my Theater class taught me a lot more than the lines of Hamlet. I was pushed outside of my comfort zone, and for the first time, I experienced what college was supposed to feel like. I had some of my favorite professors, and because of Colin Hosten in particular, I became an English major. Because of Sara Diaz, I became and Italian minor, two subjects I never dreaded going to class for. I'm proud to be a stag, and I love going back to Stag Country after breaks, weekends home, and summer. It is my place of belonging (but the College of Arts and Sciences could use a makeover!)"
Sophomore,4,"i visited fairfield once and kind of just made the decision cuz they gave me the most money, i came in thinking i wasn’t going to like it but it’s actually pretty cool! the people are nice, obv it’s a PWI and the POC are very little but we have a diversity office where we all go to chill and hang out, like if you come you’ll definitely find your group. the classes i really like. they aren’t that big so you get attention if you need it.  the faculty and the advisors are nice and they really try and help you. the halls are nice, the sophomore ones are better so that’s cool. the food is eh. it just gets tiring but we have a little restaurant so u could switch it up or order out, we have a bunch of places near by, going into town is cool too and there’s some spots to eat and shop, buses on the weekend take u to the mall and into town those are really fun. also we’re really close to ny so to have fun sometimes we go to the city. i really enjoyed my first year here."
Sophomore,4,I chose Fairfield because of the nursing school’s great reputation but I love it because of all the people I’ve met and friendships I’ve made here.  There are so many things to get involved in that everyone is bound to find a community where they belong.
Junior,4,"I would love to see more diversity at Fairfield. The only real diversity we have is in the commuter lounge and diversity lounge, which is sectioned off in a portion of the school. But a plus would be that academics are very serious here. There aren't the best professors, especially in some STEM departments, but the ones that are good are great."
Junior,4,People are very nice at this university. Just don't be afraid to put yourself out there because there are always people more than willing to get to know you. Can make friends in classes and meet like minded individuals. There are professors that also care about their students success and are willing to help them as much as possible.
Sophomore,4,"I have only completed my freshman year at Fairfield University. However, going into my sophomore year, I can say with confidence that I deeply respect and enjoy this school. The Jesuit education is extremely effective for students that actually want to learn."
Alum,4,"I had an amazing experience at Fairfield. I met friends that I can call my family and who I will hopefully remain close with for the rest of my life. The one downfall I can say about this school is that Freshman year sucks compared to the 3 years following it. Freshman year is still a good year but it is not going to be one of the ""amazing"" years you will experience at Fairfield. The school really gets fun once you are a sophomore and have larger dorm rooms (especially if you live in the village or Faber)  and more connections at the townhouses and beach so partying is not as awkward. Once you have your own townhouse or beach house Fairfield gets that much better. I have had the best memories as a junior and senior that I honestly cannot go visit my old townhouse or beach house without crying because I miss it so much."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Fairfield University. I have met friends that I know I will keep for the rest of my life. Most of the professors are very personable and understanding. The small class sizes really put emphasis on the student getting the most out of the course. The University finds a way to align all it's matters with the core Jesuit values, without being overbearing. Everyday you will be in contact with the positive community of staff, faculty, and students. The Town of Fairfield in itself is beautiful, with the beach being right down the road, but the campus always seems to be green and lively, even on the coldest winter day."
Freshman,4,The professors at Fairfield University will treat you and respect you like a colleague. I love that it is a small school so you are able to gain a personal connection with your professors and classmates. Fairfield is a great school with passionate students. It is a lot of fun here and it is easy to find your place here. There are so many clubs and organizations to join to meet people and feel a part of something.
Freshman,4,"Fairfield University has a beautiful campus with a mix of older and brand new facilities with more on the way.  The education standards are pretty high and the party scene, not so much.  The town of Fairfield, Ct is very nice, but a little too far to walk.  One of my biggest gripes, besides the food, is that you cannot have a car on campus until your Junior year."
Junior,4,Fairfield has a great learning environment and everyone feels like a family. I love that there are so many clubs
Sophomore,4,"Nice campus, really great professors, good student body. By the end of my freshman year, I had made excellent connections with a range of professors and older students, got a research opportunity, leadership in clubs, and am very integrated in the Fairf community."
Alum,4,"Fairfield University provides a solid education, with some aspects of their mission being inspired by Jesuit values. If you are not looking for a Catholic experience, there are ways to avoid it, and if you do want to be involved in Campus Ministry, you can. The large core of classes can be daunting, but it helps students become well-rounded and well-informed individuals. There are opportunities for research experience, club sports, and career-development - if you know who to talk to. Sometimes extra-curricular experiences are difficult to find, so make sure to talk to teachers and administration; they are happy to point you in the right direction. The town of Fairfield has very good food, and the campus is pretty, and in the process of improvements. Make sure to join a ""Res College"" your sophomore year - it is a wonderful experience that not many other schools offer."
Graduate Student,4,"The teachers are amazing! The classmates are supportive, and the staff want's what is best for you. Administrative offices don't really pick up the phone often, but when they do, they are really helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletes have many parties, school spirit lacks."
College Sophomore,4,"Academically, this school is great. Professors are experts and very useful resources. Some majors (business, nursing, bio) are much more difficult than others. As for going out, it gets better each year. The beach is really fun but the townhouses get old, especially when it gets cold here. People are generally friendly, but it is cliquey. Sort of like high school. Bottom line... there are better things out there."
College Junior,4,Fairfield University is close to the town of Fairfield and there is a great nightlife there and at nearby Bridgeport.There is a lot of variety there and it is student friendly.
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of parties that take place at Fairfield. Just about every weekend, one club or organization has some social event going on. It is a great way to meet new people."
College Junior,4,Fairfield University is a multicultural school and it was one of the reasons that I wanted to go there. I love meeting people form all over the world. It really enhances my understanding of our global community.
College Sophomore,4,"The courses and professors are awesome, always around with office hours and answer emails pretty quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are ideal, dorms aren't awful, and theres a lot of good stuff around town. Downtown is within walking distance"
College Sophomore,4,"I think that for me, it has not mattered what school I go to but rather how I conduct myself in interviews"
College Sophomore,4,Health and safety on campus is great. Everyone is very accommodating
College Sophomore,4,On campus housing is great. The lottery can be difficult but is not the worst.
College Senior,4,I only just started the summer session! I can't wait to see the fall when sports are at their busiest.
College Sophomore,4,"We had a few incidents this year with sexual assault. The school constantly stresses the importance of educating our student body about how to prevent sexual assault. I think the school did all they could to do to help the victims of the assaults that occurred recently.  DPS is a bit overkill when it comes to shutting down parties/drinking. I think monitoring who comes in and out of our campus should be a greater priority to them. Overall, they do a good job. Health center is very friendly and helpful. Free counseling services are offered to all students. If you need it, take advantage."
College Sophomore,4,Good housing options. Freshman year you take a survey to get a roommate. Not many had issues. I had no issues at all and my roommate was pretty cool. Sophomore year you get to choose a rescollege or live in the village. Both good options for different reasons. Junior year- townhouses or apartments. Senior year- beach. cant beat that.
College Sophomore,4,"Fairfield gives its students every opportunity possible, students just need to be active in taking advantage of them. Your student email will be bombarded with updates on campus activities and applications for positions in various clubs and organizations. Overall, I wish I got more involved freshman year. If you do, it will be to your benefit. Everyone gets super close! The people here are great. Making friends is easy. The party scene is exactly what you make of it. If you aren't into that, there's TONS to do at night. Academics are challenging but fair. It's college and I'm happy to be challenged. I love Fairfield. It wasn't my top choice but I would not trade it for the world. It's everything and more."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is extremely safe and suburban, with police everywhere and a blue button system always within sight. Although towards the end of the year sexual assault became a larger issue than ever before. It was not a issue of alcohol but rather of the availability of campus to the public. Being an open campus does not prevent outsiders to wonder in."
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are much better than many of the other colleges I have visited. But then again colleges that are of the same price of Fairfield and a little less have better facilities. The buildings are outdated in style.
College Sophomore,4,Fairfield is getting credited as a great school recently because of many different aspects of its education philosophy. A Fairfield education is a good education and employers are impressed.
College Junior,4,"I don't know from personal experience; however, I hear very good things. It is relatievely easy for students to get internships and I hear the networking is really something special. Fairfield alumni really look our for eachother in the ""real world""."
College Junior,4,"There was a recent incident this past spring; however, the university acted quickly to address the issue and provide students with counsiling. DPS officer's are abundent on campus and we have the ""blue light system"" so if anyone ever feels unsafe they can push one of those and be escourted by a DPS officer. I feel generally safe on camps."
College Junior,4,"Housing at Fairfield is great! There are a variety of different places (on campus and off campus) to live. In some dorms you have to clean up after yourself but that's never been an issue from what I have experienced. The social atmosphere is very good, Fairfield offers the option of rescolleges which really adds to the social atmosphere."
College Junior,4,"It's a small school, so everyone really gets the opportunity to get close with many of their peers. For the most part student and faculty are very caring anf friendly. Among my favorite experiences are jail and bail and pres ball. There is a strong sense of community at this institution. The class sizes are relatively small making it easy to personally interact and seek help from professors. The professors here encourage one on one time and meeting during office hours which I persoanlly feel is a truely unique opportunity that Fairfield offers."
College Senior,4,"The Career Planning program is a great place to go if you're looking for a job/internship opportunity. They'll introduce you to Stags4Hire, where you can put your resume and cover letter, then apply for a job/internship. There is a Career Fair every fall and spring, but they are mostly looking to hire you in Connecticut."
College Senior,4,"In terms of academics, I mostly enjoyed the courses I took and the professors. Most professors teach well and are concerned about their students. The classes are small and participation is usually a significant part of your grade. Grading is fair in most classes, and all my professors have been great with office hours."
College Senior,4,"Overall, I liked the housing here at Fairfield. Freshman year, I lived in Campion. Great, big rooms but terrible showers. Pick Jouges if you want the best showers, although they do have the smallest rooms. Pick Regis if you want the best freshman dorm parties, and pick Gonzaga if you want to be the closest to everything. Sophomore year, I lived in Loyola. Loved the community, the nice-sized room and the showers were better than Campion. Pick McCormick if you want the best showers, and pick Faber if you want air-conditioning and to be close to the business school. Junior and senior year, I lived in Dolan. Although it is quite far from everything, they now have a bus that runs to Barone. The apartments are the perfect size, everything is updated, plus there's a beautiful study hall on the 3rd floor. Pick the townhouses if you're a partier, and pick Mahan or Meditz if you want to be close to everything. The on-campus lottery isn't too bad."
College Senior,4,"As a senior, I've enjoyed being at Fairfield all four years. I've made great friends here, there are many clubs to join, plus the academics are great and the campus is gorgeous. The town of Fairfield is cute, and the off-campus food is delicious. The on-campus food has gotten better over the years. Dorm life was average, but apartment life has been amazing. The only things I would change about this school is the size and the school spirit. I wish the school was a little bigger, and unfortunately, there isn't much school spirit on campus."
College Freshman,4,Parties are every Friday and Saturday and are very fun! the great thing about the size of FarfieldU is that the parties feel big but not too big and you know almost everyone there. On some Saturdays there are themed parties on the beach that are amazing but you usually have to bring your own alcohol to parties.
College Freshman,4,"Freshmen don't get the best selection when it comes to housing and have to live in dorms with an assigned roommate and the bathrooms aren't the best. Aside from freshman year, sophomores usually live in the Village or apartments on campus, juniors live in the townhouses (where some of the parties happen), and some seniors live in off campus beach houses (where parties also happen)."
College Student,4,"Professors are really kind and care about what they teach. However, there's not a wide variety of courses offered and it's hard to get good classes as a freshman."
College Freshman,4,The staff works hard to give students the information they need. Whether or not the students take it seriously is out of their control.
College Freshman,4,The professors are approachable and the class load is not bad as long as you keep up on your work.
College Freshman,4,"I am a freshmen so i'm not sure about this, but I've heard we have a high job rate after graduation"
College Freshman,4,"I like my building and it is relatively clean- the only problem I have is that rules, like quiet hours are not enforced. Which is a big problem because even during finals week they were not enforced."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very open and friendly; the staff and administrators are approachable. I feel I can get help if I need it.
College Freshman,4,"Not a very well known team, but we have a following."
College Freshman,4,Its fantastic and one of the best private schools.
College Sophomore,4,I love the classes offer in college. They have helped to broadened my horizons about the world and it has made me want to share this knowledge with others.
Freshman,2,"As a new student, I was very excited to attend Fairfield University. However, I quickly realized how clique the school is. However, the campus is beautiful and professors truly do care about their students."
Sophomore,2,"Fairfield university is a great investment, however this only applies if you are in the business school or nursing programs. Fairfield University is an extremely strict school when it comes to its students and their behavior. Too many write ups and you’re out. In addition the housing options are mediocre at best. The public safety here ate almost too good at their jobs and like to bust everyone’s balls. The students are generally white rich preppy kids from Long Island that use their parents money to splurge on food via uber eats because the food in the dining commons is so bad. All in All if I had the chance to start over I definitely would not have attended Fairfield University but rather a school that didn’t monitor every move a student makes like a private high school.

Words to describe the University:
Preppy
Snobby 
Expensive
WAYY too strict
Cliquey
Boring
No access to car until junior year
Hinders your ability to mold into an adult
List goes on..."
College Sophomore,2,"Let's just say that what Fairfield portrays it to be in their recruiting visits and academic choices is not what it really is.  You can't get classes you need, athletic program is questionable at best."
College Junior,2,"Facilities are pretty mediocre for regular students, but they are renovating our field house"
College Junior,2,"Same thing every weekend, same faces too. Townhouses get old quick for underclassmen."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, the level of campus strictness hinders one from becoming and/or acting as an independent. For many, personal freedom has actually dwindled from that of living at home."
College Freshman,2,There is very small student attendance at varsity sport events.
College Freshman,2,There is an incredibly small selection and one needs to have connections to find a house off campus for senior year. The only way students have housing senior year is if they plan it out at least two years in advance.
College Freshman,2,Everybody seems to be obsessed with partying and all they do is get sloppy drunk and get in trouble from RAs or from DPS. Townhouses get rowdy and I have been pushed around too many times there.
College Sophomore,2,"$13,000 for what? Small rooms, random room assignments (freshman year), and no A/C?"
College Freshman,2,If your not on a team.. forget about it
College Freshman,2,Dorms are extremely small and make you feel trapped
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't any diversity, this is mostly a Caucasian school"
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not a fan. It reminds me of a high school all over again. It's very clicky, the administration is very controlling, parties suck, girls are bitchy, and the school spends no money on its facilities. I transferred here thinking it would be a much better school and it definitely isn't"
College Sophomore,2,It's pretty bad. Fairfield has a reputation as a party school but it definitely isn't. The school policies go out of the way to try and curb drinking on the weekends. Parties are always broken up early. If you're a guy and trying to get into a party many times you need to know someone there. In the winter the amount of parties is are limited.
College Sophomore,2,"Internet here is terrible and routinely is slow. The tech department is a joke and don't know how to do their jobs. If you're going to college you should have you're own laptop, its makes things less complicated."
College Sophomore,2,Public safety sucks. They routinely break parties up early and take their jobs way too serious. Parking is awful and they routinely ticket.
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is terrible here, most of the equipment is rusted and broken. Students don't care about the varsity sports and barely attend events."
College Junior,2,Dorms are not great. Would think that the dorms would be nicer for how much tuition the school pays.
College Junior,2,We do not have frats and Greek life at Fairfield University.
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much everyone is white, rich, preppy, etc. Yes, we have some diversity on the sports teams but that's pretty much it."
College Freshman,2,"The academics are the best part of the school, followed by how pretty the campus is. Everything else sucks. The people are preppy and cliquey. There are absolutely no fun parties to go to on weekends unless you're a junior or senior or on a sports team. The school only really cares about athletes and gives them special treatment to no end. People dress up at night to go out but there's no where to go so they end up wandering outside in the cold. Look, if you only care about academics, play sports, or are rich and preppy, then go here. If not, choose somewhere else and don't make the same mistake I did."
College Freshman,2,"Club are sketchy, filled with people from bridgeport norwalk and new haven"
College Freshman,2,"I spend my nights trying to pick up a bunch of self conscious, shallow white chicks"
College Freshman,2,"They suck, no school spirit. "
College Junior,2,Not much financial aid or campus jobs are made available
College Junior,2,"Very limited things, very expensive, really bad at times. The best you can probably get is a small salad, it will be good because you made it and because it is cheap, but that's as good as it gets."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few people of different races or religions. Majority of the school is white Catholic. The school has a reputation of being full of white wealthy prepsters, and in reality there is not any lack of them by any means.  People at Fairfield University do not view being different as a positive. People like to fall the crowd, so most people appear to be pretty similar."
College Freshman,2,Everyone is preppy and stuck up. Boys only want sex.
College Senior,2,"Only juniors have cars, sophomore nursing majors. You can't park behind academic buildings. Permits are expensive, frequent ticketing. Great rent a cops."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Only Sophs and up can have cars on campus; as well as commuters. Not a great situation, but most universities have similar policies"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The cafeteria food is not very good. Their choices for protein, such as meats are very unappealing. The stir fry is ok, and so is the salad bar. The choices for dinner are not very good, so many times you are forced to spend extra money eating elsewhere. I am an athlete and the hours are also very inconvenient. I love this college, but the dining accommodations need to be reconsidered and much more student friendly."
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus is not available until your junior year at Fairfield which is unlike most schools and is quite inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,Diversity is low but I'm happy to see it slowly growing
College Sophomore,2,"Housing options really aren't great, they're are some newer options but theyre harder to get into, most of the options are pretty old. The social atmosphere is on and off, you can find friendly people but for the most part it is relatively stuck up. It is definitely over priced, for the amount we pay to go here our housing options should be 10x nicer."
College Sophomore,2,"We Deserve a Little More – we pay a lot of money to attend this school and one would think we would get food that matches the quality of our education. instead the food is often greasy or looks promising, only to disappoint with an awful bland flavor. most staple foods are good however. the salad bar is always stocked, bagels and cereal are fool proof.

another problem is the inability to use your meal swipes as we choose. again, it our school, our money, our swipes, let us use them however we choose."
College Junior,2,"One Word, Repetitive – The food is very repetitive, and that's the worst part. The first few times you get something in the area, it's nice and convenient, yes. BUT, after going to starbucks, subway, and dunkin donuts one too many times, you start to cross them off of your ""dining"" list, FOR GOOD. Food around here easily get boring."
College Junior,2,"Staying in on campus/off campus housing here is only for people with deep pockets. I recommend living with a family member if possible because it drastically reduces the ridiculous cost of $55,000 a year, to approximately $41,000. The worst part? The dorms and housing is nothing special, TRUST ME!!!"
College Freshman,2,"I have a few friends I really like and the academics have been challenging. The overall atmostphere is not bad and I am able to keep up with my studies, but I am not extremely happy here."
College Freshman,2,Drinking Vs.Drugs – There is not really much drug scenes at Fairfield because most of the time Public Safety and others try to keep it quiet. Drinking is popular.
Sophomore,1,"Lordddddd only knows, how closed minded this school is. If you’re rich and you have mommy and daddy’s money then you will fit in just fine! But for everyone else who is from a not so wealthy home and on a scholarship, good luck trying to fit in. Sorry not all of us on campus can afford all the nice cars and name brand clothes.  It’s a bunch of teenage boys and teenage girls who loves to party on a week day and gets wasted before an exam. Go somewhere where you won’t feel so left out and not every single female and male all go out and sleep with everyone on campus and everyone knows everyone. It gets boring and annoying. Don’t waste your money now."
Junior,1,Good luck making friends! So cliquey. You will never feel like you fit in unless you’re rich and beautiful.
Sophomore,1,"Although I agree that the campus is beautiful, the professors enjoyable, and the people friendly and accepting, that is where the positives of life at fairfield begin and end.  The food is nearly inedible.  The few edible options always have long lines.  The administration does not care about the students a single bit, nor do they respond to emails.  Double majoring is a nightmare, I am on week 6 of attempting with no results.  If you value your money, time, education, and self, go somewhere else."
Alum,1,"Basic. If you are super basic, lack a strong interest in academics, are uncomfortable amongst people from diverse backgrounds, and are comfortable in the knowledge that your life will be defined by mediocrity, Fairfield University is for you.

Some of the professors are in fact quite excellent, but intellectual curiosity is not a characteristic most students possess, so they trod on as best they can.

Campus life? Well if you are looking for the classic experience of keg parties in a suburban setting, then you are all set here. Extra curricular activities involving the arts and sciences are not common place, and best avoided."
Niche User,1,Worst experience ever! Very inconsiderate towards international students and don’t care if they are responsible for ruining a student’s career because of their own irresponsibility.
Senior,1,"Fairfield University is a very close minded university. The students are all a part of a very specific subset of people, those of whom are extremely privileged in every aspect of life. The professors do not seem to care about your future unless you are one of these trust fund babies. The staff are not willing to compromise, provide clarity or sometimes even offer generosity."
Alum,1,School name is worthless. Wont get a job with a degree from this school save your money and try to go somewhere better.
College Student,1,Athletic facilities are under construction so for now it's a bunch of machines shoved into a hall. Theres no school spirit because the athletics are so bad.
College Student,1,"All the parties get shut down. There's no school spirit whatsoever, partly due to the fact that there's hardly any serious sports teams (no football or hockey). It's a 2 hour train ride from NYC, not 45 minutes as advertised by the school. In the middle of nowhere with nothing to do. Lack of diversity. Buildings are really outdated and it's scary how behind the technology is, I had a professor who used an overhead projector last semester -- I haven't seen one of those since the third grade."
College Freshman,1,Just not a good time
College Freshman,1,"If you want to party, Fairfield isn't the place. Go to a much bigger school to have fun. Lets face it, its a small school in a small town, not much goes on. Either the townhouses, which can only be so good, and the beach but only if your an upperclassmen. I'm currently transferring out to a much bigger school for the spring semester."
College Sophomore,1,I hate public safety and they are unnecessarily strict and should be looking for actual criminals not writing up kids all the time. I hope your reading this you wanna be cops.
College Junior,1,"Practically non existent, the most boring place ever."
College Junior,1,"The food is terrible, unless you like eating unhealthy, processed, unknown, ""food"", then it's ""delicious""."
College Sophomore,1,"There is a secret Greek life, its nothing big."
College Sophomore,1,A greek life would be fun
College Sophomore,1,"It's pretty bad. There's no air conditioning, the bathroom are filthy, the study lounge in the oldest buildings include broken tables and chairs, and the housing process sucks if you don't get a good pick."
College Sophomore,1,It's ridiculous. If you park on campus without a pass you're almost guaranteed to receive a parking ticket. If you apply for a 24 hour parking pass they charge you $10. It sounds like a simple amount but it adds up if you need to have your car on campus 4 or 5 times.
College Sophomore,1,If you want diversity go somewhere else.
College Sophomore,1,If you're in the middle class don't even bother applying for scholarships. The only students that get scholarships are lower class minorities from Bridgeport.
College Junior,1,It is bad for a lot of students. some students are forced to walk ten minutes from where they park to where their dorm is.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do unless you are on a sports team or are a junior or senior. I might transfer it's so bad.
College Freshman,1,"We dont have one, school badly needs it, this ship is sinking mang"
College Junior,1,"The WiFi at fairfield is terrible, spotty and sometimes goes out for a few hours at time"
College Sophomore,1,"Can be tough at times, this school would really benefit from a parking garage. I think the zoning in the area only allows 4 story buildings, lets goooo!"
College Freshman,1,"(health and safety in this review means academic disability and support services) 
Do NOT expect any help with accommodations related to your health conditions, academic disabilities or otherwise. They do not help you in the slightest and leave you to your own devices to sort things out (ex: housing accommodations needed for your health, support for tutoring, and transportation to the Health Center). The Special Accommodations committee do not know what they are doing and are completely out of touch with the ADSS (Academic Disability Support Services). Don't bother coming here if you have special needs."
College Junior,1,Cabs Are Expensive – Horrible transportation. The school is one hour away from New York but the Stagbus only runs every half hour and there should be more shuttle buses that are running. There should be later buses and more options to the mall during the week. Wherever you try to go you need a car and there is nothing that is walking distance from the school.On top of that the cabs are too pricy and try to take a longer route so that they can charge you more money
College Freshman,1,"This is a very white school. I'm surprised no one has made a clever nickname for it yet like Vanillanova,"
College Freshman,1,There is little to no Greek life on campus. The only greek life on campus is an under ground sorority that is not recongized by the school and therefore not heard or seen by most of he students on campus. However the varsity sports basically make up for the lack of Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"The stereotypical Fairfield student comes from the tri-state area, is Italian or Irish, and are Catholic.  90% of the school is like this.  In other words NO DIVERSITY.  "
College Junior,1,Almost impossible to have your car on campus until junior year. Once you have your car on campus you cannot park anyone but on spot.
College Junior,1,"Not Really There but No One Really Cares – There's a reason Fairfield has a reputation for being a preppy whit kid school, but the not even the diverse among us don't really seem to care"
College Sophomore,1,Process Could Be Better – It depends on the students but the department is really disorganized and from time to time seem to misplace documents and then are not able to give full aid to the students.
College Sophomore,1,Food at the dining hall is absolutely nasty. However the Stag is somewhat better then the cafeteria but the school only gives you one hundred dollars for meals at the stag. Another good place on campus is the Levee but everything is very pricey and sometimes are forced to eat in the dinning hall. The swipes for the cafeteria should be also used for the Stag or something because alot of people hate going to eat there because there is not much variety every day is the same thing and its not healthy.
College Student,1,Only juniors and seniors on campus are allowed to have cars and they just took over a few parking lots for new dorms (yay) but parking is very tight.
College Freshman,1,Horrible Relationships – It is hard to meet anyone on campus because there will always be drama.
College Freshman,1,Hate Winter Time – The weather in Fairfield is horrible especially in the winter time there is no way of staying warm. It snows way too much and they never do a good job cleaning up the snow. Classes barely get cancelled and once it gets nicer outside then everyone goes outside to hang out.
College Freshman,1,"Rich, White, Northeast – Rich, white, and from the Northeastern United States (Specifically Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts) essentially describes the student population. That isn't to say that EVERY student fits into this category, rather that it is an alarming number. Racial minorities certainly exist, but they are small in number and tend to hang out with each other. It is sometimes difficult to judge a person's wealth based on appearance, but the default seems to be affluence. Not necessarily bragging, but merely explaining that one's dad is worth $5 million is commonplace. In terms of religion, this is a Catholic school. I feel no Catholic presence here from the Jesuits, as they are small in number. I am aware that a large percentage of the students are non Catholic, which is comforting. Sexual minorities exist as just that."
College Freshman,1,"The Beach – Off campus housing comes in two categories: commuters and beach houses.

Commuters, obviously, commute.

Only seniors can be released to live off campus, and the only allowed housing is at the beach. The beach is thus elite, and underclassmen must have a connection to go to beach parties. Even then they must walk the two miles from campus. It is quite a comedic view seeing wealthy Fairfield mansions alongside relatively tiny college homes. The Fairfield residents don't exactly enjoy having boisterous college students living next door, so they are quick to call the police on noise violations. Parties are wild and crazy, but often busted. 

Everyone else has to live on campus. I can't rate higher than a D simply because there is only ONE option to students, and even then it is only for senior year. Every year the school talks about phasing out beach living, but so far nothing has changed."
College Freshman,1,"Not for Me – Nothing special about this school. Jesuit, but their presence is not felt.

Academics are lame. Hardly anyone wants to, or even can, hold an intelligent conversation.

If you're good at math, go somewhere else. I'm bored to tears as a freshman in 300 level major electives. I expect nothing more when I take their hardest graduate level class next semester."

Senior,5,I love Ashford. The communication is great. The course structure is extremely user friendly. The instructors as wonderful.
Senior,5,The course structure is extremely user friendly. The instructors as wonderful. So many helpful resources are available.
Senior,5,My only option was online learning. Working a full time day job and having children at home to take care of left me no other option. Ashford has been great for me.
Senior,5,"I started my college education at age 35, with two kids at home and working a full time job. The Fortunately, Ashford University allows me to complete my schoolwork on my schedule. Had it not been for their flexibility, I would not have been able to successfully start my college education. Now, a senior and only two courses away from earning my bachelor's degree, I feel extremely confident and proud of my choice to enroll at Ashford University."
Graduate Student,5,I love how the teachers are always helpful and are there for you when need them. I currently graduated from there with my Early Childhood degree and now I am getting my Master's degree from there. Such a great school!
Graduate Student,5,I much would rather do online schooling than going to in-person schooling. Online schooling is so much easier for me working full-time in a school.
Junior,5,"Loving it so far. They provide online paper reviews, which will help you get an A on your papers. You have an online database for researching."
Sophomore,5,"Love their student portal. All of the workers I've encounter such as academic advisors, TA/ Finical advisors were all amazing and helpful and extremely knowledgeable."
Sophomore,5,Professors are very flexible and understanding when it comes to me especially being active duty military and needing flexibility.
Senior,5,"The online programs are very well paced. There is assistance if you need it, with tutoring, writing center, and other programs. The professors are professional, helpful, and teach the classes very well. My only issue is that the office of financial does not assist their students, so if you have any financial aid issues, you are pretty much on your own."
Freshman,5,My experience with Ashford University has been amazing. The online classes come with easy and detailed information. What is expected is well presented and the time frames to have work done is sufficient.
Alum,5,"Online was the only was I was able to manage obtaining my degree. Due to a disability and raising a large family the online option was a perfect fit. I do not mind a lot of reading and writing with little to no lectures or tests. This is the way that online classes tend to operate. This option takes dedication, the ability to manage your time, get started without prompting, concentration, and focus."
Alum,5,They helped me to work through challenges that normally would've caused me to have to quit. They encouraged me to keep going and helped me to find solutions to obstacles I encountered.
Junior,5,"Wonderful school, classes, and support. The classes are just the right amount of workload to be challenging but do-able. Professors are easy to stay in touch with and helpful. Academic and financial advisors are helpful and contact is simple. The school resources are very useful such as the writing center and library as well as turn it in. Can connect with tutors online 24/7."

Senior,5,"I love Ashford. My four years of schooling has been easy and fun, yet it wouldn't have been without the dedication and hard work. The only downside of Ashford is their financial services department and overall lack of communication with students."
Graduate Student,5,"I have not started classes yet but, will start in December. I am looking forward to learning there. I hope to graduate with my bachelor's in 2 years to become a counselor for women that have been or are being abused. I chose this school because of its fantastic curriculum and because of the instructors and professors that teach there.

I have been set up in the online classroom and can not wait to start classes."

Ashford University displays a clear idea of what is expected of students through their online schooling platform.

Freshman,5,"Absolutely love this College already with the extras they offer for accuracy with our class work, to make sure we learn , and provide us with step by step walk thru's when entering!"
Sophomore,5,I love the flexibility. I have a full time job and I am a full time college student online. I would not be able to complete school as fast as I am now otherwise. The instructors have been very helpful in the courses when I did not understand something.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed everything about Ashford University. I am an online student and attending school to complete my bachelors degree. The staff has been very helpful in getting me set up for school and the instructors are very knowledgeable and understanding when life circumstances get in the way of school.
Junior,5,"Fantastic instructors that are interested in helping you achieve your goals and ensuring the information you are learning is relative for your academic and professional growth. One class at a time every 5 weeks makes it easy to manage my time and still enjoy the balance of work, school, and life. All online and easy platform which makes it user friendly."
Freshman,5,A strong military supported college. Academic advisor supported and assisted from the very beginning to the end.

Junior,5,Ashford University has been a great experience since I am a non-traditional college student. It gives me the flexibility to be able to do my homework while traveling for work. The advisors were great and walked me through every single step when it came to admissions and getting ready for classes.

Junior,5,This was the first time I have taken online classes. I was hesitant because I always enjoyed in person classes but the classes I have taken have been great and I have really enjoyed the experience.
Junior,5,"After 8 years of being out of school and going back for my bachelor's, I was nervous about it all. But the process was very easy and the enrollment agents were very helpful. It was a great place to go to expand my knowledge base."
Freshman,5,"So far, all I've seen/heard are good things about this school. Applying as a service member was easy, they called and helped me through the process."
Freshman,5,"So far the school advisors/counselors have been easy to work with. Haven't started classes, but they helped me get scholarships, grants, financial aid, and pick a degree. They also helped me with a variety of things considering that I'm in the Army."
Junior,5,Both Professors and University staff/advisors are always available with any questions or concerns that you may have.
Junior,5,"I love Ashford because they are really there to support you in your journey to further your education. Everything is done for you and they are very military friendly. With five week courses, it is easy to stay focused and finish quickly. They have all kinds of resources to help you in case you're having trouble in your courses."
Senior,5,"The thing that i love most about Ashford is everything is at your own pace, although there are deadlines teachers are understanding if you need a couple extra days."
Senior,5,My bachelors degree in Business Administration is all online and it was the best decision i made. All the professors have been understanding and amazing. I feel like i've learned more from these professors than any other schools i've attended. 10/10 would recommend this school to anyone looking to purse their degree!
Freshman,5,Enjoy going to school with Ashford. They are just a phone call or email away. Very good at working with you so you can meet your goal.
Freshman,5,I am a full-time mom and also work full time. Going to school was just easier fo me. I love going to school online and getting to chat with new classmates.
Freshman,5,"I really like the structure. I am considered a full-time student, but I only attend 1 class at a time for a 5 week period. It is perfect for a working parent like myself. I can easily manage my home life, work-life, and school life."
Freshman,5,"The online experience is great. Classes are easy to navigate, instructors are informative and personal, and it is user friendly to turn in assignments."
Freshman,5,"The school's online site is easy to navigate, and the teachers seem friendly and very helpful to the students, including deployed active duty."
Sophomore,5,Very easy to work with! I'm a United Stated Air Force airmen and I've been attending this school for over two years. I've been taking courses through this school to receive my CCAF (Community College of the Air Force) degree. I recently received my degree back in February and have transferred over to getting my Bachelors of Arts in Business Administration. So far it has been a smooth yet a little lengthy transition.
Sophomore,5,"My online experience has been really good! I'm able to learn everything that I need to in an efficient manner. Since this is an online school, I have been able to do my college work in my spare time when I'm not working full time."
Junior,5,Ashford University is a great school! Since the beginning they made me feel comfortable and were helpful when I had any questions. I really enjoy how they will call you to make sure you are supported and to take advantage of their resources. As long as you are organized and keep a schedule then I believe anyone can be successful with online school .

Sophomore,5,The canvas app is perfect! It provides quick and easy access  to online courses and instructors. It's the best way for a parent with kids st home to further their education.
Sophomore,5,Ashford has been an eye opening experience  for  me. I was burned by 2 previous  online colleges and was almost in debt with no degree in site. Ashford University  took me in and has worked with my health issues so that may obtain a degree in Psychology. Thank you Ashford.
Senior,5,"I have had great experiences at the school. The online learning is structured, the professors are very fair, and understanding."
Senior,5,"I love the experience. The advisors are fair, and understanding of all situations a person may be going through."
Senior,5,My classes are online and I find the ease of access to be rewarding. The teachers are very knowledgeable in their fields and very receptive to student's needs.
Senior,5,"It is a great school where they help you, guide you and really help you understand everything you need to know."
Senior,5,"It’s a great university with great staff. They are always ready to answer my questions. Also, the courses are pretty easy yes they can be challenging but you can use the resources they provided for us students. I truly recommend ASHFORD! It’s an awesome university. I would greatly come back for a masters later in the future."
Freshman,5,"Ashford University is amazing, love the quick responses. They care about the students for who they are, not just a number."
Graduate Student,4,"See the below response about AU online and things that are both good and bad overall with the college. Overall, it was a good experience. It was costly."
Graduate Student,4,"This was a nice college to attend and the classes were only 5 weeks. However, the transfer of credit process is not a good one. You have to attend 3 classes before they assess your progress. They also do not let you know about your outstanding balance until 2-3 weeks before you graduate and they ""are sure"" the scholarships will take care of ""most or all your balance."" It has been 4 months and not one scholarship have I won to put towards my balance."
Junior,4,"Ashford is a great place for remote learning. It is flexible, and you can work at your pace. Easy to navigate."
Freshman,4,My learning experience has been amazing. The course instructors respond in a timely manner and the additional resources are a great help as well.
Senior,4,"I took four years of online classes with ease. The professors were well-educated and flexible, the course sizes were convenient, and the work-load was fair."
Freshman,4,I love ashford the advisors and councelors are very polite and steadfast on you achieving your career and asnwer and and all questions you have and are there with you every step of the way
Freshman,4,I love ashford the advisors and councelors are very polite and steadfast on you achieving your career and asnwer and and all questions you have and are there with you every step of the way
Senior,4,All my classes were online and were pretty easy. I struggled with essays at times but I got through it.
Senior,4,It was ok. The portal was easy to use and they have an apt so you can do work from anywhere. Way access
Senior,4,Most of the teachers were understanding and helpful but the financial aid department waited until the last minute to tell me that I have a balance and it just messed up my life. I am a single mom and at this point I regret this choice in college they need to do better.
Freshman,4,Ashford is a great online school that has five-week-long courses that are convenient for busy parents or anyone that is working full-time.
Freshman,4,Classes are online and 5 weeks long. Instructors are very communicative and are available at any time. Ashford provides many free resources for academic success.
Junior,4,Awesome I love it!  The professors work with you and are helpful for the most part.  It cannot be beat.  This is my third onlne school and i plan to graduate from here soon.
Junior,4,I am currently taking classes online and the instructors have been very supportive. Maintaining a 4.0 has been a challenge but the professors have been helpful.
Junior,4,The university is helping students learn and providing great support. My advisors have all been extremely helpful in making the process manageable.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been well. There are plenty of resources and individuals who help you on your educational journey and make the process a lot simpler. The way that classes are scheduled and organized allows students to succeed through adequate time-management and a focus on all class assignments. Professors go above and beyond to make sure that students are on track and are always seen taking the extra steps to provide students with new information and tips for the topics being taught. Regardless of what degree you have chosen to partake, every student is given opportunity to interact with educators and classmates in a productive manner. An education at Ashford University is one which allows every eligible student a chance to further their learning and create a bright future for themselves."
Junior,4,"The instructors really care about your success and development in your professional growth. They provide challenging tasks and assignments that are attainable. The instructors are always eager to help and answer any questions I have. There are plenty of student resources available to me to aid my writing assignments, accessing the online library, and tutors available 24/7."
Senior,4,"My experience with Ashford is mixed feelings. It is a good school, very demanding in school work and depending on your professor, it is a hit or miss. Overall, the college is helpful and they are there for you. However, when it comes to assignments, they are very strict and deadlines are not welcomed. This school is not for everyone. It is time consuming to be in this school, work and if you have a family to support, your time is even more thin. A 4-year degree at this school may take longer because the courses are so compact in 5-weeks, your brain needs a break."
Senior,4,"My learning experience was great! Even though it was online, you so had access to the groups and administrative staff of needed. The advisors were always available. I would recommend to family and friends."
Junior,4,Ashford's system of 1 class in 5 weeks is very intense but does well to make you learn the material at the right pace

Graduate Student,4,"Hello, I graduated with an Associates degree for Early childhood education in 2018. It was one of the most challenging and amazing experiences of my life! The enrollment process was a bit difficult. I would make sure you ask questions to the advisors. They may seem rushed but they mean well. My teachers were excellent and very helpful. The ECC instructors prepare you for your degree. I did many writing assignments and presentations. I had an amazing instructor who told me about the field not having enough bilingual educators who can help children with disabilities. That was a life-changing experience for me! I understand that online college may seem hard but you need to motivate yourself and set a goal. My colleagues were friendly and overall my experience was great. I want to go back to get my bachelors soon once this pandemic is over!"

Freshman,4,The things I like about Ashford University are the kind and helpful teachers and staff that help me arrange my schedule around my deployment and them giving me help with getting financial aid and grant opportunities.
Junior,4,I really enjoy the online portion of being at Ashford it has been very beneficial to me and very quick paced but you also learn so much . I have enjoyed it however if you are going to go make sure you understand it is no joke because it is online don't expect a free ride do the work and you shall be rewarded.I gave it 4 stars due the fact of transferring my credits in has been such a hassle . I started in January and I am still waiting for them to transfer in without knowing this I have unexpected fees . This is not something I expected.However you sometimes have to expect the unexpected.
Niche User,4,"So far, my experience has been great. From being enrolled, all the way down to finishing a course. I've done in-person classes and transitioning to online is something to adjust to, but it's worth. I have a great team of people helping me through my educational journey. There are lots of tools to guide you when needed."
Senior,4,"For an online experience, they really do a good job of engaging and giving the students a substantial education. The price is feasible and it is very military friendly."
Graduate Student,4,Most of the professors were great and very hands on. The class size is great. Course work was just hard enough to challenge to push you to learn new things. My advisor kept changing and hard to get a hold of. Other staff was great and always willing to talk things out with you.
Sophomore,4,It’s a good school with a lot of help and support but we need more longer breaks there is no time to rest from school it is kind of stressful
Junior,4,"The school is ok, it is very expensive and hard to get ahold of help over the phone or emails. The advisors are frequently shuffled but they are trying their hardest to do their job well."
Junior,4,"I love that my school gives me flexibility and the time to make my own schedule. There is no set time to check in or a teacher to make sure you have attended class, but is instead run by the idea that you need to turn in one assignment every 7 days to account for attendance. This allows me to make my own schedule and work at the pace thats best for me. This schedule allows me to learn at my own pace and work slowly on assignments over time instead of doing them all on one day. The one thing I would change about this school is the online courses. The main pain with this is that teachers since they don't conduct lectures, are forced to answer questions via email and its almost impossible to hear back from them within the same day. Overall great school and education system!"
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending Ashford. I only dislike the amount of time it can take to communicate with others, such as instructors. I have had one teacher completely ignore a message I sent about my grade, but he responded to the other emails."
Freshman,4,"Customer service is incredible. My experience working with their admissions advisors was very good. Their courses are set up well and I found their system of incorporating new students to be stellar. There was some confusion about which courses I would need to take and which gen-ed courses had been fulfilled by my transferred courses, but other than that it has been a great experience."
Freshman,4,"While I haven’t been at Ashford University for long, overall my experience with them thus far has been excellent. They have been very accommodating and communicative throughout the entire enrollment process. Everything has been straightforward, easy to understand, and thoroughly explained. I’m hoping that the academics are just as great."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my online experience, it is a good school they go above and beyond to help adult students. Their resources make it easy to succeed. The professors care about their students. The students are supportive of each other."
Freshman,4,I love that this school is at a faster pace but also on you’re own pace so it’s super easy to follow and stick with! The classes are engaging and actually really enjoyable. This is pretty perfect if you have a tight schedule but want to go back to school or continue!
Freshman,4,I am currently attending Ashford University. I like the classes that I am taking and I feel that I am learning quite a bit for my future as an educator. There are many great tools for us students to use to help make our online learning experience a successful one.
Graduate Student,4,It's a good school but they lack some of the more popular degrees that I was looking for when I returned to school and now I find I want to go elsewhere
Sophomore,4,Ashford University is an online school.  It is a great school. I've been able to work my full time and part time jobs while doing classes. I like how easy it is to work school into my schedule. All my professors have been great so far. I looked forward to continuing with Ashford.
Graduate Student,4,"Worth learning while working full-time, and a blessing to have an opportunity to grow your career! Check it out!"
Junior,4,Ashford has been an amazing school. All my instructors have been willing to work with me as I try to get my degree and be a full-time parent. All the staff are helpful and knowledgable and they listen.
Senior,4,"For my first online experience, it has been a pleasant one. Most of the teachers I have had have been a joy to work with. The work is extensive but manageable."
Junior,4,I Love the ease of going to school online.  Five-week courses make learning fast and furious so be prepared for lots of online work!
Junior,4,"I am able to work on my own time. Classes are five weeks long each and I only need to focus on one at a time. I would change the way some of  the advisors do not actually help you, they just say ""what do you want me to do"". They also need to be more upfront with the actual cost of the programs."
Senior,4,"Great contact time for a university that is online. I was able to start classes within two days of enrolling. Their five-week courses make for very fast-paced learning, but Ashford has very many resources to offer their students."
Junior,4,The course work is very rigid. You work very independently and if you work its hard to attend full-time. There are very strict attendance policies that make it harder for working students with families. It is very easy to get behind and not catch your grounding.
Freshman,4,"So far so good. Advisors have been excellent and incredibly accessible. Convenient hours for me, excellent programs offered, and accredited."
Freshman,4,"The classes go at a pretty steady pace, and I don't feel rushed at all. My professors so far have been very helpful when it comes to answering any questions regarding course work. Although I have had problems with submitting my homework, for some reason it submits my assignments as blank papers. But other than that I have no complaints about the school. 
I really like how all the classes are five week courses, they seem to fly by. I am already almost finished with my first year at the college, and it feels like I just started at the college. Because the course is online it requires us to do discussions to show that we understand what we are learning, and a lot of the time it also requires us to paraphrase information from the book to show our understanding of what we have learned thus far in the course."
Freshman,4,"It’s all online, so if you have a busy schedule with work or just life this is a great college for you. The staff are so nice and are willing to help you with everything."
Sophomore,4,I very much enjoy that I can do my schoolwork anywhere with internet. I enjoy the 5 week classes and the professors are all really kind and helpful!
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my journey at the university of Ashford, when you think of a online school you think of self study and a lot of reading. At Ashford you have a lot of opportunities to communicate and receive help from the professors. The professor are not just there to grade work and receive a pay check, they actually care and want you to do well."
Senior,4,"There is a low graduation rate - think like 16%.  If you are willing to write papers and do discussions then this school is perfect!  If you hate having to do the online discussions, look somewhere else.  They do accept Sophia transfers (super cheap/free college credit).  The teachers are hit and miss, as with all schools. I have enjoyed most of my major  teachers and classes."
Sophomore,4,Ashford University is a great college . I like how you can still communicate with your classmates and professors even though its online . I even love that its 1 class every 5 weeks . One thing I wish would change is that you could have a video chat with your professor everyday of class .
Senior,4,"The classes provide their students with a flexible schedule to still juggle their life outside of school. I have really enjoyed lost of my proffessors, however I have had a couple that do not respond in a timely manner or at all. I have also had a few errors that were out of my control when submitting assignments that cause a grade drop."
Senior,4,I feel like the style of how classes are offered is 100% up my alley. The tuition is average in comparison to other online schools. The help offered and available is much more than student get involved with and the availability of degree options is standard to that of on campus universities. Overall an excellent school that deserves more credit than it gets.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the structured schedule Ashford provides.  I enjoy it so much I transferred back after trying a couple other schools.  The administration and counselors are quick to respond and always helpful.
Junior,4,Pursuing a degree in Organizational Management and Human Resources. The staff has been extremely helpful in assisting me throughout the academic process!
Junior,4,They work with you and make sure you are on time with your classes. They also help you for any questions you need just like if you were in a traditional classroom
Senior,4,"I really like the convenience of the online classes. I can work school easily around my schedule. The professors are engaged, and the classes are great. Even the support staff you are assigned are great to work with."
Freshman,4,"I have just started my career with Ashford College, So far, They are very invested in helping out every student who is interested in getting a better education."
Senior,2,"The teachers/professors at Ashford University, are amazing and very helpful. The courses and the pace of the courses, are also wonderfully done. My only issue would be the non-teaching staff. The office of financial aid, does not help students. If you are not filling out the FAFSA they offer no additional help for anything else, and they do not offer any information on scholarships or other programs. You would think that they would want their students to graduate, so they would try to give them scholarship information, but unfortunately that is not the case."
Sophomore,2,"I can’t say I had a great experience nor can I say it was so terrible it was just, average joe online university I feel like. There wasn’t nothing amazing, the teachers are not that great which made me transfer to an instate university every class is the same structure nothing changes very repetitive. Makes sense why the graduation rate is low. They should really change the structure of the classes and monitor the instructors and maybe it will be a better university to attend"
Senior,2,In the beginning when I first started things were smooth sailing until my second year when I found out that what the finance people had told me my first year was wrong. I ended up having to keep taking month breaks because every time I talked to someone to help figure it out id have to talk to someone lese that didn't know what I was talking about. The only thing that I did not like was that they are supposed to write down in your file what they talked about and what you guys figured to do but they never did because no one could find anything on what I was talking about. It cost me so much and overall as my first college experience it was not good. I just had so many people telling my one thing and then so many telling me another thing.
Senior,2,"Pros and Cons of attending Ashford University for a bachleor degree in Business, Pros they have Financial Aid depertment when you call their are many indivuals prepared to handling your queston or concerns about Financial Aid, another benefit the course are five weeks those five weeks go by retively quick. However the Cons a major issue I transferr over 53 credit hours from a previous institution that I attending before I took any course I was told out of the 53 only 47 was accepted after attending Ashford for two years assuming my graduation date was April of 2018 and I only have Five course left I was told rather then 47 credit hours been transfer over and accepted their were only 41 therefore I have to take to extra course. Consequently pushing my graduation date back. Therefore, this has provided a major in convenience for myself. Considering my thoughts were on graduating in April."
Senior,2,"Even though the instructors are knowledgeable and I have learned a lot from my time with Ashford, I have issues with the way student finances are handled. Ashford overcharges students who are out of state and does not help them to locate funding so that they do not max out their student's loans while with them. Due to the classes being in an online format, students do not qualify for grants in either their home state or the schools. Once a student is admitted into the University and the school begins to receive money from the federal government, students are left to their own devices. Students are pushed right into classes without being taught how to navigate portals, funding, and the University libraries. If a student does end up with an outstanding balance on their account, the financial department is so inept they don't notify the student until the student is almost graduated. They also misrepresent to students that they will be able to find a job after graduation."
Alum,2,"This school in insanely expensive, and there are a lot of hidden fees and costs which you learn about later. There is not a lot of bang for the buck."
Niche User,2,"This school is no longer an active school for students on campus. When I was enrolled, I was an online student while serving in the Marine Corps. My experience with each class greatly depends on the professors for each class; there are some who always communicate with their students, and then there are some who, in my experience, took two weeks to answer a question for an assignment due a week and a half prior to that. There is almost no incentive to speak to other students or even learn more about them."
Niche User,2,"Overall pretty lackluster when it comes to obtaining higher education. Was hooked initially on the quick class schedule (5 week for undergrad) but still paid the same amount as I would for a full term class and for much less instruction. Additional education resources are available at what seems like free, but it is charged to you. Would suggest for someone who just needs to knock out a few classes quick but not for someone who wants an actual degree and a reasonable amount of substance for their dollar. You pay for a shortened, not better, education here."
College Sophomore,2,The credits acquired from other school has not been awarded but I'm still hopeful.
College Senior,2,I don't think that working online has as high of quality.
College Senior,2,I don't know for sure what to say.  Online education is great but it can be very difficult.
College Freshman,2,They don't really offer any career services. They simply give you a lesson on how to conduct yourself and how to do research on the career of your choice but they never give you any help with the finding of the jobs.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The subjects were good, but the textbook was outdated by at least one edition, and basically one is stuck with them and can't sell them back."
College Junior,2,"The education aspect of it is really great. Everything it takes to get to that point was very deceiving. When I enrolled, there was one specific concern I addressed immediately as my biggest concern. It was assured to me that this would not have been an issue in any way. Half way through my second term they reassessed my financial aid because they determined that this one concern was an issue. It ended up costing me a poor grade, over $2000 which they are battling me on, and a lot of frustration and stress. After signing an agreement stating that they did make a mistake and they would agree to pay half of the penalty, they have still yet to honor it 9 months later. I have had to wait over 9 months just to get back into classes because of this mess. The opportunity is great, as long as something like this doesn't hold you back."
College Senior,2,"Haven't had any education on doing this part at all. Sure there are links on the site, but an advisor should be advising along the way."
College Senior,2,They keep postponing my financial aid app
College Senior,2,Tuition rises every year this year April 1st 2015. Additional $10 per credit hour
College Junior,2,"Being military, the TA cap is set at a max. My school utilizes the full cap of our TA."
College Freshman,2,I didn't agree with what my cereer services determined for me. I will say Ashford does have a good course that helps you understAnd your cereer path....
College Junior,2,"Everyone at this school, from students to professors, is only focused on obtaining a good GPA in order to receive the Presidential Scholarship. Few students take challenging classes and the challenging teachers either get fired or change the way they teach."
College Sophomore,2,The tuition for my school is way to high. I really appreciate the financial aid because it helped me out a lot going into my second year.
College Senior,2,A lot of students in the Bachelors program could not read or write very well at all. Its just a diploma mill in my opinion.
College Senior,2,They promise to help you find work/internships but it is not true. I will not recommend this school to anyone.
College Senior,2,Don't like how tuition keep going up its nt affordable
College Freshman,2,The fees for class and all others are way too expensive. I am worried that my scholarships or other monies that I am expecting will not be enough to sustain me. I was not expecting college (even online schools) to have this hefty of a price tag. I am currently seeking alternatives to financial help.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ashford University does not give scholarships to On-Line Students, now I owe $10,000 for classes because I ran out of federal financial aid.  I am through with classes and basically considered a graduate but cannot receive my diploma until I pay this money. I am trying to get outside scholarships but have been unsuccessful."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Because  I was an online student, it was not so good. I received no help with trying to find work, infact, there are professional certificates in HR and I was never informed of these. I have received nothing about being a part of the alumni association."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The value I am paying seems like it increases each academic period in which it has gone up. However, I do feel like I am learning a lot but going in debt in the mean time. On the other hand, financial aid is very supportive on the phone but they are slow and not accountable to do speedy disbursements or process my financial aid package. My advisor is great and I go through him to reach financial aid. It seems to go faster. However, my school does not offer any scholarships and I wish I would have known that before choosing the school."
College Freshman,2,"I have had nothing but problems getting financial aid. At first it wasn't bad until the VA renigged on my financial aid. That's when everything hit the fan. I had to contact the school when I found out about the VA not giving me any FA. I believe the school got the letter as well. Then I had to fill out papers to change my elective for FA and I not only had to fill them out, I had to fill them out a couple of times. I sent them in via a scanner on my phone and someone called to tell me that they didn't get everything. So there was more filling out to do. Then when they got them they couldn't see them. I got the phone call a few times, along with the missing pages phone call. I also took a month off so the FA office could get everything straight for me when my month was up. Come to find out no one looked at my papers until the Friday before my classes were supposed to start back up. Complete NIGHTMARE."
College Junior,2,"My education is financed through government student loans. There are no scholarships offered, and I don't know what a full academic year will cost me ahead of time. Tuition is high ($1300 per course), but most of that goes to the IT department to build and maintain the online classrooms. After they register you for classes and use up all of your financial aid, the financial aid department is very helpful in setting up affordable payment plans and explaining the money that you still owe."
College Junior,2,"It's expensive, but I knew that going in.  There is a very unexpected $1200 registration fee upon initial signup.  That hurt!"
College Junior,2,It was a nice thought but a true headache in experience.
College Junior,2,"It could be better there is a staff person leaving every time someone enrolls no one is ever available. An they cannot even figure out who could call a student on Saturday. Too high rate of staff turnover, to feel secure with financial documents and paper verification."
College Junior,2,"I like the online, but teachers are much less personal or seem to care really. That is not much from what I am used to in my demographic."
College Junior,2,"For the expensive tuition the people at the school could focus more on student success and help through stressful situations, rather than focusing on the money. It would also helps if the institution would be supportive and available to the students for help. Boost morale... something."
College Freshman,2,"Do I feel like I am getting what I paid for in my classes, yes. However my experience with financial aid has been horrible! They have been very inconsistent and give me a different explanation every time I call. I was going to go to this campus sooner but due to the stress financial aid had given me I withdrew my application."
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't choose this school again because I am completely bored with the learning experience and tired of the monotony of each class, the only way each course differs from each other is by topic and content within the respective textbook.  The instructors get paid to supervise, not actually teach."
College Junior,2,"The instructor have little interaction with the students.  It seems the only effort the instructors put forth is grading essays and being present post-discussion posts.  The online dicussions DO NOT replicate a traditional college classroom discussion at all, far from it.  It feels as if you can pretty much teach yourself at this University, not sure instructors should be required if their not teaching anything, they seem more like a supervisor of sorts."
College Junior,2,I tried to transfer all my general ed classes and they went towards my electives.  I was and still am very dissappointed.
College Junior,2,I wish there were classroom set up like meeting through Adobe where the instructors could actually teach us in real time.
College Senior,2,"I enjoy my online class experience. Sometime it can become frustrating, depending on the subject. But overall, I am happy."
Recent Alumnus,2,Too hard to do and submit some assignments
College Junior,2,"The cost of classes are too high, I'm researching other college that are less expensive"
College Junior,2,Tuition has went up twice since I've been going to school. I love school and have no complaints.
College Junior,2,"I think the school is way too expensive, but I am really between a rock and a hard place.  I would prefer to be able to go on campus but time does not permit.  The tuition and/or lab fees, taxes, or some other fee seems to be added or increased.  On this basis, I think the school is taking advantage of students."
College Senior,2,"I have had a tough time with financial aid in the past year.  At Ashford, there is not communication between the financial office, and the financial advisor.  They use the students to communicate between the two.  The advisor that I have has had problems remembering my situation even though we have had problems to deal with for a year.  I have to explain it every time I have had to talk to her.  She is nice and helpful, but there is never recognition.  I must make sure my account is being taken care of myself.  I have totally run out of funding for my degree, and my advisor is not very helpful with the problem.  She pretty much has left it up to me to do everything.  "
College Senior,2,"I don't feel that the caliber of student at this university is very high. I feel that there should be a larger separation between advanced and beginner students. For example, I could have very easily tested out of the courses that required me to learn how to use Microsoft Word or operate an internet browser. These classes are designed for students who have been out of school fro 10+ years and don't know how to operate computers. I would have rather spent my money on classes that taught me something valuable. "
College Senior,2,I am not aware of any career services programs that could help me get a job in my intended field. 
College Freshman,2,"My major is Healthcare Administration, yet I am enrolled in courses that have nothing to do with that subject. For instance, I just began a course called Intro to Film. I have been billed for Anthropology, and it is not even on my list of courses scheduled, and I did not receive all of my financial aid, and can not get answers to any of these things."
College Senior,2,"I did not really experience any thorough career services when I graduated with my BA, hopefully my experience will be better after the masters completion."
College Senior,2,"the inability to combine programs to make a more personalized program is a negative, but the overall curriculum covers all the necessary topics"
College Junior,2,There are some teachers that have expectations that are unrealistic.  
College Junior,2,"The first few general classes are very good with this school.  It is as though they put there best teachers out there first, then it is all down hill."
College Junior,2,I beleive there should be more scholarship options available for students. 
College Freshman,2,"I am working on my fourth class at Ashford University so I have not taking any class directly associated with my major, Service Management - Hospitality Enterprise. My current class, Computer Literacy, is the most interesting so far. I am learning about all aspects and history of a computer's hardware and software. This class will help with my career since technology is changing daily."
College Freshman,2,I am an online student but I love reading my classmate's post. They lead interesting lives.  
College Freshman,2,"My former school, College of New Rochelle, is not cooperating with my current school, Ashford University, in the transfer process. There have been multiple attempts, so I will have to go to the school. "
College Sophomore,2,i gave it an average rating as i am an on line student
College Sophomore,2,have not started yet but already feel its gonna be a good experience
Recent Alumnus,2,personal things going on in my life hindered my focus
Freshman,1,Horrible experience. I was lied to about the cost and the assistance they would provide. They prey on low income and military students. If you search into them you will find many class action lawsuits against them for defrauding students. The classes they offer do not care over if you try to transfer to another university. They have struggled with their accreditation and many of there programs are not accredited although they claim to be. A waste of money and time. They will pass you around to multiple different advisors who will do nothing but lie.
Freshman,1,The classss have nothing to do with what you are majoring in. The general courses do not even transfer over because they are made up classes to get more money. Five weeks per class adds to much stress and makes it impossible to learn anything.
Sophomore,1,"I can’t say I had a great experience nor can I say it was so terrible it was just, average joe online university I feel like. There wasn’t nothing amazing, the teachers are not that great which made me transfer to an instate university every class is the same structure nothing changes very repetitive. Makes sense why the graduation rate is low. They should really change the structure of the classes and monitor the instructors and maybe it will be a better university to attend"
Senior,1,"The staff at Ashford University are seriously overworked. They do not care about you as a student. I was emailed from an advisor that some classes would be approved to transfer in. Once I took the classes and had the transcripts sent they were no longer approved, even though I had the emails. The customer service I received after this was appalling. Save yourself the headache and choose a better university!"
Niche User,1,This was an terrible experience from the beginning to the end. I am stuck with a huge balance and 1 class to complete my degree. They have no resources to help their students. The customer service from anyone that answers their phones is horrible and they are supposed to be professionals.
Freshman,1,"The college will get you signed up super fast and leaves a lot unsaid. They have a pay period instead if a semester that means your financial aid will pay for a class and if you fail for any reason you are automatically charged for the next class and you semester continues on. If you complain about not know and indicate you can prove that you have had conversations with individual who told you differently, they will cite school policy. The school is ok as far as academics go and are not very personal about the learning. If you are military and choose not to use VA benefits, they will take away the discount they offer. Also the initial evaluation is very inaccurate, compared to the actual amount of credit they will take off your degree program. The school has potential, yet they care more about the for profit part of their school. I would look elsewhere, there are better programs that cost less and are much more caring and honest."
Niche User,1,"I thought this would be a great place for me to attend college, however, after the third course I received a teacher that was never active or present in the class. I, being who I am took it upon myself to motivate the class and get the discussions going and flowing. I didn't give up though and some of the staff, advisers, and deans wanted me to take it all the way and have her disbarred from teaching but I chose not to. Not wanting to be remembered as the one who ran a teacher out but as the one who walked that stage in high honors. I then suffered a severe hand injury and under doctors orders had to withdrawal from my class and would resume the next time. Well they didn't withdrawal me from the class they withdrew me from the University. I could return if I paid xxx amount of dollars each month. Why would I do something that I didn't have to do prior to the injury? So I left the University to a bigger and brighter place."
Junior,1,"The staff are completely unhelpful. When asked to submit paperwork and being told repeatedly they had not recieved it, I found out they had over a dozen copies. I did not have N/A in all the required spots. After being told for many months they did not have it someone finally told me the truth and how to fill it out properly. At that point I was too frustrated to deal with the school. Now they have sent me to collections. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
Sophomore,1,"SCHOOL IS A FRAUD. ALL ABOUT MONEY. LAWSUITS!! CONTACT ME! I am ready to work on a class action lawsuit for my ""outstanding balance"" CONTACT ME. I see lots of you are having the same problem with your accounts and with the ""counselors"" I can tell you my experience. I was going for education, however 2 years in I found out my state would not accept them. I was just about to change my major to a business major when I ran into the same problem lots of others have had with my financial aide. Google  -- Lawsuits Ashford University financial aide. I have been very mis-treated and now they are not helping me at all! I owe lots and lots of money THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS that I should not owe at this time because my account was messed up. I have been battling this for over a year now and talked to a handful of people. NO ONE helps!! Go to any other school."
Freshman,1,"More teaches who have hands on experience in business world.
 
Real become a university campus and a nonprofit private college.

Be more about students best interest  instead of bout bottom line.


I'm  a rare student.  One of the riches minds ever .  yet I'm not received  with a importance imbracement ..

So I'm transfer after I complete half a year of classes  and I'm let another college help me..


How can a great mind who created over 1000 business models be not embraced. 


Well. Ashford university is a for profit school bottom line. 


I have a mix review.."
Freshman,1,Ashford University was sued for fraudulent activity by the state of Iowa a couple years ago for 7.25 million. As a result they lost their accreditation and they are no longer an accredited university. Ashford of course paid a settlement because they knew they would lose in court for their thousands of scams against students and their bank accounts. Ashford screwed me out of the entire class cost when my military duties intefered with class and my teacher was discriminating against me. Do not use your TA here or pay for classes here. They do not respect military or honor extenuating circumstances. Ashford is trash and it is no wonder they lost their accreditation just a few years ago in a state-level lawsuit.
College Senior,1,transferring i really could 't answer the questions before because they just got in but the way i was told was all of them would go though so i would have 84=90 credits. just a little scared of taking a class i took.
College Senior,1,My previous college credits was fully transferable.
College Senior,1,I don't think that people know what they are doing here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not very flexible with transferring, they want you and they want to keep you."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Like ITT Tech, Everest College/Concordia Colleges, and other online and storefront institutes I've heard about, the degree comes nowhere near the real-life qualifications of the industry.  And they continue to bilk billions in profits off the student loans and grants.  It's injustice at its' best."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Instructors cared, and that's the only segment of the faculty at Ashford University that did care...only now that they have closed their campus in Clinton, Iowa, that may have changed."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They do not accommodate to those with Diabetes or other metabolic diseases.  They do not provide sufficient assistance or accommodations in any arena.  They refer you to a website for tutoring, which is the laziest accommodations ever.  It really turned me off of their school.  They should be ashamed of themselves for claiming things in their ads and not following through honestly.  IN fact, they do the exact opposite of what they ""guarantee"".  It's horrible."
College Senior,1,"For teaching credentials, none exist at Ashford. I feel like they stole my GI Bill benefits by not telling me this during the application process."
College Senior,1,"The school is in a rush to get a military student enrolled. While the classes are decent, Ashford does not reveal that their classes do not receive teaching credentials until you are almost halfway done with the program. The Finance Department comes up with multiple excuses to keep Pell Grant monies long after they should be paid out to the student, and this causes extra financial hardship on the student.

If I knew then what I know now, I would NEVER have chosen Ashford."
College Senior,1,I asked but not responded to by my advisor
College Senior,1,What else can I say?
College Senior,1,Constant screw ups with my aid and hiding funds & fees
College Junior,1,mistakes made by department but left up to student to resolve
College Junior,1,"Too much money per class $1409.00 per class, $85.00 per digital material for bachelor's program."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I've tried explaining to the financial that GI bill students should get there money sooner, but they tend to totally mess up stipend distributions."
College Junior,1,"Ashford is not recognized by PHEA, and I cannot get a grant to help pay for my education, when I applied to FASA, there school was not there and FASA has not given me any grants to help pay for my education, I did not get any help from my Ashford on what grants or any other options to help me pay the extra cost, Ashford raised their prices every year, after the money was granted."
College Sophomore,1,I have not had the best experience with the financial aid department. had issues with a getting help with my finical aid and getting a response from the staff
College Senior,1,Financial aid will encourage you to accept maximum loans especially if you are a student with previous credits. I feel like my degree having had already two years completed should have coated less.
College Junior,1,There have been several times that I have had to ta with the financial aid office due to mistakes made on my account.
College Junior,1,I have never had a worse experience then I do with this school.
College Junior,1,The teachers are not there for the students when you have a question.
College Junior,1,If I could choice to start all over I would never begin at Ashford.  They are not helpful for their students and they are not good at getting back to here students in a timely manner.
College Senior,1, I was just told I have exhausted my pell grants now I have to come up with money for 6 more classes and I don't know where it's coming from. I'm praying for a Scholarship somewhere
College Junior,1,As an online student I provided my own network.
Recent Alumnus,1,many errors in admission promises.  Advisors do not know how to handle issues.  Disabilities department not good at helping students with disabilities.
College Sophomore,1,The tuition is too high and I'm not receiving the necessary knowledge
College Senior,1,This grade was received in informal logic I wish that when I was getting graded for my discussions that I didn't get points off for them because as long as I responded to my classmates and was the appropriate words that it should've been the full grade and receiving this grade cause me to almost loss my financial aid which I desperately need.
College Senior,1,"What a rollcoaster ride. My educational experience has very stressful and unfulling.  I have had some difficulties with my core classes. I haven't successful pass due to my own fault.  I have reached out to my advisor, but most of the time you hear from them unless you own money and then they call like you have committed a crime. Once I finish my degree program,  I will never recommend this university yo anyone"
College Junior,1,After I graduated with my AA I tried accessing the career center and even submitted a resume.  Needless to say 6 months later I yet to hear anything back from them.  I am really disappointed with the academic advisers.  Whenever I ask them for assistance either I do not hear back or I am told to just read the website and make my decisions based on what I read.
College Sophomore,1,I believe that most of the students could do better if the teachers pushed more and interacted more. Most just let the students get by with the lest they need to do
College Sophomore,1,I am not offered any help with my studies and the do not off any tuitions or aid to help with finances
Recent Alumnus,1,The overall cost for tuition is extremely high and not able to use the degree that I paid so much money for to successfully land a career.
Recent Alumnus,1,I graduated with a Master's in Higher Education July 2011 and have not been able to find a job in my field.
College Sophomore,1,"After comparing different online program tuition fees, I decided to apply at Ashford University because they had the lowest tuition fees but after being enrolled for 4 months they increased my tuition. In addition, my first advisor informed me that I would be fully funded, I was so excited and decided to proceed with the enrollment but after 5 months and 3 different advisors I was informed that I owed over $1000 for my classes and the advisor had misinformed me about being fully funded. The school acknowledge the mistake but are only covering me for one semester. Now I have to deal with 2.5 years of paying for school."
College Sophomore,1,Already disclosed my opinion in previous question.
College Sophomore,1,"What is actually horrible is their school library! Wow! You are asked to provide scholarly sources from the school library, but it is the most difficult to use.  I mean you try to put in their suggestions so that you can find something on the topic you are trying to write about and you can never get what you need.  Some you have to pay for.  I am not in a financial position to pay for JSTOR and so I lose points on my grade because I can't follow the instructors request for my assignment."
College Sophomore,1,"I cannot say what the physical campus was like, but I can say that the online one was rather... interesting. I did like that it was fairly easy to navigate, however I did not like that it was constantly complaining about various things such as which web browser was used. I also did not appreciate that very little about the school seemed to.... challenge a person. There was nothing to actually push a student to do better and a lot of classmates would post very small responses to questions posed in ""class""."
College Junior,1,"This is the worst school when it comes to probelms and figuring out that if we cannot get to the school web page, that it is ok to email our homework directly to our teacher. Then, load the paper later when the web page is available."
College Freshman,1,"I don't think there is a great career service unless it involves Clinton, Iowa."
College Senior,1,Tuition increases are frequent. They do not offer financial aid and do not offer help with federal financial aid application. It is difficult to get that applied when it comes in. The process is frustrating. It is probably much easier and cheaper to take general ed classes at a local community college first. AU is overpriced and a waste of time.
College Senior,1,"I could have learned better on my own. This was a major waste of time, money and energy. AU is only out for a profit. All things promised to get you in will go unfulfilled. I deeply regret my choice in AU. (This is coming from an honors student with double major and minor). AU is a joke!"
College Freshman,1,i need to find money for i didn't pass some classes that i need to pay for them ineed to find extra money so i can stay in school
College Sophomore,1,"i believe that is the grade i was to receive with one pf my previous classes and i was stumped because i turned all of my assignments in (so i thought). i found that i did not submit my assignment, it was already finished i just spaced it. it was 15% of my grade and it knocked the grade from a C to a D+ and it was not acceptable to me or the school. to make it short i emailed the counselor and the instructor for that course and asked what i could do about turning it in. my counselor suggessted i get a hold of my instructor first and then if that did not work i could always appeal my grade with the proper forms. i then emailed my instructor and he did accept my assignment then he graded it and gave me a grade i felt was appropriate for the work that was submitted. i was pleased that he allowed me to turn it in and that i did not have to go as far as an appeal process. I thank the both of them for their understanding and patience with me."
Recent Alumnus,1,Unfavorable experience with financial aid the school leaves it up to the student to obtain their own financial aid there is no guidance and unclear explanations as to the use of financial aid.  There are some advisors who are helpful but in the end there are no alternatives other than the student obtaining their own funding
College Junior,1,They have a website. We must provide our own services. Some books are provided for us.
College Senior,1,"The classes are very expensive and only 5 weeks long.  I have had numerous issues with the financial aid department this year.  My financial adviser has changed 3 times since I started at Ashford.  If you plan to attend Ashford, make sure that you stay on top of your financial aid.  They have a tendency to lose paperwork including the FAFSA.  I filed mine in January and they claimed not to have received it until MAY.  The reason this is a D+ instead of an F is because they are very prompt in sending my financial aid once all the problems are fixed."
College Junior,1,I think that paying this much for a class that is 5 weeks long is outrageous and I do not get the help when I need it and that should be part of the high tuition.
College Senior,1,I had a family member get very sick and I had to put all of my attention to them. I was failed because my final paper was two days late.
College Senior,1,The tuition is not very expensive compared to other online schools but they do not help you very much with financial assistance. The books are very expensive and you have to ask for the voucher to purchase these books.

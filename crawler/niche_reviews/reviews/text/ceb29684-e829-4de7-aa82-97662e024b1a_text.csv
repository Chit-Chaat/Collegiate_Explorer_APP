Niche User,5,I absolutely love everyone at Huntigdon College. They are so friendly and helpful with anything you need help with. The college is clean and so beautiful.
Freshman,5,"The school is beautiful and the other students and teachers really make you feel at home. Life at Huntingdon is really something more than i expected, i tend to get along with everybody more and i'm less of a closed off person because of it. The people their really make you fee like family and it's an enjoyable place to be at."
Freshman,5,"I like that Huntingdon is a small, easily walk-able campus with not having to work about thousands of students driving across a huge campus."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful but old so there are a lot of problems with air conditioning, etc. things that go along with older buildings."
Niche User,5,"I am a high School senior, that will be attending Huntingdon college in the 2019 fall semester. I have already loved the experiences I have had with everyone and everything that has to do with the school. I have yet to attend a class, and i already feel like I am a part of the family. Everyone is very nice and welcoming and the campus is the icing on top, it is a very relaxing and easy sight, the rustic look of the buildings with the greenery is truly a beautiful sight. Huntingdon college is a great place to be and i would recommend it to anyone."
Freshman,5,"I love all my professors because they want to see me succeed and are always willing to help me out with things I may not understand during class. I also, love the staff that work her because they are all so nice and always happy to be here even they don't want to be. They make my day brighter."
Freshman,5,Huntingdon is a great way to express your inner self. Itâ€™s a great college to further your education with up to date resources and teachers who would be more than happy to help. Class sizes are smaller for focus reasons. And everyone on campus is very friendly
Sophomore,5,"I like the people and the staff, there all so cool and understanding of how you are and everyone just almost get along."
Niche User,5,"I visited Huntingdon College through a summer program and my stay was excellent! The staff, the campus, the whole atmosphere was just amazing! I loved how welcome I felt just walking through the doors; everyone was so nice, it made me feel as if they already knew me! I spoke with professors and participated in simulations and I have got to say; Huntingdon is definitely a top choice for me and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a college with fantastic academics, a staff willing to do whatever possible to help, and fun, friendly student life."
Junior,5,Huntingdon has been a wonderful choice for obtaining my bachelor's degree. The advisors are always there to assist with my questions and requests. All the staff members provide immediate responses. Huntingdon's evening studies program is the only way I was able to work on completing my degree. I love the flexibility they've provided to working student's and parents.
Freshman,5,"Huntingdon College is a great Institution, that my family and I fell in Love with after our visit. I am going to play Football for Huntingdon and Coach Turk and the Coaching Staff had been great."
Niche User,5,I have been on two college tours. Huntingdon College is by far the friendliest group of faculty and administration that I have met. The college is small enough to not feel overwhelmed but still has the full university experience.
Senior,5,Huntingdon College is a small liberal art's private college and it was the perfect fit for me. Everything is very hands on and the experience is very personal as it is a small campus so all the administrators and professors know you and always welcome you with open arms. The campus has a great home feel to it and overall is a great place to be.
Sophomore,5,very good school. all of the professors are friendly and do all that they can to help each individual student excel and succeed in their studies. the athletics are very well done as well. every sport goes out to support each other in their own event.
College Freshman,5,OVERALL A GREAT SCHOOL ALL AROUND !!!
College Freshman,5,Overall Huntingdon offers the best professors. They care equally about students and would do anything to make sure students succeed.
College Junior,5,Sexual assault is not a thing on our campus.
College Junior,5,Being at Huntingdon you will love each and every person there
College Junior,5,Everyone gets included in this on campus and there are so many to choose from.
College Junior,5,Attending Huntingdon College is the best choice I could have made. We are not just a number at Huntingdon but apart of a great family that wants to see you succeed in every part of life.
College Freshman,5,they make me feel at home and help a lot
College Student,5,"Since the campus is small, everyone knows everyone. All of the administration knows where everyone is or where they should be. the professors care about their students even beyond just them passing the course."
College Student,5,Its in a very nice community and the security guards are very nice
College Student,5,I love this college so much and will love going there
College Student,5,It is the best school in the whole world and i will love going there in the fall
College Student,5,The campus housing is about as good as it gets at Huntingdon College
College Student,5,They really care about their athletics at Huntington College
College Student,5,Huntingdon College is the best college in the south. They will help me overachieve what I plan to do in life.
College Freshman,5,"Alumni relations is very important at Huntingdon, they are encouraged to stay involved with our campus even after they've graduated. The recruiters are amazing, and part of the reason why I was so interested in coming to Huntingdon. The advisors knew me by name, and remembered me when they would come to my high school for college fairs."
College Freshman,5,"Never have I ever experienced professors being so concerned with how I am doing with my classes. If I do poorly on a test, they'll encourage me and many have met with me to study before another test. I love my classes, and I love what I am learning. The other students in my class are friendly, and we all work really well together."
College Freshman,5,"I was extremely skeptical about joining Greek life, having the stereotypical sorority and fraternity image from Hollywood. But, after joining, I realize that I am so lucky to be apart of a sorority. I am apart of Chi Omega, and we work diligently for our philanthropy and for our college. We get along great with the other sororities, and even help out with their philanthropies as they do for us, and the same thing goes for the fraternities!"
College Freshman,5,"Huntingdon is the greatest college ever, and I love it so much! I am so glad to have found a place where the teachers are so interested and dedicated to making sure you do great in your classes and get the most out of your college education. The admissions counselors, the staff, and the professors are the nicest and most helpful people you could ever come in contact with. And the students who go there are exactly the same. You can't walk down the sidewalk without saying hi at least a dozen times to every person who goes walking by. It is a wonderful campus, and I am grateful for everyday I get to be there."
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved my education at Huntingdon College! My professor was always there for me and willing to help me. I even had several of my professors cell numbers and they would answer calls even at night! They want to help us succeed and will do anything to make that happen.
College Sophomore,5,"For the career that I am choosing to go into, Huntington is a great choice because they have partnerships with graduate schools/seminary schools that I plan to apply to. The staff is always talking to me personally about what I plan to do and when I need to do it in order to make the most and get the most out of my experiences at college to have the best chance at a successful graduate experience at the place I would like to attend once I graduate."
College Sophomore,5,Hardly ever is there a problem.
College Junior,5,"I LOVE my Communications program. Our classes are hands on and we learn from real life experiences that we can relate to. Our director, Dr. Disbrow, is the best woman in the world and is an absolute pleasure to learn from. She makes courses unique, such as using the Hunger Games book to teach different styles of communication."
College Junior,5,Our professors know our names and genuinely care about helping us getting into our programs of study and graduate schools.
College Sophomore,5,MY PROGRAM IS ART AND I LOVE IT
College Sophomore,5,WHEN PICKING HUNTINGDON THERE WERE NO CHALLENGES.  EVERYONE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND KIND
College Sophomore,5,EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES. VERY HELPFUL. VERY SAFE
College Sophomore,5,THE FOOD ON CAMPUS IS GREAT. AVAILABILTY IS GREAT ALSO
College Sophomore,5,HUNTINGDON HAS A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT THERE IS NO SUCH ACTIVITIES AT THIS SCHOOL
College Sophomore,5,"YOU ONLY CAN LIVE OFF CAMPUS IF YOU ARE 21 OR CLOSE BY THE SCHOOL 

THE SCHOOL DOES NOT REALLY LIKE STUDENT TO LIVE OFF CAMPUS"
College Sophomore,5,THE HOUSING IS GREAT WELL PROTECTED AND ACCESS TO EVERYTHING
College Sophomore,5,everything is beautiful and student friendly.
College Sophomore,5,Campus is haunted. Incredibly beautiful and old.
College Sophomore,5,I haven't heard of any problems getting into it.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are incredible and so hands on.
College Junior,5,"Our security team is the best. They will give you rides to anywhere on campus for free and to keep you safe, all you have to do is call them. Nothing bad ever happens on campus."
College Student,5,"Everyone is like a family win or loose, we all support each other that's what I like the most about the school. The sports teams are pretty amazing"
College Sophomore,5,"Students are very involved in all aspects of campus life. It is a small campus so it is easy to find something to get involved in. Traditions such as ""Welcome Back Week"" and homecoming week events are very popular and a lot of planning and timing goes into them."
College Sophomore,5,"We are all provided with a laptop when we arrive for the freshmen intro weekend to use for the next four years and is ours to keep after graduation. They are always one of the best quality computers for that year, and come equipped with all programs we would need for school already on them. We also have computers in the library to print anything you need off of them, or research if yours is down. Most people just use their own because the tech team is quick about fixing any problems we may have."
College Sophomore,5,"There are numerous places to eat around campus from fast food to fine dining in Old Cloverdale. The most frequented places by students of HC are: La Zona Rosa, a delicious and extremely affordable Mexican restaurant, Chicken Salad Chick, which has numerous types of chicken salads, sandwiches, and amazing cookies, and also Kraze, a frozen yogurt shop."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved majoring in Athletic Training. If you are interested in that though, Huntingdon is not a fit for you. There is no longer a Athletic Training program. The workload was overwhelming at times especially because of observation hours at practices and games. The facilities are nice but could have been better. The faculty was the best part of my experience. My advisor set me up with an excellent internship after my senior year."
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy being in the Sports Studies department at Huntingdon College! All of the professors are extremely knowledgeable and helpful in understanding material.  Having a physical therapy clinic on campus is also a unique facility for the campus.
College Sophomore,5,The Chemistry department at Huntingdon goes above and beyond what is asked of them they currently have 100% acceptance rate on students trying to get into grad school that is the highest of any department on campus. The advisers in the Chemistry department actually care about what happens to you while your at Huntingdon and after you leave. They are there when you need them and giving advise when you don't think you need it. They really do more than I can type on this review. If your thinking of a college to go to and you want to be a Chemistry major here is the place to go...
College Sophomore,5,There is  NO evidence that there is or ever has been alcohol or drugs on campus. It is a great place to attend college.
Recent Alumnus,5,Athletics are a huge part of Huntingdon.  Most students are affiliated either with a physical sport or an artsy sport
College Senior,5,The workload within this program can be a bit too much at times if you do not know how to manage your time. This major is not for people who like to procrastinate because deadlines can sneak up on you. The faculty in my department are extremely helpful and encourage you to visit them during their office hours. They even give their personal phone numbers for you to call them if they aren't in their office. The faculty also will do whatever they can and offer assistance in your endeavors.
College Freshman,5,if it rains you really do not have far to walk unless you are a freshman girl because our dorms are so far from everything on campus.
Junior,4,"For a quick transition to online learning with COVID-19, it went surprisingly smooth. I was able to obtain good grades for the semester, and the professors were always readily available when I asked questions."
Junior,4,"If you like a small college feel, this is the school for you. It's a private college with a hefty tuition. However, it offers several easy scholarships to obtain, and the tuition is all inclusive (ie. books, housing, food, etc.) Great school for athletes, and/or those who want to continue to grow in the Christian faith!"
Freshman,4,"Some teachers are better than others. Most teachers are easy to talk to and get feedback from, others not as much."
Niche User,4,Great visit on their campus. Everyone was friendly. The Dining Hall food was great. As well as their DIII athletics. Great academically sound students.
Alum,4,"The main characteristic that stood out to me as a student at Huntingdon College was the small, tight knit environment. As a student, I always felt as though I belonged on the campus. Between the faculty and staff, along with your fellow peers, a student can expect to feel engaged and welcome. That is one thing that Huntingdon prides itself in, and that is the saying that we really are like a family. Now, that sort of atmosphere is not for everyone. Some individuals prefer to stay hidden in the mix of students around them. However, if you are a prospective college student who enjoys being known by your professors, being involved in the college community, and interacting with your peers, then Huntingdon College is the place for you."
Sophomore,4,Huntingdon is like a big family. Of course that means drama and everyone knows everything but it also means that there is a crowd of people that care about you and your mental health and are ready for you to receive help.
Junior,4,Huntingdon is like home. Everybody is wonderful and treats you like family. I have loved my experience at Huntingdon overall.
Sophomore,4,"Huntingdon College is a college that wants you to succeed in any future you want. There is a friendly environment on board to help with essays and tutoring. The small campus feel makes every closer. Class sizes are no bigger than 28 students. There are many programs to study from Business, Art, History, Religious Studies to Sport Management.  There are also many clubs and intramural sports to provide students with a needed spark. The campus is surronded by a close-knit community in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. The only complaint is to have better Wi-Fi."
Freshman,4,"I came to Huntingdon to play basketball for them.  So far, I am enjoying my classes and especially the size of them.  I have a better relationship with my fellow students and instructor and am getting to know quite a few people.  If I have to change anything about this school, it would be to increase the size of the dorm rooms (they are really small) and incorporate private bathrooms instead of community bathrooms.  Also, I would like to reduce the cost of this school as it is very expensive!"
Junior,4,What I like most about Huntingdon College is that I am more than just a number there. My professors know me by name and are more than willing to go out of their way to help me succeed. The student body and its staff are close-knit. Huntingdon College is basically one big family!
Freshman,4,"What I like about Huntingdon, is all the people are friendly and will interact with you to make it fill like home."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Huntingdon College so far has been absolutely wonderful. The teachers are extremely helpful. The college all around is a place of diversity and prosperity.
Freshman,4,"School officials are incredibly nice, the buildings are beautiful, and everyone is welcome.  The campus is old and some of the facilities are more outdated than others. The campus is small which is good if you do not care for larger schools or long walks to class. They work with everyone, so no matter your grades or financial status they will do their best to make sure you get the college experience you've always dreamed of."
Niche User,4,I came to spirit camp and honor band this year and really enjoyed the campus. The food was great. The housing was good and the over all atmosphere of the college was amazing.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a huge part of Huntingdon College. Students who participate have a higher GPA than those who do not!
College Freshman,4,"I love the school, and the students. I feel at home every time I am on campus!"
College Junior,4,The dorms are great. It gives you that closeness environment that everyone needs. We have a chance to know each other on a personal level
College Student,4,"the degree earned from this school is of high prestige, especially in the medical field. The school prides itself in there medical related majors and have a 98% placement rate after graduation."
College Student,4,"Courses are very informative, there is a nice workload; however it is manageable. The professors are very helpful, especially since the classes are small. They will help you if you are behind or if you don't understand something. They are definitely there for you, not just a paycheck."
College Student,4,The dorms are very clean and the roommates are all friendly and considerate. There are monthly check-ups of the dorms. It is not a party atmosphere which is wonderful and always time for quiet study time.
College Student,4,Honestly I don't know much about the Greek life at my institution.
College Student,4,"The athletics are very important to the school, everyone is treated as if they are family; however, academics still come first. Athletes have study time and the professors work with them."
College Student,4,"It is a very small with a beautiful campus and extremely friendly people, both students and professors."
College Student,4,The Greek life is pretty low-key at Huntingdon college
College Freshman,4,"The school works really hard to educate us about the importance of safety, but also works extremely hard to prevent such matters from happening."
College Freshman,4,"Basically the whole school shows up for athletic events. The school sends out mass emails reminding everyone to go, and sometimes they turn showing up to games and supporting into volunteering events, called ""Red Pride Nights"", where everyone who goes has to donate things such as clothes, canned foods, or school supplies to donate."
Recent Alumnus,4,A degree from Huntingdon will definitely prepare you for a career. The acceptance rate into graduate schools is very high!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Greek Life at Huntingdon is much different than you would find at other institutions. the Greek Community here if caused on scholarship, philanthropy, and leadership. Huntingdon is a dry campus, which makes parties difficult to have, but this is the essence of what Greek Communities were supposed to be. If you are looking for a Hollywood type Greek experience this is not for you."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I absolutely loved my experience at Huntingdon. Now, of course there were times I was not happy, but overall I would do it all over again."
College Freshman,4,The only thing I know about Greek life on campus are there are party Frats and working Frats. The working Frats are full of great people with great attitudes toward each other. And we all know what the party frats are full of.
College Freshman,4,"I played football for half the year, but was forced to quit for personal reasons. The guys still would help me whenever i would need it. Being a non-athletic scholarship school the facilities are almost forced to be subpar. The people who play sports at this school play with more heart than any other college in the country, I would bet my life on it."
College Freshman,4,"Tremendous school, great and beautiful campus, great and beautiful students, and excellent professors. My only issue is the cost of tuition; I would expect for the facilities to be a bit more updated."
College Sophomore,4,There is plenty of security presence on campus at all times. I feel extremely safe walking to and from classes and buildings throughout the entire campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The classes offered are very relevant to colleges across the country I would assume. I like the smaller class sizes that Huntington provides. You definitely feel more like a person and not just a number at a smaller campus like mine. It's nice to have a personal relationship with professors and staff. I love that the staff, up to the President and Vice President know you by name and know what you are studying. My only wish would be that there were more opportunities for the students who don't live on campus to intermingle more with those that do. Perhaps more student interaction outside of the classroom during the day. Overall I feel that the classes are relevant to what I want to study in the long run and that Huntington gives me an excellent opportunity to get into the graduate school that I most would like to attend, and that they will help me in any way to do that."
College Sophomore,4,"The school that I attend has a great small campus atmosphere and I feel like all the students are known, not just numbers, to the faulty and staff. Access to professors is relatively easy and they are usually available whenever you need to ask a question or get clarification on anything. I like the small class sizes and that everyone seems to work together for the common good of the school as well as the individuals."
College Sophomore,4,Teacher/Student ratio. The football Coaching staff and academic program.
College Junior,4,We are a very diverse campus and very accepting as a majority.
College Junior,4,I am a psychology major. We only have one advisor but she is the best. The program is hard but worth the effort put in.
College Junior,4,"Professors, curriculum, registration process, workload and study areas are all great. Professors challenge you but with the best of intentions."
College Junior,4,"Campus quality is great. There's always somewhere to study, hangout, and fun things going on especially spring semester."
College Junior,4,"If I could do it all over again I would. What makes Huntingdon unique is the feeling you get when you go home for the summer, you miss it. It becomes part of you and you become part of them. When people graduate most still come back to visit. Professors will see you in a store and come up and are genuinely eager to hear how you are."
College Junior,4,Huntingdon has some challenging classes. It is small in number but the experience is worth the cost. Professors for the most part are always there for you no matter what you need. Class style is fast paced.
College Junior,4,Huntingdon has an exceptionally high admission rate to graduate school. Huntingdon is known and thought highly of in the south.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus and issues of violence and sexual assault is almost non existing issues.
College Junior,4,"Greek life is a huge part of the social atmosphere. Most of the students who attend are in a fraternity or sorority, They put in many hours of community service. Greeks are friendly towards non-Greeks. Greeks hold many leadership positions."
College Junior,4,The cost of off-campus dining is affordable for college students and convnient driving distance. So much variety for all types of people.
College Junior,4,The campus strictness is great. Huntingdon has a very safe environment and are concerned with academics.
College Junior,4,Most every student recieves a scholarship and I recieved half of my tutition for being in their marching band. It helped tremendously.
College Junior,4,The cost of living is higher because it is a private school. The doorms are clean and the social atmosphere is safe. The campus is small and convienent.
College Sophomore,4,"The Chemistry department is great, very caring"
College Sophomore,4,Would not trade my professors for any other
College Sophomore,4,Even though small my professors make it better for me
College Sophomore,4,"Love my major professors, they work well with me"
College Sophomore,4,Every greek organization deserve houses not only 2
College Sophomore,4,Lots of options to choose from
College Freshman,4,Rules are enforced at a good level.
College Freshman,4,They do a great job of preparing students for the workplace and finding job placement.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are only a few options of organizations to join, but each is a unique group of individuals who care for one another."
Recent Alumnus,4,football team is the most important part of the fall semester
Freshman,2,"Online learning should not be done again. It is not school and there is no learning with online. Academically, it is easy to cheat and by doing everything online there is no level of learning with a minimal level of contact with teachers. You canâ€™t learn anything from online courses and many assignments donâ€™t equate to the ability to understand and learn the material."
Freshman,2,"The college is okay but the woman's soccer head coach 2017-18 season is a total disaster.  He over recruits,  has anger issues, and acts like a dope.   If you have a general question or need help, don't expect it.  Instead, prepare to be insulted, called names, and belittled."
College Sophomore,2,I would prefer the teachers be more hands on and more worried about their students.
College Sophomore,2,"Quality of food is not good, need better options"
College Junior,2,"My school does not allow students to live off campus until they are 21, married, or have a child. This is very frustrating and makes some students feel as if they are being held captive because they are not allowed to choose where they live, but simply who they live with (and even some times this isn't guaranteed). Those who qualify to live off campus are sometimes not even able to because of the limited availability and safe neighborhoods in the area."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally do not like having to eat dining hall food. If I could afford to do so, I would eat off campus more. As far as having no money and cost, the dining hall is an excellent option. The food is not always bad but there is hardly a time in which I am excited to go and eat there. They do not have much of a variety. This year is better than last year though."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life offers fun events on campus as well as off. There is no separate housing for students in a fraternity or sorority although a few houses resemble a frat house. There are always parties to attend if you like but are no looked at differently if that is not your scene.
College Freshman,2,its a gym where the basketball team has their home game with a dust weight room and a small game/lounge room!!
College Sophomore,2,montgomery may be huge but the things to do dies after 6:00 PM
College Freshman,2,"The freshman girls dorm at Huntingdon are not horrible. The building is old, but we do have free wifi and cleaning ladies but the thing is the space here is not ideal."
College Junior,2,"There Is Not Much Variation for a Reason â€“ On race/ethnicity there are few that fall out of the range of caucasian. And as far as political beliefs: most tend to be liberal. And since Huntingdon College is a Methodist college that automatically answers the religion question. And because of that if you believe anything else you are pretty much condemned because of it, so I've learned to keep my mouth shut."
College Junior,2,"There Is Not Much to Do Unless You Have Money â€“ Being a college student for most means living off very little and also usually means not having superfluous money to squander here and there. So for these college students there are few options already, but when you attend Huntingdon these options are lowered again due to the limited number of things there are to do in this town."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug/Alcohol Infested. I don't know of but maybe 10 people at HC that don't either drink or do some kind of drug on a regular basis. Although it's technically a 'dry' campus, that means nothing. However, the peer pressure is not there. Everyone's perfectly fine with those that don't drink and they still go to the parties and have fun."
College Freshman,2,"Limited Choices â€“ Can only live off-campus if married, over 21, or live with your parents."
College Freshman,2,More Boys Then Girls â€“ The guy:girl ratio is pretty bad. Most of the parties I have been too were full of guys
College Student,2,Greek life at Huntingdon doesn't dominate. No one forces you to join a sorority.
College Freshman,2,Huntingdon College's policies regarding drinking are very strict. The college is a completely dry campus but that is set to change very soon. Also the visitation policies in the dorms are strict but this due more to RA abuse of power more than it is college policies.
College Freshman,2,"College Life Experience â€“ It is a small campus, but the social atmosphere is minimal, with very little campus activities that are fun. The dorms are nice, but the internet is very unreliable. The school is private so the cost is high, but the references and education is worth it. Very little range for food on campus is available; just a dining hall and local coffee shop."
College Student,2,Not Great but Filling â€“ well it is all you can eat but the question is how much of it are you willing to eat. the food is not bad for you it just does not have much in the flavor department
College Junior,2,"VERY limited options on dining on campus. The dining hall is usually not very good, and the options are not of very good quality most of the time. It is very hard to be healthy, and the cafe option, Java City, is not always stocked or machines are broken. Fast food and grocery stores are very convenient and close by campus. Students are robbed by being forced to buy meal plans, and then unused money disappears. It's hard to use all your money when you don't want to eat at the unsatisfying options on campus. The dining hall needs more funds to provide better quality and healthier food for students."
Sophomore,1,"Listen and listen closely. HUNTINGDON COLLEGE IS A WHOLE JOKE. Facilities are falling apart, most proffessors aren't even PHD certified, most sports besides football are awful, the classes are so easy they are a joke, nobody outside of Alabama has even heard of huntingdon. The tuition plus room and board is over 30,000 dollars a year?? You can't live up off campus until you're 21 and you pay over 8,000 dollars a year for housing when apartments are around 6k. The food is awful, the people are even worse. There is little to no diversity in most classes and you see the same people EVERY DAY."
College Sophomore,1,"To be honest only a few teachers actually care about their students. It seems as though when you first enter the college, it has a beautiful face. When you are actually engulfed in its claws, it shows its true nature. I had a problem with bullying in high school, I was made fun of a lot. I enjoyed orientation but classes were different..... no one actually cares about you and your problems. I have had a lot happen to me this year and instead of being a part of the family, I feel like Cinderella with no happy ending"
College Sophomore,1,Students deserve a better facility to work out in
College Sophomore,1,It is a dry campus
College Sophomore,1,Not fair with giving then taking money away
College Junior,1,"Because my school is affiliated with the United Methodist church, we are a dry campus. This can sometimes be annoying because we are college students. Most freshmen get to college and the first thing they want to do is have a drink because that is what college is cracked up to be on movies. However, at Huntingdon, even if you go off campus to a party, sometimes the administration becomes involved. This is annoying because it is not their place since it was not on school grounds. Dorm visiting hours are also annoying because they end very early in the evening. It makes you feel as if you are still being treated as a child when we should be being treated as adults."
College Sophomore,1,"Although the school provides the students with laptops, the internet connection on campus is the worst. I have personally had a lot of trouble with mine and cannot seem to connect to the internet even off campus. The internet either does not work at all or it is extremely slow. There are not any computer labs per say but there are some computers available to students in the library, which also offers free printing. But even in the library sometimes there are issues with internet connection. Overall I would say that the internet connection, whether you own your own router or have to use ethernet cord, is unreliable."
College Senior,1,Parking on campus is one of the things that Huntingdon College needs to fix.  There are limited parking spaces and we are getting more and more students each year.
College Freshman,1,huntingdon is a dry campus and the RA's are very serious about their job.
College Junior,1,"Almost Everyone Is There on Scholarship but Is Required to Live on Campus â€“ Huntingdon is good about giving out scholarships to almost everyone that attends. The average is a half-tuition scholarship, which would be great if they didn't require you to live on campus in order to maintain scholarship status. With the half-tuition scholarship awarding around $10,000 and on campus stay costing $8,000, the discount seems rather minimal. It is understandable to have high costs at a private institution, but making up for the rest of the cost is difficult for some people since scholarships are not stackable."
College Junior,1,"Parking Is Hardly a Viable Option â€“ There is not a transportation service at all, though Huntingdon is not large enough for a bus system to be necessary. There are large vans available for off campus activities and the like, which works just fine. But the parking available to the students is atrocious. We are limited to certain areas that are not convenient to where the class (freshman,sophomore,junior,senior) lives. And on top of that there is not enough parking for upperclassmen. Most have to park on the street or even off campus and often at times at the risk of getting a ticket."
College Junior,1,"Lackluster Internet Connection and Computer Technology â€“ The internet connection is not reliable, which makes researching and writing papers extremely difficult. The email server, which professors rely on in order to get in contact with students and vice versa, is constantly crashing after little strain. Finally, for those without a printer the library is available for free printing, however there are hardly ever any open computers available."
College Sophomore,1,there isa bad parking problem on campus. unless you are a freshman girl or a senior do not expect to park anywhere near your dorm.

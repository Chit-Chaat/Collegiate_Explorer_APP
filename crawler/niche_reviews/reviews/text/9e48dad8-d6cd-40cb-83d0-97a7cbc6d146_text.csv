Sophomore,5,"I like the community that is built every academic year in that you are not just another student, and part of something bigger."
Freshman,5,"Spring Arbor University is a wonderful four year, liberal arts, Christian, private university in Michigan. It offers a wide range of majors with a wonderful faculty. The best part about this school is that it really focuses on cultivating community between students and between students and faculty. The professors here genuinely care about your well being. The class sizes are small so you receive one-on-one attention quite often. My favorite part about SAU thus far has been COR100, which is a required course your first semester of freshmen year. In this course, you are paired with roughly twenty other freshmen. I met my two best friends through COR100, and am so thankful at how important community is to my school. We have fun student events constantly happening and a booming athletic department, so there's always some sport to be watching.Overall, I would highly recommend Spring Arbor University to anyone looking to get a liberal arts degree from a small school."
Alum,5,I am very grateful for my college experience and my professors who helped me and took time to tell of their real world work experiences.
Niche User,5,Very pretty school with a nice comfortable feel. I love everything about it. The only thing I wish it had was more privacy.
Niche User,5,"When I went and visited Spring Arbor University, it totally changed what I thought about the university. When you take a personalized tour with them, you get your own parking space, meet with your own rep, take an hour long tour of the campus, and get to meet with your advisor for the major that you want. It was amazing how personalized and in depth they took it!!"
Niche User,5,I really loved the community at Spring Arbor. The faculty go out of their way to make you feel loved and important. They are constantly there for you throughout all of life.
Niche User,5,I love how the campus is small and everyone is super friendly. The only thing that could be improved is the food.
Freshman,5,"I am very grateful for the people and community of Spring Arbor. While nothing and no where will ever be perfect, I can most certainly say my spiritual and personal life was challenged in amazing ways. I greatly appreciate the amazing student development team that so lovingly listened and invested in me all four years. Upon reflection on my time so for at SAU, I would have to consider almost every class and professor I had to have been top-notch and while I didn't always agree with everything (which is in my opinion a good thing because it is dangerous if we are seeking 100% agreement), it was coming from a place of openness, authenticity, and a passion for Christ-like love. Thanks SAU for all you did and do and for the prayer you pour into the community. I wish I could do a personal shout out to everyone that God used to impact my life at SAU but the list would be far too long! Blessings!"
Alum,5,"I LOVED my four years at Spring Arbor University! I met my best friends for life. I love the concentration of academics and strong encouragement from all the faculty. I was planning to go to grad school after college and I felt very prepared and so did all of my friends. Honestly, I wish I used more of their resources, but I do not regret anything else."
Junior,5,I love the professors! The Professors add so much value to Spring Arbor University. They really get to know you. I am apart of the business school and they consistently will reach out with opportunities they think you could benefit from.
Freshman,5,"Small Town University with Big City feel, while still maintaining the feelings of being at home with family and friends.  Strong Christian based fundamentals are taught here."
Junior,5,Very friendly and caring school choice that allows for fast and obtainable degrees through the Zoom program that is used with the online students.
Freshman,5,I am just at the beginning stages of my college experience with Spring Arbor University.  Everyone has been so very helpful in creating a satisfy experience.
Sophomore,5,This college is amazing. Every student is involved and included even if they commute. Everyone is taught everything with a Christian perspective. The instructors care and do what they can when someone needs help. The student life is great there are so many events and groups you can go to or join. It's an awesome place to go.
Alum,5,"I transferred into Spring Arbor, as I felt the prior State school that I attended did not suit the my academic, spiritual, or personal needs. From the moment I toured SAU, I knew I was ""home"". I felt incredibly welcomed, and I felt as though I was actually wanted there by the fellow students and faculty. Because it is a smaller school, professors were easy to get in touch with and quick to offer extra help if needed."
Junior,5,"Spring Arbor University is a small liberal arts, private educational Christian institute. Things I would love to see change is the respect and involvement for LGBT Students that are on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love this college. It has great sports, academics, variety, and people. The staff are very involved with the students."
Freshman,5,"Spring Arbor University excels in providing outstanding educational opportunities to students by employing excellent professors who are extremely dedicated to their students, and setting up academic ""extras"" such as group experiences and international trips that truly make it learning about life, as well as a career.  I would love additional extra-curricular opportunities provided, as it is a relatively small campus in a very small community."
Senior,5,I love my night accelerated classes the teachers are always helpful and responsive during the week if I have questions.  I am planning on continuing my education here after I graduate in October.
Junior,5,"The professors at Spring Arbor really care about their students. They go out of their way to help in any way they can. The professors take their time to fully explain what they are teaching to make sure everyone understands. Grading is fair. Spring Arbor has a good reputation with employers, from what I have heard."
Junior,5,"Spring Arbor University provides a community that allows students to grow together and build friendships that will last a lifetime. The campus is filled with genuine people whether that be the students, professors, coaches, etc. Also a very safe campus to be on."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the wonderful community that is present at Spring Arbor University - there are so many opportunities to build relationships here. I truly cannot imagine myself attending college anywhere else.
Niche User,5,"The environment simply put, is home. Everyone knows everyone and it is a wonderful atmosphere to learn and grow in Iâ€™m so glad I chose spring arbor"
Sophomore,5,Professors are so knowledgeable in their fields. They really connect with their students and try to get to know every single one.
Freshman,5,This is an unapologetic Christian University. The community is great. I have formed the best friends that I could have ever asked for in the two months that I have been here. I have no complaints about this school. God is at the center of this campus and my life has changed because of this place.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone at SAU is very invested and is willing to go above and beyond to help students succeed. There is a strong sense of community, and people treat each other like family. There is just something different about SAU that makes it feel like home."
Graduate Student,5,"I am a distance learner through Spring Arbor. I love the online learning environment and managing my homework and study time on my own. The instructors have been helpful in providing clear instructions and examples to follow for assignments. Overall, I'd recommend this university to others."
Freshman,5,"Great athletics, beautiful campus, home town safe atmosphere.  The staff is very helpful.  Large variety of foods in the cafeteria."
Sophomore,5,Spring Arbor University is a wonderful place to attend college.  They do a great job of walking with the students and giving us practical hands on experience in the field.
College Sophomore,5,On campus I see lots of people from different ethnicities and even religious backgrounds getting along.
College Freshman,5,drugs or alcohol are not allowed
College Freshman,5,I have yet to experience the courses since I am an incoming freshman for the fall semester of 2016 but I have already seen my schedule and talked with numerous of my professors and I can say that I am very excited to dig into the courses and learn all I can from what my advisors and professors have prepared for me and my learning abilities. I do know that the class sizes are evenly decided and the student to teacher ratio is 15:1 so we are able to have an easier time and get a closer connection with fellow students and with our teachers/professors.
College Freshman,5,It is a safe-zone for us students but it is also a place that is shaping us for the real world and engaging in any type of situations we may come upon. Campus safety is very helpful and cares about they students and faculty. There is extremely low campus crime.
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to experience life on campus but I am extremely excited to test it out and experience ""dorm life""."
College Freshman,5,"The environment is very welcoming and Christ-centered. Everyone on campus is very kind and helpful, no matter the situations. On my first visit to Spring Arbor University I was warmly welcomed by students, faculty, and other fellow incoming freshmen. I was given a chance to meet and talk with professors and engaged in useful and memorable conversations with them, the atmosphere while in contact with the professors was especially unique. They helped with my questions, concerns, and planning my future at SAU. When I was choosing colleges, Spring Arbor University was not even on my radar, I had heard about it but had my eye on other colleges that are similar but when I visited the Spring Arbor website, I immediately felt a connecting and knew that I was meant to attend and earn my degree from there. The admissions team and advisors went beyond lengths to help me and get everything in order fro me to attend and join the Spring Arbor University community this coming fall.

What I think makes Spring Arbor University unique is their eagerness to help students gain confidence and encourage them in they're journey to becoming apart of society and growing in their spiritual faith and walk with God. They have a servant's heart and a Christ-centered mindset that is very different and amazing when compared to other colleges. 

I am very eager to become a member of the Spring Arbor community and begin my journey towards growing in my walk with the Lord and gaining my degree in the medical field."
College Freshman,5,"I am so glad that I am at Spring Arbor University. The professors truly care about their students' success and are very helpful. They are also very knowledgeable and have a lot of experience in their fields of study. The community at SAU is great. The small size means that a student can get to know almost everyone and be involved in many different extracurricular activities. A Christian worldview is also a part of every aspect of the university, including chapel, classes, dorm floors, and student events."
College Sophomore,5,The community at Spring Arbor is above and beyond most university experiences. It is truly a family atmosphere on campus. Most people are welcoming and selfless. Professors embrace opportunities to spend time with students out of class.
College Sophomore,5,Spring Arbor is very safe.There's never ever a problem here. Campus safety does an adequate job with keep campus safe.
College Sophomore,5,My Accounting/CPA degree will set me apart from others and employment will be easy. We have one of the best pass rates for the CPA and one of the best accounting programs around.
College Sophomore,5,The courses are great! The professors really care about you. The Christian community and Christ Centeredness is thee best part!
College Sophomore,5,"This school has been so great! There's nothing to complain about, the Christian community is absolutely phenomenal! The professors care about you and your well-being. Everyone is very nice!"
College Freshman,5,Campus safety plays a big role in Spring Arbor's safety. They are available at all hours and are promptly there for the students.
College Freshman,5,"They make sure you have career opportunities outside of college. If you are a ministry major, you intern for three years during school and all other majors intern for a semester. They help you gain work experience and help you into work post graduation."
College Freshman,5,Spring Arbor's teachers are supportive and care for the students. The courses are challenging and thought-provoking. The classes are a good size and various courses are offered.
College Freshman,5,I live in Gainey Hall and I absolutely love it. The atmosphere is great and the utilities work well.
College Freshman,5,Spring Arbor University is an excellent school. I am a freshman this year and I cannot see myself anywhere else for the next few years. The teachers are approachable and helpful and the school takes good care of it's students. I am so grateful for all Spring Arbor offers.
College Freshman,5,The campus security are the best because they are always patrolling the campus and making sure everything is good. They even make sure that guys and girls are out of each other's lobbies by 2 am just the like the school has addressed.
College Freshman,5,I'm a freshmen right now and the advisors around campus have been trying to get freshmen like myself lined up with internships and jobs from the very first day we arrived on campus. I believe this school wants nothing but the best for us and that's why they push us to get linked up with internships and jobs.
College Freshman,5,The dorms at my school are actually bigger than I thought they would be; there is enough room were I could bring 10 friends in with their own chair and have a tournament on the Xbox or PlayStation.
College Freshman,5,I can't imagine a better situation for health and safety that allows this much freedom and enjoyment.
College Freshman,5,"Proffesors really care and will work with you, even if you have a hard time understanding them at first"
College Freshman,5,All the dorms have great social and hygenic atmosheres. Great experience.
College Freshman,5,All campus crimes are dealt with if found out. I feel very safe.
College Freshman,5,Winning the girl's soccer nationals basically explains the hard work that goes into the athletics at my school.
College Sophomore,5,I love being able to attend a university where religion and education are combined.
College Junior,5,The schedule works perfectly being a mom and pregnant
College Freshman,5,No alcohol which is awesome!
College Freshman,5,"We have a place in downtown Jackson Michigan called ""city crepes"". It is a small mom and pop place located conveniently within the downtown area. There prices are average for crepes and are extremely delicious serving both meat and dessert options. The atmosphere is wonderful and the location is great too."
College Freshman,5,"Our dinning commons are set up in a very modern and comfortable manor with many different styles of setting and atmosphere across the commons. Eating in either of the windowed rooms are great places to see campus and nature all in one. The variety from the dinning commons has everything from pasta, salads, fresh sandwiches or panino, to home cooked styled meals. We are able to use our flew dollars in a secondary meal option called the cougar den, as well as another lunch option called Ada's kitchen (similar to a Panera Bread). We can purchase both meal and candy at both secondary options, and purchase other meals such as pizza, wings, or wraps. We have many different menus as well as timely options on campus for meals."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus at Spring Arbor allows you to experience great growth as an individual as well as within a great community. The experience living on campus makes a great different both for events and classes. Knowing who is in your dorms or living areas is vital to maintaining good friends and knowing who else is in your classes and walking around on campus. Although you may not know everyone in your dorms name, you will know their face and be able to say ""hi"" and give them a smile when you see them around campus or in the dorms. Applying for housing is very simple on the student website as well as the form that you must fill out to live on or off campus. The best option for community is to live in the residence halls. There are multiple events and clubs set up within these as well as intramurals and floor bible studies."
Sophomore,4,It is a great school! All of my classes are absolutely wonderful. The only downfall with this school is how much it costs.
Sophomore,4,"When SAU went online due to Corona, they did their absolute best to put all of their classes online. Some classes were better than others due to the fact most of the professors had never taught an online class before. They were very understanding and worked very closely with the students to still provide the best education they possibly could."
Senior,4,Most of my online learning was due to covid-19 and the professors did a wonderful job of transitioning to all online classes.
Senior,4,I have enjoyed the time I have spent at Spring Arbor. I have loved all of my Professors so far because they get to know their students and genially want to help them succeed. Overall they have created a tight knit community on their campus. My only complaint would be the price and how financial add is run.
Sophomore,4,All of us had to finish online due to the circumstances. That did not stop the faculty from doing a great job in transferring from face-to-face to the online format to get the most out of the times.
Junior,4,I would like to see more students attending on campus.  I would also like to see a turf baseball field.
Freshman,4,I have loved my time at Spring Arbor. The student life is great and all my professors have been fantastic.  The only problem I have run into was with creating an individualized major. The university is phasing out that academic track so I either would have to change my major or transfer schools.
Sophomore,4,"Fantastic community and values.  This university thrives off its student inclusiveness.  SAU may be lacking in several departments education wise, but they do a great job bringing students together and teaching the liberal arts."
Junior,4,"I play sports and really enjoy my coach and the team.  The atmosphere on campus is great.  As a PA, I love having the chance to make a difference in helping the incoming freshman."
Freshman,4,I have loved getting know the campus and everyone at Spring Arbor. Everyone on the campus is incredibly kind and helpful! The professors are always there to answer a question or guide you in what to do next. The students are amazing and the amount of activities offered on campus allow you to meet all kinds of different people. This university generally cares for its students and I am so happy that I will be attending here.
Alum,4,"If you are interested in getting an education from a smaller, faith-affiliated school, then I would recommend attending Spring Arbor University. The professors are great and being at a smaller school allows you to get to know them better. Getting a liberal arts education was valuable, as I found myself learning about a variety of topics. That along with the cross cultural requirement broadened my perspective and encouraged me to think critically."
Freshman,4,Spring Arbor University is a small school that is open to its community. It is good for students who do not want to be overwhelmed on campus and lost in a vastness of students in a class.
Alum,4,My experience at Spring Arbor University was a great one! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the time the professors take for each individual. They are there for you. The thing I would like to see change most is financial assistance.
Junior,4,"spring arbor university is a small college with the best of everything. The atmosphere, the professors, the students etc etc etc...they have a wonderful Christian based background and it makes me feel so comfortable when away from home"
Sophomore,4,"The campus as a whole is beautiful. If you are looking for a smaller Christian University, this is the place to be. The small classroom setting allows for a more personal student-professor relationship; you can tell they really do care about your education. The worship chapels are amazing and a great break from the stress of school."
Niche User,4,Everyone is so nice and welcoming! Didn't have a better visit to a college than Spring Arbor! A college you have to visit!
Senior,4,I am in an online program at Spring Arbor. I have all online classes lasting seven weeks followed by a one week break. My time at SAU is flying by because of the compressed class schedule. The programs are very user friendly and accessible for working adults with family's.
Junior,4,I enjoy the idea of attending a Christian organization where you are free to learn in a biblical atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,"Spring Arbor University is a small university, but the community on this campus is unreal. I have never experienced this type of community among college-aged people before. Also, most of the professors are awesome with a a bunch of knowledge that they want to give us and help us understand. Some of the professors are amazing mentors also. It is not uncommon for a student and professor to have a more meaningful relationship with one another than a normal college (not in an inappropriate way!). Most of the faculty and staff are there because they want students to grow intellectually, sociable, and most important, spiritually."
Senior,4,"Classes are a small size, so they are great for receiving personal attention and help from instructors. It is a great atmosphere and student body. The campus could be more accommodating towards those with physical handicaps or disabilities."
Graduate Student,4,"They call me way too much but overall, I am happy with taking courses online for my graduate degree with Spring Arbor University. The professors are kind and so are my fellow peers."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Spring Arbor University, though it has put me nearly $140,000 in debt by the time of my graduation. The school is located in a VERY small town with not much to do, but we rally school spirit for sporting events and annual school traditions. If you decide to come to SAU, you will be here for the academics, not the party scene. We have top-notch professors and small class sizes that allows students to really develop a passion for the course content."
Sophomore,4,Spring Arbor University is a place where community thrives. Learning is integrated with Faith there are no boundaries on what is studied. Campus life is meaningful and full of loving community.
Junior,4,"Spring Arbor provides small class sizes, amazing professors who are invested in their students, and great community! Attending here is one of the best decisions I've made!"
Freshman,4,Spring Arbor University is a community. This university truly values community and values each individual student.
Junior,4,"I absolutely loved going to SAU, the classes were great. However, my financial aid wasn't covering all my costs and I was owing around $1000 a semester. I had to drop out because I couldn't afford $350 a month payments."
Senior,4,I have always loved being here. The professors are unique in that they genuinely care about their students. They are intentional about building relationships with students and their offices are open for both academic and personal discussion.
Junior,4,"I went to main campus for my first two years, then entered into the global program in order to cut costs (it allows me to commute only a half hour from home while also working full time). During my main campus time, I lived in Muffit and majored as psych/social work. I loved most of my profs and felt genuinely cared for by them. Though the facilities in my dorm were not altogether reliable, the small community of women I lived with made it worth choosing a second year. I also made close friends with my CORE group, and a few others. I cherished those friendships, and still do. The academic advisers are also so helpful and generous with their time and knowledge. The staff really is intentional with students.  
The reason that I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that I feel SAU encourages some stereotypes about different groups of people, particularly men and women, which perpetuates some obstructions toward growing as an individual.  Meal plans are also not ideal."
Sophomore,4,"Attending Spring Arbor University has so far been a very good experience for me. The campus is very safe, and the small class sizes mean that the teachers are very hands-on with their students and unlike other university teachers they seem to actually care about the performance and behavior of their students. I hope that my good experiences continue into my next few years at SAU, and I see little reason why they will not."
Freshman,4,Great experience. The professors are very helpful with excellent resources.  This school does not only teaches academic but also Christian values.
Freshman,4,"SAU is a great place to learn in a small town, with small classes. Everyone here  is super friendly and you will make many new friends. As for the academic part I wish they had more options for majors."
Junior,4,"Spring Arbor University is the perfect small school. The people here are awesome. If you want a place where you can walk across campus and know 10 out of the 20 people that you just walked past, this is the place for you. The professors care about you and your education, and about what you are doing as a student to further your experience in the classroom. Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option! Our CORE program does a really good job of getting new students hooked up with a student mentor and a group of fellow classmates from the first day on campus. You get to grow with this group and you might find that some of those people will be your good friends."
Sophomore,4,"I like the community at Spring Arbor University. The students, staff, and professors are kind and become great friends instantly. The classes are challenging but small class size allows for one-on-one help from the professor, and you easily get to know the other students in the class. My biggest complaint for the school is as a Spanish major. They have not yet hired a full-time Spanish professor, and that has taken a toll on the students studying Spanish, including myself. Other than that, I have been happy at Spring Arbor University."
College Sophomore,4,"It is such a small school and town that it is very hard to get strong support to athletic events, however the students do their best to support teams and create a great atmosphere.  The better teams clearly get better support.  For example, over the past few years the men's and women's soccer teams have done tremendously well and their home games are always hugely attended.  The basketball team, which has struggled in the past few years, does not get quite the same support.  This also shows in the fact that the gymnasium is also a little outdated, while the soccer field is one of the best surfaces in the Midwest."
College Sophomore,4,My program preps for licensure and is now CACREP!
College Sophomore,4,The cohort experience is a wonderful asset
College Junior,4,I have been very impressed with the academics at the school.
College Junior,4,There is a great diversity on campus with ethnicity and international students.
College Junior,4,The courses are very helpful and can be applied to any career.
College Junior,4,A degree from Spring Arbor is well recognized and the school helps you find possible jobs.
College Junior,4,Have had only a few safety incidents on campus.
College Freshman,4,We don't have Greek Life
College Freshman,4,I myself am not an athlete but the whole student body supports and participates in school spirit and encouraging the athletes and teams. Several of the sport teams have achieved many goals and holds numerous championships and titles. I thoroughly enjoy the athletic atmosphere and everything that comes with it.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is nice and wants to make sure you are doing well.
College Senior,4,The global campus allows for adults to return to obtain a degree in a timeline that is convenient and they offer experts in the field to teach the classes.
College Freshman,4,This school is great when it comes to professors and the availability of courses on campus.
College Freshman,4,The school is overall good with its students. The faculty are very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,The housing that I live in is great. There's nothing to complain about. The housing offers a great sense of community.
College Senior,4,The professors have been great
College Senior,4,I have not had the opurtunity ti have one on one with Greek life
College Junior,4,"For the most part I feel safe on campus. Campus security had always felt helpful and accessible, however the campus is very close to Jackson, so it is safest not to go running around alone at night, especially if no one know where you are."
College Junior,4,"I've really enjoyed a good number of my classes and am always excited at the beginning of the semester to start my new courses so I can learn more. (Yes, I realize how nerdy that sounds)."
College Junior,4,"I think my school is exceptionally unique in that, at least in the communication department, the professors actually care about your education. For example, I never miss class but I came down with strep throat so had to skip one of my night classes. Because my professor knew how much I was dedicated to learning the material, he recorded me a lecture video on the side with all the information we had covered that night. This is the kind of things that happen at Spring Arbor."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a great school with great community. If you put the effort into college, it will be worth it in the long run. I would do it over again if i had to!"
Recent Alumnus,4,Athletes are friendly to everyone and aren't stand-offish to others.
College Freshman,4,Spring Arbor offers great athletic programs and scholarships for the athletes.
College Freshman,4,"The curriculum is good because when the professors hand out the syllabus, that lets you know exactly what you will be doing the entire semester. In my opinion it's up to the student to figure out how they will approach the assignments and how well they will do in the class."
College Freshman,4,"In my first semester of college I enjoyed my courses because they made me think outside of the box and gave me a challenge. Yes, there were a course or two I didn't enjoy at first, but once I kept putting my best effort into the course I began to enjoy the course. All in all, at the end of the semester I personally went up to the professors and thanked them for teaching me and telling them how much I appreciated them."
College Freshman,4,"My school athletic teams might not have the best of records, but the athletic teams brings the campus together and gives everyone the chance to take a break out of studying and doing homework."
College Freshman,4,There is always some athletic event to go to that will at least be entertaining because of the competition or enjoyable because we're winning.
Senior,2,"There are some professors who are amazing; and others who are a waste of my tuition. The culture there is very judgmental and bland. There is not a lot of diversity and when anyone speaks out about something they believe in, they are threatened to be expelled. If this wasn't the only four year school close to home; I would transfer."
Junior,2,"I am entering my second year with Spring Arbor University which has been less than satisfactory. I attend Spring Arbor's School of Education courses through North Central Michigan College's Cohort, the community college in the small city where I live and work full time. Like many others, I am going to school while juggling many other responsibilities. North Central's administration has made this educational journey as easy as they could, but Spring Arbor's administration has failed me over and over. They're impossible to contact, unorganized, and down right unprofessional. If it were'nt for the local adjunct professors they assign to our courses being so amazing I would've switched to a different university long ago."
Alum,2,"I would normally speak very highly of Spring Arbor, until I graduated and was never given a diploma. After contacting the university, I was informed that I had credits missing in order to complete my degree. The registrars office was very informal and rude. They refused to fully acknowledge the situation, and did not take responsibility for for the lack of a strict process that helps students complete their degree and graduate. Since this has happened to me, I have been in conversation with others from the university, and have heard that this (or similar situations) have happened to many of my friends, or friends of friends. I enjoyed my time at Spring Arbor, but this incident left me with an awful distaste for the school. It's unfortunate that I paid an incredible amount of money to attend a university that does not have an organized and professional way of handling credits and the graduation process."
College Freshman,2,Don't know much about it
College Freshman,2,There really are not many places for off-campus dining. And there are zero options past 11 pm
College Freshman,2,We don't have typical college parties. Any good parties are put on by the school.
College Sophomore,2,"there are no parties, but we're all okay with that; this is what we signed up for"
College Senior,2,"Where do I being? This university is very, very strict!!! Guys can't take their t-shirts off outside, open hours are very limited, no alcohol during the school year (on or off campus), no gambling... etc. If you decide to do anything against ""the concept"", there are a lot of rats around campus ready to report you to higher authority! Being a normal person is very difficult, a lot of judging takes place here. I knew it was gonna be strict when I enrolled, but definitely didn't think it'd be this bad!!!"
College Freshman,2,In SA not too many but Jackson is great
College Junior,2,Most students live on campus and are requited too unless they live with parents nearby or are over 22
College Sophomore,2,"The wi-fi is awful. You can only get great speed if you're the only person in the room in a certain position. 
I can't tell you how many times I would be on the internet and my roommate would come in and get on the internet and everything would run extremely slow. "
College Freshman,2,"Most students live on-campus. Your off-campus choices are to live in Jackson, which is a 10-15 minute drive, but where you can find a nice place close to shopping, dining, and other activities...or you can live in Spring Arbor, which puts you close to campus but without close proximity to the aforementioned luxuries. "
College Sophomore,2,I live in one of the older dorms and the printer in the computer lab doesn't work half the time. It also takes a few minutes for the computers to fire up.
College Junior,2,"While permit costs are average, spots are frequently hard to find.
There are a few places but many commuters so students could definately use more parking."
College Sophomore,2,"We sometimes joke that Spring Arbor has it's own personal rain cloud because it just seem to rain a lot! Also, on certain days when the wind is just right, campus smells like a farm...Other than that, it's great. It's a small campus so throughout the winter you never have to walk over 10 minutes in the cold to get from one place to another. When the weather is very nice people are always outside in the plaza doing homework and hanging out."
College Junior,2,"This school is pretty strict.  Girls and boys are hardly ever allowed to be in each other's rooms, unless you live in an apartment or K-house.  Drinking is not allowed whatsoever, but depending on where you live, it's pretty easy to get away with it.  Premarital sex, along with many other types of affection between guys and girls, is prohibited.  Also, you are required to go to chapel frequently--you are only allowed 6 misses per semester."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to do outside of Spring Arbor. The closest large towns are Jackson and Ann Arbor, and while there is more to do in Ann Arbor than Jackson, most do not make the 45-1 hour drive a lot."
College Junior,2,"There are only three places to eat in Spring Arbor outside of the dining commons. If you don't have a vehicle or know someone with a vehicle, you are stuck on campus. The only thing to do here at night is watch movies, do homework, and sleep. However, Spring Arbor has been holding many on campus activities lately in an attempt to make campus life more fun and entertaining."
College Junior,2,"SAU is mostly made up of white, Christian students from middle class families.  The university does try to promote acceptance of ethnic and racial diversity; however, the fact still remains that the campus is predominately homogenous.  There is some diversity among students political beliefs, but the university tend promotes rather conservative ideas.  As for sexual orientation Spring Arbor University does not accept or tolerare any ""diversity"" here. (If you are gay this is not the school for you.)"
College Junior,2,"If you want to live off campus and are under 22, it is harder to live off campus because you have to talk to student development in order for them to approve you living off campus. It depends on who you are living with off campus. If you live at home with your family and decide to commute, then obviously that is no problem. Depending on the scholarships and financial aid you have, it may be cheaper to live on campus anyways. If you are able to live off campus, there are apartments and houses you can rent in the Spring Arbor/Jackson area."
College Junior,1,Don't have any fraternities on campus.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life whatsoever when it comes to SAU.
College Freshman,1,Spring Arbor University does not have a Greek life on campus besides the education Greek society which is barely heard from those who are not in the education program.
College Sophomore,1,Spring Arbor University does not promote or have any Greek Life
College Freshman,1,"We don't have a Greek life, and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing."
College Junior,1,I know nonething about it
College Junior,1,There is no housing for Kalamazoo Spring Arbor location
College Junior,1,There is not much available that I know of
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have a Greek life at all. Since we are a very small campus and Christian orientated, we do not have it at all."
College Freshman,1,The campus security is willing to fine students at the drop of a hat and they are not cheap.  There are no warnings only fines with no explanation.  Mostly it is students working campus security who have too much fun with the authority they have. 
College Sophomore,1,"If you like parties or any type of 'ungodly' type of fun this is not for you. I understand that Spring Arbor is a Christian university but they are exceptionally strict when it comes to parties or any thing of that nature. Even if you are of age, you are not allowed to go to clubs, casinos, drink or buy tobacco. Even if you are at home with your family and it gets back to the university that you broke one of these rules you can get in serious trouble. "
College Sophomore,1,Super strict. Boys and girls can only be in each other rooms at allotted times.
College Sophomore,1,"Spring Arbor is in the middle of no where. You could go to the lake 1.5 miles away, but there is not much there. the only thing close to the school is a pizza joint, McDonalds, and a dollar store. I wish there was more to do around campus, but there is enough to survive."
College Sophomore,1,"we are a dry campus and students have been kicked out for continued substance abuse. They have a grace program that will help you quit if you come to them first and tell them about it but if you are caught, you will probably get a strict warning. If you continue with no obvious sign of ""trying to change"" then they might kick you out."
College Junior,1,There is virtually nothing to do anywhere near Spring arbor university.
College Freshman,1,My roommate got kicked out for the semester for being around people with weed off campus. It is very strict here. But if you know you struggle with it you can let people know ahead of time so that you won't get in trouble if something happens down the road.
College Freshman,1,The only thing around SAU is a McDonalds and two random pizza joints. They're kind of pricey and McDonalds is not everyone's preffered choice.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Fraternity's or Sorority's at Spring Arbor.
College Junior,1,"Very strict! Don't come here if you're expecting to party and have sex, because you will hate it."
College Senior,1,"SAU does not have public transportation. Most people hangout around campus which is perfectly walk-able even in the winter. If you do not own a car, you can usually find a friend who has one and go into the local city. If you really need to buy stuff bring a bike or some sneakers and walk a mile to the grocery plaza with a Subway, supermarket, and a few dollar stores. But if you really want convince, go to the pizza or fast food place across the street from the main campus. 
I have never seen anyone come in a taxi, but I suppose that's possible.
As with long distance transportation, a catching a bus to the airport from Jackson is no longer available, as far as I know. Carpooling is more effective if you live a few hours away or if you need to be dropped off at a bus or even the Detroit airport. I have several en-devours to the airport and back. It is not easy, but is possible with research and generous friends."

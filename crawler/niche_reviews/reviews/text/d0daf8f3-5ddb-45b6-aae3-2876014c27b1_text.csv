Sophomore,5,I think the professors were well equipped to teach with the online materials. We used zoom and it worked great for what it is.
Sophomore,5,Almost all of my classes have been online this year - the U has done a great job at making distance learning very easy for the student while keeping them engaged. The professors use digital tools very effectively.
Sophomore,5,The University of Utah has done an incredible job at adapting to the ever changing world situation. They were quick and proactive in taking safety measures while also providing a campus and community where students can really connect and experience college. Their use of technology has been seamless.
Niche User,5,Amazing college. Very well funded and organized. I am so excited to go here. Beautiful landscaping and great location. Staff is friendly and smart.
Graduate Student,5,The online classes at the University of Utah are quite extensive. The professors provide as many free online materials as they can in order to succeed in the classes they teach. The University also has additional resources to aid in online learning.
Graduate Student,5,The University of Utah has many facilities and resources available to students at a reasonable cost compared to other accredited Universities in the Country. There are so many resources that come with the price of tuition. It isn't easy to take advantage of all of it while you're there!
Freshman,5,"I would say that the University of Utah has excellent online learning experience, because all of the above mentioned resources are still available online. To add, the zoom and internet connection has never really had issues. Also the homework assignments are pretty well organized, the websites are secure too.

The only thing I would suggest is making the websites and homework upload sites more universal. For example, my Biology class uses canvas to upload, but my math class uses Grade scope. But, its not to cumbersome to do this way."
Freshman,5,"I'm trans and teachers are very accepting. They all use my correct name and pronouns. There's even an option in the homepage for all of our school resources to put in a preferred name. The academics are challenging, but not overwhelming. I feel most of my issues here are covid related, and am enthusiastic about next year."
Freshman,5,"I haven't had any issues with online learning. I feel I have a grasp on the course material, and my grades haven't suffered. That being said, I did do online school for the majority of my high school. It is very likely that this method just works for me, and isn't necessarily better or worse than other schools."
Junior,5,"I love the University of Utah! They have many amazing academic programs and stellar professors. Every professor I have had has been willing to work with me and ensure a positive experience at the U. The campus is beautiful, we have a great student body, and many different opportunities available."
Junior,5,Great school with many accommodations.  I started as a transfer student from salt lake community college.  the first semester was intimidating but that was just all in my head.  great school
Junior,5,Classes have transitioned to online.  All of the professors have been very understanding and will work with you in times of hardship
Senior,5,"The University of Utah is an amazing school! They have a fabulous undergraduate research program, esteemed professors, and hundreds of clubs to participate in. The University of Utah believes students should balance work with play, and they make everyone feel like family. I loved my time at the U!"
Junior,5,"This semester is hybrid, so some online classes some in-person. The online portions have been okay, some technical issues but the professors are helping a lot"
Junior,5,"Love it! Salt lake city is amazing. So much to explore, lots of awesome outdoor recreation. The teachers are the U want to help you succeed. Advising would be my only complain"
Junior,5,"I have only attended the University of Utah for one semester. With the short amount of time, I have been involved with this University I am thoroughly pleased. I am a huge fan of the community feel from being on campus. There are so many resources they have to offer."
Junior,5,"Every online class I have had have been enjoyable, each professor has been understanding with the transitions we are alll going through with this pandemic."
Junior,5,So far I am enjoying my semester online. The professors have been helpful and still providing an in depth learning experience.
Graduate Student,5,"Graduated double major in Biology and Chemistry. Now enrolled as a Biostatistics Masters student. Classes and culture are excellent for Utah. University of Utah is a good choice, especially if you are going into the field of Health, Business, or Law."
Freshman,5,"Amazing facilities and location, full of teachers who care, and surrounded by an environment that is built to help you succeed in whatever way you strive to. An amazing choice for the educational quality, campus location and activities on campus, and price/financial aid available to help students."
Freshman,5,"Almost all my classes this year have been online, and I can happily and easily say that it was the easiest transition to online curriculum that there has ever been. The teachers were all very accessible and understanding with this new level of complication, and the peer mentors were incredible in being able to help with the transition."
Sophomore,5,I love how the University of Utah is so diverse and how they make sure everyone has an opportunity to join many clubs and organizations. I also love how they are so concentrated on the students which makes it very welcoming as an incoming freshman.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at the University of Utah. I was provided a great education in a great environment. They are very progressive as a University, have great athletics, and your classmates quickly become your family. The police officers in charge of Lauren need to be investigated."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online. Although, I have heard that they have set it up in a way that is very straightforward and allows you to excel."
Sophomore,5,"I loved all of the blended courses that I took. However, I did not take any all-online courses. My instructors remained responsive and helpful during our online portions."
Senior,5,I have had a great time at the U and would recommend it to anyone that's looking to be at a beautiful campus with tons nearby.
Sophomore,5,I loved the University of Utah! It is a great school for academics as well as having the college experience. There were professors that weren’t always my favorite but other than that I don’t have any complaints. It’s a great school that offers a lot of opportunities for all students.
Sophomore,5,I personally didn’t have to take any online classes. From what I heard from fellow students it was a hard transition but the professors did a great job and did the best they could considering the situation.
Senior,5,"I love the University of Utah. Everyone there is really friendly, I have not had any poor experiences with professors and everyone on campus is extremely helpful. The parking is a challenge but other than that it is great."
Senior,5,"My online experience was great. I had taken an online class before the COVID pandemic and it was great. With moving to all classes online, all of my professors have been extremely available and they have made the material very interactive."
Senior,5,I switched my major to psychology and go online every semester the professors are amazing and help out so much.
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Utah is a place that I can trust to help me accomplish my goals, starting with the most important things -- my own happiness. When I'm on the campus, there's always an encouraging line somewhere around the corner on a banner or poster. Satisfying students is important to the school: student resources, recreational groups, campus accessibility, and many more areas of focus are the reasons why it's easy to see that time and effort has been put into making this university a wonderful place."
Junior,5,I have felt extremely supported by my professors. The shift to online classes surely wasn't ideal for many students but my professors were extremely understanding of the circumstances and were much more flexible and ready to help students.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the scenery on campus and the ability to walk to all my classes. The professors know what they teach; the advisors can really guide someone to making a great choice for one's life.
Sophomore,5,Online learning was a breeze. The class I took was mostly textbook based and had very little need for instructor-student time so it was super good.
Sophomore,5,The University did an amazing job of dealing with COVID-19 restrictions. The professors I had were understanding of the situation and would check in weekly.
Junior,5,This is an amazing school! The campus is beautiful. The  professors are great and they help you achieve success that sets you up for great things in your future.
Junior,5,The professors help you achieve success and are very flexible. They want to see you succeed and help you in any way possible.
Alum,5,"Campus is easy to navigate, professors are great and the campus is always evolving providing a great experience."
Junior,5,The U has been amazing so far for me. The staff is very resourceful and helpful navigating through the college experience.
Junior,5,The U has been amazing so far for me. The staff is very resourceful and helpful navigating through the college experience.
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my courses and experiences at the University of Utah. They offered me a really generous scholarship for in-state tuition rates, and there are great opportunities for academic and career development."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school! It feels good to be there, the community is helpful, and my instructors are interesting and care a lot about their careers."
Freshman,5,Applying was super easy and they love helping incoming students. They truly care about the students and will do anything to help them. They answer questions clearly. The campus is very clean and welcoming. The most welcoming in all campuses I had visited.
Freshman,5,It seems that the performing arts program could be very promising and highly enjoyable! I got to audition through Chicago Unified's as a walk in and they were extremely nice to me! They truly seem to care about all their students!
Sophomore,5,"University of Utah is the best college that I could ask for, especially going into my bachelor's degree. They have so many opportunities for any major you declare! I am a history major and there are hundreds of classes in which I am able to choose from. Here at the University of Utah professors are very engaging with their students, which I view as very important. In fact, any staff I have come in contact with at U of U have been very proficient.  With other large colleges such as UVU, staff seem to be overburdened due to the large quantity of students and it is a pain to get anything resolved. Not at the University of Utah! I have always had every problem resolved in a timely and professional manner; weather I go in person or call, I always have had things straightened out by the end of the meeting/phone call. I would definitely refer others to the University of Utah!"
Freshman,5,I really like the community. There is tons of academic support and many resources available to students.
Alum,5,I had a fabulous experience at the U.  I felt my professors & advisers were all attuned to my needs & circumstances.
Senior,5,The school has easy access to trax and other transportation which makes it easy to explore. For being a university it also has a fair tuition rate.
Alum,5,"The University of Utah has a beautiful campus and wonderful faculty that care about each student and will meet their needs. Also, you can get good jobs coming straight out of college due to the degree that you get from the University of Utah. They have plenty of events on campus and it really is an amazing college experience."
Sophomore,5,The biggest things that I like about the University of Utah is how our boards direct the students in tough situation. They handle tough situations really effectively and gives us many option in order to focus on our success
Alum,5,"The campus is safe and clean with lots of places to hang and study.  There are lots of food options on and off campus.  Just up the hill of the campus is the zoo, museums and great places to go hiking.  The professors that I've had have all been thoughtful and kind, they really care about your success.  The one downfall is the parking situation.  They have trams that go straight up to the campus and buses that continuously drive around campus but if you commute yourself it is awful.  It takes up to 30 minutes circling lots to find a space during high class times.  The school is also on a mountain which makes it a long hike to and from the parking lots."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, great teachers, comfortable environment, nice weather, good people, a lot of school spirit, great great school, good counselors, attentive teachers.  Best school I’ve ever gone to, honestly great its so good to be in an environment surrounded by very accepting people"
Freshman,5,I have loved my time on campus so far. The classes are just the perfect size; I have had classes as large as 300 people and as small as 18 people. There is a lot to do outdoors and so many clubs and sports to join and events to go to in order to meet new people.
Niche User,5,"My experience with the University of Utah has been an extremely positive one. Especially me as a high school senior, I am always being invited out to the college to experience a higher education and a great time with the college. For example, the University of Utah's E-Sports team always invites and hosts events for people of all sorts of shapes and colors. And overall provides a great atmosphere!"
Freshman,5,"Overall, I enjoy have enjoyed my experience at the University of Utah. I do wish that the food was better and that safety had more of an importance."
Freshman,5,A lot of benefits to the students. Very good to their students and makes sure they are well fed. Nice gym and challenging classes with free tutoring for the students.
Freshman,5,"There are so many amazing things on campus, you definitely have so many great resources, like the incredible library. I feel very accepted at this school and I've only just started. The U makes going to school feel so good and honestly fun. My only complaint is that the website can be confusing and getting everything sorted out for college readiness was a little rocky."
Freshman,5,I have always loved the University of Utah! Being a Ute fan has ran in my family. Both of my parents graduated from the University of Utah and my Grandpa worked for the U. I have always loved following the sports there. As I am now preparing to go to the University of Utah. I know they have a wonderful Business program that is ranked top-25 in the U.S. I have not yet attended the University of Utah but I have been on campus so many times and have grown up around that local area. The atmosphere is amazing and there is such an amazing vibe to it. Wonderful place for any person.
Alum,5,"This University offers a bit of everything for everyone. You are close to the mountains, with recreational opportunities all year long. You are also located in the city, with entertainment to access easily.  The professors are compassionate and work hard to make sure you succeed. There are a lot of student activities available as well."
Sophomore,4,"I like the professors, the programs are high quality, there are lots of resources, lots of clubs and ways to be involved, great campus, great sports."
Niche User,4,I have not taken any classes online. I will be starting college soon so I hope to have a good experience with online classes.
Freshman,4,"I like at the University of Utah that they offer so many resources in assisting the students. For example, they offer advising sessions, tutoring, and study halls. The best thing is it's free! These advising sessions have saved my life, because they have guided me towards the classes needed towards my major. Not to mention, the tutoring has assisted me in seeing a new point of view towards lectures. 

The only thing I feel is sometimes the professors are bombarded with students and cannot focus one on one with students as much. This is my only concern; however, the counter balance are the resources I stated above. One thing to add is that I wish the advisors would schedule check up appointments with you, instead of requiring that you yourself schedule them.

Also I am online, and its my first semester, so I don't know how the campus is, and in person classes. Nor have I experienced the social aspect of the University."
Junior,4,"I am taking online class this semester as a full time student. We do zoom meetings for two of my classes and if we miss a class, we can go back and watch the recordings. And for my other two classes that don’t meet at all, we get weekly remainders to do the homework."
Sophomore,4,The University of Utah has many great course options that are very flexible and fun. I enjoy the smaller class settings available and the easy navigations of the courses.
Senior,4,"The online classes were very well-organized, and the professors were very responsive. While there are occasional software issues, my overall experience with online courses at the U was great."
Junior,4,"Overall decent experience so far. Professors are supportive and most care for the students' success. There are many resources on campus and discounts to locations around campus. Events are a little lacking, but enjoyable."
Junior,4,"This is my first semester at the University of Utah! So far I am loving the diversity of my courses as there are so many options to choose from. Additionally, I am really enjoying the culture of the school because there seems to be a lot of school spirit and opportunity for participation. If I could change one thing about the University it would be the affordability. Additionally, I feel the scholarship office could offer better guidance to the students who need to find scholarship opportunities."
Junior,4,online learning is actual very nice and helpful and I would say typically better than most online classes would be but definitely way too overpriced
Graduate Student,4,"So far, classes have done a good job transitioning to online learning. Not a fan of needless Zoom meetings though if they could have just been a video recording."
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience at the U. I really love the campus and you are so close to the mountains which makes it such a great location.
Graduate Student,4,"I love this school. Very far from perfect, but I enjoyed my time there. The on-campus life could be better, but the resources that are available to students are the silver lining."
Senior,4,"I did not intend to ever move to online classes, it is not how I function. But because of COVID the transition was necessary and teachers have been supportive and flexible as they learn through the transition as well"
Senior,4,"Because the university of Utah is a large school, it provides options. The school is large enough to get lost but support is there if you need and look. The school is a research school and many resources are dedicated toward that, this comes with both benefits an negatives. Providing research opportunities to student and teachers with field time in their specialty."
Sophomore,4,"Considering the quick switch to online classes, my professors did really well.  I only had a hard time with my math class just because I have a hard time learning math online."
Senior,4,Great school overall. The campus is stunning. Professors are decent. I've had my share of excellent ones and not great ones like you'd get anywhere. The food on campus is not great. Expensive and not many options. Public transportation is pretty good but it does take forever. Parking is expensive and while there is a lot of it there are still not enough spots.
Sophomore,4,"Very large classes most of the time, but with excellent professors. Beautiful campus, with a lot of online resources as well."
Junior,4,It a really beautiful campus. I've had the opportunity to like most of my professors and have even loved some.
Junior,4,"There are plenty of passionate professors and unlimited opportunities. However, safety is often an issue and it is quite expensive."
Senior,4,Took online classes cause of COVID and the professors had a hard time switching over to online even in summer semester.
Junior,4,"I transferred here for my junior year of college and I love it so far! Although I don't stay on campus, I appreciate all the helps from the staff when I do go to campus. The professors may seem a bit intimidating at first but they are pretty nice once you really talk to them!"
Junior,4,"The University of Utah did a wonderful job converting to online with COVID. I found that all my professors understood took this challenge and made our experience still wonderful. I did not learn as much as I did in the classroom, but I learned more than expected. I would take online classes again."
Sophomore,4,Great school in a beautiful location and very underrated in my opinion. Party scene isnt great but getting better.
Graduate Student,4,"Taking classes online has never been easier for me. When I log in to the campus information site, I can get to any of my class directories (including those that I take on campus). There I can access all of the organized Canvas pages that allow me to take my tests, quizzes, and assignments that can even be redirected to different textbook sites or online learning programs. Within a few days or a week of use, any student will be proficient enough to find whatever they need through the online learning system."
Junior,4,"The University of Utah has worked really hard to make online school work, especially since COVID 19 happened. Professors have all undergone training for how to manage online classes. All of my online classes have been very organized and the professors have been available to help you if you are confused. Obviously, it doesn't match up to in person classes, but the effort is obviously there and my online learning experience has been pretty good. I wish there had been a tuition reduction, but it is what it is."
Junior,4,"I've really liked my experience here. There are so many different classes to take and it's really easy to explore different majors. Campus is beautiful and in a great location. Resources are very easily accessible and students are encouraged to take advantage of everything available to them. There have been a few issues with student safety in the past, and I wish that they would be better about that, but they have tried to enact change which has been good to see."
Freshman,4,"I'm enrolled but haven't taken any classes yet.  However, a placement test, orientation, and some other meetings will be online.  It's been pretty smooth getting those scheduled.  The staff are kind, helpful, and knowledgeable."
Freshman,4,"I'm enrolled but haven't attended classes yet.  I've been on campus tours and orientationy stuff, and that's been promising so far."
Junior,4,"I really loved the atmosphere at the University of Utah. I felt like most if not all of my teachers wanted me to succeed and wanted me to progress which made me want to work harder and do my absolute best. The student body is very fun and we have SO much team spirit which makes events a blast! One of the things that I would change would be parking first and foremost. But that is just campus wise. I really like the way that this school is run, and even though we aren't perfect, the university, the staff, and the students are constantly looking for ways to improve and progress our learning and our legacy."
Junior,4,"I would like to see a change in campus safety. We have had several instances at the University where I feel like the police could have responded to and handled the situation better. On the other hand, the professors are extraordinary and really care for students."
Junior,4,"Positives: U of U is a BEAUTIFUL campus. Political and liberal-leaning environment. Instructors are well educated and tend to care about students who also show they care. PAC12 athletics, ArtsPass that allows free (or extremely cheap) artistic admissions, great focus on research, great programs for medicine. TAs for several classes that help with one on one study guidance. Variety of diverse people. Lots of ways to get involved. 
Negative: U of U tuition is expensive, especially for the State of Utah. Students may feel like a number because campus is so large. Parking is expensive. Parking is over-policed. In wintertime, the campus may get snowy and icy."
Alum,4,Online classes were great. The online interface for classes were easy to use and effective for me making it joy to learn from my dorm or home.
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed attending the University of Utah, and I love the community I have found there. Despite being located in the the mormon central, I have found that many professors and students are quite progressive. I have especially enjoyed the Honor's College experience, I find the classes super interesting and enriching. The only downside to the U is the administration, which has consistently failed to protect women and people of color consistently, it is very disappointing seeing their actions, and I wish I knew more about it before attending the school."
Junior,4,"The U of U is a great school. Its very large so it has lots of variety in types of professors, difficulty, and experiences. I personally, have had many amazing professors, but also a couple bad ones. There's something there for everyone. The mountains are beautiful and so close. The main problem I have with the U of U is the parking, which is limited and very expensive considering its a commuter school."
Junior,4,It has been a really awesome school for me and other members of my family. We have loved it there! It provides an excellent education with fantastic teachers who really care for you. Classrooms are larger depending on the classes you are taking though. Overall this is an awesome school that we have loved to attend and be affiliated with.
Sophomore,4,"It has a mix of great and adequate teachers. I haven't had a good physics professor here but the chemistry teachers are great!
Housing can be expensive and the food isn't wonderful but the campus is beautiful and I loved living on it."
Senior,4,"The University of Utah is a leading research university, and this designation comes with many pros and a few cons. Because it is a very large school, the student body is diverse and there is a wide variety of programs and colleges housed within the University. It's size also lends it to providing many on-campus student jobs, internship opportunities, and a robust alumni network. It's PAC12 status, coupled with a strong legacy of reliable donor families, has meant secure funding for various institutes, centers, and initiatives affiliated with the institution. As a student who has taken substantial coursework in both the STEM related fields and the humanities, I can speak to the quality of courses on both sides of the spectrum. Many departments across disciplines are home to impressive faculty and professors who are outstanding in their field."
Junior,4,"When I went to the University of Utah I hardly knew anybody, but through orientation I became connected with many of my friends which have been closer to me than my high school friends. This school promotes diversity for individuals in all walks of life, which has greatly attributed to my improved self-esteem. Professors are always passionate about the subject which they teach and are sensitive to your personal life. They truly care about their students, despite how big the class may be. The Campus is located on the downtown foothills of the Salt Lake mountains, aesthetically overlooking the city. A student has access to free commute on the UTA Frontrunner, bus, and Trax systems, as well as the Student Life Center gym. This school's student body is highly involved with volunteer, travel abroad, and work opportunities. It's never a dull moment in the student section: the PAC 12-league sports at the U are out of this world! I truly recommend this school for both prestige and experience!"
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience at the University of Utah so far. The professors are very good and they truly care about you as a student and they want you to succeed. I am currently in my second year at the university and I have had a great time. campus life is fun and full of energy and there is plenty of stuff to do in and around the campus.
Freshman,4,I love my classes and professors they are all great. There are lots of opportunities for research in the sciences which is great for me a biology major. The campus is also beautiful!
Sophomore,4,All the professors are qualified with doctorate degrees and and teaching assistants have at least a bachelors degree. There are lots of resources on campus and the students are very friendly.
Senior,4,"Great education! The professors are all really wonderful and active members of their fields. 
It's a huge school so required class sizes tend to run large, but once you get into your area of focus they're smaller and you get more time with your professors. 
The facilities are great, lots of new and historic buildings. 

Negatives: Safety has been a concern these last few years. It's a commuter school and there's not nearly enough parking, though there are multiple trax stops and bus stops on campus."
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, but life has been good so far! There are lots of opportunities and it can be overwhelming sometimes, but there are lots of resources to help with that!"
Freshman,4,You have many opportunities and the scholarships that are offered are endless. It can be very competitive and the Honors college is amazing.
Junior,4,I really have enjoyed the professors at the University of Utah. I have found many individuals in the math department to be inspiring.
Freshman,4,"It has been great attending school here! I've had great professors and the atmosphere is amazing, as well as the fact that they provide low cost mental healthcare to their students which is fantastic."
Freshman,4,"The U of U has a beautiful campus with plenty of resources available to students. The relative distance to ski resorts, as well as the school's student life center makes it the perfect place for athletes. The one downside is the lack of student life on campus. At times it might seem quite dull."
Sophomore,4,Its a pretty good school that has a wealth of opprotunitys. however like any university it has its downsides. so you just have to be aware ot those thing before you attend. but overall a pretty good time.
Freshman,4,"I love how many opportunities the U offers. Info sessions come onto campus almost every week providing job opportunities, information about clubs, and more. Some classes do not teach hard skills, rather they are more opinion based. The food system is not ideal as they force you to purchase meal plans if you live on campus and it is not cheap. The professors are great and provide many office hours and TA sessions."
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at the University of Utah. It is located in the heart of the mountains and there is so much to do in Salt Lake City, especially in the wintertime because of all the snow. I love everything about the program I am currently in, which is the Multi-Disciplinary Design program. I would have loved to know more about it before coming here, as I feel the website doesn't do the program justice."
Sophomore,4,"I love how many campus resources there are for students here.  We have affordable counseling services, academic advisors that know their students by name, and professors who let you walk into their office or labs at any time to ask questions.  The student life outside of the university is also amazing.  Students have easy access to be involved in any outdoor sport: climbing, hiking, skiing, rafting.  The Utah outdoors are amazing!  Utah athletics is also so fun to be a part of.  Students can attend any sporting event for free!  We are a PAC12 school and are nationally ranked in a number of sports so it's so fun to watch all the games and meets!"
Junior,4,"Overall, the University of Utah is a great school. Salt Lake City is a beautiful, fun, urban becoming city. The campus is gorgeous, with a mountain backdrop and new state of the art buildings. Some of the best ski hills are 20 min away from school, and hiking just the same. Our professors are the best in their field, and research opportunities are around every corner. That said, If I could change one thing about the University of Utah, it would be the campus safety. On-campus patrol is practically useless, and cops don't always listen to student, causing sometimes devastating results. Salt Lake City police fill in the gaps for campus security, but progress can be achieved."
Freshman,4,I love how many places the college has to eat and nooks to study. I feel like there is at least a cafe in most buildings and every building has a small study area. Sometimes I have a hard time choosing where to go!
Freshman,4,Most of the professors are well-qualified and seem genuinely interested in your success. There are a lot of resources for students and the campus is very beautiful. Sometimes you are fined for items you were not told beforehand which adds to tuition.
Freshman,4,"The thing I like the most about the campus is the easy access there is to the city. Downtown Salt Lake is a short, free thirty-minute Trax (light-rail system) from the campus. This makes it easy to go out for dinner with friends, go to the mall, or the other plethora of activities in a metropolitan area. The one thing I would say needs improving on campus is the food quality, especially at the main dining hall the PHC. The PHC's food is often bland or just takes like pepper. The food often runs low at eight o'clock, even though they are always open till nine. The one benefit of the PHC is that it will help you lose weight as nobody wants to eat a lot of bland food. The food on the lower campus by all the classes is fairly good. However, the inability to use meal swipes at many of the cafeteria's on lower campus make it hard to make your meal plan worth it."
Freshman,4,The academics and professors are all wonderful! The professors really want to see you succeed. There’s a lot of support for all aspects of your life. The campus is pretty big but walkable. The food is interesting because there’s standard meal plan places and snack bars but there’s also food trucks around that are delicious!
Freshman,4,I love the school environment and I have a lot of fun learning and I have lots of fun outside of class.
Junior,4,Great culture and location. My professors are very invested in the education of their students and show that they really care.
Niche User,4,"I went on a tour at the University of Utah, I have lived up there past year for a Trio program. I really loved it and my experience there was awesome. the food was good but, I just wished there could be more types of food."
Junior,4,"Transferring from a smaller school to the University of Utah has been such a positive change. The academics are more serious here, which drives me to do better to be competitive with the rest of the student body that my other school did not offer. Also their system and programs are very organized, and the facilities they use to house these programs are state of the art."
Junior,2,"The problem with the University of Utah is that it is a research school. So most of your professors are not there because they're good at teaching, they're there to earn the uni more $ researching. A lot of times it feels like this takes priority over the students' learning"
Junior,2,"There is so much homework. Which would be fine, except that getting help on any of it is a nightmare. They either do not higher enough TAs to handle the workload of a class, higher incompetent ones, or just have poor systems for getting help. I've had all 3 just this last semester."
Junior,2,"Overall experience has been lacking. Many classes, especially STEM classes are unsuitable to being online learning. Has been difficult to acclimate to Zoom learning."
Junior,2,"I am not a fan of online classes. Some things are nice about it but overall, I would rather be in an actual class learning."
Sophomore,2,"I took Television and art class for FF. Professor never responded my email. I was always confused what was going on. And there wasn't 
specific explanations for the test. 
I am taking Psychology 3000 and World music right now. But both professors are great so far."
Freshman,2,"I have only been going to the University of Utah for two months but already I have negative things to say. There are not many school activities and when there are everyone shows up drunk. On a Friday or Saturday night it is very hard to find fun that does not involve drinking. Because it is a big commuter school people come here to learn and not socialize. People do not smile at you when you walk by or hold the door for you. It is a very unfriendly place. I do have only good things to say about the academics. They are unmatched and even though the classes are very large, the professors do care about you and will get to know you. There are more opportunities here than at smaller colleges and being close to downtown Salt Lake is very exciting. The mountains are gorgeous and the buildings are nice."
Sophomore,2,"The campus really is beautiful and I've enjoyed most of my professors and classes, but that's mostly it. I'm out of state so I lived in the dorms my freshman year. No one really seemed to care about anything but getting drunk and rebelling against their LDS upbringing and don't really take their education seriously. I've only met like two other out of state students. Not to mention a TON of students are returning LDS missionaries and are 20+ years old. It's a commuter school, so everyone just goes home after classes back to their old high school friends so no one is really social. Also there is almost no school spirit. I thought the PAC-12 football team would make up for that, but we're so bad that it doesn't even matter. I honestly don't like telling people I go here and am kind of embarrassed when I do. I'm planning on transferring next semester."
College Senior,2,"Overall I have been highly dissatisfied with my education at this university thus far. As a transfer student, I had heard nothing but amazing things about the university, the classes and the professors. This still may be true for specific majors and departments, but as a student studying communications I have been highly disappointed. The professors have been horrific and couldn't care less about whether or not we succeed. The professors put forth very little effort into the curriculum, and truly don't seem to care for their students. Overall, I have just been highly disappointed with the professors and courses within the communications major."
College Junior,2,"I notice a few people who have pledged to one of the fraternities or sororities on campus, but I don't have a desire to join."
College Sophomore,2,I'm sick of being asked to join a fraternity.
College Junior,2,I am not a Greek and don't plan to be. The atmosphere is not a good atmosphere.
College Sophomore,2,It's very difficult to receive scholarships at the University of Utah.
College Junior,2,"Getting financial aid at any school is a pain. There are a lot of hoops you have to go to and things you have to fill out. Just stay on top of things, and call the office a lot."
College Freshman,2,"I'm still living with my parents because I couldn't find a place to live. I've signed up for the off-campus roommate finder, but the people I talked to, I didn't really connect with and wouldn't want them as a roommate. I tried asking a few friends, but we couldn't find something close enough to school and work, or that fit in our price range."
College Sophomore,2,"Again, not a lot of options for social interactions for on campus students. I'd like to see the school sponsor more activities, expanding my options beyond overrated frat parties."
College Freshman,2,"Have all documents for ""FAFSA verification"" ready as this is an especially annoying part of the process. Also financial aid for summer classes is limited if you have already received some."
College Junior,2,It is just really expensive.  I guess there are surrounding places to go to eat but I hate having to have a meal plan.  The HC got boring as the year went on.  The transfer meals were nice...but I always felt like was eating unhealthy
College Freshman,2,I don't even try to obtain off campus housing except for at my parents house. Housing downtown is a nightmare whether you're looking at the outrageous rent prices per month or the availability of finding somewhere that is remotely close to campus.
College Freshman,2,I wasn't able to receive any financial aid towards attending this college.
College Freshman,2,There is so much competition for scholarships and when you do get one it is very restricting on your education
College Senior,2,"There is a lot to choose from but also a lot of competition.

Most of the housing is operated by slum lords and/or private individuals looking to make a quick buck."
College Senior,2,"Most people here are very sheltered and inexperienced.  Although the U has a reputation for being a liberal campus, this is only true by Utah standards; dating-wise, the entire state is a wasteland if you are not Mormon."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Campus definitely needs to work on promoting awareness and prevention of sexual assault more. While the numbers go up, the only people really doing anything are the student organizations, not the school run organizations. They took out safety call buttons a few years ago, and the cop/security presence seems to be lacking these days. I don't feel too scared to walk around at night, but campus could definitely be better lit. I do carry around pepper spray for my safety, and I tend to try to park in certain lots that are lit."
College Senior,2,Sexual Assault on campus has gone up every year with very little done to stop or prevent it. ASUU has been more worried about stupid stuff over dealing with these problem.
College Senior,2,"I try to bring my on lunch or go with out, due to the quality of the food."
College Senior,2,"Depending on what building you are in either it is new or really old and ran down. It is cheaper to live off campus because University of Utah requires all students living on campus to purchase a food credit, which starts at $500 per month on top of rent."
College Sophomore,2,I wouldn't want to live there
College Sophomore,2,It is not strict at all
College Freshman,2,I wish I could live closer to camp but rooms for rent near the school are way too pricey!
College Freshman,2,"I've seen a police officer once on campus, that's it. But there are plenty of officers that can give out parking tickets.."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I would not go here for the Greek Life. Though I was not much involved, it seemed more like a loose affiliation than a social group."
College Student,2,It is difficult to get campus housing. Rent is overpriced
College Student,2,I would not recommend off campus housing. There are parts of the city that are extremely dangerous.
College Junior,2,I lived in the Honors dorm. For over 800 a month and with 4 to a unit the school is making a lot of money 3200 for less than 600 square feet. The cell service is blocked in most rooms due to the amount of cement used in the building.
College Junior,2,Every thing is about sports here. Many athletes do poorly in classes but are given grades. Look at how many sports associated scholarships there are and academic ones. The percentage of athletes who make the pro arena is small. Academics is really down played.
College Junior,2,I am from a middle class family. I do not qualify for financial aide but my family has trouble getting enough for me to go to school. The partial honors at entrance don't even cover half. My tuition and fees were 5480 last semester the partial is 1250.
College Junior,2,too much alcohol and strange people.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's not great to know which scholarships are safe
College Junior,2,Finding answers to problems is very difficult. They always seem to refer you to someone else
College Junior,2,"As a student working full-time to pay for school, my housing options were limited to low-income housing with lots of bug problems, poor and unprofessional management, and neighbors that scream, smoke marijuana regularly, and disrespect the communal property."
College Junior,2,"I enrolled in the Honors Program immediately upon admission into the university. It's incredibly underwhelming. I see no real effort of the classes to make the course extraordinary or ""Honors-level."" It seems like you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get a measly designation on your diploma, and a complete waste of time. Everything listed on their website is really just waving a banner and saying ""look how great we are!"""
College Junior,2,"I think it's annoying that financial aid is only based off of the FAFSA; this means that families that are deemed stable enough don't get any aid, when in reality, they are the ones that need the aid the most. And the maximum amount of financial aid from the school is pitiful: it's only $400 a semester! That's enough to buy two books..."
College Sophomore,2,I couldn't stand to eat at the on campus dining center. I moved out of the dorms because I couldn't eat it.
College Freshman,2,"Maybe it's just during summer, but someone needs to fix it."
College Junior,2,"Finally got Panda! Unhealthy, no variety, average."
College Junior,2,They are very old and in need of remodeling. They are close to some classes depending on where your classes are.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel like it's used as a social thing rather than a community improvement outlet.
College Sophomore,2,I wish I would be in an engineering or mathematics-based program.  Job opportunities are exponentially greater than any liberal arts program or major that exists.
College Sophomore,2,"ASUU concerts and Crimson Nights are the only major on campus parties, and have varying success.  Greek Row will always have their parties, and the LDS Institute as 2-3 big events per year.  No event is ever mind-blowing.  No major off-campus campus events"
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus is ridiculous! Not only are there a very limited amount of parking spots, but the cost for the permit is ridiculous!  I recommend either using public transportation or taking an LDS institute class and getting free parking that way."
College Freshman,2,"I received a full tuition scholarship, which was really nice. The downside was that I had to maintain a 3.6 GPA to keep it, which is very difficult when you are an Engineer major. A 3.6 GPA didn't sound bad at first, but I quickly realized how hard it is to keep a 3.6 with my major."
College Freshman,2,"During the winter time, there is so much snow. Since it's a hilly campus, the snow and wind make it very tiresome to walk to class. However, other times it's okay."
College Freshman,2,"It is very much the norm to find drugs or drinking as a part of student life. Parties, it is a must in order to have ""fun"". I have hear many references from most staff towards drinking, which is their personal life, but very influential on students as reference to these practices being the norm."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly only like living on campus because it is closer to my classes. The housing costs are ridiculous and also the dorms are outdated. For what one pays to live here it is way too costly especially because you have to have a meal plan which is another at least $1500 to add on to housing. Also the way rent is split up by the months is way too much.
College Sophomore,2,"The wifi on campus is terrible. UConnect is hard to stay connected to and frequently goes in and out for me. I also do not like that it will not connect to any other devices such as my ""Roku"" without the use of a router. I have also tried to download the free software for antivirus and my computer got a virus anyway. There needs to be better service at the tech place as well."
College Freshman,2,I get scared at night
College Junior,2,"This school is great for you if you are very career driven. They have programs that are catered for individual career needs, which is awesome. The social life here is amazing as well, with lots of dances and activities to get involved in on a weekly basis. There are also several clubs that are definitely worth looking into, especially if you enjoy sports or the outdoors.

I would suggest applying for as many scholarships as you can. The U is more expensive than SLCC and USU, and money can get tight really fast if you are paying for everything out of pocket. It would also be good to schedule an appointment with a school advisor as soon as possible when you start. They help a lot when you are new and don't necessarily know what you are doing."
College Freshman,2,The worst musical experience I have ever had...
College Freshman,2,"Half of the people I meet are white,blonde, and LDS."
College Freshman,2,"My religion gets made fun of quite a bit of here, and people and professors can be very crude in language and attitude."
Niche User,1,"i learned they care more about money than health care!,  agenda driven medicine is just plain wrong on many levels!"
Sophomore,1,"Honestly awful. I just transferred here because of the pandemic, and I’m already looking to transfer somewhere else. The financial aid office is the worst I’ve ever dealt with, and I came from NYU, so I think that says a lot. The professors are mixed. I have a couple great professors, but I ended up dropping a French class on the third day because the professor wasn’t fluent enough to teach the class. Unless you get an excellent scholarship, I can’t recommend going here at all. The U of U is absolutely not worth the sticker price, even for in-state."
Sophomore,1,"Online isn’t that great anywhere, but it seems like most professors here really struggle with it. I’ve had two professors who seem to be making things easy to learn, but the rest don’t seems to put in a lot of effort."
Freshman,1,"Classes are too large, professors do not care they are not very helpful, they seem to only be there for the money, many do not even speak English so it is very difficult to understand them.  Some are first year and have no cue how to teach.  The TA are over worked and stressed out.  It seems the University says it cares about students but it seems they only care about the money.  Example, my dorm was a single with 3 other singles and a common area, the University made that common area into a room never notified anyone of the change so instead of 4 girls 2 bathrooms there were 5.  We all were bio or chem majors the 5th was a general ed major or undelcared she would party, guys over and loud so on, it took me writing a curt letter to the housing department for any change to happen.  Our quiet enjoyment of our rooms was compromised."
Niche User,1,"I am a 70% disabled veteran who attempted to utilize the GI Bill for Spring 2018. The Residency Office filed my residency application for the WRONG semester and I am now being charged over $7k. This is unacceptable and the Residency Office should be held accountable. I have attempted to contact the school in efforts of finding a resolution, however, I have only been met with rude and unhelpful employees. I have went ahead and emailed our Utah Government Officials, as well as Veteran advocates in Washington, D.C. This school has been a giant headache. 

If you are deciding on which college to attend in Utah, I definitely do NOT recommend the University of Utah. Do not waste your time."
Alum,1,"Terrible institution. Professors are not punished for poor behavior (sexual harassment). OEO is a joke, the dean of students and the sociology department is full of judgmental professors that protect predators by doing and saying NOTHING."
College Junior,1,I hate that so much of our money goes to athletics
College Sophomore,1,"I lived on campus for one academic year and the only, ONLY good thing about it was the high speed internet. I paid almost 1200 a month to live in a one room with one other guy and have all my meals and utilities done for me. Now that I have my own 2 bedroom apartment for only 600 a month I truly see what a dump I lived in. Not too mention it floods on the first snow. Which is insane for buildings built for the winter Olympics. It drained me of my money and patience."
College Senior,1,I feel like I'm surrounded by students that don't care that much about academics. Student fees are through the roof and are used to subsidize things I don't care about. I'm worried about the quality of job I'll get coming out of this program.
College Freshman,1,"The Univeristy of Utah hardly gives out decent scholarships. The one I did get, still only covered a fraction of the total cost. Financial aid was also a pain. At first I was given aid, then the office called me in and said they had to take my aid away because now I wasn't ""poor enough."" It was discouraging and made college really stressful. I eventually had to take out a loan, and going into debt wasn't the plan."
College Senior,1,I have 0 interest in that stuff.
College Student,1,The air quality is smoggy. Police don't prosecute.
College Junior,1,There is never enough money for an average person like me.  I don't qualify for most scholarships and the ones that I do are very few and far between but they have thousands of applicants are have a small chance of earning it.
College Freshman,1,I only say it is the worst because I do not enjoy parties
College Senior,1,University of Utah is not the place to attend if you are interested in fraternizing or sororitizing. I personally think that U of U greeks are some of the stupidest people I have ever met and they will be extremely co-dependent for the rest of their lives.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is really cheap, but there is never any parking available after 9 am"
College Freshman,1,"A lot of the students are white Mormons. They don't say or do anything bad to others, but there is an extreme lack of diversity at this school."
College Junior,1,"It is a very lengthy and difficult process! I had to have a lot of hours of community service and volunteer time, I needed experience working in the field. I needed letters of recommendation, a personal statement, and an essay about a case study and how it applies to Social work ethics"
College Sophomore,1,They were very unprofessional and gave me very vague answers. They provided both I and my grandparents with different information and it was awful to try and sort things out. Their was a lot of money lost that I could have had and it is making it very difficult for me to go to school here although I really do love it here. It is just very expensive and not a lot of financial aid is coming my way which I do not understand.
College Freshman,1,"Stay on top of it or you'll end up like me. I had a scholarship that was put on hold and was saved but, they didn't hold my admission. Thus I had the headache of applying again, not being eligible for financial aid because I'm a middle class white male and am still trying to find ways to pay for college."
College Junior,1,denied my aid due to prior schooling I paid for
College Junior,1,I do not buy a parking pass.
College Junior,1,"Since the U is a commuter school, many people drive. However, there is extremely limited parking. They keep tearing down parking lots for new buildings-- I don't know how people are going to park in the upcoming years."
College Freshman,1,The athletics at this university rules everything about the school. A foot ball game can shut down the whole campus and take all available parking spots. The university puts too much of its strength and money toward football. 
College Freshman,1,If there were dorms rooms for every student I would live on campus even at 29 years old. It is a nightmare to live off campus and the only places even close to campus are extremely overpriced. Live anywhere other than Rose Park. It is a dump.
College Senior,1,"I think parking is way too expensive. I definitely love taking TRAX for free and walking everywhere. It's good for the planet, and it's good for our bodies!"
College Freshman,1,The parking passes are expensive and only let you park in certain lots. These lots are not close to classes and almost always full so you will be waiting for a while to park. They just doubled the prices on the metered parking and if you park in the wrong lot or let your meter run out you should expect a hefty ticket. Parking nazis are always watching.
College Freshman,1,The U is a commuter school. Simple as that. There is almost no campus feel. People go to and from class and don't associate a lot. This is a below average public university academically and socially.
College Freshman,1,"Do not go to this school if you like to party. Lots of the students here do not drink. There are small house parties scattered throughout the city but they are usually byob and hard to get to. Also, the cops shut them down really fast. There are no bars close to campus. The Greek system puts on a party sometimes but they have to shut it down by 12."
College Freshman,1,There are not many people in the Greek system. They throw parties every once in a while but most of the parties are registered with the police and have to close down at 12. The parties that aren't registered are pretty bad and are mostly just sloppy dudes and a few girls.
College Freshman,1,The campus police are nazis. They are always out trying to bust people for anything possible. Getting a minor in possession here is going to cost a lot of money. Utah is a dry campus so if you get caught drinking you have to go to two three hour classes and if you get caught three times you are out of the dorms.
College Freshman,1,The food at the Heritage Center is awful. They have basically no variety in their meals and the specials tend to be pretty disgusting. The salad bar is the only thing that is worth while
College Junior,1,They keep making buildings in our parking lots...
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a nightmare when it is busy. But they're building more parking structures so hopefully that will alleviate traffic and overcrowded parking lots.
College Sophomore,1,"I am a non-greek and I think the greeks are rather irrelevant to the school campus. The social atmosphere isn't really impacted at all by the greeks because they don't do much. The only time I see the greeks is when I drive past their houses and there is toilet paper all over their trees and spray paint on their doors, but that's pretty much it. I had a different expectation about the greeks from movies and stuff, but I would say they are pretty boring."
College Senior,1,"There are way too many teacher spots and not enough student parking. It takes you about 10-15 minutes to find parking. The permits are way overpriced, and if I can't find a spot I have to end up paying $6 to park in the pay lot"
College Sophomore,1,"Almost no place to park, and the parking pass is expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"Only one dining hall, undercooked food, rude staff, and unsatisfactory cleanliness."
College Sophomore,1,"At the University of Utah, parking gnomes must hide in the trees and prey on poor students who simply have classes that run late, like $15 for one minute past the expire time.  Not only is it extremely expensive (near $200) to purchase a permit, but parking is still poor and priority goes to game day goers and professors.  Pay lots are absorbent in price even for students attending university events or even class."
College Freshman,1,REALLLLLLY EXPENSIVE. well i mean for the quality of where youre living... and they require you to have a meal plan which is alo really expensive
College Freshman,1,"They keep building things on the parking lots and there is never any parking. The pass is expensive, too expensive for not having any spaces. I have missed class because of the lack of parking. It is UNACCEPTABLE."
College Student,1,"If you live in the undergrad dorms: you have to get a meal plan. DO NOT GET UNLIMITED. you think you'll use it a ton. you won't. i promise. I have the 12 meal a week plan and I usually have left over meals by the end of the week. also, get a meal plan with transfer meals or you'll regret it.  You can use a transfer to get panda or pizza or a sandwich at the union, or starbucks in the HC downstairs."
College Student,1,"I was in a sorority my freshman year. Everyone denys it, but greek life is just partying.  Sure, they do philanthropy and other things, but the main reason to go greek is to meet people and party with. I never felt a close ""sisterhood"", and I literally paid for friends. waste of time and money."
College Sophomore,1,It is rough to find a parking spot close to your classes unless you buy the more expensive permits.  It is better to take the public transportation than drive your own car.
College Sophomore,1,"It was the same food all the time at the Heritage Center. If you live in the undergraduate dorms (sage, chapel glen, and gateway heights) you are required to have a meal plan. This quickly became expensive for me because I was allergic to everything they served. I was having to buy a meal plan (not cheep!) and buy food on the side as well. They wouldn't exempt me from a meal plan even with a doctors note!"
College Sophomore,1,I have not been able to receive any financial aid and it is the end of my second year here at the U.
College Junior,1,"I received a decent amount of financial aid, but it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a lot of people that need it to have fun. But, there are a lot of people, because of the LDS culture, that do not participate in drugs and alcohol."
College Junior,1,"Just had to declare, didn't have to jump through any hoops to get in"
College Senior,1,"Waste of money and most of the houses are ""renovated"" but still look like they're falling apart.  If you rush & join, then the likelihood of actually living-in (as in living in the frat/sorority house) is quite low.  Small, cramped, shared rooms are all that's available anyway.  Parties are usually crashed anyway especially by too-young teenagers from surrounding towns.  You'd be better off volunteering or working somewhere social."
College Freshman,1,"It is awful to find parking at the U at times, regardless if you have the best parking pass."
College Freshman,1,"As i student i am told that rules are broken a lot on Campus.  I have known people whom smoke weed, drink, and party like there is no tomorow and they are underage.  Its disgusting to have people like that who cant follow rules and how officials cannot catch them.  I believe the strictness is not as strong as it should be.  Especially when those partiers are ones welcoming rape, and accidents."
College Junior,1,"Dry campus... need I say more. If you live in the residence halls, be smart if you're going to drink... just don't throw ragers or go ham in your dorm room with 20 people (it's been done before). Depending on who your RA is, if caught you might get a warning or you might get the university police called and issued a ticket. In extreme cases you may be evicted and have your housing privileges permanently revoked... again, depends who your RA is and number of offenses. This is by far the most complained about policy on campus."
College Junior,1,"It's pretty tight, and expensive. There are varying levels of parking passes available, the higher prices of which will get you a little bit better parking. But there aren't assigned spots for each parking tag, so its first come, first served. There is one place, the LDS Institute of Religion, that will give you free parking if you register for and attend a class 75% of the time. They have a huge lot with tons of room, and it's right across the street from campus. This is what I use personally, as there are also social benefits to it. But otherwise, parkings not great. Take the bus or trax."
College Junior,1,The greeks have little effect on the social atmosphere of campus away from greek row. Non-Greeks view them as regular students if they view them at all. They are regular students that like to party a lot. Greeks can live in the residence halls or in the greek houses.
College Sophomore,1,Even with a permit parking is expensive and almost impossible to find.  If you have the most expensive pass and it is after 9 AM you can forget about finding a spot.  The campus has buildings located with a proximity that makes it difficult for them to have parking available for students.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is awful. There aren't enough spots for students, so you end up having to park in the paid lot anyway, thus paying more on top of your already ridiculously overpriced parking pass."
College Sophomore,1,"Because the University of Utah is mainly a commuter school, parking is a necessity for most students. However, the number of parking spots in comparison with the number of students attending the U is laughable. If you have class every day at 7:30 a.m., you are likely to get a spot. For those students taking classes during the afternoon, leaving an hour or an hour and a half early becomes necessary. Also, no street parking is available because resident only permits are required to park in the areas surrounding the U. Both campus and city parking enforcement patrol these areas and I know several people who have been given multiple parking tickets in one day in the same spot."
College Junior,1,"Parking is hard to find, permits are too expensive, tickets are given too readily. get to campus at least 45 minutes earlt to find a good spot, or any spot!"
College Junior,1,Expensive and Rotten! The housing anywhere within 20 miles is expensive and run down

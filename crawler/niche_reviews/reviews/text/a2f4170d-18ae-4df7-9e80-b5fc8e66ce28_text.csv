Alum,5,"I loved how involved I could be in such a small school. There were so many clubs and organizations that I had enjoyed while going to Andrew College. The small size of the classes and connections with professors helped me to better my academics. I graduated highschool with a GPA of 2.67, and graduated Andrew College with honors and a GPA of 3.5! I also made friends quite easily by being at a small school and joining clubs."
Sophomore,5,what I like about Andrew college is that its a small campus and that everyone knows each other. Its not a huge college where you have to walk a far distant. All the classrooms are almost next to one another.
Niche User,5,I loved visiting and how small the schools is. It allows the students to get true one on one time with the professors.
Freshman,5,"This School offers a lot of programs to study.Also, it has a high level of academic support to help succeed. The college has a tons of organization/clubs to join in."
College Sophomore,5,Touring the school made it feel like home
College Junior,5,"My School Is The Best Even Though It's A 2 Hour Drive From My Town, It's A 2 Hour Drive Worth. My School Helps Their Students By Preparing Them For The Real World & Preparing Them For 4 Years Schools, But The Main Purpose I Like My School Is Because They Have The Best Focus For Kids With Learning Disabilities Like Myself That's What Makes My School So Unique."
College Junior,5,with a degree from this school I can go to a lot of major schools like the university of florida or florida state.
College Junior,5,ive been able to intern at the local elementary school.
College Junior,5,"everything is just so simple and calm. no rush, I don't feel stress like I did in highschool"
College Junior,5,its a 2 year school.
College Junior,5,there very helpful. like ive said in previous reviews. teachers have helped me with my test anxiety.
College Junior,5,I would much rather have a teacher in a class room so I have one on one then the online thing where I have to do everything by myself.
College Junior,5,everything has been perfect. I have barely any classes so im able to deal with softball all the time. and still have enough time to study and work on my test taking problem.
College Junior,5,Andrew has the very best resources. They've helped me so much with my test taking skills.
College Junior,5,Everyone should take the option of doing a 2 year college so that they can get their basics out of the way and then be able to focus on thier major their Junior & Senior years.
College Junior,5,"Everyone has been super, super friendly and very supportive!"
College Junior,5,There are all kinds of things here to stay involved and help you stay active.
College Junior,5,"The student body is diverse ethnically, economically, politically, religiously, and sexually. The students are friendly and it's easy to make friends. Everyone is accepted, not based on their diverse background, but on their personality."
College Junior,5,"I'm a first year student and have no idea how good or bad the transferring of credits is, however, the college is pretty lenient when it come to the curriculum. I personally haven't had any trouble with the college and their methods and they want the students to succeed so they work around your schedule, especially if you do sports or other activities on campus."
College Junior,5,"I wanted to have a double major, but that would cause me to stay at Andrew for at least three years. For my first semester, I had to just focus on the core classes that both my majors share and see where that gets me. The school is pretty flexible when it comes to your major. You tell your advisers the classes you want to take pertaining to your major and they make it happen. For instance, one of my major is psychology and I was allowed to volunteer at the local rehab center, and my friend's major is pre-med and the college allows her to volunteer at the hospital behind the campus. The college gives the students plenty of opportunities to succeed in our field of choice."
Alum,4,"I took some classes online while at Andrew. It was a heavy load of work, but the instructors were always helpful and answered every email as fast as possible."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going here, the people are friendly. Teachers work with you on making sure you're understanding the work for your degree. I play soccer and I enjoy meeting new players and playing other colleges. It gives me a chance to grow and better myself. Hopefully I have an opportunity to further my education and soccer after this year. I graduate in May 2019"
Sophomore,4,It has been a great experience and I would like there to be more food options and better housing. I would like to there to be more student activities to do around school.
College Senior,4,"Great small town feel, close knit, wonderful teacher/student ratio, good learning environment and very helpful professors"
College Junior,4,There is not a huge diversity at my school
College Junior,4,I have great teachers here and they help me understand things on when I need help
College Junior,4,I have a lot of opportunities
College Junior,4,I've had a good time my freshman year
College Junior,4,The employers recruiting on campus have great quality in their work.
College Junior,4,Andrew is a very unique school mostly because of its diverse community.
College Junior,4,"The workload can be stressful at times, but some teachers will help you."
College Junior,4,The student body at Andrew college is a very diverse community and I love it because of that.
College Junior,4,I like how everybody is so friendly. and the small class room environment is great.
College Junior,4,The tuition at Andrew college is pretty expensive but its worth it. I love the small class rooms. The classes are like 16/1 and the tuition pays for everything. if I would of stayed home and went to school it would of been the same price.
College Junior,4,Coming straight from high school there wasn't much to have to handle....Most of my forms were sent easily!
College Junior,4,The financial aid department at Andrew College have been wonderful and extremely helpful!    They have been there to help through all of my questions and have given me tons of options.    They just can't help those that need help when the government states they make too much money and they still can't qualify for scholarships and grants for a private college fee.
College Junior,4,It costs a lot to go to school here and you can only get one school scholarship so you have to get a lot of loans...which of course you'll have to pay back six months after you completely finish all of your schooling.
College Junior,4,It is a private school so there are smaller classes and it is more one on one and it makes it easier to ace the class.
College Junior,4,The other students are really nice.  The directors and everyone in head of the school are extremely unorganized.
College Junior,4,"Tuition here is 20,000 dollars a year. Honestly, we do not receive what we pay for. The food is horrible they only feed us good when visitors come to make it seem as if the school is an okay school, The dorms are run down with rust and mold with no breathing room for you or your roommate, And most importantly they make it very safe and boring here. So, that you don't experience the real college experience. The people in financial aid are very nice and assist you with anything that is needed."
Freshman,2,"Andrew College sucks! The student life is boring, the location is in the middle of a ""bad neighborhood"" with the nearest Wal-Mart being 30 minutes away, and the overall quality is bad. There is mold in every dorm room, the bathrooms are tiny, the A/C units don't work properly, and the food is the worst of it! I basically lived off of bread, which was hard. They always had pizza and some veggies and mystery meat that was disgusting. They never change out the bread in the bread box, so it got moldy. The pizza smells like weed and is usually stale. And the dishes rarely come out clean. The former dean would fine students any chance she got, and spend the school's debit card on her and her kids, all the while student activities consisted of coloring and painting with cheap materials. The professors are okay, but some are harsh and don't explain things well and give impossible deadlines. The only positive thing that came from this college for me is the handful of friends I made."
College Senior,2,"it is average. the internet runs slow unless your in a school computer. you do not need your own computer or printer, but i recommend it. the printing on campus is cheap."
College Senior,2,Everything here is average. it can be better.
Alum,1,"When i went here, the local police department was over run by a street gang that is located on Andrew street. You are told day one, not to drive or walk down it.
You have to go to Dothan or Albany for the nearest stores, 45 minutes to an hour. The nearest McDonalds is 30 minutes away. I know this because the cafateria food is so horrible I has to sneak in hot plates and so on to survive. They are almost never open for breakfast on time. Was over 35 minutes late opening. 
There is no student tribunal and you will be fined for everything if you are not listed as a favorite child. I was punished once because I knew of someone sitting on a roof and not doing anything about it. 
Athletics. The XC coach quit as i was coming in. They replaced him with a soccer goalie. Literally a person who never actually runs who then married a student, which is fine, but since we are fined for every little thing, youd think it would have been an issue."
Niche User,1,"Andrew College is a nice start to the entire college experience. The dormitory's were not clean. My roommate and I constantly stayed sick from the black mold in our A.C. unit and out bathroom. There were only two choices for food. Many times with my schedule I was unable to eat lunch in the cafeteria because it only stayed open 1-2 hours at a time. Something my parents were paying a good price for. The office staff were almost impossible to get ahold of. Countless times I asked to speak with Financial Aid because they had lost almost $2,000 worth of scholarships I had brought with me and the constant threatening emails about paying my tuition. They eventually found them laying on a desk in a vacant office for anyone to have gotten. Needless to say my freshman year experience was a disaster and I was so happy to be able to transfer. I DO NOT recommend this school!"
Sophomore,1,"Wouldn't wish this ""school "" on my enemy. Professors play favorites with athletics and foreign students. Don't really care to help students. Tuition is 28,000 a year and you don't get what you pay for at all. Food is repetitive and very small portions when there is even food ready. Don't try going in between classes because you'll probably risk going hungry or being late for waiting on food. If you go to the restroom doing class you are marked absent. The nearest Walmart is over 35 mins away, nothing to do unless you wanna go to Albany which is 45 mins away. However there are a few AWESOME professors Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Hohn, and Ms. Craft,  and the student life team. If you want to be in high school I suggest you just stay in high school. "
College Senior,1,"Seriously, it's bad. Don't come here if you want to enjoy your college years.

Go to Southern University, or Walla Walla University, or even Pacific Union College."

Freshman,5,"I would recommend going to blinn, if you are trying to get into Texas A&M. Doing their transfer program."
Freshman,5,"The teachers were very interactive and would take the time to actually teach you. They were very nice teachers, they didn't make class over difficult. They didn't over whelm you with school work or anything. They understand you have a life other than just school. They are always there to assist you and help you."
Sophomore,5,Blinn College offers classes that are small for an easier learning experience and an overall better student/ instructor relationship. Their professors really care about your education.
Freshman,5,Going to Blinn has been a great introductory into college. The professors here are great and really form a relationship with you during your time with them.  Blinn also gives you the opportunity to get a lot of the credits you'll need at a university out of the way for a very affordable price.
Freshman,5,Learning online was a good experience at Blinn. The way to succeed is to check in on a daily bases and assure that you have done your studying and work for the day. Professors provide many resources for you to learn the material and get a good grade on your tests.
Sophomore,5,"Blinn is a great place to learn! It offers a diverse atmosphere and many resources that as a student you can use to better your education. Every staff member that I have met is so helpful, and almost every one of my professors has had experience in their field before teaching. I look forward to going to class everyday!"
Sophomore,5,The teachers are always interactive and helpful. The students are friendly and willing to help fellow students out. One thing I would like to see change is the student body reaching out and making more chat room groups to help study for classes.
Sophomore,5,I have done my entire freshman year online with Blinn and loved every second of it. The professors are helpful and flexible when it comes to online problems and personal conflicts. They answer any questions about the material promptly and clearly.
Freshman,5,"Due to Covid-19, there wasn't a lot that I experienced but when I first applied I was simply just thinking this school was just another school and that I didn't have a chance in getting in because that's the only way I think about things. I see everything as a difficult process and to be where I am with this process and the school its amazing. I highly recommend this school for getting your prerequisites. Plus its the neighbor of Texas A&M."
Freshman,5,"I haven't got a chance to explore their learning options yet, but I once had a relative attend Blinn College and he told me that being only there for a short period of time, he still had a terrific time being there as well as living the college life. He really loving the dorm life and from his perspective. I could say I would say that I would most likely love the upcoming experience myself."
Sophomore,5,"When classes got put online it was not a big learning curve, nor was it a hassle. All the professors worked hard to make sure we adjusted well to the new format of classes. My advisors called me to make sure I was handling the transition well and to see if i needed any assistance. Online classes at Blinn were new to me, but I will likely take more in the future due to the easiness of it and being able to do all the work from the comforts of my apartment."
Sophomore,5,I like how there are a ton of resources that are within your reach. The professor's are good and really strive to help students.
Graduate Student,5,All online classes I’ve taken have been very hands on and for organized for the most part. Profs are quick to respond and want to help you turn in things on time and learn.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Blinn has been wonderful, all of the professors are extremely helpful and are aware that most students attending are looking to transfer to Texas A&M. Blinn's team in admissions and advising are always there to help you through the process of transferring or figuring out what classes you need to take. The classes are also comparable to A&M, so be ready for that if you decide to attend!"
Freshman,5,"Great! At first I was worried about the idea of going online, but the teachers were quick to take action and put you on a study plan to guide you to make the best grades possible. They made sure to answer all of my emails and help with tech issues."
Freshman,5,Blinn is a very welcoming college that helps students jump into the shallow end and work to be able to swim in the deep end. The teachers take there jobs serious and teach to TEACH not to fail you. It’s a great place to start your college career.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a few classes online and my professors have been great at making sure I am not only exceeding in my classes but that I am learning to a great extent.
Niche User,5,"Blinn is exactly what I'm looking for in a junior college, as well as the experience I want to be apart of."
Freshman,5,It's a great junior college and I am so glad I chose to come here ! The teachers here really care to help you out!
Freshman,5,"Its a great place to be , and very diverse witch is something that i really enjoy. There is plenty to do on campus to keep you occupied and in sync to blinn college activities . Athletics are something i really enjoy as well , and there are always students to come and support whoever is playing every week , showing fighting spirit."
Freshman,5,I like that it's a small school and the teachers are able to help you more because the classes aren't that big.
Sophomore,5,"The professors were very friendly and helpful. I also love the fact that they have  a learning center, which had tutors for math. What I would for the college to change is to provide more lighting at the school for safety reasons."
Freshman,5,I recently completed my first semester of my freshman year it started kind of rough but in the end everything worked out the teachers really are nice and they work with you. The campus provides free sources for help on essays and other requirements for college.
Freshman,5,my experience with being at Blinn college is wonderful. The staff are amazing and so are the students that also attend Blinn. you never have to worry about not fitting in.
Sophomore,5,"I like my experience with Blinn College, I like the educators who meet you on a personal level and try to understand your needs. They help direct to the resources that can help you."
Freshman,5,The professors at the Bryan campus are amazing! They are such good teachers and offer so much help to their students. They work really hard to make sure no one gets left behind and everyone succeeds! It is also really nice being so close to Texas A&M. You get to go to all the events there and go to A&M parties and tailgates all while taking classes at Blinn.
Alum,5,"Blinn College is a great place to either start working on your core curriculum for your Bachelor's Degree, getting an Associates through one of their programs, or attending one of their technical schools. The small classroom sizes offer a better chance for you to make a connection with the professors."
Niche User,5,I'm really excited to start my journey at Blinn. They had a very quick acceptance! I am excited to start my path to becoming a Business major at Blinn College.
Sophomore,5,"I have found that Blinn College provides a decently good early college experience. As a 2 year college, it does its job of setting students up for further education well."
Freshman,5,Nice Sized campus. The Housing is really good. A lot of space and everyone in the area is nice and helpful. A small town around the campus so it’s really easy to find your favorite places
Niche User,5,I love there choir and I would love to be apart of it as well.  I got to listen to the perform at my school and it was very interesting.
Freshman,5,"Before, I started school, I was super nervous. Since, my first day the staff members have been so helpful. They have helped with getting involved with different activities and great tutoring options. I love the class size, it will help my transition to a bigger university. Also, I love how the professors know your name. It makes you feel special because at most universities they do not know who you are."
Freshman,5,I love the involvement of the staff and students here by attending extra curriculars and being around. There is so much help offered writing wise. I would recommend a bit of a change of the food.
Sophomore,5,Blinn is an affordable school Great place to study after high school graduation. I studied at Blinn in 1982-83 and went bank to see how much they had changed for good. The campus had been upgraded and now students and staffs enjoy of better education and commodities. I new that the Library will be remodeled soon and will look very modern to serve student better. It was so nice to revisit Blinn College after all those years.
Freshman,5,My experience with Blinn College has been great. I have had no trouble and when I have questions about anything they are answered right away very easily. My professors are nice people and they are very helpful through the process of transitioning into freshman year.
Freshman,5,I've not yet made it on campus for my freshman year yet but I am very excited to be starting off my college experience at blinn college.
Sophomore,5,I like Brenham because It’s Small and Everyone I met was really good people and the housing at brenham is already but mill creek is nice it’s one of the newest dorms we got and blinn is all about work   but you wanna get away blinn will always new people to the school
Sophomore,5,Blinn is a very good school but you can tended to get bored there plenty of things to do on campus but off campus that’s the story there nothing around the school to do. But the school makes the most of it by putting activities on campus for the students to participate in making the students life more fun instead of all work no play
Freshman,5,Blinn college is the perfect school for people who plan to transfer to 4 year universities or want to save money.
Sophomore,5,"The school is very nice, everything goes really well. The campus is clean and refreshing and the teachers are solid. They aren’t usually life changing or like advising but they do teach the subjects very well. The community is excellent and a wonderful place to be."
Freshman,5,"I love Blinn College. There, I said it. I came to Texas unsure of where life was going to take me, and ended up enrolling at Blinn. Fondly, Brenham is home to me in a number of ways, but Blinn takes the cake. The teachers truly care, you can tell that much. The classes are better than expected and the college itself is constantly being improved upon."
Sophomore,5,I just finished my first year of college at the new TAMU Rellis - Blinn campus with a 3.9 GPA! The new campus in Bryan/College Station is wonderful.
Freshman,5,"I love everyone here, love the college town and love the student involvement. Very friendly and honest people. I am not a fan of the traffic, however that is only a minor default. The classes aren't that hard and greek life is not bad at all. The core values of A&M transfer to Blinn and it is truly a amazing place to start before going to A&M. However the Blinn campus however isn't what A&M is, to say the least."
Freshman,5,everything is very friendly. campus is nice. staff is friendly. everything is accessible. safety is a top priority
Freshman,5,"My experience at Blinn College has been amazing. I have met some wondering, and amazing people this semester. My instructor makes sure that I stay on top of my grades. One thing that I would change about Blinn College in Bryan, Texas is that they would have a sports team."
Freshman,5,"Good classes and professors at the Bryan campus, with convenient parking and student center.  Has been a good college experience."
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the atmosphere.  Blinn is a very good college and I have friends that will attend Blinn also.  I am excited to start my college experience and to meet new friends.
Niche User,5,My visit was very interesting and very meaningful. I felt as though the dorms could have been better but they aren't completely uninhabitable. The students are very nice and the student lifestyle doesn't seem like too much of a hassle which is very good and can create a more wholesome experience for the average college student. In conclusion I feel this campus and the community is great
Freshman,5,"It was a great experience so far, it is a very welcoming place, everyone is nice and helps make you feel welcomed. It is like a home away from home and even though you are only there for two years, they make it the best two years ever while at the same time fulfilling all of your needs and wants to make sure you are good to go when it's time to move on to an university."
Sophomore,5,I like how the campus over all is small because you get to meet a lot more people. The fact that all the buildings are close it a good thing too.
Freshman,5,"its an awesome school , really like the leadership that this school takes and I really would reccommend blind college"
Sophomore,5,I am a current student at Blinn College (Bryan Campus). I would recommend this college to anyone who wants a good education without breaking the bank. Classes are affordable (and easier than ones at a 4 year).
Sophomore,5,"Taking classes my first semester, I was expecting  them to not be easy. Naturally as a student, I am a very hard worker so I put much effort into my classes. Thus, the classes themselves  were not difficult, meaning the teachers and the assignments, but rather the subject material was challenging. Taking general psychology, college algebra for science and engineering, stars and galaxies, and English, were certainly a load but the teachers were very understanding and willing to help maximize their students abilities inside and outside the classroom. Working hard for classes certainly helped me grow not only academically but intelectually. This establishment is great for students that want to test the waters first before heading to a four year university."
Sophomore,5,I liked the school...would love to see more activities...I liked the football team....I love the new dorms
Freshman,5,"Blinn College gives a cheap but good education. It is close to Texas A&M University, so there are plenty of things for students to do and people to meet."
Sophomore,5,"I love Blinn College as it fits me the best. Classes are smaller, so professors have the chance to interact and get to know all the students more. Campus is smaller than University, so you can move around easier and not get lost. The people there are helpful with your needs and willing to help in any way they can. I would love for them to offer bachelor degrees."
Sophomore,5,"I go to the Bryan campus. This is my first semester. So far, my experience has been extremely pleasant. The classes are going well, and the teachers are very good at teaching. The parking lot gets extremely congested with both cars and pedestrians, however, and it can feel a little unsafe and inconvenient. It has taken me as long as twenty minutes to get out of the parking lot before. I don't think they can do much about this, though. The campus, is in a convenient place, however, and is easy to get to."
Alum,5,"I loved Blinn! Everything was made clear for registration, I never worried about misleading information. Class sizes and teachers made the transition into college wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"Where do I began!!! The professors are fantastic. Even though I go to one of the smallest branches of Blinn, there is still so much that the school offers.  Not to mention, that every day the professors are there with a friendly smile and the staff at the front desk is willing to help you with anything you need including setting up a financial aid account.  They have been really helpful this past year and I can’t wait to start up again this upcoming year :)!"
Junior,5,The teacher added very are and available when needed. The staff and classmates are allvery each to get along with and all show respect for one another.
Niche User,4,"A good community college with decent professors and staff. Food is a little sub-par and some rules just don't make sense. Overall, a good choice to start of your college career."
Sophomore,4,ive been going to blinn on and off for about 4 yrs now and its the perfect school for anyone whos had a slow start or is trying to get back in the saddle. its also great to get your basic courses out of the way before going to a four year school because its so cheap
Sophomore,4,ive only taken a couple online classes but the ones ive done are very simple. it depends on the professor how the class is run but its all pretty similar.
Sophomore,4,"Most professors adapted to online learning fairly quickly. I only had one professor that was hard headed about it, but even then she helped as much as she could."
Sophomore,4,The few classes that I have taken online are very clear and I learn great information. Most of my professors posted videos of themselves teaching their lectures as if I was a sitting in their class with them. They also have an abundant amount of extra resources if you ever have questions or get lost in the online setting! Most of the professors reply to emails in an adequate time period.
Freshman,4,For the most part Blinn College was a very good college. I have only attended 1 year at Blinn and I will be returning in the fall. I love the campus police I had a few situations where I had to report to the BCPD. They took my prxoblems head on and took care of them right away. They do a great job at trying to keep our campus safe. I do however wish it wasn't as strict as it was. I do understand it's to keep us safe. The guest rule is a little much I believe we're in college it's hard to study or even just hang out and have a movie night if we can'thave more than one friend at a time and if they have to leave at a certain time. Weekdays is understanable but on the weekends?
Alum,4,"Online classes at Blinn can be either really good or terrible, I have taken classes where I fund it very easy to learn while not being overwhelmed by assignments. On the other hand I have taken classes where I could not keep up with the number of assignments, but I also didn't really learn the material. It really just depends on the professor, Blinn has made it possible to have a really great online environment but some professors just don't know how to truly take advantage of this."
Alum,4,"The class sizes are great, the environment on campus is very welcoming. The residence halls could use some improvement, the rules they have are ridiculous for 18-20 year olds. The cafe has good food, but not very much variety as it is just a rotation of the same thing. But overall Blinn is a great place to transition from high school to college, before moving on to a university."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled at Blinn college Bryan. I personally love the school. I will agree that some of the classes expect too much from you considering they are a junior college. I just got done with my ""freshman"" year. I was really a sophomore due to my dual credit classes. I finished with a 3.33 GPA. I have only had one problem with this college and that is because of professor Mathison. He was my business calc professor and he was the worst. He would not let us ask questions and when i went to him during his office hours to ask for help he'd turn me away and lock his door so i could not bother him. I talked to my advising counselor and eventually the dean and they said their was nothing they could do because he had the freedom to teach how he wanted. Hes also on 10 year and they cant fire him... even though he has the highest amount of drop rates across all campuses. Other then this one incident and the current construction it is a great school."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Blinn Community College has been one that is most appreciated. I am a marine veteran and blinn has helped me on becoming a better student.
Sophomore,4,"I did take classes online, and it was pretty normal. It's definitely a challenge to ensure that you're checking everything consistently, but if you are on top of it, it's easy to get the hang of. Blinn does a wonderful job of making online classes easy to navigate for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Great School, not the best parking but great education! Blinn is always making sure its students are taken care of!"
Freshman,4,"I wish that they had more of a sense of community. The school and education itself is really great and I completely suggest you going to the school for your basics or an associates. I know for my major it would help if I was able to be a part of some type of agricultural club or organization, which Blinn only offers at the Brennham campus. I went to school in Bryan so that I could try and start my community in College Station because Texas A&M is my dream school that I have wanted to go to for so long."
Sophomore,4,"This school is appropriate to begin at. I went with the intentions to transfer into Texas A&M Business School. The classes are appropriately sized and most teachers are good. There are some teachers that are more dedicated whilst others not so much. The learning is taken seriously and it is necessary to attend class. Either way, my time at Blinn has been good and I've made many new friends."
Sophomore,4,"I like Blinn College because though small, it's easy to navigate and you meet a lot of people ans see the more than you would a big college. I'd like to see it grow technology wise and newer modern buildings."
Sophomore,4,I would message the professors to try and get help with certain things and they wouldn’t message me back till after the deadline.
Sophomore,4,"Each department is very catered to teaching. Many of the professors are passionate about what they teach and help every student fully realize potential. Many of the teachers are not rude or overbearing. If anything, many of them actually help the students learn and help them understand things they are missing. 9/10"
Freshman,4,I like that the campus is small enough to introduce us to the campus but big enough to show us how a college operates.
Freshman,4,I personally think that my experience at Blinn has been a great way to introduce me to the college life and to get me ready to transfer into a university. The teachers try really hard to get you ready to go into the university and they try their best to make it easier it for you.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at blinn has been okay. I've finished my first semester off with a 4.0 and I plan to continue my next semester just as strong as my first. There are many extracurricular activities that are offered all around campus, which I personally like. The cafeteria food is usually good, but one thing I would change is better dinner options. The recreational center is very nice, and the Mill Creek dorm is very clean and spacious. I have so far enjoyed my blinn experience academically, because I have been given outstanding teachers for my calculus I, general engineering chemistry, and government classes."
Senior,4,"Affordable tuition, flexible class schedule so I am able to continue working full time. Professors are wonderful and knowledgeable."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors are great, some are awful, and some are excellent. The course work is manageable and most every professor is willing to work with you if you communicate with them. The campus life is good and everything in town is easily accessible to students."
Sophomore,4,It's a good place to start when attending college for the first time. Classes are small and personable. There's good professors here just a small handle full that's not the best. The campus is always clean and sometimes they have activities in the court yards. The parking is crazy during the beginning of the semesters but it gets better as time goes on. It's a great school and it's one of the top schools to help you transfer to Texas A&M or whichever school you're looking at.
Sophomore,4,"The instructors really seem to care, particularly in the business school. There are many opportunities for students to seek assistance, and the student leadership association is heavily involved. Blinn is one of the top transfer schools in the South, and works hard to keep their status. There are transfer fairs and workshops often that are well advertised and promoted."
Freshman,4,"So far, my first semester is stressful, but it has been a good experience. The only unfortunate thing about this semester is that I'm taking 5 courses and working as a full time student."
Junior,4,I have had no issues with this college as registration has always been a breeze and meeting with advisors to talk about my future has really helped me throughout my college years.
Sophomore,4,Blinn College is a very good school for students who aren't really sure if college is for. them. It is a two year school students will leave with their associates. Plan a small school and kind of eases students into the college life because it's not overwhelming and it has all of the elements of a normal school but just on a smaller scale. For students who just want a taste of what school is like without spending too much money.
Sophomore,4,My personal experience with Blinn for the most part has actually been somewhat enjoyable and stable. I really liked how small the campus is since I was a first year student and I get incredibly stressed by big changes in my life. I also liked how I have two amazing friends that have been there for me throughout the year. What I believe the school should change about itself is actually helping the students instead of assuming that they know everything.
Freshman,4,"I love how everyone is friendly, safety could be improved though. The campus food is good, I like how we can just swipe our card. The parking permit is extremely high and I feel should be lower."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed going to Blinn. It has been a great experience and good for accomplishing generals before moving on to another college/university. The majority of the professors want to help you and will work with you to help you be successful in class. The only thing I would change is a larger tutoring center.
Sophomore,4,"Blinn college Bryan campus is where I study. This campus is very diverse when it comes to its professors as well as its students. Diversity is something I am used to, my High school was also very diverse so I like that it reminds me a bit of home. Also I like that the professors have open hours and are able to help me one on one. It is a great college and I cannot wait to continue my studies here, and meet new people who will most likely make a positive mark on my life and help me better myself for the future. Those are just a few things that I love about Blinn College, I am positive that I will have more great experiences in my next semesters coming up."
Alum,4,"Blinn is a great community college that provides affordable education opportunities.  The school has a wide variety of technical programs, degrees, and general education classes."
Sophomore,4,Blinn boasts some excellent Professors who are difficult and caring about their students. Blinn in Bryan has no sports teams or dorms.
Sophomore,4,"Blinn is an older campus, and some of the facilities reflect that. The charm that it offers, however, is second to none. The professors in my experience are great, and the classes offered are diverse. I actually enjoy eating in the dining hall (get the cookies). I lived in the student housing apartments which aren't bad at all, and the privacy offered was worth the extra expense. Courses are inexpensive which makes my time here all the more worth it, and I've heard transferring credits is easy with Blinn compared to other schools."
Freshman,4,"A good college for those who wish to start on attaining higher education. Blinn is also affordable, which helps relieve the troubles that many young adults face regarding student loans."
Freshman,4,Blinn classes offered a lot of easy programs. It was easy to communicate with the professors if there was anything I was confused on.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a senior in high school, however I have already signed my letter of intent to play soccer at Blinn College. When I visited the campus... I immediately fell in love. I knew that I could see myself attending Blinn for the next 2 years, regardless of me being a student-athlete or not. Being able to be a part of the athletic program is definitely a plus, but I know that Blinn is the best choice for me regardless."
Freshman,4,"One thing that I loved about Blinn was that the students made you feel like family. Also because of the small, junior college campus it was easy making friends. The whole town of Brenham is amazing. Brenham has tons of chooses for food and plus have some good grocery stores such as HEB and Wall-Mart. The only thing that wasn't my favorite were the dorms. They are very old and it shows. Other than that everything else is pretty average. The professor teach just like any other college. They'll give their lecture than you are responsible for the rest."
Freshman,4,I've had the been a Blinn for a whole semester and I'm fixing to be done with my 2nd semester. I've enjoy Blinn so much. I was able to make friends and meet people from all over the world. The classes are very helpful especially the learning center. One thing I think they should change is there food choice. Different things should be offered on both sides of the cafes but overall Blinn isn't a bad college. Can't to see what the Fall 2019 semester brings.
Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience with Blinn, I'm excited to start my journey towards a higher education!"
Alum,4,I live off campus and commute to class and have no problem navigating through campus. The Brenham campus is small most buildings are in walking distance. I like the nostalgic feeling of some classrooms being in the original buildings. The only problem I have had is delayed response from the financial aid department.
Sophomore,4,"Blinn College is a great option for students who need either an easier transition to a 4 year university or who simply cant afford 4 year right away. Their small classrooms makes learning personal and easier on any student. If you do not understand a certain topic or discussion within the classroom, the professors in my experience at Blinn are very helpful and encourage you to come in for office hours. The only thing that I would change is there parking situation but other than that I think this college is an exceptional choice for any student."
Freshman,4,"The band program will get you on your feet and wake you up into reality and get you ready for when you transfer to a university. Academically, be careful with some of the teachers on campus some will teach and help you along the way and others talk about their terrible life or are not able to wrap up a side conversation and continue with the class."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Blinn College in Bryan and I am loving it so far! The only thing is when I was signing up for classes I did not know anything about the professors or their teaching styles. Some of them were great for the way I learn, but I had a few classes that just did not work for me. Overall it is a great school and I recommend Blinn as a starting point for anyone who is just starting their college career."
Freshman,4,"Out of all the community colleges I could have attended I'm glad I chose Blinn. It's still in a college environment, the campus is nice, you'll always find someone to help you out with anything, and the teachers are great and up to standard. Blinn gives you a great educational experience and they only want success for their students."
Niche User,4,Very good professors that interacted with me and taught very well. Is a great option in entering 4 year universities.
Freshman,4,"Going to Blinn's financial aid office in Bryan, TX was a very confusing process. They had me going back and forth for two months just to get paperwork done. Other than that, their advisors helped me pick great classes for my first semester!"
Freshman,4,"The Professors are easy to talk to and are always in good spirits. I don't live on campus but I know the area is good. The workload is manageable so that is a good thing. I am only a freshman so I can't say about the return on investment. The diversity of the campus is really good, there are people from all walks of life."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed that they offer a reasonable amount of online classes for the students who are working full time. Also they are starting to offer Saturday courses, so if you are a person who has decided to go back to school but still have to work they have great options for you."
Freshman,4,"Blinn College Bryan campus is an exceptional college if you are entirely focused on your academics. If you are looking to expand your horizons in a social aspect through college, it is not the place. If you are trying to achieve a commendable GPA however, do go."
Alum,4,I think its a very economical decision to attend Blinn College. Spend less money and get the same education (from many of the same teachers) as you would in your first two years at Texas A&M.
Sophomore,4,I have only been here for one semester and now starting the second semester I think I will like it here. I am becoming an engineer and blinn college is helping me to become what I want to be.
Freshman,4,"It is a good college, you mainly have to know how to pick your professors to get the best experience from it."
Alum,4,"Love this area! College is affordable, and the classes are small which makes success in your classes much more attainable. The area is nice and close to College Station that has pretty much anything you could need food, drink, and fun wise."
Freshman,4,I like it's small but big. I like the safety I feel walking to my classes. It's not a party seen..which I would like more student gathering.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the courses, and the academic level the profs hold the students accountable. I really enjoy the services the university offers, I do with the library had more conference rooms for students to hold bigger study meetings."
Sophomore,4,"I'm actually on the Bryan campus and accepted in the ADN program.  This school is very established and reasonably priced.  Only reason to give it four stars and not five is that if you don't live in Brenham, you have to pay out of district tuition, even though the Blinn campus in Bryan is the largest."
Freshman,4,"I haven’t been at Blinn long but I already know I love it! It offers great educational programs  as well as surrounding students in an outstanding learning environment! It’s located in a great area too! There isn’t much I would change and the things I would are minor. I’m a bit stingy here and there on things so it’s moreso something that only bother me. Overall I do enjoy my time at Blinn, though however short it’s been!"
Sophomore,4,"When I first came to Blinn College, I thought I wasn't going to have a good experience. I was wrong, during , my first year in Blinn, I made a lot of new friends, and joined two clubs like the Gaming Society and the Art Club, both of which I recently became the new president. The classes are very interesting and mind blowing! If you're looking for a junior college for a nice start, Blinn College is for you."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at Blinn College. The professors are very nice and always willing to help. The classes are well taught and a good size.
Sophomore,2,"I have had ups and downs during my time at Blinn. Going to advisors for help when registering is questionable so I recommend taking the time to figure out classes to take yourself. I have had really amazing professor that did nothing by help the students improve and succeed. I have also had professors that seem to be there mostly for a paycheck. Unfortunately I have had more bad professors than good. I intend to transfer to A&M but I often feel like I am stuck in a circle and not progressing in my degree plan at all. Most people that I talk to feel the same. Although this is a 2 year college, I come across people who have been trying to transfer for 3+ years."
Sophomore,2,"In my experience some of the advisers in the advising office of Blinn College Bryan Texas campus do not care in helping you choose the best courses for you nor do they help much in helping you decide what's best. They suggest something to you without actually answering all your questions, and when trying to get advised to schedule classes not very many advisers are helpful with that either, to insure you are picking the best courses for your success."
Sophomore,2,"Blinn College is rated one of the least satisfactory colleges in the state of Texas. From what I understand, Blinn College lacks atmosphere. There is little to no handicap equipment available on campus. The food is very repetitive.  The area is rough and a bit sketchy. This campus also has very little activities to participate in on campus, and the majority of the staff here do not take their jobs seriously. I would not recommend this school to anyone who wishes to experience what it is really like to be in a college town."
Sophomore,2,Blinn is a good stepping stone to a 4 year university. The teachers are helpful and nice and the small class sizes help you improve academically. I think the parking for Blinn is extremely overpriced but the tuition is reasonable and the campus is and nice and safe.
Sophomore,2,Administration lack the knowledge or training to properly prepare and guide students to transfer. Blinn feels like attending a high school with the small classes and professors that complain about their salaries to students. There are hardly an existing clubs or organizations to join for transfer applications.
Sophomore,2,I take online courses with them. I have had some good teachers and some terrible ones. What really getd me is how Blinn gouges you with extra fees and materials that they do not talk about before registering. Overall i would go to a different school if it wasnt my last credit.
Freshman,2,I was really surprised by the lack of diversity on the Blinn/Brenham campus. There are also very few social activities.
College Sophomore,2,The professors do not have compassion for single working moms that are trying to make it.
College Sophomore,2,It is a lot of academic competition that prevents students from progressing in their chosen career such as the nursing program.
Recent Alumnus,2,I ended up paying for classes I didn't even need now I can't get help paying for the last class I need.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is nearly impossible to get financial aid
College Freshman,2,There aren't very many post-grad services to begin with at my school.
College Freshman,2,I don't feel like Blinn prepares you for the future of careers for the students.
College Freshman,2,I am not getting an actually degree from this community college so none of this applies.
College Freshman,2,Blinn is just a community College. There is nothing special about it. Which is why I am transferring to TCU for the Fall of 2016. I am excited for a bigger school with sports and more of the college feel!!!
College Junior,2,"Honestly, because it's just  community college, there arent many choices of classes that I can take for my major. However, I can get my basics for my major's plan for a cheaper price than at a university."
College Junior,2,Not much for environmental geoscience
College Freshman,2,"Besides waiting 5 hours tired and hungry and on the verge of wetting myself, the advisor i spoke to was incredibly unhelpful. The FASFA forms don't tell you what parts of the year they actually cover (paperwork=not straight forward). NO ONE could offer to help me fill out paperwork i had questions on! Don't expect any help from this college."
College Freshman,2,I would rate their educational system but i don't have any basis. Since i haven't started yet due to misinformation from their admissions and financial aid departments.
College Freshman,2,"From the little interaction i have had with Blinn College, I can say that they have a lot they need to improve on. Not only in their facilities, but their staff needs to be properly trained. I feel like every time i go up there no one has a clue what is going on. They are not helpful and they are rude to boot. I can't wait to transfer."
College Junior,2,Many of the same race.
College Freshman,2,"The school's tuition and financial aid process has room for improvement. As I was an incoming freshman at Blinn College, I applied and was granted financial aid for the Fall/Spring semesters. As the Fall semester was about to begin, my pell grant was dropped due to being ""unqualified"" because of a change in my application that I never made. The financial aid advisors and department were no help and are not straightforward with their words and department. I lost several thousands of dollars due to their lack of help. I feel that my education at Blinn college is not receiving it's full worth of tuition that I am paying."
College Freshman,2,"Its nothing like being on the A&M campus, no one really talks to you or tries to help you.  Everyone

sticks to themselves.  That part I hate..."
College Sophomore,2,Post-grad services are non-existent at this school.
College Sophomore,2,Fianancial aid office didn't help me at all. I never got financial aid even after they told me I had everything in but I checked online and i said I was missing something. So I went to the oice and asked and they told me nothing was missing
College Freshman,2,No real connection with people at the school I go to school and only talk with people I knew from High School
College Senior,2,The admissions department is okay. They are kind of rude and not all that helpful at times. It seems like they don't like college kids but they need a job so they work there.
College Sophomore,2,There is no athletic center just a place to play ping pong and pool.
College Junior,2,"Only at the main Blinn campus in Brenham are there athletics. The student center is alright, a couple mediocre food places that say they're healthy, but in actuality they're just the same as going to a fast food place, a bunch of tables and chairs to eat and do homework, a couple TV's, and a pool table and ping pong table. The library is pretty good, though. There aren't many campus activities that go on. I saw a flyer on one door about a Thanksgiving dinner, but no one I knew was going to go. Mainly the campus is used to go to class and to go home. Having to stay there longer than necessary is a real bummer."
College Junior,2,"To me, there are only a few types of students at Blinn. The first kind: The student who wanted to go to Texas A&M University, but were not accepted, so they go to Blinn until they can get into A&M. The second kind: The really weird students who really don't care where they are, they just want go to college because that's what they know and that's what their friends did. They hangout in groups and dress really weird and shun themselves from the rest of the student body. And the third kind: The students who are going to Blinn as their first choice in order to better themselves, possibly just because they want to do better than their parents did. They want to prove themselves, or make their family happy."
College Junior,2,"Getting through the financial aid process with Blinn is hard enough on a college student, but then it takes ages for the refund to actually go through and get back to the student! The financial aid system at Blinn is a joke."
College Junior,2,"Blinn College is more of a group of building that contain different compartments for learning, rather than a thriving, social place to learn and make friends. It's like you just go there for the allotted time of your classes and go home. You keep to yourself mostly, and you just want to get in and get out. They are trying to promote clubs and activities, which is good, but I feel as if it is just not catching on. I mean, they just need to see it for what it is: a community college. The best part, I believe, are the professors. They are so dedicated and involved in what they teach. It's not just a job for them, it's their lives."
College Junior,2,"There is not much recognition for a Music major at Blinn College in Bryan, Texas. I am currently taking core classes that I need, in case I decide to change my majors, since the Music major is not really relevant here or at Texas A&M."
College Sophomore,2,"When it comes to career services, it is so confusing and often leaves a student feeling alienated. The campus counselors are very little help (and yes, I've gone to more than one of them) and the career and student days are mostly for people looking to transfer to a specific university. (Texas A&M)"
College Freshman,2,there are no post grad options at blinn college.  there is no alumni network that im aware of because it is a two year school
College Senior,2,Online classes need more student teacher interaction. They also need a quicker response time to students that are in need of help. 
College Freshman,2,Most buildings are gross and contain bugs. 
College Freshman,2,Blinn is nothing special at all. :) so yeah I don't know what else to say
College Freshman,2,not that many time that a class can be given at and cost way too much
College Sophomore,2,"The internet wifi is not up to good standards, but it is alright to do work on."
College Sophomore,2,"The unique part is that being a small college, you have tutors available at anytime."
College Sophomore,2,"This semester I am taking 18 hours and also in organizations like the Phi Theta Kappa, the English Honor Society, and Math Honors Society here at Blinn. I am able to balance all of these classes and extracurricular activities without a strain. This is due to organization and help from my professor here as well. They explain the assignment were you are able to understand and do it."
College Sophomore,2,"I am having a financial struggle at this point and I have not received much help. I was told that there was money out here, but when I go, and ask I am told that there is not. The value of tuition is indeed work my educational experience otherwise."
College Sophomore,2,There are not much advertisement at this school for people in my field.
College Junior,2,We pretty much just have basic classes that will eventually help you move up to a university. 
College Junior,2,Campus life is okay when you have friends to hang out with other then that its not really anything  to do. We don't have like a cool hang out study place to go to so most people just do their own thing.
College Junior,2,When i got my balance for my school it kept going up almost every month and i didn't understand why. After i continued to look for scholarships and grants i was always denied they told me they didn't offer anything like that.
College Junior,2,The student body at my school is okay as well its smaller so most everybody knows almost everybody so that can be a good thing or a bad thing. We don't have much school spirit i don't ever really see school banners.I don't even know what clubs we have.
College Junior,2,"I think Blinn College is an okay school they could be better with helping you financially. The school doesn't have a lot of scholarship opportunities. The counselors can be kind of rude you have to catch them on a good day. The school is just like high school but it does have its perks as well its a small campus so easy to walk around, and some teachers are very nice and helpful."
College Sophomore,2,"My major is nursing and I intent to apply to the Associate Nursing  Degree program as soon as I finish my prerequisites. So far if has been a tough time due to my financial aid being taken away because I haven't met their academic progress requirements for assistance. I only have been able to take one class the past couple semesters, because my appeal keeps being denied. I could only afford to pay for one class at a time. All because in the Spring 2012 semester I mistakenly decided to sign up for 3 classes. As a non-traditional student and single mother I didn't quite expect Biology and Psychology to be such a challenge; Also, being that I hadn't taken Biology since high school. I hope that when I appeal again, I can meet the assistance requirements for the spring 2014 semester. Right now i'm currently taking a philosophy class and a study skills class to help me boost my GPA."
College Sophomore,2,There are not many part time jobs on campus for students without taking away from your financial aid.
College Junior,2,"There really isn't an alumni network. I think the athletic departments keep up with former athletes, but there really isn't anything set up to keep contact with average students."
College Junior,2,"The classes are easy, but transferring credits is so hard because you can request them to send a transcript 5-10 times and it will not be done. They are very unorganized."
College Junior,2,"It is very diverse, but no one is really involved. Most people are just trying to get it over with and graduate."
College Senior,2,"Financial aid has given lots of people trouble when they get money back from the school, but they help if you get the money from somewhere else. Tuition is also high for a community college."
College Senior,2,Accepting but not interested in others. More involved in other schools than own.
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the classes offered aren't really within my major, my major is Pharmacy, and though they do offer Science classes, they are just general courses."
College Senior,2,"Tuition is okay, but everyone pays out of district tuition because the main school is in a different county which isn't right when you live in the same county that you are going to school at. The Financial Aid at Blinn does ts job very well. I am very pleased at the financial aid office."
College Senior,2,Blinns computers are always available. On the other hand the wifi is not always working. Most of the time it is slow
College Junior,2,"To Many Drop Outs – Most of the people that come, just come to get the money,or just to say there in college. They take just enough hours to say they a full time student, and staying on campus. Most just hang outside, like its high school all over again."
Freshman,1,Never took online here but was on computer to write papers. There is a chat room but the cops would give a parking ticket before you got away
Sophomore,1,BRYAN CAMPUS- Ever since things have shifted due to COVID-19 it has been a complete nightmare. I never know if I am supposed to login and go online or be there in person. When I do try to login to go to class online it never works. I call the HELP DESK only to be told they can not HELP!!! I call the IT department only to be sent to voicemail and get a call back a day later when I need to get access to that class that very second. Professors do not care they are stressed AF to and some of the professors were not even trained on how to do the online format. THIS SCHOOL NEEDS TO DO BETTER IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL. I pay 400$ a month to teach myself. I cry every day due to feeling like a failure and not knowing how to deal with their horrible attitudes.

Sophomore,1,"I really dislike everything about this place except for one coveted jewel. Mr. Born is a teacher here for history and he's the only reason that this place even gets a star. The people around are sketchy, rude, manipulative, and just generally terrible people. There's of course a few good folk, and some of the teachers aren't bad. The area is also sketchy and not the best, and there's not much to do either. There have been shootings here that I didn't even know about until months later because it's kept so hush-hush by administration. People have been kidnapped, raped, and far worse here. Cars broken into. They have it all. I'm telling you that if it weren't for Born, this place would be set into the deepest darkest part of my mind to never remember ever again."
Freshman,1,"Advising is terrible. They put me in random classes not associated with my major and the professors here suck so much. A lot of the curriculum, especially in online classes, does not match with the quizzes or tests. Some profs just give you answers on reviews for tests and such because it's difficult to know what's important to know and what's not. Education is terrible and boring. I loved school all my life, but after a month at Blinn, I thought about dropping almost everyday I was there. Whoever manages complaints doesn't do their job at all. So many of my friends say that people smoke weed and are rowdy in their dorms very often and have reported their dormmates many times, but almost nothing happens. There is also no student life worth mentioning. Events happen, but no one goes. Blinn is really lifeless and not worth the money unless you need to go here."
Graduate Student,1,I absolutely hated Blinn Brenham. There are few descent professors on campus. The others don’t care nor take their jobs seriously. Advisors purposely enroll you in classes that you do not need because It’s all about the money. I’ve wasted a lot of money here. Very repetitive food. Little to no diversity. Very little activities/clubs to join. Definitely would not recommend!
College Junior,1,I have not seen any post-grad services.
College Junior,1,"once again, I think I have already answered all of these questions."
College Junior,1,I think I have already answered these questions lol.
College Junior,1,I HATE THE COUNCILORS AT BLINN. THEY ARE TERRIBLE.
College Sophomore,1,This school is extremely disorganized. I'm behind due to the advisors at my school telling me to take classes that I don't even need for my major.
College Freshman,1,I work two jobs and was hoping for more online options. They didn't deliver. Neither did they afford a wider range of class times or varying of days. I can't make it to class mon-fri. I have TWO JOBS.
College Freshman,1,"To put it simply, If I could just go straight to A & M, I would."
College Freshman,1,"I got fined for being ""out of district"" even though i live LITERALLY 10 blocks from my school, have applied for mostly online classes, and have lived at the same address for TWO YEARS. Tell me how i am out of district."
College Freshman,1,"Again, i have no basis. I just got back from the aid office. They told me that i couldn't be supported even though i have been independent from my parents for nearly three years and have been financial independent for more than four. Somehow, when filling out FAFSA 15-16,  it wasn't mentioned anywhere that it doesn't actually cover all of 2015. How would I know that? It's not stated on any of the forms that i would be screwed if i wanted to start school during the summer of 2015, when i've already registered and missed any deadline for scholarships for this summer! What part of I'm poor and COMPLETELY support myself and am under 24 does the GOVERMENT NOT UNDERSTAND!!! Thanks, y'all helped so much."
College Freshman,1,"Blinn didn't charge and didn't judge- so no comments on them.

A&M and Baylor charged $75 to apply and it was ALL about 1 #, nothing about what you had to offer the school

they didn't even read my essays"
College Sophomore,1,Online work was really confusing and it kept messing up
College Freshman,1,I don't like that you have to log in three times just to get to email.
College Freshman,1,"Computer labs: Not used
Printing on campus: Never tried 
Network reliability: horrible!!! 
Network speed: okay
Wireless access: Difficult
"
College Freshman,1,"Blinn College, being a two year college is not the best for career networking or jobs "

Alum,5,I had a great time with the online classes. What it comes down to is how is your time management. Are you a slacker that puts things off until the end or are you regimented? I was a little bit of both. When push came to shove I had to just dedicate an hour every night to studying. That way I could see if I forgot to do something or realize I had to buckle down to get some projects done. I finished out with a 4.0 my last semester going full time online. Maybe over did it a little but the results were what I was looking for.
Sophomore,5,My online experience with Palm Beach State is excellent actually. The professors  are very understanding if we run into some type of issues or if we just can not make it to class and vice versa. At times it can be a little hard to stay focused but the professors make class interested by playing music and just engaging us to participate. Me personally I prefer online learning than face to face!
Sophomore,5,"My experience at this college has been extremely positive overall. As far as my specific objectives are concerned, this campus has everything. Yes, a library would be a great addition, but we still have a lot of resources close by/at our fingertips. Plus, the gym has been revamped, the cafeteria is changing vendors over the summer, the parking lot is being updated...lots of good things are happening to improve the facilities for the students. The best thing about this school, however, is the caliber of its teachers. With very few exceptions, all the professors I have encountered here are wonderful human beings who are fully invested in their students and their success.

Junior,5,"I literally call Palm Beach State College my second home because of the environment being so homey! I love PBSC because the class sizes are an intimate size of the maximum number of twenty students and most of the professors make time for one-on-one sessions just in case the student need the extra help to understand the concept or method being presented to them. PBSC professors also make time for their students when they are going through something and just need someone to talk to. There are many resources available for PBSC students to use because of the college partnering with many vendors and non-profit organizations. Resources such as housing, food stamps, school clothing store, food pantry, medical services, and much more. Every six months, the health department comes to the college to provide free HIV, blood pressure, and other tests to all PBSC students and the community."
Junior,5,"When having to transfer on-campus classes to online classes due to the pandemic alarming the campus and to my surprise, the college was able to transfer the classes to strictly online very quickly!

Sophomore,5,"The classes and teachers are based on understanding and learning better every day, about online classes is very good although for my part I prefer to have face-to-face classes since that way I learn better and I know more people and about my university environment. In this way, the college helps me to develop in important moments and there will always be the help of other people such as teachers, workers and collaborators since there are several parts in which one can undertake for a better future."
Sophomore,5,"The experience with Palm Beach State College is wonderful, learning is based on understanding and helping one another is an experience that teaches one to grow and be able to undertake a better future."
Junior,5,Professors were interested in students learning and able to apply in real life. The campus was clean and security was always present. It made me feel secure when taking courses at night. The library resources where always available and staff made it simple and easy to find.

Sophomore,5,"If you are financially able to go to a university then this is the college to go to. Even the first class is a scam in a way because it's teaching how to use the college's website and just writing goals for our future. But overall, my experience is good,had some rough starts due to not having a job at first but I'm now I'm starting to take more classes and starting to have great friendships with not only my classmates but my professors as well."

Freshman,5,"Before to start online classes,  I was worried about it because I am so bad with tecnology. I did not have any options but learn.  After taking my online course , which help me to understand how to manage my online classes, I decided to enroll myself in summer online classes full time. Nowadays, I am very confidence about my classes online. My  professors are amazing, and they are patience. They speak clear , and they are organized. They usually record every class, so they send us a video of our class after our face to face meeting. We have an online platform, and it is called blackboard! All the information that we need, we can find it in blackboard, so I have my weekly assignments in it. Also, I can see my grades in blackboard; moreover, I can complete my test,homework , and some practice. We also have lab assignments, which is easy to complete  online. After all , studying online has several advantages; for example, I do not spend gas and time to drive to the school."

Freshman,5,"its a nice campus with great diversity and professors but I'm sure they don't do housing because its a community college, but overall the campus is so big and beautiful from the library to its theater."
Freshman,5,"So far I'm taking three online classes during the summer, right after I graduated high school. I was in fear that I wouldn't receive the true college experience, but over time, I've grown to like and accept it. It's easy to navigate through applications, and by staying home lots of time and money are saved."
Freshman,5,"I've only gone to PBSC online due to covid-19. However, my teachers are very supportive and open to assisting students with any issues. They don't have the stigma of letting a student fend for themselves. Opportunities are given to engage with the community and it's great to see that they encourage this. The staff makes sure students are travelling down the right path to a successful future."
Sophomore,5,PBSC is an excellent community college in my area. I learned a lot from class to class. Thank you very much!

Amber P, a career advisor at this campus is outstanding and beyond helpful. I would love to see some change though, I wish the school would exchange community service hours for unpaid student balances. It would make a lot of sense and offer lots of positivity in the community."
Freshman,5,Palm Beach State College has been a good experience although I enjoy it because I'm in and out and its cheep the professors accents can be hard to understand at the time.
Freshman,5,Personally I’ve found Palm each state to be a great two year public college and great way to start my academic career. Along with this it is a great transition school as I look toward the future for my graduate program. Overall they deliver on everything but don’t expect something super exciting.
Sophomore,5,Palm beach state is a great school it’s open to anyone that’s willing to complete their career. This school has a lot of activities during the day after your class you can stop by any table that’s out sign up for activities join groups and etc. this college also has jobs you can apply for & gives scholarships out to those who don’t have enough to pay for their classes .
Sophomore,5,palm beach state is a good school and I learned that everyone their will help you and get what you need.

The only thing I personally would like to see change or improve is more class buildings, and bigger classrooms."
Sophomore,5,"Although I will be transferring to FAU soon, I will miss Palm Beach State. I had a great experience attending this school. Between the professors, the courses, and the inexpensive cost I would 100% recommend other kids to attend this school. The Professors were always available to help you understand the lessons that are being taught at any time. The advisors were amazing and guided me with the classes I needed to take for my major and my future plans. I was also impressed to see how much extracurriculars they provided students with in order to engage with other students and enjoy the ""college"" experience."
Sophomore,5,Greatest two years of my life. All of my professors loved what they did. Always so open to speak to me and help me. Getting in contact with advisers were simple. The students were all so kind and encouraging. There were always things to attend to on campus. The free tutoring was the GREATEST help.
Freshman,5,"Palm Beach State College is one of many community colleges that gives new you challenges every day. It all depends on how you handle them. The people on campus encourage you in every way possible to get aid. There's always someone willing to help you instead of me stressing myself out trying to do things on my own. The motive for PBSC is to see everyone do great and maintain success. Everywhere you look there's always activities to get the students more involved in the community. I love how the students are the main focus of the college, its been great so far I feel secured, had a few bumps here and there but i had people to help me with things I didn't quite comprehend. Palm Beach State College is more than ""normal"" it's different unique i could say."
Freshman,5,"Although it is only a state school and not a university, they do the best they can to make sure every student is given a fighting chance at their dreams and goals in school."
Alum,4,I attended this school on a off again for nine years. I was on three different campuses and took online classes as well. I saw everything was to see. I enjoyed my time there. A majority of the professors I had were very receptive to working with you as long as you took them and their classes seriously. Student life is very involved and a lot of different programs started to emerge like study abroad while I was leaving. It was a great and cheaper alternative to getting thru my general education credits.
Sophomore,4,I took classes online and my professors would always make online easier by sending helpful videos and notes and being able to further explain the topics.
Sophomore,4,"Palm Beach State College is a small yet very efficient college. We are a 4 year public college that have amazing programs. The nursing program, ROTC, and mathematics program are one of the best. If you small and not a lot of people palm beach state college is for you. We put on events to engage students, we have a fitness center for students to attend, and we do sports events."
Freshman,4,"My experiences with Palm Beach State College has been nice so far. I'm experiencing an online experience, however I don't mind too much, as I feel like I am still learning in class. There is nothing in mind of what I want to think of changing for this college, however."
Freshman,4,"My online experience so far is fair, at least. My instructors go over the work the best way they can online, they teach us proper note taking, time managing, and studying effectively. Although it may not be in person, I've handled online in my high school fairly, so college is nothing too different. My college experience hasn't been stressful, thank goodness; this is only the beginning, but so far it has been a fun ride!"
Sophomore,4,Classes online were very good.Teachers were very professional and we’re very understanding with everything that was happening in the world they gave us multiple chances on quizzes and homework.
Senior,4,"At first I was struggling with the online version of Palm Beach State, but this semester they really stepped it up. The online lectures make you feel like you're actually in the classroom.  The professors create a great learning atmosphere and encourage participation. They will call on you to answer questions throughout the class to ensure you are still paying attention."
Sophomore,4,It can be a bit difficult if you do not have teacher that's good with technology. Overall I think how they use the system with blackboard is actually pretty good.
Sophomore,4,"It is honestly a pretty good school, and the cost is also not a huge cost either. It is an affordable education, and what is great is that they have multiple locations in Florida. Sometimes the type of teacher can depend on the location, so I would say do your research before finalizing which professor you will have for the subject you need to take."
Freshman,4,"During these strange and unusual times, classes have been altered to a remote setting. As I am changing with the times and am having to be more tech savy  my transition into this new experience is slowly happening. I am not one of those students who are tech savy,  so making this transition is a little bit difficult. The professors at Palm Beach State College are also making these transitions as well so they are doing there best to help out the students."
Sophomore,4,"To whom it may concern, I hope this application finds you in good health during these challenging times.
My name is Jovan Hayes. One of my principal concerns as a human is improving my condition with regards to fitness, which is why this job opportunity interests me. My knowledgeable nature with regards to health and wellness, fitness, and nutrition is elucidated through my extensive background in sports, my academic background, and my own independent research. I have taken a nutrition class where I learned about concepts such as nutrition labels, the different types of nutrients, and nutrition during pregnancy. I have also written papers which explore the dietary benefits of veganism. Moreover, by virtue of the fact that I am starting another nutrition class this fall, I am in a unique position to continually provide insightful emails as I gain even more knowledge on general health and wellness from my studies. I hope this brief account aids you in your decision.
All the best,
Jovan"
Sophomore,4,"Palm Beach State College provides a lot of value for the sticker price. Competent Professors and Adjuncts are plentiful, the Lake Worth campus is nice, and there are lots of resources there for students (e.g. free tutoring, a Wellness Center, clubs, etc.). The college's transition to online learning in March was done pretty well and they have maintained a strong hold on that. Classes run smoothly online and The College has been communicative with the students by posting COVID updates on a dedicated part of the website. The Honors College, however small and limited by its low amount of class options, has competent teachers who seem to go the extra mile for you. A great college choice for medical students  (Nursing or Dentists) and also just a great choice for those who want a cheap A.A. that doesn't come from a garbage school. This college definitely gets the job done well so that you can transfer to a new university/college for your major-specific courses!"
Sophomore,4,"I have not occur any problem with my online class , I think if student are having bad experience with online classes it depend on the professor and how they prepare for the student ."

Niche User,4,"I have only been there a couple of times due to things I needed to get done for my high school requirements, but the little experience I have had with this school and what I have heard from it I have loved. The admissions office is pretty close to the front and easy to find, the workers there are super helpful and understanding, the campus is huge and open. It also has my major and is very close to where I live at the moment. Not a lot of colleges have the Interior Design major I want to study so it works out."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently a freshman at Palm Beach State College, and overall I'd say its been pretty good. I've receive many aid from advisors, and I love how flexible it is. Reason I'm giving a 4 star is because there's always ways for improvement, despite my compliment."

Sophomore,4,"I love there front desk workers the students of course they are so sweet and helpful, very patient one student stayed on the phone with me until I can log back in my student account because I forgot my password. They should keep hiring student for front desk keep up the work!"

Alum,4,"I liked how diverse and inclusive the school was. There was a group of friends for everyone no matter the race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation."
Junior,4,Palm beach state has a lot of great resources for students. I have used their library data base countless times for peer reviewed articles. I love that I can use their data base any where by simply logging in to panther web. I am so happy to have PBSC so close to home while still receiving a quality education.
Junior,4,I love that all online classes have the same basic format. Professors are usually always available and eager to help. I enjoy taking the classes at my own pace from the comfort of my phone.

Alum,4,"My online experience with Palm beach state was good. It was very easy to navigate. I found it easier to take classes online because you can do it at your own pace; however, they do give you deadlines and have to manage your time wisely. The student learning center at Palm Beach state is also a great place to go if you need help. The staff is very friendly and is always willing to help you. Just make sure you make an appointment in advance."
Junior,4,"Palm Beach State College is an amazing affordable way to transition into the college life and education. The professors are very flexible and understanding when you first enter as a freshman. I love it so much I decided to get my Bachelors Degree here in one of their 3 Bachelor Programs! The professors genuinely care about your success and want you to do well so they are always there to help! Also, the Boca Raton campus has 3 buildings so theres no chance you can get lost! Nothing but great things to say about this college."
Sophomore,4,My online experience was easier in a way but also a little hard because there’s a communication barrier. I’d email a teacher and of course they won’t respond right way. That’s the one annoying thing with online classes. Other than that PBSC has made it an enjoyful experience
Sophomore,4,I liked the professors and the students are all really nice. One thing I’d like to see change is being able to take the nursing pre-admission test more than 3 times a year.
Sophomore,4,Palm Beach State has been such a great school to study at. The professors are able to breakdown the material so that every students is able to understand as well as genuinely nice people.

Niche User,4,This is a very good starting school for college and allows you to take a glimpse of higher education before actually indulging into the universities.
Freshman,4,"Palm beach state is great for anyone who isn't ready to experience a big university. I started palm beach state as a junior by taking dual enrollment classes. Now, as a senior, I take all my classes at the college. I am happy I decided to start college at palm beach state before going off to a university. I was able to start earning college credits without having to leave home. The classroom setting was perfect, there aren't filled with 200 students and the professors know who you are.  Everyone is helpful, from the academic advisors to the students if you need help all you have to do is ask. I knew that coming from high school to college in less than 2 months wasn't going to be easy, but palm beach state was a great way for me to get a feel of college life, without the pressures of a university."
Sophomore,4,"Palm Beach State College has an adequate class size that benefits the individual needs of each student to a professor. When a student is unable to find what they need or cannot afford it, or do not have access for any reason, then there are several resources available around campus for our use, and most of it is free as it is under tuition. The factor that Palm Beach State should consider doing is getting more free resources available, especially ones that are in high-demand for students and run out easily, and to seek more involvement around student activities, such as clubs and sports."
Alum,4,"Palm Beach State College is a very easy college to attend, very easy to navigate and so many people here to help you out, and the best beginner college overall, the only thing I would want changed in this collage is to have more parking."

Senior,4,"Palm Beach State courses are fit for those fresh out of high school, it is a nice experience for individuals obtaining a 2-year AA degree.  Advisers are their to help you determine which career path you are most interested in along with credited transfer credits to attend the university of your choice."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have had a wonderful experience with PBSC. I was truly impressed by the dedication, commitment, and kindness each of my professors have shown. I consider myself quite blessed knowing that every single professor I have taken were all invested in their students - when it comes to both knowledge and grades. The students and staff have been friendly, helpful, and patient. The only reason I have given it a 4/5 is because I do feel that it lacks in student activities as well as the counseling department. However, I feel most colleges and universities vary when it comes to counseling and advising - and each experience is subjective."
Graduate Student,4,"My overall experience at Palm Beach State College was great. Compared to a private school that I attended, the attention to students and the classes were more organized."
Sophomore,4,"I have been attending Palm Beach State College since my senior year of high school. My overall experience has been very good. It is a very affordable college, but they still offer a top notch education. The teachers are very helpful and confident in their abilities. They always point you in the right direction and make themselves available to you as much as they can. The school also offers many resources. The student learning center is one of the best resources at the school. It is a free tutoring center for students to get help with homework or test prep. The tutors there are well experienced and very helpful. The school also has many clubs to join and offers many free, on-campus activities. I don't have anything bad to say about this college."
Niche User,4,"We are Parents of a College freshman. The registration process was seamless. The FASFA application was daunting and resulted in No financial aid for our Family. 
The Schools financial office was not able to offer us any more information about the status of the financial aid decision package,"
Freshman,4,I like the environment Palm Beach State College provides to their students. There is always parking and I am able to utilize the FAU library due to the fact both colleges share the same campus.
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty good, but for students that are not consistently active. The college could have more reach and provide more of an experience."
Freshman,4,"The schools are very welcoming and open to everyone. They provide food on occasion for free to promote clubs and other activities. The schools have a ""hub"" where you can meet new people and play video games with friends. The atmosphere is great. The teachers are understanding but still firm so that you aren't being babied."
Junior,4,Palm beach state is a really good school. The professors all care about you and do their best to accommodate you should any issues arise. The campus is nice and the food is good too.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the class sizes and many of the professors. I do not enjoy being in a class with one professor and then getting a different one that i did not pick because they got a promotion. They should allow that professor to finish the semester and then carry on the other responsibilities.
Freshman,4,My overall opinion of palm beach state college is that Palm Beach State College have a very beautiful campus and safe environment the staff are very supportive and helpful they always here to help and guide you the student body  are very respectful and kind I would recommend palmbeach state to any person who like to learn and have fun at the same time.
Sophomore,4,"Great place to get an inexpensive education. For the low tuition we pay, there are innumerable services offered here. There are is great food, advisors, fun events, a well-kept gym, and some great staff to help do it all."
Freshman,4,I love all of the Palm Beach State campuses. All of the staff are friendly and helpful. Everyone is there to help the students out. You feel very taken care of.
Sophomore,2,"When I asked about why i was paying out of state fees I was waved off instantly, it took me going to the campus three times before they changed the visa status they had me under. I almost lost my scholarship because I couldn't afford the rest of the tuition until someone in the college finally looked into my situation, this was after I had already attended for over a semester."
Niche User,2,So they have a lot of fun student activities but education wise it is terrible. I mean it's cheaper so I guess you get what you pay for. I think high school was harder
Freshman,2,I very glad that I love my teacher. But the attitude and rudeness from the admins and academic advisors made me want to drop out. This is my first semester at this school and I had a horrible take just applying. I was also registered for a class that I shouldn't be in based on my major that my advisor did not tell me. 
College Student,2,My plan is AA degree
Recent Alumnus,2,"The program is very disorganized, however, we have learned a lot and have attended many clinical sites to gain some hands on experience. We have tests roughly every other week and we have homework and discussions due weekly. The workload isn't too heavy but the amount of studying is!"
College Sophomore,2,I don't see anyone trying to schedual a meeting with me to try to make sure I'm prepared to transfer and have all the required classes. Kinda just a fish eat fish world. Your expected to do any and everything and they just collect a paycheck. The college advisors are kinda just whatever don't really care just want you in and out of the office as fast as possible. Not much recruiting on campus.
College Junior,2,Too much workload. It's hard to communicate with the professors as well.
College Freshman,2,The professors I had just to the bare minimum.
College Sophomore,2,"After high school I stopped doing online courses because I would never take the class seriously enough and I know how seriously I have to take my education. In a traditional classroom you can focus more, less a chance of getting distracted, learn more, have a more hands on experience etc."
College Sophomore,2,The only good thing about PBSC post-grad services is their career center. They have helped me a lot with my career/major research.
College Junior,2,The career center of my campuses very busy Astec they run a lot of programs they help build resumes practice interviews and researching opportunities
College Freshman,2,My interaction with the professsors here were awful. They weren't exactly the friendliest of people.
College Sophomore,2,They do not really care and will not take the time out to guide you.
College Freshman,2,I had decent sat scores and a great Gpa but didn't receive as much financial aid and I wasn't informed how to grab more scholarships
College Senior,2,Its very frustrating. First time attend in college and they don't give you no information or very few information about any scholarships or Pell grants that you available for. just a real pain
College Senior,2,Most of the kids at the campus I go to are duel enrollment. So mostly all high school students.
College Senior,2,i did not get any aid.
College Senior,2,there are no internship opportunities and very little jobs on campus.
College Freshman,2,It was way too difficult. Almost as if it were a class in itself. But I will admit the financial aid advisors helped at the times I needed it and it should be taken care of since I gave them my taz transcripts which was a major problem.
College Freshman,2,"I usually get the minimum of what I need for financial aid. I have had instances where I had to pay for 3-4 classes out of my own pocket because financial aid didn't cover it, no fun at all!"
College Freshman,2,"Some of the professors are awesome while others are just there to just do their job and not help out of the classroom. The counselors aren't helpful AT ALL! they don't know what is or what is not required for a degree and they didn't help me at all when I asked them how to transfer to FAU, WORST STAFF EVER."
College Sophomore,2,Due to my school just started offered bachelors degree they don't have many options
Recent Alumnus,2,"i think it's bad because the students most qualify for a job, are the ones that have financial aid . it's not fair for the rest of us who don,t have financial aid.The student that don't have finaNcial aid are already struggling about paying for school and can't even find a job too. That's completely unfair."
College Junior,2,"Maybe it's just because I'm so determined and slightly older (27), but I feel like the student body is just whatever about the college thing."
College Freshman,2,The facilities are not the best. The social scene is alright and campus life is boring.
College Freshman,2,I want to go to another school with on-campus housing and high school spirit. I feel I'm not getting a great college experience.
College Freshman,2,Most students are older adults and have jobs. The school is highly diverse.
College Sophomore,2,Transferring credits has not been easy at all. Everyone that I have dealt with gives me the run-around
College Junior,2,my major is not offered at the school.
College Junior,2,Financial aid counselors are horrific and give terrible and conflicting advice; no help whatsoever.
College Junior,2,"The counselors consistantly give incorrect advice with reference to signing up for classes and transfering to other schools. Many students, along with myself consider the administration a joke. The financial aid department consistantly gave me incorrect advice with attempting to apply for the Pale Grant and offered no assistance for other financial assistance."
College Freshman,2,Very little teachers care about you!
College Senior,2,it kind of made me digress in a way i never thought was possible
College Senior,2,they need swings around campus to destress students.
College Freshman,2,The admission office is always extremely packed and unless you have an appointment you aren't seeing a counselor. I found that the financial aid section of the office to not be helpful at all.
College Freshman,2,I have not seen many recourses other than student recourses for internships.
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't anything that stands out about my school, I wish there was! If the financial aid office was nicer to me maybe I'd enjoy school!"
College Junior,2,"I have never been to the career center, but as far as post-grad help from the academic advisors I would say that they're not very helpful."
College Sophomore,2,It is not the ideal but it is not as bad as some places. 
Recent Alumnus,2,i don't now about that.
Recent Alumnus,2,"not convenient it is possible,i had good treatment."
College Freshman,2,The academic programs are good. The social scene isn't truly there and campus life is slightly below average since its a small school with no housing and has that high school feeling. The unique opportunities is the small classes for more one on one style of teaching.
College Freshman,2,It if weren't for the accessibility of the computer labs this would get a one star. The wireless internet is poor and hard to reach wirelessly. Network speed is slow. The need for a personal computer is needed in some cases but rarely.
College Freshman,2,This area in Palm Beach is lacking since the athletic center is small and pales to comparison to the nearby FAU. The student center is very nice but the location to which it is located is hard to reach. As for the library you have to go to FAU to get books. Campus activities are on going but few attend. 
College Student,2,Decent price for 3 classes.
College Junior,2,There is nothing unique about palm beach college in my opinion. The school is very fortunate to have police academy and fire fighter academy but when it comes to regular classes there is nothing special/
College Senior,2,"It is really only average. the first time I applied for financial aid it was a huge long process, which is fair. But when applying for the second semester it was even more complicated which it should not have been since I was already in the system. Regardless I always received my financial aid in time for school to start, but it was very close. As far as the education I have had some teachers that where fantastic and were definitely worth the long financial aid process. The only thing I would give an F on is the advising department, they really did not understand anything I had to say or ask and I left even more in the dark then I was when I walked in there. I actually had to contact the schools I wanted to transfer to in order to get the correct information."
College Junior,2,The Financial aid process is a bit much. Why because there isnt enough employess for all the students who are requesting and having a problem with their status. So it often makes the process overwhelming.
College Senior,2,"In my opinion the cost for a class is a little too high especially online. A student is more likely to get in touch with a professor taking a class on campus then online. Anyway, my experience with financial aid office was not pleasant. How can a student trust the financial aid person if when you ask a question  the person always adds the word ""not sure"" when they are the professionals and are there to help us not lead to more concerns."
College Senior,2,"The provided wi-fi at my campus is spotty at best! It isn't available from all the buildings and when it is, it comes in and out. There are plenty of on campus computers provided, and labs. Printing costs money and the use of our cars makes it more complicated than necessary."
College Senior,2,"The school is extremely cheap, as it's only a state college. Financial aid is easy enough to receive. The education is average at best however. I can't seem to get the counseling I need for class sign up. They also don't provide a wide range of classes in my desired field."
College Senior,2,The tution is fine but there isn't much explantation of how it works you would have to talk to an advisor or go to a meeting where they can explain it to you.
College Senior,2,"The experience is overall okay nothing special about the college it's mostly a college where kids go to transfer to a university or finishing up school after taking some time off. It's very easy to get behind, however there are a few teachers you will meet that will go above and beyond to help you. The college is very cheap as well another reason why so many students go there."
College Sophomore,2,This school wasn't my first choice but it's the cheaper choice. All I can say is you get what you paid for. It's not very organized and I've had a few teacher that acted like they would rather be anywhere else but here. When I first apply to the college they had me all over the place for no reason. They kept telling me different things and the next day they would say that was wrong its actually something completely different. I was late to sign up for my first classes and I ended up with the leftover classes.
College Student,2,"The process is tedious and slow sometimes, the people that work their are fine but sometimes don't care to look into students problems. The process is also hard the guild lines are unclear and of very little help to get school aid."
College Senior,2,when i asked for another computer class advisores told me that thiers only 2-3 class on computers for pbsc
Recent Alumnus,2,"Registering for classes can sometimes be irritating, confusing and stressful. There are not enough servers to host all of the students when choosing classes all at one time."
College Junior,2,"I feel like it is a very drawn out, time consuming experience that personally i did not enjoy."
College Junior,2,It really dissapointed me when I found out that its hard to transfer to University afterwards.
College Junior,2,They are very helpful if you know where they are and if someone is nice enough to show you them. Everyone there excepts you to just know where they are and sometimes when you ask for help they can give you an attitude because they assume you already know it when no one even took the time to explain it to you.
Sophomore,1,"If you are a parent or a working adult, expect nothing from this college. I mean ABSOLUTELY nothing. 

These people expected students and professors to ""carry on"" during a pandemic and made NO accommodations to working students and parent students. For example, those of us who were forced to home school kids due to school closures were still subjected to letter grade (instead of P/F). Even though the workload was NOT the same (think instead of Work + School, now we had work + school + home school + no daycare). 

TRASH school. Horrible administration that washes their hands off. I literally stay in this school because I cannot afford a 4yr school so instead I have to do a community college (they are the only one around) and then transfer to a 4yr school."
Sophomore,1,"Most professors are highly biased. There is very little diversity with learning topics from different walks of life. Professors also act like their ""hands are tied"" when implementing teaching methods that enhance a learning environment."
Freshman,1,It is a horrible school. The staff is very disorganized. It doesn’t even feel like a school it’s more like a business. All they want is money. It is disgusting
Freshman,1,"I would like to see teachers who don’t work for a paycheck, and actually like their job.they should be doing everything to help a kid pass a class and not just hand out assignments."
Niche User,1,I personally haven't experienced online learning with Palm Beach State but one of my best friends is currently doing online classes and she tells me it's such an easy process. She really enjoys learning online through palm beach state.
Freshman,1,"I have to teach myself in every single semester. 99% of my teacher were there to make money and don't want to work for it,"
Freshman,1,"The worst teachers, mybe 1% are decent, the rest are there just to get paid. You have to teach yourself. Also some are very rude and don't respond to you emails or questions. Chose another school."
Alum,1,Worse experience I've had dealing with admissions. The rep erased all my prior information on transcripts and caused delay in registration under the next session. Their Pantherweb is poorly constructed as well as the now required 2x authentication. Another issue is the one day only requirement for certain registrants.  Not a user friendly web and worse in person.
Niche User,1,"Class 74...l was the handicapped cadet in the class who was sponsored by Riviera Beach Police. Jill Reiter was successful at making sure a handicap was rejected from completing the police academy. In 1994 this college capitalized by allowing anyone to sponsor themselves into the police academy; creating thousands of more certified applicants in a law enforcement career that will never have enough openings to hire them. It's all about profit. As soon as their certificates expire they'll have to return to this college to become recertified. The 63 year old Jill Reiter will remain employed at this certification mill until she expires. She would have been terminated back in 1993 if l understood the discrimination laws that applied to me and sought legal action against her, the college and the Riviera Beach Police Department."
Sophomore,1,"This school is horrible. they tell you, you need classes when you don't. They keep horrible horrible teacher on pay roll. it's sad that your education depends on what teacher you get. I am not the only one who feels this way. i've been at this school for a year and half of my teachers were crap, especially the math teachers. they have unrealistic rules, such as if you miss a day you can't get the work from that day. I am pretty sure i am paying for this and if i happen to miss a day i am entitled to my work. they don't teach the easiest ways of doing problems. They need a better way of running things."
College Freshman,1,There were secret fees that you don't see till after you finish paying. I did not receive any financial aid. And I know my friends didn't receive money either and they go to different schools. Then you spent a future on books. TIP: Use Chegg
College Freshman,1,"I have tried to contact my advisor. Left voice mails and no on had called me back. There is this stupid SLS class that is required. You can't pay for you other classes without it. It's about college planning and other stuff. I think it's a waste of money, because if you transfer to another school, that class counts for nothing."
College Sophomore,1,I cannot pay for school on my own I need help .FASFA is not an option for me
College Senior,1,"It sucks! Let's start off like that. If your going to a college to have fun and meet people, this is not the place to go. Everyone's just here to get their education, I mean 'credits'. Lol!"
College Freshman,1,The people in the computer room and learning center are the NICEST! very helpful. Other than that the people in the student store and counselors in the student center are non helpful and just want to get the student out of their office as soon as possible. Not friendly at all!
College Senior,1,you guys should just quit. Thats not nice how you treat your students.
College Sophomore,1,Its a 2 year school
College Student,1,When I am in a building and attempt to use the internet it just doesn't work. Network frequently drops. I have all new technology so I know it is not on my end.
College Junior,1,parking and registration is ALWAYS a disaster. Almost always have to park in a small and dirt filled overload parking area. Security then gives you warnings to find a parking in the original parking spaces.. Registration is always a problem.  It's always delayed at least a day. Also online payment is the worst. most of the time they fail to recognize the payments. 
College Junior,1,Professors are not the best. there are a handful of good professors 
College Junior,1,"Many of the colleges' technology and collegiate software are not friendly to Mac users. You must have another windows orientated computer to get  things done. Submitting is a pain, watching videos from your teachers etc. it is just no bueno "
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no communication on your balance until it is too late and the balance is more than you can handle. I 'm stuck with a bill and I thought it was pay when I sign the promissory form but that was just hold it until I could pay it.
College Sophomore,1,"PBSC has a Theatre and Music department and offers courses in acting and music, but it does not have a Dance department so it doesn't offer any dance courses. This is problematic for students who are pursuing musical theatre or dance.  The course offerings in theatre and dance are extremely limited.  I have had to take dance at a private school."
College Senior,1,"Most professors expect you to learn on your own and really dont explain the material correctly. Very few teachers care about their students. Classes are expensive, and according to financial aid, my parents make too much money. In my opinion, I believe financial aid is not fair and most of who do get it are not the ones who need it."
College Senior,1,You come out more confused then before you went in.
College Junior,1,"So my school tuition isn't that bad, it's a state college so clearly it isn't as expensive as a university. Their only flaw is in the financial aid area. I am a student with parents that don't make more than $50 grand a year together and they only gave me $600 a semester. That doesn't even cover two classes for me there, especially since I am a science major. I don't want to take out loans, because I find it unnecessary since I am eligible for a lot more than $600 a semester. I am very upset with their process and that is why I am applying here."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is very poor in the classrooms, as well as teachers. They don't seem to teach or produce very well, which depresses me and makes me lose interest in learning. The labs are great, as well as the library, but when it comes to teachers and learning.. it gets a lower score. Professors don't seem to care about their classes, or their teaching standards."
College Sophomore,1,This was an online class. They dont give you much time or really help you understand the course. You basically have to figure it out yourself. On campus the courses seem much easier and you get much more help.
College Sophomore,1,The wifi is very low and hard to access. The only way to access the internet is by going to the computer lab.
College Senior,1,"Never Had – I always apply for Financial Aid but they never help 
me out and always charge me about 1,000 Per class!!"
College Junior,1,"I feel like going to PBSC I am wasting my money. I'm never given any work. The only good thing that comes out of taking classes, are my credits."
College Senior,1,Financial Aid is horrible. It seems like they don't want to help you and it seems like they get annoyed with your questions.
College Senior,1,"They Dont Help at All. Ive gone into the office multiple times, looking for some sort of extra income, or maybe even work study, and they always give me the run around."
College Senior,1,"""Customer Service?&quot – I am paying for education. I am not able to pay upfront; therefore, I count fully on my financial aid to help fund my education. I went back to school after a 10 year hiatus. I did not fully understand what I was getting into with financial aid. It should be required that a student applying for financial aid meet with an advisor to go over EVERY detail and obligation."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Making the trip down to the financial aid office is always a dreaded experience. For even the most simple of issues, you must go in person because the phone is never answered. Upon entering the office, you add your name to the long list of similarly annoyed students and wait, while the one financial aid officer sits texting in his empty office. A trip to this office must be well planned, as you may be spending a significant portion of you day waiting for someone to speak with you. And of course, appointments are not available. Once finally seen by the only person working in the office, he is rude and little or no help. If you have made a mistake on your paperwork, he will make you feel utterly incompetent for it, rather than just help you correct it. This particular officer also has a reputation for hitting on female students and has even gone as far as to text/call students personally to pursue what is obviously a less than appropriate student-staff relationship.  Students not requiring financial assistance are thoroughly fortunate to not have to deal with the financial aid office at an otherwise pleasant school."
College Junior,1,"Not Great. I'm a Biology major, I'm just at this college because its close to home, it doesn't really have any special classes for me. Not even a degree. I'm just here till I get my AA then I'm going to transfer to a college where I can get my degree."
College Sophomore,1,"It's Pretty Bad – The facilities on campus are pretty bad. The gym is pretty small, my high school gym was bigger than the one they have at my college. The cafeteria is small, its ridiculous. the library is small and need to be updated with brand new computers. And they don't even have a theater building, I have to drive 30 minutes to a different campus to take a theater class."
College Sophomore,1,Career Center Is Not Helpful – I got  transfer to this fall in the spring. I went there and I was trying to find what classes I need to take for my major and the man I was not talking to was not helpful at all. He didn't seem to care at all about basically he was kind of saying I'm on my own. I was extremely disappointed about the way he handled me and seriously I don't know why some people work at a school if you are not willing to help students to get to where they want to get. Its sad and it's unfortunate
College Sophomore,1,Ntework Is Slow – The computers are slow. they are old and not up to date and they dont really have a lot of them on campus.
College Senior,1,The school doesn't really help you or give you much information about the school.

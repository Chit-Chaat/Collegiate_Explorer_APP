Freshman,5,"This college is all about culture in Native American history and the dynamics and geographics of Native American history. There are classes that focus on the Native American government  as well. They have student housing and dorms that are located on campus and are easy access to class. The dean of students is amazing. I've recently had an experience  with her myself. She helped me get into college. Without her help I would of not known what steps to take. It wasn't here job to get me in school but she took time from her day to get me started in the right area. You would think she is busy with ""the dean of students"" stuff. But she took time to help me. It meant so much to me especially  when she introduced herself as the dean of students. Cause I met the dean of students at SKC. I'm grateful."
Freshman,5,The staff at Salish Kootenai College are very helpful.  Also they cater to individual needs.  The campus is clean and open situated in the Mission valley.  Very accessable.
Freshman,5,Salish kootenai college makes sure that all students achieve their lifetime goals from making sure they’re doing good in class and to making sure they’re getting the right education. This college is a big support system too! You never feel like you’re alone here at all
Freshman,5,Everyone is so caring and wants to see you succeed! Staff and faculty are willing to go out of their way to help students!
Junior,5,"I love the staff. Everyone from admissions, financial aide and the nursing departments have been amazing. They are all 100% wanting you to succeed and do everything they can to make it a seamless process. I would change the distance from home for me, but I am so thankful to be in a program"
Junior,5,I’ve had a lot of support throughout my time at Salish Kootenai College.  The professors present material in a way that’s easy to understand and are always willing to offer help to those that need it.  There are a wide variety of degree fields to choose from and each department is dedicated and professional. Housing is convenient as they have dorms and apartments for families  to accommodate all types of student needs. The environment here is very team oriented and there are plenty of events to attend throughout the quarter.  I’m glad I chose SKC because I’m getting the experience and education I was looking for.
Junior,5,"The college is a blend of multinational and international students. The student senate hears complaints, suggestions, or recommendations about anything and will stand in front of the board and argue the pros and cons for the student body. They do research on what is brought before them. I have seen changes that normally would not even be thought of because of their diligence to beng the best advocate for the students. The faculty and staff take the time to make sure students are in good health, spirits, and mind for the rigorous 10 week quarters. If a student might slip and begin to fall behind there is a great support system of faculty and peers to help. I chose this college because of the top notch professors and they were the only college that took the time out to show me around campus and classes."
Freshman,5,"This school is great, the instructors and advisors are very helpful. It is easy to enroll everything just flows well at this school."
Freshman,5,Great atmosphere and people. You get one on one time with your instructor and they help you through any problems.
Freshman,5,I love Salish Kootenai College. It's a perfect community college here in the Mission Valley. It's very convenient to live so close to campus and everyone is very friendly and helpful. It is a smaller college which makes it less confusing to get around and find exactly what you need when you need to.
Sophomore,5,Very personable staff. They want you to succeed. Very willing to assist with problems you are experiencing. Many programs offered to ensure success of students.
Junior,5,Salish Kootenai College is a great inter tribal college that integrates native american history and teachings with traditional college work.
Sophomore,5,"Salish Kootenai College has a wide variety of classes that benefit students in their majors and future careers. The professors are willing to go above and beyond to help each student individually and meet their academic needs. Each staff member lives up to their potential of being committed to their job and taking interest in those around them. Typically advisors in small colleges, like Salish, spend a good amount of time with each student and guiding them through a successful school year. Academic wise everything is fine but when it comes to athletics all they have to offer is basketball. If they included sports like track, tennis, volleyball or golf many talented athletes would get recognized by coaches from universities."
Sophomore,5,I love it at SKC. Everything is great there except the Three Wolves Del.   The jerk who owns it is rude and a racist. Shame on the college for contracting out food services to such a jerk.
Senior,5,I have been going to SKC since my education began. I love how the staff and advisors help and keep students on track to graduate. They give their own personal experience to students who needs help. The college is beautiful and well taken care of.
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that Salish Kootenai College is a family based college. You become family as a whole. Getting more involved, engaging in friendships between faculty and other students is very awarding. I love how when I walk through a hall and at least one person knows me by name. I am always smiling at everyone even if they do not smile back. I guess I would like to see this college focus on getting their departments and faculty of who is teaching which subject figured out way before the academic year starts. Other than that, I loved all of my experience at this college. They accept you for you and allow you to make and learn from your mistakes. Great opportunities here and it is really amazing see the faculty so involved with their students."
Niche User,5,My oldest sister went to college there and I liked how she got to graduate with her Bachelors in Tribal Historic Presevation and I feel like I could go to school to major in that area as well. 
College Senior,5,"Again, everything within these topics.here at SKC are amazing. Very helpful. A lot of interaction between the student and the instructor."
College Senior,5,"Due to SKC being smaller, it gives students a better one on one relationship with their professors. The classes are smaller. They offer many labs and one on one tutors to help including the instructor themselves. Each instructor has a way of teaching within their styles that they believe will help the student. I've been inany classes here with many different instructors. I have seen many different styles of teaching and a lot that are better than some."
College Senior,5,"I am proud to say I have become friends with all the ladies from the career services department. They work so hard to help the students with jobs outside.of school, they work hard daily.to help students complete scholarships before the deadline, they work to get any updates, new scholarships, etc... On the school bulletin board for students to see. One of my favorite is they combine with other departments to have what they call a ""Coffee Hour"" every Friday to bring students together, to interact with one another but also because they love seeing and spending time with students. They give free door prizes for showing up and give many opportunities to be the first to learn about upcimg events and taking part I'm these events. It truly is amazing what our career services provide and do."
College Senior,5,"Salish Kootenai College is amazing. This is my first college I have ever been to and honestly, I would not change for anything. I am involved with the Medical Assisting field of study and am on my last year. Getting to choose my own workload that works well withy everyday life situations is awesome. I recently graduated with my Medical Office Clerk Certificate and I didy practicum with Polson Health. One of the best places I got to work with amazing doctors, nurse practitioners, etc... SKC set me up with amazing people, doing what I love. They don't want us to stress as students, every faculty at SKC care to see us succeed in everything. They all offer to help if they can in any way."
College Senior,5,"Its a smaller campus with a great team of faculty who give you their time. They mean it when they say, they are here for the students no matter what. When they give.you their phone numbers and tell you to call them and bug them, they mean it. They want to be here for you and help you pass. But being smaller with less students in your classes helps give you and the instructor and or professor a better one on one relationship not only as a student and teacher but also as a friend"
College Sophomore,5,It has taken a lot of time to transfer in my credits and I thought more would have transferred in.  I am taking a lot longer to finish than I thought.  I have an extra year which I did not anticipate.
College Sophomore,5,The online experience was ok thought I prefer to be in a classroom.
College Sophomore,5,The direction I am already receiving is incredible. I look forward to advancing under this direction.
College Sophomore,5,Class discussions have been so valuable.  I am able to share my ideas and thoughts with students while learning from theirs.  The teachers lead with great opening discussion points which lead to these types of classes.
College Sophomore,5,My degree has endless options and opportunities for employment.  I do not feel trapped or that I will be stuck doing one thing for the rest of my life.
College Sophomore,5,The whole department is helpful and fun to work for.
College Sophomore,5,The teachers at SKC have made all the difference.
College Sophomore,5,"The accessibility to classrooms, and the availability of classes is great.  The faculty are always willing to accomodate special circumstances."
College Sophomore,5,"Online courses offer a greater flexibility in scheduling.  This school is wonderful in the assistance or tutoring, even for online courses.  The discussion forums allow for peer-to-peer interaction and communication with the instructor.  Plus, again - on campus assistance and study groups are abundant."
College Sophomore,5,The staff are always ready to help and discover new areas of educational opportunities and career placement.
College Sophomore,5,I already have several job opportunities upon earning my certification.
College Sophomore,5,"Each course offers a wide variety of applicable knowledge.  Including the electives, there is emphasis on individuality and cultural awareness, and personal success. My instructors are and have been awesome, very knowledgeable and helpful, motivating and inspiring."
College Sophomore,5,"I am currently studying Chemical Addiction, working toward a certification as a counselor.  Each class and area of study and practice is preparing me to work with people, educate and help them help themselves.  The assignments can be difficult, but there is abundant help and tutoring available. The instructor is fabulous, with clinical experience as well as that of a college professor.  The availability for employment in this field is extremely high."
College Sophomore,5,"Salish is a school with many diversities - areas of study, faculty and students.  There are courses offered here that are unique to our area, and cultural knowledge.  Every day I wake up on a school day, I am excited to go to class, participate in the college activities, and study.  I would recommend this school highly!"
College Freshman,5,"I was expecting the college experience to be difficult and confusing, however I was pleased to find out that wasn't true at all. Everyone one in all departments have been very helpful and useful. My school is very culture orientated and has many culture course options available to everyone native American or not. Cost are low. I would choose this college over again every time."
College Freshman,5,"SKC is the best school to attend, all the staff are very helpful. They have an amazing athletic center with someone who is always there and willing to help you to achieve your goal. They also have great study centers in each building for every student, to have a comfortable place to study and get some homework done."
College Senior,5,"The gym is beautiful, the fitness center could be broadened but an amazing place to be."
College Senior,5,I have heard nothing but amazing experiences during their time attended in the Nursing program.
College Junior,5,This school doesn't take all my Financial Aid and Housing helps a lot since it is on campus.
College Junior,5,The major I chose is Business and it is the most fun major and classwork. I like the accounting especially.
College Junior,5,Everything I need in my degree is there and when I need help services is there to help.
College Junior,5,The services help me with everything that needs answering.
College Junior,5,I everything about the school.
College Junior,5,I think that overall the academic experience here is great because it's so small and you have the opportunity to take free tutoring and get all the help that you need. The instructors are usually available all the time and in most circumstances you can even get ahold of them after hours which is really nice.
College Junior,5,The nursing program here is extremely difficult and rigorous. You have to jump through a lot of hoops just to get in and once you do finally get in it's a whole new world of hard classes and making sure your reading for the real world. It isn't a course you can just skim through you have to be ready and willing to give up your social life in order to make it to the next step
College Senior,5,"It's great. The teachers actually care and take concern when you don't arrive to school. They email you the work you missed and understand if you had a doctors appointment or something important to attend to. If you are having a hard time on a subject the teacher will personally help you out, if not there is a numerous amount of tutors who are accessible everyday. There is always help!"
College Senior,5,"Everything is beautiful. It looks nice, plenty of nature right outside the classrooms. The gym is great and open to everyone including non-students. the programs are great as well everybody gets along great and meet many new people. I have begun to discover so many new opportunities."
College Senior,5,"Assistance is always provided. SKC helps students with their homework, financial issues, childcare, housing, provide food, and even helping hands to those needing a person to talk to. They have many fun programs to boost our health and stay in tune with our Native culture."
College Senior,5,"There is always access to the internet for students, teachers, and even the public. Everything is sufficient and all materials are provided. They have a ton of people around to help fix any problems. I have never encountered any issues with the computer network."
College Junior,5,They offer many great programs that surround our Native American Culture and offer great cultural understandings to many students who aren't informed about the Native American heritage.
College Freshman,5,"Writing Center – The English Dept. has a great writing center that students of all calibers use constantly. Tutors are always available during school hours and are well versed in MLA, APA, and other writing styles and techniques."
College Freshman,5,The small class sizes bring the students closer to the teachers. The comprehensive instruction and weekly homework load makes it easy to work with others and complete projects. As a writing tutor at the college I enjoy helping people with their papers and watching the student body achieve greatness. As a Native American College preference is given.
College Freshman,5,Native American Studies – The Native American Studies program at SKC is as good or better than any in the country. These classes are informative and generate quality thought processes that encourage growth in the Indian community.
College Junior,5,"the people here are dedicated to learning, and the staff and teachers are amazingly helpful and understanding"
College Senior,5,"School Resources – The school has good resources for all of its students.  They offer activities, the library is open to all students, athletic center is open to any for endless amount of time to be active.  SKC has all kinds of entertainment for students while they have the extra time."
College Student,5,"The diversity at S.K.C. is wide in regards to age,social,ethnic,new students,returning students,as well as part time students"
College Student,5,Highway Construction Program – This is one of the best programs of its type in the northwest region. A huge variety of Trucks and Equipment are available for the students.
College Junior,5,"I Have Only Had a Few Online Classes. Although I have only ha a few online courses, the ones I had were very good classes.  I had worried that I wouldn't have any understanding, while attending online classes, but on the contrary I gained just as much as I would have if I were in a classroom."
Senior,4,SKC is a great college for people who are from small towns and want to succeed but need small cohorts to do so. Degree programs are top notch compared to other tribal college universities around the United States. SKC is open to all people who want to attend. One misconception is it's only for native american people but it is open to the public.
Freshman,4,If you are looking for a small town school this is the place the thing I like is the smaller class sizes you are able to receive one on one assistance from instructors. The staff is extremely helpful and are determined to help you succeed
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed working with Salish. 
I am an off campus student doing a satellite program and it has been very easy working with them. I have taken two online courses and the teachers have been super quick to reply and give very helpful feedback."
Sophomore,4,Its an ok school we are just a branch of Salish Kootenai College  So my low scores on the items below is because they dont apply to us
Freshman,4,My experience so far at the college has been very good. I like the professors a lot. I like how it's a small school and not so crazy. I feel like the professors have a better bond with a small class.
Sophomore,4,"Not only is this college in my back yard, they offer four year degrees, at a community college price!"
Sophomore,4,"SKC is a small rural campus that's easy to get around in- and it's right next to two different convenience stores. The dorms are kept clean inside and out with no raucous parties or debauchery due to being on a dry, zero tolerance campus. Teachers and advisers do everything they can to help you succeed, short of doing your homework."
Sophomore,4,"This college is quite diverse, this is why my educational experience has been of great benefit to me.  Unlike the University that I had gone to in the past, the teachers are more one-on-one based.  This environment helps keep me motivated and gives me a sense of belonging, a sense of care, and the willpower to finish college and get my degrees.  The experience of attending SKC has been a rewarding, fulfilling experience that I will remember for the rest of my life."
College Senior,4,I've never had to deal with transferring credits but I guarantee the faculty were very helpful and are helpful to anyone graduating.
College Senior,4,I honestly couldn't give a good review.on this topic only because I honestly don't know about the post-grad services. But I am sure its great and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Not only are the professors knowledeable, but they care about a student's success.  The courses offered had variety, due to the different styles of teaching.  Since the class sizes varied from 2 to 25sh, the professors could offer more one on one teaching.  They deffinitely encourage interaction and participation during class."
College Junior,4,"Salish Kootenai College has fairly well-educated faculty members, cohort based programs, and the advantage of decent student-instructor class ratios. SKC's mission for all of it's programs includes providing a foundation in critical thinking, cultural understanding, communication and citizenship. I would choose, and recommend others, to attend SKC because there is no greater feeling than being in an environment surrounded by people who want the same things as you or are willing to offer you guidance in achieving those goals."
College Senior,4,every one has been nice and helpful have not had any problems yet.
College Junior,4,The career center/services has many goal driven employees. They are definitely there to help you move forward with your career. They have opportunities of internships on their website.
College Junior,4,"Tuition is lined out down to application fee, etc. in the yearly catalog. The financial aid office is very helpful, answer all questions the may occur. You apply online and the information is sent to the school. If you need help they have the financial aid office to assist with filling out the information."
College Junior,4,All of the above stated are clear cut processes. Instructors give syllabus' the first day of class so there is no confusion as to what is needed and expected of the class. Enrolling in the classes is smooth.
College Junior,4,The  advisors are so helpful in picking out classes to fit your schedule. The workload is doable.
College Junior,4,They are all helpful and friendly. Several different resources set up on campus. Easy to find also.
College Junior,4,It is what I always hope for in a school as a young man. Classes range from 5-35. It just depends on what kind courses are being taken.
College Junior,4,"The two athletics centers are nice one is attached to a huge gym with a running track that goes around the top half of it. So, those who want to run can watch other sports going on down low. The library is really homey. It has a few computer labs in it and a movie room for classes and independent study."
College Junior,4,The academics are all amazing. Each professor has their own style and curriculum. The registration process is rather simple. The Salish Kootenai College offers a tremendous of classes.
College Junior,4,Majoring in forestry fire is one of the most wonderful experiences I've encountered. The hybrid indoor/outdoor/online learning has brought a whole new way of learning to a class experience. I find this program very unique and extremely successful in guiding me to achieving my goals of working in the line of fire.
College Senior,4,"The staff work hard, the registrars make it possible to attend college, thank you!"
College Senior,4,I received help whenever I asked for it.
College Sophomore,4,I have received a lot of great career advice and am confident that the staff can and will help me find a job in my chosen field.
College Sophomore,4,We have a really diverse group of students for such a small school.
College Sophomore,4,Our financial aid officer is really helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the overall atmosphere of SKC and would highly recommend it to family, friends and even strangers!!"
College Junior,4,Everything students need is on campus.
College Junior,4,"There isn't accessible WIFI at the dorms, but internet cores."
College Junior,4,On-line classes aren't overloading. Its at a good maintained level.
College Junior,4,Students are nice and are hardworking people.
College Junior,4,"I am in the business management department the teachers are very helpful and give real life experiences for tools of learning, I do not know of any internship possibilities from what I have heard the funding is low so the work study has been cut, there is a club that is for business leaders but yet again most of them seem unfriendly, they do have a great transfer program with the university of montana"
College Junior,4,"The teachers are very helpful, I didn't like that my advisors are only allowed to transfer my credits that deal with my major, electives must be transferred by someone else it is inconvenient for myself, none of my classes interfere with each other."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of student activities a lot are family oriented, there are many resources workout room, library, clubs, free tutoring, etc."
College Senior,4,So far my experience has been a positive one. I live close to the college so getting to class on time is very easy. The classes I have taken has fit into my time line pretty good. If there is something I need changed the classes are very flexible. My main frustration is that I am struggling in my math class. But as I stated before they offer lots of help.
College Senior,4,"As it is so early in the year I don't have a lot of class experience. What little that I have been in class the curriculum is very interesting. Forestry is a unique class. We get to do lots of field work, with a manageable work load. With the completion of this class they assure me that I will have no problem finding work."
College Senior,4,"I am a new student this year, however I have found that over all the professors have been very helpful. They make it very clear hat if you have any questions to be sure to ask. They are personable and polite and ready to help. My personal workload is a little heavy but I have a lot of catching up to do. They offer lots of tutor classes to help students. This has been very very helpful to me in my college career."
College Senior,4,I really can't say. I have only heard that this is what it is. Hopefully I can answer this better when I graduate
College Senior,4,"Because of my work schedule and busy life my schooling is dependent on my class schedule being flexible. Many of the teachers have been very flexible with class times, out of class help, and extra help with homework and class projects. Academic Flexibility is one of SKC's strongest qualities."
College Senior,4,The career center is generally very helpful and concerned about helping the students. They are pretty good about alerting students to up coming scholarships and grants.
College Junior,4,Going to a native school you get a lot of diversity and you get to experience a lot of new things. I think that the student body is great because you get to be your own person and get a great education at the same time.
College Senior,4,The school is definitely affordable and for that I am grateful. It's absolutely worth the money because the staff and tutors are extremely helpful. The only reason I struggled with financial aid is because I was no longer living with my mom and I had to do it all on my own but with the help from the financial aid office. My advice is write as many possible scholarships as you can.
College Junior,4,"I am an elementary education major and my classes are a lot of fun, and very informative, they make me excited to become a teacher. The workload is time consuming but nothing that cannot be done if your organized and attend your classes. I love the program."
College Junior,4,"The campus has a gym and work out equipment, it has study areas a writing lab with tutors, there are math tutors in the math building and computer labs everywhere. There are always campus activities and study nights towards midterms and finals, and campus clubs as well. It is a very comfortable campus, and a place where there is always free help if needed in between classses, or after school."
College Junior,4,"My experience has been convenient because I live here and it is not a far drive. The scheduling is great and the people are helpful. I feel very comfortable asking for advice and help here at this school, it is a very community like school."
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is always very helpful and understanding to different student needs. I feel my education is worth what i am paying for the most part minus a select few instructors. Most every instructor has been helpful and great at teaching me what i need to know. I get the full pell which helps me out a lot although my pell never covers all the costs of school it does pay for a big portion and helps a lot. Getting paper work turned in on time is a must.
College Junior,4,I am a college freshman and have not had to transfer credits. I decided to attend this school because its a good size school. My classes usually have less than 20 students which makes it easy for me to have one on one help from my instructers. At the moment to do not plan on changing schools i really enjoy how things are working out at this school.
Recent Alumnus,4,"SKC is a tribal school located on the Flathead Reservation, so every class has a Native American cultural aspect to it. It is a small school so you will most likely meet everyone and have a sense of belonging and if you have a sense of belonging you will be more apt to excel."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The computers have never crashed since I have been there and thats 5 years. Our student e-mail is very secure they don't allow spam on it.
Just this year we have to pay for print out copies and it is only four pennies."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Online for Native American classes was organized and easy to follow. Moodle was the online application. Some online classes were a waste of time. The nursing online classes were postings to answer some questions posted by the teacher, and then respond to other classmates, these became very arrgumentative and the instructor never was involved in the postings creating distention in our class."
College Senior,4,My college is unique in the fact that it is one of the top rated Tribal Colleges in the nation and the only tribal college that offers a BA in Psychology. It is a fully accredited college that makes it a priority for students to succeed.  SKC not only educates Native students it returns them to their communities with a adeep understanding of responsibility and heritage.
College Senior,4,"SKC has a modern gymnasium, theatre, golf course, lacross field. one of the largest collections of Native Americna literature, an diverse and friendly staff and student body.  The only thing I would improve is the dining facility.  It's small and very expensive and doesn't have a very diverse menu to choose from."
College Senior,4,"As a tribal college we have a diverse student body.  There are many students that would be considered non-traditional or that have families and work.  We have a large and active straight/gay alliance club, Native American activities, and a close relationship with faculty.  SKC staff is friendly, open, and diverse.  There is a wonderful support staff to help students with all and any needs."
College Sophomore,4,"Very Close-Up and Personal Experience. Because the classes aren't around 175 students in one room, the teacher can be a lot more personal and hands on. The hands on experience can be so important went majoring in a any subject."
College Sophomore,4,Very Experienced for Such and Small and Short-Lived College. Many of the offices and staff are always having issues with many things.. I think possibly not enough staff meetings to get on the same page.
College Junior,4,"i love the psych program it is wonderful in both its atmosphere, and its workload. they do press you to the best of your ability; and help you to aspire to even greater potentials."
College Senior,4,"Why My School Is Unique – I attend a Tribal college, as a white person the knowledge I have gained simply about the Native people on this reservation is irreplaceable. I could have never learned all I have about the true nature of the our governments relationship with Native peoples if I had not been so immersed in it. Just living here doesn't cut it, I get to see the real politics of the tribal and federal governments at work up close and personal."
College Senior,4,Very Helpful Career Center – The career center at SKC is very helpful in assisting students. They are always available to provide scholarships and other important information.
College Senior,4,"Nice Facilities – SKC offers very nice facilities on campus. The gym, weight room, and theater are all brand-new."
College Junior,2,"I do not really like the school it is the closest inexpensive 4 year school near my hometown so that is why I chose it. I do like how small it is I like the one on one with my teachers. The students have already been in classes together so they already know each other, they do not seem to care that I am in the room with them. They only sit and talk with each other and do not embrace anyone new."
College Junior,2,"Tution isn't very expensive, but I have been very frustrated with the financial aid dept from the start, they caused me to not get a full pell grant, caused me to lose a $5000 scholarship because the school told the donor that I wasn't even enrolled there (which I had been accepted but the registration wasn't even for three weeks), the woman in charge of loans has had a lot of complaints, some students have had a lot of trouble like myself but others have had no problems."
College Junior,2,"A lot of the students do not seem very friendly, they have their clicks made and could careless about anyone new, they have student mentors and tutors but seem like they don't really care to help they are just there to put it on their résumé, a lot of diversity when it comes to ethnicity."
College Junior,2,"Do not like that all computers are Mac and and apple, you must pay to print or copy EVERYTHING, if you do not change the settings on the computer to black and white you will always be charged more because they charge extra for color even if everything is black and white anyways, Internet is Internet decent speed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The library was small, but the instructors within the library were helpful. The gym is outstanding. Campus activities are very disorganized and because of this, things usually ""fall out""."
College Junior,2,"Financial Counselor – It would be awesome is the school had a Financial Aide Counselor, that could help with locating and writing proposals for grants and scholarships."
College Senior,2,"Good Student Diversity – C  My school has excellent diversity in the student population.  The school is a Native American school and while ther are several other ethnicities, American Indians are the greatest population.  Even though the diversity is a great assest, the administation in all progrmas and at all levels leaves much to be desired.  It is clear that administrators at my school are not there for the students, but rather to come to work and just go home at the end of the day.  They are unfriendly and many times rude!"
College Junior,1,"I haven't had any experience with any career services yet, I haven't heard of anything or have been pushed in that direction"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Within the nursing department: the rooms were small and dirty, the bathrooms were filthy for a healthcare related environment. The building was old. There was no place for students to ""hang out"" and study or eat their meals."
Recent Alumnus,1,The syllabus was usually not followed by the instructor. The faculty had limited teaching experience or limited experience in nursing. The curriculum was horrible and any nurse who had any experience was disgusted with the curriculum. The clinical sites and clinical instructors and partnerships were appropriate and a positive learning experience. Faculty would leave/quit in the middle of a quarter and students would have to learn a new learning style. The nursing department had many weak faculty members that could not assist in advancing a student. Students would ask questions during a lecture and the instructor would not be able to answer many of the questions. The best instructors left because they were drove out.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid office seemed as if they did not know what was going on. When went there, it was total choas."
College Junior,1,"Online Class – I've had only one online class here. Unfortunately, the class didn't make it past the first two weeks. The teacher's lack the ability to keep both class involved. Along with the teaching the computer's froze too often to real get enough from the class."

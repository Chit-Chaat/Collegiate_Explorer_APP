Freshman,5,"Florida Atlantic is filled with diversity, whether it is the staff or the students. When I came here I was pleasantly surprised with the large variety of people I got to meet and bond with. The campus is in the most amazing location, and I took this into consideration a lot when I was deciding amongst different Florida universities. The school is a longboard ride away from any necessity store, food store, and of course the beach. Even though my classes are online, living on campus and getting involved with the school has made my time learning here a blast so far."
Senior,5,"A great school with a great faculty and instructors who will go out of their way to help you and provide you with opportunities if you seek them out. They won’t just assume that you’re dedicated, you have to show them."
Senior,5,"I transferred to FAU to get a more local take on my area of study, Social Work. I felt like the school I should be learning from should be one in the community I live in and will be practicing. FAU did not disappoint me. They are amazing!"
Freshman,5,"Online classes aren’t pretty bad in my opinion but it’s just a little hard to stay focus in class. But overall, things could be better such as the audio and the connection issues."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I love FAU. In my opinion it’s by far the best college I ever been to. The college campus is nice. The teachers at FAU are nice and they teach pretty well."
Freshman,5,The campus is very easy to navigate. The dorms are right in the middle of everything. Teachers are easy to contact and answer relatively quickly and the staff is really nice. The food at the dining hall is always really good as well.
Junior,5,"My online experience with FAU has driven me to consider my time as a scholar as the most precious time you can give oneself while isolated (due to the pandemic). For the apprehension of the professors to devote time in making zoom classes appealing and engage students in thorough academic comprehension while at home, shows that whether in person or online, you are getting the quality of service that you hope is your money's worth. It has been easy to follow, friendly user, and very interacting and challenging."
Freshman,5,"While I have the struggle of no in person classes, the school is beautiful and inviting with lots of things to do.  I love that I'm only 1.5 miles to the beach and a short drive to stores.  I've made wonderful friends and love living in the dorm rooms.  The teachers are great and I am really enjoying my freshman experience.  The diversity of FAU was very appealing to me along with an amazing direct entry nursing program."
Freshman,5,100% of my classes are online this semester but the professors are doing a good job of managing the various platforms and communicating with students.  They take extra effort to make sure no cheating is happening and are responsive to questions.  The guidance counselors are very good at helping during virtual meetings.
Alum,5,Amazing school with amazing professors. The academic were great at FAU and they have some amazing professors.
Alum,5,Online schooling with FAU was very organized and the professors did a good hob at teaching through the online portals.
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been really easy and comfortable. Contacting your teachers is easy and quick, they reply to your email fast and extremely nice and respectful."
Freshman,5,"I am an undergraduate student at Florida Atlantic University as well as a Freshman student for 2020-2021. I have experienced great service and attention from this school, they help you in any way and make your stay at the university comfortable and safe. The university has so much around, you can go eat to many places and just do fun things. Everything is 10 minutes away or less which is awesome."
Senior,5,"I have taken many courses online at FAU. Every online class that I have taken was excellent! All of the material was easily assessable, and all of the professors responded to email in a reasonable amount of time. Everything that I needed was located on canvas. If there was another external link, I was able to reach it via canvas. All of the courses that I have taken online provide a sufficient amount of materials and resources to understand the content of the course."
Senior,5,"Ever since becoming a student at FAU, I have become better at socializing with a variety of people.  From professors to students, a new experience never hides itself from me.  The staff are always helpful and are willing to work with you if you have any issue trying to get something done with the school.  I am very glad that I have gotten to be apart of the FAU experience because no other school has made me feel this way."
Senior,5,i'd say i like online more than on campus mostly because it gives me flexibility with my workload. the professors set up their platforms and syllabus as easy and straight forward as they can and i appreciate it. with online comes responsibility and time management.
Senior,5,"i love FAU despite covid affecting this semesters way of learning but i love how they're adapting so well to our new precautions. i have no complains, i've had great professors and earned As and Bs with great teachers and study habits."
Freshman,5,"Florida Atlantic University offers excellent programs in different areas of study. The Florida Atlantic team is always caring for the students and the Owls community, they are always ready to help and provide the students the best college experience possible. Florida Atlantic University has a lot of student organizations and clubs to get involved in the university and make your experience memorable."
Freshman,5,"I did take all my classes online, and everythings has been so far so good. Professors are willing to help you understand and the online platform is friendly to every student."
Freshman,5,"I felt at home there. The campus spoke to me and I felt like I was living in a dream. I felt good in my classes, I felt good commuting and going to class even though it was 50 minutes away. The professors were also good."
Sophomore,5,Florida Atlantic university is quickly becoming a better and better rated school for good reasons. The layout and atmosphere of the campus is excellent and it is always a good experience when walking around the campus.
Sophomore,5,"The online classes that I have taken have equal treatment to us as their in person students. While I am not someone who performs as well with online instruction, the professors and teaching assistants were able to help me get my work done"
Senior,5,My online experience was great! Teachers were readily available for assistance when needed as well as academic advisors!
Senior,5,My overall experience with Florida Atlantic University has been excellent. It's a great learning environment and staff are always available for assistance!
Junior,5,"Campus is beautiful, teachers are helpful, lots of activities and guidance. Soccer team kicks ass. Parking is easy and accessible."
Junior,5,The online courses make it super easy to work around any work schedule you have and the platforms are simple to use.
Senior,5,"My college experience has been great. Being a senior at FAU, I can say the past 2 years have been a great experience. Being on campus is fun and engaging even though I don't live on campus. They offer great restaurants, entertainment, and its great being so close to the beach and other social outtings."
Senior,5,I did take classes online and currently are due to the pandemic. FAU makes it easy to take classes online and it helps that most professors there are very easy and quick to contact.
Sophomore,5,"I have taken a couple classes online due to Covid-19, but the experience was still not bad at all. FAU always makes sure to notify you of important deadlines, dates, and even online activities they have started. There is always a way to reconnect."
Sophomore,5,"Florida Atlantic University has a huge campus with so much to do at all times. The student government is extremely invested in student life and is always looking for a way to spice something up. From school spirit to football games, there is never a dull moment at FAU."
Senior,5,I love Florida Atlantic University. The tropical atmosphere on campus makes going to class easy. All of my professors so far have really cared about their students succeeding in their classes and always offer help. The  dorms are very nice and I've always felt safe in them and walking around campus.
Senior,5,"Online classes are very simple to navigate. They have been just like sitting in a normal class, but you are on your computer."
Sophomore,5,It’s a great school overall! The atmosphere on campus is calm and the school provides sufficient spaces to study.
Senior,5,My experience so far in the enrollment process at Florida Atlantic University so far has been very pleasing. Along with constant updates from the college on issues concerning this coming semester and how they are working on improving the campus. Along with creating a safer environment for the students to come back to if necessary for classes this semester due to covid19.
Senior,5,From what I can tell this semester Florida Atlantic University's online class setup this semester due to covid19 is going to be very easy to follow. With not only regular style online classes but also live lecture online classes in order to help student who will need more help following the curriculum.
Junior,5,Best decision I ever made. Professors and advisors are very helpful. Professors want you to pass and graduate. Advisors want you to figure out what's your next move in life. As well as putting seminars and meeting together of your chosen major for you to attend. It may help with your resume and how to apply for a job  and certain requirements to get the job.
Junior,5,"Online at Florida Atlantic University was overall a great experience. There online course helps out people who worked more than 35 Hours a week. For testing, professors give about at least 6 days to take an exam. Which is very helpful."
Junior,5,"This will be my first semester taking online classes. However, getting to know some of the professors and their passion to teach and eager for us to learn, I know for sure it will be an amazing adventure full of great challenges."
Junior,5,"Since transferring from BC, the University Staff have been of great help. The professors, despite some obstacles that I endured during my first semester, they were very sweet, helpful and understanding of my situation."
Junior,5,Teachers are very knowledgable and passionate about the subjects they teach. The food on campus is pretty good and the breezeway is always filled with student organizations bringing life to the campus.
Junior,5,Teachers are very knowledgable and passionate about the subjects they teach. The food on campus is pretty good and the breezeway is always filled with student organizations bringing life to the campus.
Junior,5,It was well and the teachers were very responsive which made it easier. the teachers also gave us tutoring options if we needed so and would give us other options to also help with certain things that we didn't understand.
Senior,5,"I can honestly say I had a great experience at FAU. I’m extremely extroverted so that has a great deal to do with it, however, as long as you try to connect with at least one club or be open to meeting new people on campus you can have a great experience. Before officially committing to FAU, I was invited to explore the campus during their Owl League event and got connected with individuals from my college department, the College of Business. From intermural sports to just hanging out at the Cafe, I got to meet a lot of great friends and get involved on campus. If and when you come to FAU just remember 1. To make sure to balance school your school work and fun time,  2. Don’t step on the seal, and 3. Have those “Owls Up” (👌) Ready!"
Niche User,5,My daughter did well with the online learning experience during COVID-19. The teachers were very patient and provide clarity whenever she needed it. The classes were concise and still provided a great deal of information. Any issues that they experienced the first day with technology was immediately rectified.  The university did a great job in communicating with the students on a regular basis. Students were recommended to additional resources and materials to assist the online learning process. She was able to maintain her Dean's List standing.
Niche User,5,"FAU is an exceptional university! I am so glad we chose this school among the other schools in which my daughter was accepted. The school is esteemed from the administration throughout the staff and faculty. The opportunities for growth and internships are made readily available. The welcome committee prior to my child's arrival was the best ever. Each department works hard to keep everything going in an extraordinary fashion. My initial dealings with Financial Aid, Admissions and the Hospitality department convinced me that FAU would be my daughter's school. The diversity is unbelievably head and shoulders above the rest. Needless, to say, we will miss FAU as my daughter is due to graduate this semester."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere and diversity of the school is amazing! The teachers are also excellent. My time at FAU so far has been some of the best times of my life. I can’t wait to excel even further!
Junior,5,"The experience I've had at Florida Atlantic University has been like no other. You are not just a number here, you are a student. A name. A person. The future. FAU wants you to succeed and the professors, counselors and staff will do everything in their power to make sure you receive a quality education that will follow you throughout the future. As a student, I was accepted into multiple Florida schools, including Florida State University and University of Central Florida, but neither school sat well with me. It was my public tour of FAU where I felt excited and at home. I 100% all prospective college students to put FAU on your radar, you will not regret it!"
Freshman,5,"I am completely in love with my school. Although i was expecting to transfer, after my first semester (even interrupted with covid-19) gave me wholesome experience i want to kwep for the rest of my college career. Nice campus, area, environment, people, everything."
Senior,5,Great school ! I was nervous at first but now I love it. One of the best school I have ever attended !
Senior,5,I lobe taking online classes they make it in a way you understand and you get all the work you need to do well !
Sophomore,5,"Dorms have a nice view. Safety is excellent, they even have Night Owls who will accompany you if you're alone at night. Campus is beautiful, has a lot to offer (rock climbing, recording studio, etc). Five stars because I absolutely love the Boca area and the school honestly has a lot to offer when it comes to groups, campus life, and experiences."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are very well managed and easy to pass. Material is well organized and easy to navigate. I would stay away from the courses that require you to be logged in by a certain time, because when you take online you don't usually hold yourself accountable in a sense. So it doesn't feel like an actual class since it doesn't require much time, but you still need to be pretty disciplined to finish the course on time and actually pass, just because it's easier because you can look at your notes etc. doesn't mean you can just leave it all for last minute, it really just depends on the class. 
Overall: DON'T take online if you know you won't do anything because the sense of responsibility definitely lifts since you don't have to physically go. But don't be scared because they're generally easy as long as you try."
Niche User,5,I love Florida Atlantic University! It is close to home and my whole family has attended FAU. I currently dual enroll at FAU and I love the feel of this college life. FAU has a nice campus and many different activities and things to do.
Alum,5,"I had a great time, not only I learned concepts but I also got more familiar with navigating online. On top of that online classes allowed me to learn how to communicate professionally and effectively with the professor and prepared me for a future professional communication. The professors were very available to help and explain concepts in the eventuality that we didn’t understand the books or concepts from lecture. Some would have in person office hours, others would have online ones."
Alum,5,"Florida Atlantic university had an amazing international office that helped me closely in every aspect of being an international student. Not only they helped with my visa but they helped me obtaining a SSN, as well as a job and currently helping me getting a driver license. FAU has an incredibly positive impact in my life, it allowed me to build my knowledge, my skills, offered me hands on opportunity as well as leadership opportunities, and had a great variety of clubs that allowed me to expand on my interests"
Sophomore,5,"Teacher make sure you are able to learn all that is being thought, they  are open to those who want to learn"
Freshman,5,"My experience was great the food, culture, and scenery was great. Also the student body is very diverse."
Freshman,5,"Extremely overpriced and useless. Professors make no means to connect with you without the face to face and if you fail in any area of the subject, it is quickly brushed off and you have to move on."
Freshman,5,"I just liked the weather, restaurant choices, the niceness of the dorms and dorm halls. I also liked all the resources they had to offer."
Junior,5,I go to the honors college and I would HIGHLY recommend it to people who are actually interested in post grad work such as med or law school. We get first hand at all opportunities. I WOULDNT recommend main campus. A bunch of people who should have just went with trades.
Freshman,4,"I take all of my classes online. Two of my classes have optional in person appointments I could attend if I wanted to. I enjoy the online setup, and find that the lectures are just as easy to follow as if they were in person. I really enjoy the canvas setup, especially as I transitioned from using the Google Classroom setup my entire senior year. The Canvas website/ setup is really easy once you get the hang of it."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID, all of my classes this year have been online (though, I do live on campus). My professors have been very easy to contact and they answer back relatively quickly. I have one live class which is French and it is the only thing I struggle with. It is hard to understand what my professor is saying in French when the call starts lagging and when others are talking."
Junior,4,"This university upholds their responsibility of a high standard of education exceptionally, their due diligence to their students and opportunities of great diversity which creates this university more unique; for I am proud of being an FAU owl and I would not be surprised if I were to be successful and live a meaningful life, by applying the skills and intellect gained as consequence of attending this University."
Senior,4,"I throughly enjoy the relationships made between students and professors. In my major, class sizes are smaller compared to other majors and this allows you to really get to know you classmates and professors. Most of the professors that I have had at FAU really care about their students and take their time to make sure that their students understand the material. I also enjoy the FAU community! One things that I would want to change is the amount of parking that is available for off-campus students. I wish that there were more parking lots or another parking garage that was closer to the main buildings on campus."
Senior,4,"Online courses have been a different enviornment this semester.  The way professors are switching up their styles and habits which makes it hard to be on the same page.  Most are not used to having to deal with online resources and it causes problems when they struggle because we struggle along with them.  Although this has been a difficult time, I have still managed to keep my studies up and hope for the best at the end of the semester."
Junior,4,"The school is great, some of the staff could be a little more helpful. It is better when you can go in person and speak to someone but with the remote-learning, they have made it difficult to schedule financial aid and advising appointments."
Alum,4,I attended FAU for 4 years and thought it was a good school. Boca Raton is a very residential area so there is not too much to do around the campus and the campus itself is pretty small. A lot of students live off campus or commute. The class sizes at FAU are pretty manageable and the education I received was great.
Alum,4,"Online learning was a little bit of a struggle, but my professors did do everything they could to ensure that I was getting the resources I needed."
Sophomore,4,"Arriving at FAU I meet some friends that I will have for a lifetime. The campus is beautiful and the academics are strong so you definitely have to put in work. The social life could be a little bit better especially for African American students but if you find the right friends you should be fine. Lastly, the cafe food is not all the great and a little expensive."
Freshman,4,"My online experience was and is still amazing, they teachers allow you to email them if you need help at anytime of the hour and gets back to you in a timely manner. Also many teachers online end up creating group chats to where if you need help other students can try and help you as well."
Freshman,4,"Well I first became a Freshman at Florida Atlantic University in the Spring of 2019. Overall the atmosphere at FAU is amazing the students are friendly, the teachers take time out of their day to help and ensure that the students who do need help are getting the help. Great food I mean the café really serves food for everybody, and they are friendly as well."
Junior,4,"FAU has been one of the best experiences and has taught me so much. The only complaint I have would be communication with staff (registrar, controller's office)."
Junior,4,"I like the community, nice area, some professors are great but others are not as accessible. Food choices are improving, events are sparse compared to big schools because students are mostly commuting."
Freshman,4,"My professors are very adaptive to the sudden change from in-person lectures to online courses quite well, and with the courses online I'm able to rewatch lectures for any reason."
Sophomore,4,It’s been difficult to transfer the face to face learning experience that everyone is used to but I believe that they’ve done their best in doing so.
Junior,4,"I liked how beautiful the campus is. I am from Missouri so seeing all the palm trees and how well they take care of the landscaping really impressed me. I do like how prestigious and serious the program I am in is. However, I do not like how the University tries to profit from being the ""most diverse"" institution in the state of Florida yet not take proper actions when events like that of George Floyd occur. The professors in my program have trouble with communication. Overall, the University is great and I would recommend it to any individual looking for a medium-sized school."
Freshman,4,"The faculty and staff members are very friendly and helpful. The professors are respectful to their students and cares a lot about their students. They make sure to help out those who are in need of help. The school and the area it is in, is very safe."
Freshman,4,"The classes online were not difficult at all. The professors made sure to upload daily video lectures and reached out to our emails to help us during these difficult times. Overall, the online experience was good."
Alum,4,"Diverse and relaxed campus, there was no pressure to fit in or try to group with others, classes were good or great depending on the professors."
Alum,4,"There are many online classes available, from sociology classes to calculus, this helps with scheduling in requirements you may not have been able to before"
Freshman,4,"overall pretty nice campus and classes a definite fun place to be at, also it is in an area that is super nice and filled with things to do off campus."
Freshman,4,"over all easy to take the online classes and pass them, the server we used was also easy to navigate and most important the classes were easy."
Senior,4,Switching to online classes was slightly difficult for me. I am a person who makes themself sit in the front of the class to pay attention so having to look at my professor on an online screen was quite hard for me. My professors did a good job at transitioning online and making sure that me and my peers had enough resources to understand and practice the material.
Freshman,4,"I liked the overall campus, it was pretty chill. Not to mention that the education was more than great. So many opportunities were avaliable."
Freshman,4,Online class was very good. They provided resources to help people understand online classes and to get adjusted to them.
Sophomore,4,"While online learning has been quite challenging, the professors and student resources at FAU have been a huge help."
Junior,4,"During this challenging time of COVID-19, I have found myself needing to take multiple online courses in order to stay on track for graduation. I have currently taken World Geography, Physics 1 and 2, Physics 1 and 2 Lab, Organic Chemistry Lab, Intro to Physical Chemistry and Interpretation of Fiction online. All teachers were very considerate and they still managed to provide excellent quality material, whether that be through lectures or follow along guides. Not to mention, the tutoring staff is amazing and will answer all your questions promptly! I think the only thing that went awry for me was the Interpretation of Fiction class, not the teaching necessarily, but the grading scale is insane. A 93% is considered an A-. Considering the amount of work and time put into that class, I found that to be unfair. Overall, a wonderful virtual experience!"
Niche User,4,I like the online learning experience because of their programs that they use. There are very few technical difficulties and the professors always are making sure students are understanding the topics regardless if they are in person or not.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the school spirit the most but I would like to see more diversity at the Wilkes Honors College
Sophomore,4,"Great school to get education real quick, price is costly but overall a good school that will help you get your diploma fast"
Niche User,4,I like that they have medical coursed since I am interested in medicine. If you went to a different university you are able to transfer here. They also offer a lot of opportunities that can help you pursue your career in the that you are studying for.
Niche User,4,I went on a campus tour of the school but I'm not admitted or applied to the school as of right now.
Freshman,4,"Although I haven't had the opportunity to completely experience all the services offered by the school due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, my online experience has been very good since the beginning of my interaction with the school. The staff members and counselors are always maintaining communication, in addition to providing guidance when needed. Overall, great experience."
Freshman,4,"Since the beginning of the admissions process, the school has maintained great communication in regards to resources and information; especially now that classes began to take place online due to the ongoing pandemic. Also, great guidance has been provided to make the most of my FAU experience."
Freshman,4,"FAU offers a variety of online options to supplement learning virtually. I believe one of their best options is called the lecture capture classes. This provides a medium for students who are looking to be in the classroom or give them the option to watch online live, or at any time. In exchange for a small fee, students could either come to class in-person, watch live from wherever, or watch the recorded lectures at another time. This was very helpful with my busy schedule. FAU’s Canvas learning site is very smooth with very little errors or glitches."
Junior,4,"I never took classes online before the pandemic. However, the transition was smooth and students were provided resources to help them adjust to online learning, especially for those such as myself that are not familiar/comfortable learning in a fully online format."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the spacious campus and the up-to-date facilities on campus. the College of Business has state of the art trading rooms, as well as lecture theaters"
Freshman,4,"Professors are doing their best to cover material without overwhelming students. Overall, my experience with online learning at FAU has been pleasurable."
Freshman,4,Great atmosphere and outstanding professors. FAU strongly supports mental health and truly makes living in paradise amazing.
Freshman,4,"The classes online were very straight forward, it was just the adjusting part that was hard but other than my experience was good."
Freshman,4,The workload was tougher but it was decent. The teachers kept up with the deadlines and tried to be there as best as they could for the students. They were slightly lenient when it came to being late with deadlines even though I was never late.
Senior,4,Online classes are good. Instructors are prepared and are available to the students via email. Professors work to make sure the student understands the online format and course material.
Senior,4,Great facility. It provides a lot of research opportunities for undergraduate students. The campus is clean and safe. The school is moving towards becoming a more technologically advanced campus encouraging students to get more involved in the STEM fields. The university has great tutoring and supplemental instruction programs that help students succeed in difficult classes.
Freshman,4,"My experience at FAU has been great. It is not short of really nice people, great teacher, and network of diverse academic backgrounds."
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any online classes yet. But from what what i have heard the experience is not to bad, just keep up with your work on canvas and all should be good."
Junior,4,"I loved my professors my first semester.  They were always there, they made sure they stayed in touch. They were just overall great. The administration isn’t all that good. They take us for granted."
Freshman,4,Took me alittle to get used to everything but it is nice to meet new people and the staff is nice and everyone was welcoming and nice to talk to.
Freshman,4,I did not take online but due to the virus my classes were put on online so it was difficult but the school made it not as stressful as it could had been.
Freshman,4,"Although I’m an undergraduate students for the Fall term of 2020 and haven’t really experienced the college to its maximum extent; I’ve had a good experience in regards to the admissions process as they’ve been very communicative, friendly, and determined to make my college experience the best one possible."
Freshman,4,"Given the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, most of the learning experiences have taken place online; and FAU has been able to properly adapt and guide the students through this difficult time. For instance, virtual tours have been put into place for incoming students, as well as virtual meetings have been advised to provide assistance."
Junior,4,"I admire Florida Atlantic University. The staff is extremely helpful. The school offers free tutoring and Office 365. I would like the school to clean their library because it is extremely dusty. They also need more private study rooms. Also, I wish they had healthier food options in their food court."
Alum,4,"I attended FAU for my bachelor's degree, immediately following high school graduation. Overall, my experiences were positive, however since I graduated, I know significant changes have occurred, including a new medical school, the construction of a football field and an increase in the student population."
Alum,4,"Located in Boca Raton, Florida, the campus boasts a unique opportunity for students to learn and have fun. Boca is near to cities such as Fort Lauderdale and Miami, and a short drive to Orlando. Most professors and TA's genuinely want their students to succeed, there is a great mix of online and in-person courses available, and I personally received an excellent education from attending.  However, FAU constantly overbooks their dorms and students are forced to find alternative housing options off-campus even though they were promised housing on campus. The cafeteria food is not great, and there is not enough security in the dorms."
Niche User,4,The thing that I liked about FAU was how caring and helpful everyone around me was. It's like they took me in as their own and became family. Ever since I stepped on campus I was helped and directed to the places that I needed to be. And when it comes to athletics they try and get the students involved as much as possible so that the players can get as hyped as they need to to get the job done and bring home the dub for the owls. Another thing is is that there are tutors to help you out so if you happen to be struggling then you have someone there to help you get that A+ that you need so that you can be a successful student.
Senior,4,"I honestly don't believe that if you are looking for a ""true college experience"" that you should attend Florida Atlantic University. I believe that this university is geared more towards commuters than people who stay on campus. The majority of students are commuters and don't participate in many clubs or activities that are available on campus."
Junior,4,"FAU is a nice school that has plenty in store for any student who attends. A plethora of the school's professors have genuine field experience in the class that they're teaching, and most professors stay involved with the students and any of their concerns.
The students at FAU are generally nice and easy to get along with. There's a wide field of diversity among them, from people of different races, religions, ideals, sexual orientation, etc. FAU has a groups of people for anyone to fit into.
FAU's campus itself is decent and is well-maintained. While you may sometimes have a long walking distance between classes, there are buses that arrive to certain spots that can take you across the campus.
Overall, FAU will be a nice experience for anyone considering attending."
Senior,4,It's been a good experience so far. I'd say that there are always people willing to help you out when you need it. It's a very big school so you'll never be short of human resources in that respect!
Junior,4,"Florida Atlantic University makes it very hard for you not to feel included in campus life. Whether you live on campus, or off. One thing I would change is more parking! There seems to never be enough spots."
Alum,4,"I did dual enrollment and attended FAU for my bachelor's degree. Very good programs in health and sciences, and beautiful new campus. Arts programs desreve more attention and advising/administrative services were diffcult to navigate."
Junior,4,What I like about Florida Atlantic University is the classrooms and teachers but I really dislike the advising department. Every time I try to speak to someone about my classes and where I stand for graduation is harder than it needs to be. There is never any advisor available during the whole semester.
Sophomore,2,"FAU means find another university. I am already transferring after my first year. Academics are at most sub-par.  They highly discouraged me to continue my major (Engineering) and heavily persuaded me to find another one, even though I was adamant about not switching. Even though I did somewhat struggle, they did not help me or and encourage me to continue. My EGN advisor was very rude and talked down upon me when discussing my career path. The admin has no sense of urgency and they do not care about the students. I ordered official transcripts and it has been over two weeks and my current college still has not received them, even after countless phone calls and emails. The college life is not good, there is not much of a social scene at FAU and they are not commuter-friendly. FAU is only out to make money. While their president makes millions, they give out hardly any financial aid to students who actually need it."
Sophomore,2,Lack-luster to say the least. Most of my classes did not even use video calls or have class discussions and just assigned assignments each week. Did not learn anything
Alum,2,"EZ nice understanding professors, would recommend. the online platform sucks though. I miss blackboard"
Graduate Student,2,"A few terrible professors ruin the Executive Accounting Program! I really wish FAU cared about its students and took the time to listen to the hundreds of complaints about certain professors but unfortunately, we are just  seen as a tuition check.   I have had 2 professors so far that have been literally some of the worst human beings I’ve come into contact with. There are no options to pick between professors bc only 1 professor teaches each course.  They consistently hire arrogant tax attorneys as professors who think it’s their duty to demean a group of working professionals furthering their education.  I wish I would have known about their lack of decent teachers before I entered a non transferable credit program.  I’d have gone to Nova instead! Save your time and money !"
Sophomore,2,"Overall, my classes that were intended to be online were very helpful and knowledgeable towards my degree. However, due to COVID-19 when transferring my in-person classes to fully online was absolutely chaotic. Especially the classes that were heavily associated wit TA's. With emails being the only means of communication, not getting a response to vital questions regarding course and test material is a guarantee towards academic struggle. The course structure lacked organization in terms of posting and creating assignments the day of its due date, rather than uploading the assignments in a chronological order before its due date time to assure all students have the time and material needed to excel in the course."
Alum,2,"Many subjects did not have a proper education. For many important subjects, they were switching professors every year due to incompetency. The teachers don't support the students much. There is very little unity within the school, it is very fragmented."
Alum,2,"Very few classes are offered online. Online teachers don't make the content easily accessible. Furthermore, they are hard to get a hold of to get questions answered."
Sophomore,2,My experience at Florida Atlantic University was not the best. I started my college career the summer after I graduated high school. My dorm experience was horrible. I got paired with a Junior while I was a Freshman and she was messy and dirty. She did not like to clean and always had an attitude.
Sophomore,2,"I'm a sophomore college and honestly from an academic perspective I loved FAU. My professors for the most part were willing to help me, the resources of tutoring, study groups etc were awesome. 

But from the perspective of everything else I am not the biggest fan. South Florida is not ""The South"". The culture down here is very different and so are the people. Boca is a very expensive city so it's difficult to find fun things to do when your broke. The dining hall food gave a friend and I food poisoning so be careful with what you eat there. 

I also noticed how FAU isn't a party school either. Every party I went to basically got busted by the cops and the tailgates are okay. Just advice to anyone who's thinking of attending here- deeply do your research and talk to people at the school before you decide to come here"
Junior,2,"FAU is a great university to go to. It's a wildly diverse school with several opportunities to make friends. Their athletics are average, and the food is good. However, I believe that the  academic process desperately needs improvement. As an engineering major, I think that the math center needs to be improved. Several students have complained about the math and science professors ."
Junior,2,"I enjoy coming to this school for the scenery only. The students, faculty, administration, everything about this school is horrible. I would have transferred already if i was able to but I am not."
Sophomore,2,"The Tuition and Dorms both are expensive for no reason. The Dorms are in terrible condition infested with Ants and Mold, there most definitely not safe to be in because of the unsanitary and health-inhibiting Conditions. $3650+ for housing dorm that is making you sick AND that you share not including the extra $1600 for a REQUIRED meal plan is just no worth it. Be sure to do your research on ALL colleges and  other things related for sure. (Such as dorms, books and per credit hour cost, professors, and all extra hidden fees.)"
Senior,2,"The overall quality of education is high, but there are some professors who are very poor teachers and have unfair and unreasonable expectations of students. Additionally, the administration and organization of the school can be disorganized at times, perhaps due to the school growing faster than it can handle."
College Freshman,2,i do not play sports.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the athletic programs at our school are not very good and most of them have had losing seasons.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The dorms regularly get infested with ants, the laundry room is usually covered in clothes that people never come back for, the elevators frequently break and trap people between floors, the washing machines break alot, and the cable gets fuzzy."
College Sophomore,2,"This is the disadvantage of not going to the University of Florida. Florida Atlantic sports teams outside of baseball are mediocre at best. The football team has never won 10 games in their history. The basketball team has never been good, and the other sports are irrelevant to the national landscape."
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life here is mostly cliquey, expensive, and discriminatory."
College Freshman,2,There aren't any houses and I personally have not been in a sorority but the girls I know that are in them are not enjoying the experience.
College Freshman,2,"I have met friends of friends that talk about taking acid like taking candy. Many boys take ecstacy whenever they go to the club or to a party. Alcohol is always on campus. Its in water bottles, backpacks, and anything kids can think of."
College Freshman,2,The football team is very much sad to even watch. They have no formation and cannot perform in the 4th quarter. I have recently been watching the basketball team play and I have to say they look like a middle school team. The have no plays that penetrate towards the basket. Their offense is so mediocre that it is cringe worthy
College Freshman,2,I want to transfer as soon as possible
College Sophomore,2,"No substance, just everyones way of trying to fit in. If you hear someone here is a part of greek life, 90% of the time you have to avoid them"
College Sophomore,2,Our football stadium is gorgeous but all we do in it is lose
College Sophomore,2,"FAU has good and bad factors - Boca is just about the worst place to live if you're a college student. Most of the people around here are rude, everything is overly expensive, and nothing stays open past 10pm. The school cares more about a football stadium and construction projects than the burrowing owls whose homes they are destroying and building over. The school is overtaken by Greek Life and its conformity, and unless you sell your soul and stoop to their levels there isn't much to do. However, the weather is always gorgeous, most professors care about you and your grade and I have never had a problem with advisors or university staff."
College Freshman,2,"Lack of greek housing is key. Really takes away from it. Fraternities are filled with conformists who just want to throw on Vineyard Vines and do unethical things to women. All fraternities filled with half decent guys are very low key. However, fun is achievable without greek life here at FAU."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't think the school provides enough help to students, regarding finding jobs or internships"
College Senior,2,Terrible. I thought this school was better but my overall experience has been awful. I can't wait to graduate and leave this school. Professors know their material but they can not teach to students. You can't really get help outside of class. This school is so overrated.
College Senior,2,"Can't get any help from teachers or from the T.A. The professors give tests that don't reflect what they covered in lecture classes. Honestly, I can't wait to graduate and leave the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I had the displeasure of going here and my friends and I are currently working. The skills I learned were useless and yet I wasted about 50,000$ of tuition and general fees. I don't recommend going here or to any college, and if you have to then pick a good college one with better catering. At FAU, it is about being a business that earns money off of freshmen who don't know what they are doing and think in 4 years they will graduate with a piece of paper. It's like an over-glorified guy teaching dance class for 10,000$. All the information you need is free in the library down the street or  on the internet. Frankly all the good reviews seem like they're promoted and the bad ones are shifted to where they are less likely to be seen. I am a believer in free information and freedom of the press. Thus, I think you should take the time to look at all the options and reviews before signing off on something. If you don't, that's the equivalent of a scam with hidden fees. A lot of the good reviews are from freshmen who had their parents pay to take some easy and fun intro classes, or people (mostly women or girls) with easy majors like anthropology, biology, nursing, general art studies, etc.. It seems to me after reading a few reviews that at least one thing is true. The more experienced the person, the more they realize the college is junk. When I was there I felt like just another pawn in their system. All you had to do was go to take about 3 tests to pass a class. Think about where your money is going and if it's going to be worth it.. Even coming from a smart person with a good job-outlook on my major.. I'd just want to support my friends and be well-off and inform you that loans and payment to a bunch of scam-artists is not really the best option. I learned absolutely nothing at FAU and I felt it had many bad aspects to it including anti-social people, empty facilities whenever there aren't classes, and yeah.. it's just bad. I recommend at least trying other places."
College Freshman,2,"I love the faculty. FAU has come a long way in reputation of academics and it shows. The curriculum is easy to comprehend and attainable. There are many things on campus to help you succeed, i.e. office hours, tutoring, SS classes, Math Lab Center, Writing Help, etc. However, I dislike the caf food greatly. The food is either repetitive and bland or adventurous and gross. I also strongly dislike the roommate placing. There should be a roommate questionnaire to easily pair people. My roommates and I are complete opposites and I am looking to transfer. If you are able to commute, absolutely go to this school. Living on campus is rough (especially parking)."
College Sophomore,2,"There is really no place for students to host parties and Boca Raton is not really a 'college town' yet, it is still developing places to go out and have fun."
College Freshman,2,Even though I need aid I am very unhappy to learn I will get little to no financial aid.   And Florida's Bright Futures offers me aid but only if I attend a technical school.
College Senior,2,"Athletic facilities are limited for the average student.  The main campus in Boca Raton should have more than one fitness center.  And the campus near me in Jupiter has none, so I have to register through the school for a limited gym membership that take about a month or more to find out if I was approved, and have to repeat the process every semester."
College Senior,2,Get applications in as early as possible because you'll have to correct the financial aid offices mistakes.
College Sophomore,2,Cafeteria is terrible for all that money spent.
College Sophomore,2,The food in the cafeteria is very gross and repetitive. The food court has some decent varieties
College Junior,2,"The parking at FAU sucks and I don't think they're strict enough with people parking without parking passes and also allowing the people with dorm parking passes park in the same places as people that commute to school but we're not allowed to park in the dorm parking spaces. It's not fair. They shouldn't be allowed to park in the commuters spots and we shouldn't park in theirs, or we should both be allowed to pRk in each others."
College Freshman,2,"All of the 'student' apartments are 'luxury' apartments. They charge per-person rather than per apartment. You can pay $1,000 a month just for your room. It's entirely too expensive and not worth it. Most of the students at this school still live with their parents."
College Freshman,2,"The lack of students living on campus means a lack of parties. Personally, I am not too much of a party-person, but it might have been nice to experience a decent one.  If my nose isn't too far up my book, then my form of entertainment is Netflix on a Friday night."
College Freshman,2,All I have to say about the cafeteria food is that there really isn't too much flavor and I feel like I'm taking laxatives each time I eat there. The only good think about it is I get 100 flex bucks during the semester.
College Sophomore,2,It is very expensive to eat at a small restraunt in Boca. The chain restraunts are the cheapest option usually.
College Senior,2,"If you are not 21 there is not much for you to do unless you like house parties. Lots to do for 21+ due to the location of the school (Miami, ft Lauderdale, WPB)"
College Freshman,2,i dislike having a meal plan
College Freshman,2,Florida Atlantic University is more of a commuter school therefore the weekends are very lonely. Parties are rare to occur around here. I take this to advantage because it keeps me focused on school instead of out partying all the time.
College Sophomore,2,"As I am a Computer Science Major (going for programming), I am required to take engineering courses. I feel as if whoever made programming & engineering courses mandatory for these majors don't quite understand that they are different subjects, despite the similarities.

I've failed an engineering class simply because I am just incapable of learning it, and it has nothing to do with programming.

However, when taking a programming course, I managed to pass with a B (would have been an A if I had not forgotten to turn in one of my assignments).

So due to the classes that I feel I shouldn't have to take, my GPA fell."
College Junior,2,"Comparatively bad, not that there isn't anything going on, but that there isn't anything that good or that consistently good."
College Junior,2,Overall they contribute to create extraordinary ennui.
College Freshman,2,There are never any parties on campus since there are no Greek houses. Boca Raton is a quiet area so you would have to go down to fort lauderdale or miami to have a good time.
College Junior,2,If you do not have a permit you are very likely to get a ticket. They want to keep the campus clean
College Junior,2,Unless you own a car there are only a few areas you can go to. the university tries to keep all the activities at the school.
College Junior,2,"the off campus dining is mediocre at best. you have to travel farther for affordable food, but the variety is fair."
Recent Alumnus,2,The program is extremely difficult and tedious.  One must be driven and organized to complete the course load to the professor's expectation.  Summer credits and internship credits as well as an Honors Thesis must be completed before graduation.
College Junior,2,Most clubs are 21+ so a house party is the best option but you'll probably need a car to get to one.
College Senior,2,"They don't have frat housing, and there is not a big variety of Greek clubs."
College Freshman,2,"The school is beautiful, but it has no personality. There's nothing to this school but beauty. It's boring, dull, and dry. I can't stay at a college for 4 years of my life just because of weather and beauty. No. I need an education and an experience of a lifetime. FAU can't offer that."
College Freshman,2,Girls are gorgeous. Guys are not. There are like 20 total attractive guys where basically 3/4 of the female population look like models. Not enough guys to go around and the ones that are decent are gross.
College Freshman,2,Caf is gross. Other food is fine...just not sanitary if you ask me and the employees are rude
College Freshman,2,I'm looking to transfer to a bigger school that actually cares about it's students having a good experience. And a school that actually is located in A COLLEGE TOWN.
College Freshman,2,This school is strict. Don't drink in the dorms. Don't have parties in the dorms. Don't be loud. RA's are assholes. Campus police started cracking down at tailgates so there goes any fun you can have with alcohol on campus. Parking tickets happen often. The only things they don't care about are dorm visitors (which is kind of scary).
Niche User,1,"Instructors and courses were extremely disorganized to the point I gave up during the last month of classes. For the whole first month one of them spent 100% of the time helping students from last semester. All of the content from both online courses were stolen from other schools. The content wasn't even good in the first place. $1500+ per class, with generic mediocre content that you could find on Google for free. This school is absolutely pathetic."
Niche User,1,"This place SUCKS and is a total scam. I don't know if scamming is the norm for universities, but as soon as I transferred away from this dump to a local college my student career turned around completely. I started attending straight out of high school, got two Bs in the summer semester and for some reason the advisor decided to overload me with five classes in the fall, which was simply too much for me and other students as well. I then started having mental problems solely because this TERRIBLE place ruined my confidence to succeed. The classes are very overpriced and all, literally 100% of the content is ripped off and/or used in thousands of other universities. As soon as I transferred to college I started getting straight As and never looked back to this trash school. While at college I also learned that many of my classmates had the same experience with FAU and left for a better school. FAU is a SCAM."
Freshman,1,I did take classes online after Covid. But it was too overbearing and left me feeling depressed. I am now repeating that semester and hope to achieve more.
Freshman,1,"The staff was very unhelpful in my troubling time there and made no moves to assist me with my financial troubles. They marked me as out of state despite having my Florida residency for 8 years now, costing me thousands of dollars. The professors are also too strict to the point of being unhelpful, or so laid back they shouldn't have a job. I strongly encourage anyone looking at this school to please reconsider, as it could damage your future."
Junior,1,"After three years at FAU I can say that I cannot wait to leave. They charge you for every possible thing without providing efficient services, they award scholarships to students who have no financial need, and continuously add fees to your account that do not make sense until you contact them and find out the fees are actually their attempt to scam you and are immediately removed after you begin to ask questions. Their mental health services border on a way to glorify the counselors by offering no help and instead promoting the published work of said counselors. Find Another University is a better name because you'll experience  all  the same issues but at least your degree will come from a respectable institution."
Freshman,1,"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The school only cares about a check. They told me I would be paying HALF of what I paid. The classes aren't challenging. They couldn't care less about the students. During hurricane Dorian they didn't have a shelter for us so they told us to go to a local shelter. The only concern they showed in the whole email was when they said ""If you do go to a shelter, don't wear any FAU gear"" because they don't want prospective students to know that they have money to redo the football team's locker room and redo the football field every three years but not enough to get a hurricane shelter in a place that gets hurricanes almost every year. Then, there was a rat infestation in the dining hall and they didn't close it or fumigate it for another SIX DAYS! Then they finally closed the dining hall and had us eat in the food court, but it was still food from the rat-infested caf. It's always public image over public safety and public health with them."
Senior,1,I haven’t met anyone who actually likes it here and I had never thought of dropping out of college until I transferred to this garbage can.
Niche User,1,"My experience here was not that great. The majority of professors are just there for a paycheck. The majority of the counselors do not advise and they often directed me in circles. For example, Person A would tell me to talk to Person B who would then direct me to speak with Person A. 

I feel like I have wasted my money with this college as they did not provide me with a valuable education nor memorable experiences. Well, there are memorable experiences but not the good kind. 

I would like to think that they would make changes to their academics and get rid of professors who are inadequate, but I honestly don't think they'll do that."
Junior,1,"Within my experience at Florida Atlantic University I experienced unfair, unrealistic education. From a teacher who expressed her political beliefs out loud in front of the class to a teacher who only made an appearance at 4/16 scheduled class meeting dates, the experience was not up to par to say the least."
College Freshman,1,I'm not interested so I can't say much about it.
College Senior,1,"Garbage. Prepare to not learn anything, and to be lost down the line when you enter your major.

In my major, prepare to not find a job in Florida because employers aren't looking for what FAU teaches."
College Senior,1,"Terrible course variety. You pick a major, you are on a set path. Its like we are meant to pursue a specific type of job to get a specific income so FAU can just add that to their ""amazing statistics"". I truly feel that this university spends so much money on making the outside look good because its hiding the hideous truth inside...

I had a math professor that was inept at teaching.

The entire semester no one learned a thing, now there will be some who says he is a great teacher, but if that were true, how is it that on the midterm, 98% of the class failed?

The 3 people who got a good grade even told us after class, ""I just memorized what he said he wanted, I have no idea what this is"". That's terrible. And I needed that class to be prepared for others. Just a lackluster education with a university that only wants my money."
College Senior,1,"I think my favorite experience here, is when I joined the ""Learning Community"". Where they pick the classes I ""needed"" based on the major I picked. I got thrown into an engineering class which I later found out, I never needed. I spent 3 hours in one class that was nothing but a colossal waste of time. We sat in a room. For 3 hours. Doing. Nothing. 3 hours that could have been spent studying, or doing assignments, no credits were even given for that class. It was just a GPA boost.

Worst decision I've made.

I also managed to encounter professors who actually believe in false information. As a computer science major, I took a microprocessors class focused on engineering. My professor actually stated, ""the human eye cannot distinguish between 30 frames per second and 60 frames per second"". Excuse me? One of my passions are video games, and I spend days trying to fix issues I find. One of the things I struggle with, is maintaining a frame rate above 60. Because the human eye can distinguish the difference. There are videos highlighting the difference. In my eyes, that professor voided any credibility with me as soon as those words came from his mouth.

I also despise certain TAs, who went to graduate school then immediately became a TA, then telling me what I will need in the industry, when they themselves have never been in the field, and didn't study what I'm studying, when I know the TA is wrong, because my professor who currently still works in the industry after many years of working and keeping up to date, says I will never need that sort of information. 

I also see professors acting condescending, often telling students, ""ok I'll see you next semester when you fail my class"".

In terms of financial aid, upon being curious as to why I'm getting less, I find out the price for parking went up. When there is now LESS parking available. I also learned that no jobs are looking for the programming languages we're learning. I'm unprepared. .."
College Senior,1,"We don't have greek row. Greek life is not significant at all. There are certainly many people involved in greek life, but we are a beach college. People are more concerned with surfing and going to the beach than participating in greek events."
College Sophomore,1,Housing over the summer is the worst. They close down the dining hall and it's against rules to cook so you must fend for your self. During the regular school year you have the sub par dining hall food. There were mushrooms growing in the stairwell in the Jupiter campus dorms.
College Freshman,1,I hate living on campus. My room leaked water and had ants the entire year and the facility did not care.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do at night on campus. My friends and I travel all the way to Miami in order to hav a great night.
College Freshman,1,There are no parties and when FAU throws a party it is only one type of group of people who show up.
College Junior,1,"I am not interested, at all, in Greek life."
College Junior,1,"Fau is not here to support the students, the school only goes the length to make freshman feel welcomed"
Recent Alumnus,1,It's just another business and not good for parties
College Sophomore,1,The police treat kids terribly and give out parking tickets just for fun.
College Junior,1,"Fau has the worst school spirit; absolutely no students come to football games even though our stadium is amazing. Only Greek life students attend football tailgates and games but there's only so many Greeks which barely fill half of the student section during games. Greek life students are the only ones carrying sport involvement such as intramural flag football, softball, etc."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm at the FAU Jupiter Honors College, which has ONLY the dining hall, none of these fancy food options that Boca has. The dining hall is absolutely terrible, and it's our only option."
College Freshman,1,I did not apply for aid
College Sophomore,1,"The parties always get busted. If you go to a club, you can't get in if you are under 21. There is almost nothing to do on the weekends. If you want to party this is not the school for you."
College Freshman,1,i dont party. i study
College Junior,1,Parties don't happen on the campus as far as i am aware of.
College Junior,1,I can't receive financial aid.
College Senior,1,"As an international student, scholarship choices almost don't exist in my university."
College Freshman,1,Why get involved in Greek Life here when there's not even housing? Their parties aren't even fun and ALWAYS get busted.
College Freshman,1,"Awful. If you're looking for a party school, DO NOT COME HERE. It is as bad as they say. I gave this school the benefit of the doubt hoping I could make it fun and I look like a dumbass now who wants to transfer already. Unless you have a fake ID...a good one...you're not going anywhere with anyone. There's occasionally a soccer party, or baseball party whatever but I had more fun at high school parties so take that as you may."
College Freshman,1,You have to do everything on your own.
College Senior,1,The program its self was frustrating and took up too much time. We were rejected multiple times and we just gave
College Freshman,1,-It's so bad. This school doesn't communicate at all.
College Senior,1,"The area surrounding the school is mostly owned and lived by upper income people. This makes finding apartments very difficult. The only ways to afford off campus housing is to have at least two roommates or rent out a single room. Often for a no frills apartment the price range will start at a $1,000 per month."
College Senior,1,"Gotta get out of town...again, the old people"
College Senior,1,I went to FSU....FAU will never have good Greek Life due to the old people that live here
College Sophomore,1,"the parking is the worst. they expect you to pay the ticket it two weeks if not they add 25$ to the ticket. i also heard if you do not pay it by a certain time they put a boot on your car, like how is that even legal?"
College Freshman,1,The school does little if not nothing to help out the students. I personally cannot afford this school but did not qualify for their financial aid and am relying on loans to stay here.
College Freshman,1,"Amazing scenery but the locals are older retirees that don't appreciate college students being around. There is a mall but it's more for the rich people of Boca, not the budgeted college student."
College Freshman,1,They focus more on parking tickets and noise violations than people causing real trouble and robberies that happen on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"It's not a very good program.My first semester at this school I took Design and I took Drawing 1.Drawing 1 was a terrible class due to the fact that they kept alternating teachers.I had 3 different teachers and multiple substitutes throughout the art course,each teacher and substitute did not properly advise with the prior. Therefore the multiple teachers went over the same material,skipped material,or went over material that we were not prepared for. The final teacher expected us to have many assignments that students did not know about or were told it was acceptable to discard by the previous teacher. My Design class was okay,I don't feel that I really learned much in it. I am currently taking Digital Art and Drawing 2. My digital art teacher is one of the most irresponsible and rude teachers I've ever had to encounter. His main medium is not even digital art,and he always speaks of his disdain of computers. He dislikes computers to the extent that he does not reply to emails or have a running blackboard page with a syllabus,updated grades,or a reminder for assignments. He doesn't teach anything ,he assigns us a project and leaves us to work with a program that we've never used before.Also he constantly berates us for not knowing about obscure artists instead of informing us as to who these artists are,sometimes in a blue moon he'll explain the artist that he's referring to. My Drawing 2 class is the only excellent class that I've had so far in this program."
College Sophomore,1,"It wasn't that challenging to get into my current program but to get into the program needed to acquire my degree,there's a whole process that was never explained in orientation or my freshman learning community class. We have to meet a portfolio with mystical qualifications that can only be found in the depths of the internet and never explained by art professors."
College Sophomore,1,"The classes unrelated and related to my major at this university are terrible. I actually do have to do this program all over again,due to the inadequate learning experience."
College Sophomore,1,Every apartment around FAU is WAY too expensive for what it is.
Recent Alumnus,1,The school dosent provide much ease with parking. Parking spots fill out quickly and students basically have to fight for a parking spot. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Although the campus encourages diversity. Diversity isn't much acceptable. If your not rich or wealthy, students are cold as to whom they associate with. They have a very snobby and clique attitude at this school and if you dont fall in the white, rich category your basically not going to be accepted. "
Recent Alumnus,1, There isnt any social events so its hard to meet new people. The cost of living exceeds the normal amount of expenses and there is no easy housing process its a real headache.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not very active and not very popping... People are young and not very involved...
College Freshman,1,The shuttle they have does not drop you close to your class building and most kids do not use it because of the fact that everywhere on campus is walking distance and everyone seems to own a longboard or bike. They make us pay 80 freaking dollars even if you don't use it which I see no one using
College Student,1,THE GREEK LIFE IS FAKE. I REPEAT FAKE. THERE ARE NO FRATERNITY OR SORORITY HOUSES ON CAMPUS...OR OFF CAMPUS FOR THAT MATTER. THIS IS A FAKE COLLEGE. DO NOT GO HERE. I REPEAT....DO NOT GO HERE.
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police is a joke. I stayed in the Jewish Hillel Center one night to study for a chemistry exam, and a homeless man came into the building and started bothering some students. My friend and I pressed a blue light button to call campus police, but the button didn't work. We ended up calling Boca Raton PD and THEY called the school for us. The man had a knife and threw a bottle of liquor at us before he was arrested. He just walked right into the building, and the FAU cops told us this happens a lot. It made me feel unsafe on campus and I no longer study all night there."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible. There are never any spaces, and the parking lots are so far away from the buildings. You can get a ticket too easily and it's a joke."
College Freshman,1,Ironically there was a shooting 2 days ago.  Three men were armed robbed a student and stole all of his belongings and electronics.  
College Freshman,1,Parking at this university is ridiculous!!! I have yet to receive my car but I have heard students repeatedly complain how it took then 45 min. to find parking. In the school news paper they discussed the amount of parking compared to the massive student body. If you want good parking you will have to come at the crack of dawn.
College Freshman,1,"For the summer term I did receive a scholarship to help pay for my two classes. Unfortunately, I did not receive any form off aid for the fall term, from this university. I had to pay straight from my pocket. I am unsure as to how I will pay for the next term Hopefully I will not have to get any loans. "
College Sophomore,1,"I know financial aid is very well available and abundant when you are a resident, but as an international student there is almost no way to receive any kind of help"
Recent Alumnus,1,"There has never been enough parking for the students or faculty. Me and many other people have spent at least 45 minutes just looking for a spot. Sometimes it's such a hassle, students just end up skipping their class. FAU is in the process of building a 3rd parking garage, so hopefully the situation will be better in the future."
College Junior,1,"Drug scene at Florida Atlantic is not really bad.  You will a few students here and there smoke, but that's mostly if you walking to the parking lot or around the dorms.  You can almost say that it really who you hang around, that will determine the grade.  I haven't started FAU yet, I just transferred, but I haven't seen anyone smoking, drinking, or used any type of drug."

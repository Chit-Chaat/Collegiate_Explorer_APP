Senior,5,Would not have wanted to go anywhere else! I have loved my time at Dartmouth. Great education and students.
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online courses during my time there, but I'm sure the quality of current courses is high."
Alum,5,"The professors are some of the best in the world. It's a small college in a beautiful setting: close-knit, challenging, and deeply engaged in things that matter."
Niche User,5,"Dartmouth, in the Ivy League, is simply different. The atmosphere is more constructive and personal, as the size of the graduating classes are smaller. But this does not mean that there are less opportunities! Dartmouth's graduate schools are incredible, so if you have the desire to study for a graduate degree, there are opportunities to enter into one of these elite graduate schools at the end of your undergraduate study. Socially, it is also an excellent school. I highly recommend Dartmouth if you wish to have a bright future."
Freshman,5,"Dartmouth is a great mix of rewarding academics and a close, social community. Being in the small town of Hanover creates a tight knit community, although also fosters a bubble that is often unaware of the ""outside world"". It has easy access to the outdoors and a generally athletic student body."
Junior,5,"It is hard to imagine a better college than Dartmouth. The mix of academics, clubs and outdoor activities, and social scene is (in my opinion) unparalleled. Everyone is academically driven, and I feel like I can have an intellectual conversation with anyone on campus. There is a sport, club, or outdoor activity for everyone at the college, as most people I know are heavily involved in at least 2 extracurricular clubs. Lastly, the social scene is fun and inclusive. There are different frats and sororities for different all types of preferences, and every house has an ""open door"" policy. There is little to no social hierarchy that I've noticed (Football players aren't treated differently from comp sci geeks), making it so that anyone can be friends with anyone. 

One additional note: sophomore summer is the best term of all time! Look it up."
Freshman,5,I am very excited to start at Dartmouth this fall and absolutely love being on campus because it feels like home.
Niche User,5,"From only being on the campus a few times, I can easily say that the atmosphere on campus is amazing. From sitting on the Green to socializing within the tightly-knit student-body, Dartmouth is one of the best schools within the east coast. I'm so glad I have the opportunity to attend this coming fall!"
Freshman,5,Diversified Campus. It had the most other Native Americans at the campus compared to other colleges I toured. Very secluded environment and beautiful. Plenty of stuff to do environmentally. Sports are a little lacking but that can be made up for with the academics.
Sophomore,5,I like the whole student experience. It is a charming little college where you know everyone who goes to school with you. The one thing at dartmouth that I would fix is the need for more food places to eat.
Freshman,5,Dartmouth has a small teacher to student ratio which encourages intimate learning. The quarter system is however short making it stressful to grasp content
Freshman,5,"I had high expectations going into Dartmouth at the beginning of freshman year. Now, after just one term, I can say that they were utterly blown away. The College is an amazing school, where academics and connections between professors and students are cherished. I had lunch with a professor earlier and we had a wide-ranging, incredible conversation. The campus itself is astounding in its beauty and traditional nature. Also, the College was accommodating to the utmost degree when I had to return home for a week due to a severe family emergency. But most of all, my fellow classmates and students are what make Dartmouth exceptional. They are all bright, intelligent, thoughtful, and most importantly, filled with compassion. At this moment, I cannot comprehend a better school."
Niche User,5,"Dartmouth is a very prestigious university. There are many resources students can utilize. Additionally, it allows students to come out of their comfort zone since there are so many activities and clubs."
Freshman,5,"Has some awesome people, a very diverse group of individuals that know and accept one another. Very supportive community with awesome professors all around"
Alum,5,"My experience at Dartmouth was medicinal. It is a luxurious campus surrounded by beautiful nature. The campus is huge, and the student population is small, making for a grand Dead Poet Society experience. This Ivy League school still sticks to traditional values and embraces strong outdoor activities. The courses are challenging and taught by the top minds on the planet. Don’t be surprised to have lunch with a head of state on Tuesday and have drinks with a top scholar on Thursday. This is what a college should be like."
Freshman,5,"Very challenging, but full of people that absolutely love their school. It truly feels like a home and everyone is so welcoming. The social life can be repetitive, but the nightlife is still fun and there are a ton of cool things to do near Hanover. Professors are fantastic, people are smart, and career support is top notch."
Junior,5,"Dartmouth College is more than what I expected when I began here a few years ago.  Because of a health issue, I wasn't able to attend for 2 years and the college was very helpful and encouraging when I was able to return.  Even though I was supposed to graduate in 2018 and now I'll graduate in 2020, I'm still a 2018.  The classes are challenging (of course), but the professors are incredibly motivating and love what they do."
Sophomore,5,"Dartmouth is a great combination of a very rigorous school and a fun place to live with great quality of life. People are extremely dedicated to schoolwork and to their extracurriculars, and students are really exceptional at whatever they do."
Sophomore,5,"Great school. I wish Dartmouth spent more of its endowment on housing. Dorms are pretty old, but there are lots of grants for students to start their own startups etc. Teaching is amazing, probably most undergraduate focused among the Ivies."
Alum,5,"Dartmouth was the best way I could imagine spending my formative years post-high school. The close knit community and sense of belonging I felt at this school was unparalleled, allowing me to connect with students and professors alike to enhance my learning. This is truly a college unlike any other, with traditions and lingo and an experience that is shared by every student who walks through campus. Not only is this what a college should look like, this is what a college should feel like—support at every turn and constant smiling faces around every corner. The College on the Hill is a transformative place."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my four years here. The flexibility of the D-plan was a definite plus, and I got to explore way more classes and do a lot more things than I otherwise would have done, including study abroad and research. Also a wide variety of student organizations that are welcoming and allowed me to try many new things."
Niche User,5,"Visiting the campus was a surreal experience. Coming from NYC, walking around Hanover and seeing the close knit community was amazing. Not only is the academics great, the culture and student life is alive and extremely active."
Freshman,5,"Nothing to change about Dartmouth. I absolutely love this place and people. Despite having a very harsh weather, the atmosphere is very warming."
Niche User,5,"Dartmouth is my uncle's alma mater, and I have therefore always visited it since I was a kid when visiting my uncle and aunt. Living in the heart of New Hampshire, it is a bit of a drive to get to the campus but it is always so worth it. His friends that he introduced to us are kind and compassionate people brimming with an intellectual aura. The instructors that walk by whenever I visit are certainly world class professionals. The campus itself is a magnificent architecture of grandeur."
Junior,5,"I loved Dartmouth from the minute I set foot here as a freshman. Very opening and friendly environment, and professors are high caliber educators. Everyone wants you to succeed and there are a variety of extracurriculars to get involved in."
Freshman,5,"Dartmouth is simply wonderful. It has such a wonderfully cozy and collaborative atmosphere, which combined with the unparalleled focus on undergraduate students makes it the best college there is. The only thing people should be aware of is that there will be a large number of wealthy students, so be prepared to face some new socioeconomic diversity. Overall, it is such a safe and fun college set in a beautiful part of the country!"
Freshman,5,Dartmouth is a unique place in that many colleges will never give you the freeing chance of focusing entirely on schooling in such a beautiful location. Rural location means fewer distractions and a better overall creative way of entertainment within a community.
Freshman,5,"Dartmouth has outstanding professors who make it a priority to interact with students.  Dartmouth offers a superb education in a beautiful environment.  The people are hearty, adventurous and authentic."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere is extremely homey despite there always being a large workload.  Everyone likes to include the entire student body in activities, and the staff like to get involved as well."
Alum,5,"Excellent professors who engage individually with students, beautiful campus, diverse community, increasingly progressive, responsive to students, ideal for top-notch students who prefer nature over urban setting."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Dartmouth College. If you are looking for professors who love to teach, a beautiful college campus, and a vibrant student body, Dartmouth is the place for you! There are also many outdoor opportunities to take advantage of."
Junior,5,"Wow, my time at Dartmouth has gone by so fast! I have absolutely loved the last 3 years and there is still so much I haven't done yet! Everything is amazing here, but the Dorms could be a little better."
Freshman,5,"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Dartmouth. The professors are amazing, and the students are genuine and kind. I would highly recommend Dartmouth to anyone who wants a stellar and memorable undergraduate experience. Go Big Green!"
Junior,5,Lots of things to do on campus. Homecoming is fall highlight. D plan gives you flexibility for study abroad and internships away from campus.
Sophomore,5,"I am a current sophomore ('19), and I had a great freshman year, but I waited for this past Fall term to confirm that Dartmouth is, in fact, one of the best choices I have made in my life. Dartmouth has a small community in which everyone knows each other directly or through one degree of separation (which can be a pro and con at times!), but it's so easy to find a sense of self here and be integrated into a great community as well. Everyone knows stress levels are high, so hiding it does no good, but the community is incredibly supportive regardless."
Freshman,5,"Rages, but fire the pres and make the school less PC. The frats are great, perhaps the best in the nation"
Sophomore,5,"This College is amazing.  School spirit and the general positive vibe is wonderfully balanced with intense academics.  The highly invested, highly qualified professors and small, interesting classes are unique among peer research universities. "
Graduate Student,5,"As a graduate student, I'm very impressed with this research university. As one would expect from an Ivy League school, funding is usually never an issue for research projects or social events. The libraries have some of the rarest books in the world, a very rare and delightful opportunity indeed. The professors are world famous and you'll easily see them on television for interviews. This school is a little more traditional than the other Ivies as can be seen by it still being called Dartmouth College and not Dartmouth University, even though it is a respectable research university make no mistake. Dartmouth is understated elegance, just the way it should be. Since this school is the smallest of the Ivies, it is the easiest to network in and will surely pay off in the long term. Dartmouth opens doors and there is a reason why the Ivies are so sought after on this planet, but you'll just have to find out for yourself exactly what I mean."
College Junior,5,"Dartmouth Outing Club is probably the most important Club on campus and provides equipment, trips and rentals as well as TONS of opportunities to learn about all kinds of outdoor activities,, from camping, rock climbing, skiing, mountain biking, kayaking and the list is truly endless.    students teach students and it is great.  Dartmouth has skiway mountain too, where students are trained to be ski patrol and provide emergency first responder care - this is a competitive position to apply for, but it is a significant responsibility and learning experience.  

there are lots of other sports that I am not involved in, but people are pretty involved in outdoor activities all the time whether in a club or a sport.s"
College Freshman,5,"Dartmouth has tons of connections/networks. Also, it's name is super prestigious. Finding jobs is a breeze with campus services/recruitment"
College Freshman,5,"Dartmouth has tons of connections/networks. Also, it's name is super prestigious. Finding jobs is a breeze with campus services/recruitment"
College Freshman,5,I live in a good house with really good facilities (newest).
College Freshman,5,Dart's greek life is super open and welcoming. It's fun and you can be a part of not and it's all okay
College Freshman,5,"I couldn't be happier. Love my classes, love my teachers, love my peers"
College Freshman,5,"I love Dartmouth. Classes are all informative, though first-level classes are larger than what I'm used to coming out of a small high school. I can't wait to take some more specialized classes. Professors are great and very welcoming."
College Freshman,5,"Dartmouth has quite a name, and the D-Plan makes it so that there's not competition for internships or employment during the year. A lot of people have gotten connections and work through Dartmouth alumni as well."
College Freshman,5,"Fayerweather mid, where I am living, is one of the best dorms on campus. It is decently close to my classes. However, the River cluster is quite far away from everything, and some of the dorms are not very spacious."
College Freshman,5,"I haven't been a Dartmouth student for very long, but I love everything about the school so far. Professors and students alike make you feel welcome."
College Junior,5,Dartmouth helps you get an internship and get into grad school
College Junior,5,"Lots of opportunities to go abroad, get internships and travel.  I love it."
College Sophomore,5,I've had professors that are extremely passionate about what they teach and genuinely seem to love what they do.
College Sophomore,5,All of the classes I have taken have been quite interesting and the college makes it really easy to explore your passions
College Sophomore,5,One of the most accessible and helpful alumni networks
College Sophomore,5,"Definitely not the place for everyone, but for people who love to be challenged academically, it's a great place to study"
College Freshman,5,Such an amazing institution to be a part of
College Freshman,5,Absolutely love everything about it
College Sophomore,5,The facilities are top-notch for athletes. This creates an area where the resources are available for athletes to practice getting better without any worry.
College Sophomore,5,The people here are wonderful and it was one of the main reasons I decided to attend here. The location makes it secluded so it allows you to get involved with things on campus and form a bond with the students here.
College Freshman,5,"I'm in McLaughlin, some of the newest and nicest dorms on campus, in a spacious one-room double. The room is perfect and I really don't wanna leave it at the end of the year (it's honestly better than my room at home and most hotel rooms), but there are very few bad housing options on campus (besides, perhaps, the River)."
College Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, the faculty are impressive and helpful, the students are diverse, extraordinary, and cooperative. The biggest problem ive had with my experience is the reliance of the social scene on frats, but even they're super friendly and welcoming and most of my friends really enjoy them. The opportunities here are endless and I wouldn't wish to go anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"I have really liked Dartmouth so far. I have met some amazing people from my freshmen dorm, and can't wait to return sometime soon. Academics are tough but rewarding, and most profs seem pretty accommodating and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community. Students will build each other up academically, it's not a contest between students. Super inclusive campus"
Niche User,4,I attended Dartmouth for 2 summers on a college program. I really loved it out there because of how nice everyone was and how beautiful the campus is. The food at the college was great and the dorms were really nice. I got a chance to be able to have a football player and we made a really good bond. I got a chance to meet the head coach train at there field.
Senior,4,"Love the tight-knit community; however this isn't a school for everyone, especially for those who prefer big cities and aren't interested in outdoor activities. Professors actually care about you and want you to succeed."
Senior,4,One thing that I love about Dartmouth is the tight nit community and the wonderful relationships I have established. I don't like how cutthroat the academic culture is and the unrealistic expectations.
Junior,4,"My favorite thing about Dartmouth is that we have a very strong school culture which helped me to transition from high school to college because I had all these weird Dartmouth traditions and practices that made me feel like I was a part of Dartmouth. In the future, I’d like to see Dartmouth make more of an effort to find ways to reach students who aren’t into the quirky Dartmouth traditions, because I think while these traditions are helpful for some students, other students may be a little overwhelmed by it and feel gen more isolated from Dartmouth, in conclusion, I would like to see Dartmouth actively engage students who are often marginalized and on the fringes of Dartmouth community."
Freshman,4,"I am about to embark on college life this fall, and although I have not experienced much of Dartmouth yet, it has been quite rewarding so far. I have already connected with a number of amazing people from all over the world, and have sampled a little of the vast course offerings at Dartmouth. i am super excited to begin my very first term in September!"
Sophomore,4,Dartmouth is providing me with an unmatchable opportunity to pursue a prestigious education that will allow me to excel and exceed any and all expectations while accomplishing my goals.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small student body and faculty to student ratio, the small class sizes allow for greater classroom learning from peers and professors."
Senior,4,"I think in the end, I look back and love the time I've spent at this school, because I've grown so much as a person compared to when I first got here: emotionally, socially, and academically. The school has given me many gifts of friendship and maturity, along with many challenges in the classroom and lab that have made me think about myself and my future goals. The professors here are generally amazing and make an honest effort to connect with students, no matter how many there are. Some even memorize everyone's names beforehand!! 
I definitely ran into some really rough spots here, and the pre-med track is incredibly difficult at times, but all of my gratitude still goes to Dartmouth for an amazing four years."
Alum,4,"Dartmouth has a great community, with supportive students and professors. The campus is beautiful and there are many resources available to students. I wish there had been less of an emphasis on Greek life and better career and advising services."
Niche User,4,I am a dual enrollment high school student who has taken one class at Dartmouth and hopes to take another one before I graduate. I had a very good experience in my class. The teacher was really nice and helpful and was willing to spend lots of time with the students to help. She encouraged questions and when she couldn't find time to help she had a TA there to help. One thing that would have made the experience better was there isn't a lot of parking accessible to commuting students so you would have to walk from far away parking lots.
Senior,4,"The Dartmouth Experience - how we call it - is unlike any other. It allows you to challenge yourself in ways you never though possible. I do wish that mental health was talked about more, as I have struggled the past 2 years and have only recently received support from professors and staff."
College Junior,4,"As I have suggested previously in this survey,  1 out of every three classes I have taken EVERY trimester has been very poor.  Not just ""not great"" but actually very poor!  One teacher out of every three has been a terrible teacher, or extremely difficult to understand and often their tests are extremely unfair and do NOT reflect the material taught in class.  When the entire class performs poorly, the grades are curved so it appears that everyone did adequately, but the reality is that in those classes we have NOT learned, we have lost an opportunity to get excited about a topic probably lost a spark of interest to further explore an academic area.  For the tuition we pay, we should have phenomenal teachers and when students complain about a professor year after year, they should at least NOT be teaching introductory classes.    I am not alone in feeling extremely disappointed in the overall teacher quality, at least during the first two years' introductory level classes.    Don't get me wrong - there have been some very good teachers too - but the ratio of terrible teachers to great teachers is not what it should be at an IVY League school"
College Junior,4,"Only issue with housing has to do with the Dplna, where students leave campus for 1 trimester during their sophomore year.  This requires a lot of moving in and out of dorms.  it also means that during the sophomore year, your friends that you made during Freshman year are never all at school on campus at the same time.  Each trimester that you are at school during sophomore year, people that you care about, or are learning from or working with are constantly coming and leaving campus for several months at a time and it is a bit of a negative.  Sophomore summer when everyone is there again is really nice.  Unfortunately, then in Junior year, people start leaving again to do a semester abroad."
College Junior,4,"I would definitely choose Dartmouth again.  I love the spirit of the school, the people, the professors and all  of the non-academic learning experiences that are available.  I think in the Engineering school there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of consistently having consistently good teachers.  For the most part, teachers are good in the entry level classes, occasionally there is a great teacher, but often ( so far 1 class out of three, every trimester) there is one teacher who isvery suboptimal in their ability to teach or communicate well.  Not acceptable at this type  of school.  

Additionally, because Dartmouth is out of the way for most companies, their engineering recruiting fairs are extremely lacking in depth and availability.  Much of the fair is online.  Being only 3 hours from Boston, The Thayer school of engineering should host a weekend or trip to Boston for a recruiting fair to coincide with all the other colleges there when there are HUNDREDS of companies available to talk to and connect with.  Students could take a bus to Boston and even make up the classes that are missed at some later point if necessary.   Job hunting and internship opportunities are far inferior than at many other schools, even if they are not as highly ranked as Dartmouth!"
College Freshman,4,They care about students and aren't too punitive
College Freshman,4,Lots of involvement in sports/athletics!
College Sophomore,4,Alumni networking is great. There are many career centers and fairs that help students get to the next level.
College Sophomore,4,I've met new people from around the country and the world. The classes are a wide range to choose from and so far my professors have been very supportive in helping me pass and be successful in the classroom.
College Sophomore,4,The school is a small school and I like how everything is within walking distance. The professors expect highly of its students and generally want to help them as much as they can to be successful.
College Freshman,4,"I always feel safe on campus and in the town of Hanover, even at night."
College Freshman,4,"Dartmouth athletics isn't huge, but it is welcoming. I'm participating in intramural sports and they are great fun!"
College Junior,4,My courses are great.  I ama  double major and have a minor.
College Junior,4,relatively safe campus and responsive security and safety officers
College Junior,4,Lots of choices and living and learning communities to choose from.
College Junior,4,SPorts are somewhat important.  Lots of club level teams to participate in and compete with other colleges.
College Sophomore,4,"It is very easy to get internships, fauculty will help you but you have to approach them first."
College Sophomore,4,"Since it's a D1 school, athletics do play a role in student life, esp during homecoming, but that can be said for almost all schools. However, I never felt that sports is more emphasized than academics because the athletes have to maintain their grades if they want to be survive at this school."
College Sophomore,4,Finding a job or internship can be fairly easy through the college especially through the Center for Professional Development.
College Sophomore,4,My experience with my courses was great. The courses are definitely challenging but the content of the courses are very interesting and the professors care about the students' performance.
College Sophomore,4,I definitely feel safe walking around campus and crossing the streets at night. There are multiple support services if something does happen.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are open to both athletes and non-athletes and maintained well.
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a great time in the college so far. The quarter system makes the coursework very challenging, but students are more helpful than competitive to each other."
College Sophomore,4,I personally feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Housing is really a mixed bag and your experience truly does depend on where you live.
College Sophomore,4,The social scene IS 99% Greek life
College Sophomore,4,"Dartmouth is academically challenging, but also offers a lot of extracurriculars and outdoor activities to participate in"
College Sophomore,4,Pretty safe campus...nothing really happens in Hanover
College Sophomore,4,Depends on where you live and which buildings you have most of your classes
College Sophomore,4,A large proportion of the school consists of varsity athletes
College Sophomore,4,"Good school spirit, but sports don't completely dominate campus culture."
College Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, wonderful students and professors. Very expensive though!"
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe at Dartmouth
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is phenomenal
College Freshman,4,Beautiful campus with great options
College Freshman,4,huge part of life here
College Freshman,4,I wish there was greater student support for sport
College Sophomore,4,"I'd miss New Hampshire so much, that's why I chose Dartmouth. Also, I knew Dartmouth was well-known for its emphasis on educating undergraduates well and I know it's been really the case given all of the great professors I've had! I only wish the school wasn't so expensive, though. My mental health doesn't always feel too good when I'm super stressed by my workload either. I wouldn't give up the friends I've made since freshman year though."
College Freshman,4,"I personally don't enjoy going to frats, but that's a personal choice. As far as Greek life goes, Dartmouth's is quite exciting, community-oriented, and welcoming. Greeks seem to get a lot out of their participation in Greek Life."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great, some professors could be more involved."
Recent Alumnus,4,"In general great, but some professors (especially science) could have been more involved."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great experience living in a community house (Cutter Shabazz), my family for 3 years."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great community, friendliest of the Ivies. Some professors could have been better in terms of reaching out to the students (especially in the sciences)."
College Freshman,4,"I personally live in what's considered the ""worst"" freshmen dorms on campus, but even these aren't bad - while the rooms are small, the great community more than makes up for the lack of space"
College Freshman,4,We have campus police that work tirelessly to make sure that Dartmouth students are safe 24/7.
College Freshman,4,What makes my school unique is the liberal arts experience and the many opportunities that come through that.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of really wealthy kids here, like at all Ivy League schools, so sometimes there can be some socioeconomic barriers, but overall it's a really eye-opening experience with a lot of great people from a variety of backgrounds."
College Sophomore,4,Meeting people from all over the world.
Recent Alumnus,4,Friendly staff and personal attention
Alum,2,"When I was at Dartmouth not too long ago, we were ranked top 10, we had the Aires competing, Greek life was the best, academics was involving and fun, now to see where the school is, is just a pity."
College Sophomore,2,I've heard many stories about parties and alumni coming back and hazing new recruits.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's bad in the sense that there is a crazy amount of partying but it is bad partying. Literally, cries on cries in the wilderness. People getting hammered because we are all in the woods with no other social outlet than each other. With the new prohibition situation, I only foresee it getting worse and less safe with hard-drinking happening only behind close doors."
College Junior,2,Gym is not that great - athletes have it good with top quality equipment
College Junior,2,"Administration is more concerned with PR than students, and most students agree with this."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Living off campus is costly and competitive, which is ironic given the extremely low quality of options available. Landlords range from inaccessible to crazy, and most apartments are small, dirty, and expensive."
Recent Alumnus,2,The party scene is great if you like frat parties.
College Freshman,2,I was quoted a price estimated at early decision time which greatly increased after committing.
College Freshman,2,"The social scene is basically just drinking.  Frats run the social scene here at Dartmouth. Because freshmen do not have cars, it is very difficult to go off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol monitoring/safety is very poor. There are systems in place for overdrinking, but there are no consequence-free methods of keeping students safe, so many cases go unreported of unsafe alcohol or drug use."
College Senior,2,"I dont have a car on campus. A bike will suffice for people who live far away, but I get by fine without a bike.
Kids who do have cars park at their greek houses or in a removed parking lot
Town traffic patrollers are strict about ticketing"
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol is everywhere, and most students will find a way to pregame every event possible.  That said, it's a relaxing environment, and most people will respect the decisions of others not to partake."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, Hanover is not that exciting. We have a J. Crew... There are plenty of delicious places to eat at, but as far as a bar scene goes... it's not too exciting from what I have heard. In fact, I've heard that if you go to bars often enough, you get to know all of the bartenders..."
College Junior,2,"It's NH, and it gets cold in the winter. Being from the south though, I can say its not TOO bad. Besides, below 5 F its all the same right?"
College Freshman,2,"Living above Murphy's (there are apartments above the Murphy's restaurant) is probably the best, if not the only, off-campus housing option. Almost nobody lives off-campus though. The Dartmouth dorms are really nice, very convenient, and housing is essentially - though not formally - guaranteed for all 4 years."
College Freshman,2,Dartmouth students don't really seem to care about sports teams. No one really goes to sporting events other than hockey games.
College Junior,2,"The campus is not very strict at all. The police are basically there to make sure you don't die. Every once in a while they will get someone in trouble to make an example, but for the most part they are actually very nice. Some topics like hazing are treated more harshly though."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is an interesting question considering barely any students have cars on campus. The best option is to park in on of the frats lots when they message campus about open spots. It is reasonably priced and in the center of campus. But you have to keep in mind that with your car at a frat you run the risk of a drunk freshman running into your car of even throwing up on it. Or you can pay more to park in the student lot which is quite far away from campus. If you don't plan on using your car often and just want to have it available if you need it someday than it isn't a bad option.
College Junior,2,really cold and dreary mostly; sunny days=gorgeous
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much parking for visitors besides parking meters.
College Junior,1,"Greek life is the most controversial thing on campus. There's a ton of debate about sexual assault, binge drinking, and lack of inclusivity (fancy words meaning creating elitist areas), and such. It's pretty revealing that these problems are always discussed with Greek institutions to show how pervasive the problem is."
Recent Alumnus,1,Too much of every social event revolves around alcohol!  Would like to see it stop.
Recent Alumnus,1,Very cold winters--often well below 0.  Just get a solid NorthFace or equivalent and boots and you'll be fine.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you don't have a car, or money for zipcar, you are out of luck"
Recent Alumnus,1,"I hated the frat scene, didn't find it safe, found it very uncomfortable; Did not like how much drinking was apart of the social fabric on campus; Very hard to leave campus financially and time-wise"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Alot of drinking, sexual assault, rape, overall disrespect towards women; peer pressure; lack of leadership regarding violence/rape culture against women"
College Freshman,1,Winter sucks.  Imagine coming from sunny California and BAM! Put into blankets of snow and ice with sub zero degree temperatures.  Sometimes in the winter I don't even go to class because I get way too cold.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life sucks.. all the parties are hosted in disgusting fraternity basements that are soiled with beer, piss, and vomit (yes, people literally pee and vomit on the floors of frats like its no big deal). Frats don't put any effort into making their parties fun (no themes, etc), so the scene gets old really quickly and then the social life degenerates into a repetitive, drunken blur. There is no social life beyond fraternities, so once you get over the frat scene, you're bored out of your mind."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dartmouth's campus dining has fallen on hard times.   The Dartmouth now bares the dubious honor of being the only Ivy League school to have been sued for its poor services and outrageous meal price changes.   The food is dramatically overpriced (one student was famously billed $60 for a chicken sandwich) and the only thing more unbelievable than poor quality is the stunning lack of variety. To make matters worse the dining schedule is beyond belief.   Food must be consumed at weird hours and carry out options are subject to convoluted rules and a lawyer couldn't understand.   If you care allot of but food, or hate being screwed over, Dartmouth is not the place for you."

College Sophomore,1,"Cute but Boring – The town seems adorable at first, but you can exhaust everything there is to do in less than three terms.

There aren't really and franchise stores either so you're really going to miss McDonalds and Target.  There's a town nearby but it's not convenient to get to. You might get bored."

Junior,5,"In my experience, I would recomend if you want a quality, liberal arts education. I transferred from Wesleyan ( enjoyed their academics) but so far I like the programs at UPS better. Fantastic, supportive faculty who are very accessible outside of class.  UPS has a lot of flexibility to take fascinating classes outside of your major. The PG department is overall good, IPE( International Political Economics) dept is also fantastic. 
I was interested in minoring/ double majoring in Chem and the natural science small classes and labs were perfect."
Junior,5,"Faculty very supportive and accessible through Zoom, I had a good online experience ( despite not wanting to be online mid semester haha)"
Freshman,5,"I come from California, but the school is amazing and everyone on that campus from principal to students are very helpful."
Freshman,5,"Great University, great people, great teachers, great staff. Excited to go here for the next four years."
Alum,5,"Recent grad. Education & opportunities make UPS a top school. Students at UPS are passionate & invested, which shows in class discussions. Professors are active in their fields & care about students. There are many clubs/ internships/leadership positions to build your resume. Active student body.  For study abroad, you can go for a week, a summer, or a whole year (look up PacRim). There are research grants to study in China. winter break trips, etc. Research grants to study in China are available to undergrads! If you have a need & ask for help, you'll find it. Tutoring, counseling, library copies of textbooks, loaner graduation cap/gowns, campus dining funds, etc. UPS is a great place to go if you want a career in the PNW. There’s an active alumni network, but its ltd to the West Coast and NY. Lots of jobs in Seattle for graduates. I quickly got job offers. Tacoma is fun (if you can stand the rain)."
Freshman,5,"My first semester of college just ended and I gotta say, I have learned more things than I did out of my 4 years at high school. I surely didn’t get used to the whole new learning environment but I’m getting there. It has been one of my most enjoyable experiences ever. Is absolutely love this school. And the teaching here is absolutely fantastic."
Freshman,5,"Love it! Great faculty with an 11:1 ratio, makes for an amazing community and great opportunity for connections with professors"
Junior,5,"Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far at UPS. I've found my place on campus in a variety of communities, including Greek Life, the Business Leadership Program, and as a barista at Diversions Café, and am continuously finding new ways to get involved on campus (the options are literally endless). I came from a small high school so to continue to have small class sizes is awesome. The people here are amazing, both students and staff alike. Would 100% recommend checking out this school. #RollLogs"
Freshman,5,"At the University of Puget Sound, I am pushed academically in the small classroom setting and feel supported by the faculty.  The University has made it a priority to help students find their communities and make everyone feel included."
Sophomore,5,Absologgerly loving my time here at the Puge! Being a student athlete is incredible and the coaching staff is heavily set on making sure that academia come first. I really enjoy spending time in Diversions Cafe and taking photos around the beautiful campus.
Freshman,5,"At the University of Puget Sound, professors will know your name and are passionate about their subjects. They are engaging and supportive and are always available for appointments if you need to talk to them. The campus is beautiful and there are a lot of good places to eat and shop nearby! Also, the politics and government program is great and has a lot of amazing professors."
Sophomore,5,"Although I have only been at UPS for a couple of years, my experience here has been nothing short of incredible. The community at Puget Sound is kind and welcoming and I couldn't be happier. Academically, the business program has provided me with awesome opportunities for my professional career and every class I've taken I have really enjoyed... or at least learned a lot. Socially, the campus is incredibly open and welcoming. I have found incredibly strong communities within the Ultimate frisbee team, greek life, and residence life. 
Although I have loved my time here, this school may not be for everyone. At it's core it's a liberal arts institution that places a great focus on individual consideration and a cross-curricular education. If that's what you're looking for then this school will be perfect for you."
Niche User,5,"I have only toured this school, however, out of the 6 schools I have toured this one was by far my favorite. The tour was the best tour ever, the people were very kind and informative and I got a great feel for the school. The school is absolutely gorgeous and has a great community feel."
Senior,5,"University of Puget Sound offers an excellent education with a very small class size.  The one-on-one interactions with professors is outstanding - professors learn your name within the first week of classes, and conduct lab sessions themselves."
Junior,5,I have been very impressed with the academics the university offers. The professors are outstanding and I could not be satisfied more with that aspect of the school. I wish that tuition was more affordable for myself but otherwise I have few complaints
Graduate Student,5,This is a beautiful campus and university that fosters community involvement through multidisciplinary fields.
Niche User,5,"I have only applied to Puget Sound, but the amount of guidance I have received has been incomparable to the other schools I've applied too. I sent the financial aid counselor a question, and no joke less than 5 minutes later he responded with a very detailed answer, and offered his guidance along the way. I also decided to go for an interview, but it was not him asking me a bunch of questions, it was us having a genuine conversation."
Junior,5,"Academics are challenging, but the professors are amazing and are willing to help you every step of the way."
Sophomore,5,"A beautiful community, amazing faculty, and overall just an amazing place to live and study. No matter how homesick I get, when I'm home in Georgia I'm still excited to come back to UPS each semester."
Senior,5,"Wonderful Community! I have learned so much at my time here at the University of Puget Sound. It has been one of the best decisions, choosing to go to school here."
Niche User,5,I have toured campus many times and the facilities and staff are amazing. The students are always doing something and there is a ton of activities offered on and off campus. Coaches all seem to be very involved and very in tune with the academic importance.
Junior,5,"The University of Puget Sound has a beautiful campus and genius professors. Most, if not all courses can be quite difficult if a student is irresponsible and does not make studying their utmost priority. However, there is much to be learned from every and any class. I have enjoyed all my classes here so far. The students, faculty, and staff are all very friendly and kind. If you are a student here or are thinking about applying to this university, the University of Puget Sound is the school for you because as the saying goes ""Once a logger, always a logger."""
Junior,5,"I worried about the location and lack of diversity, but students here are very driven. We all want an inclusive environment. There are so many arts and lecture programs here that are brought in to encourage discussions about privilege, power, and marginalized peoples."
Freshman,5,It's my freshmen year but its pretty great here. Very beautiful. Lots of clubs and resources. Great library.
Alum,5,I really enjoyed my 4 years at University of Puget Sound! I learned a lot and was prepared for the working world after graduation. I majored in psychology and was hired as a behavior technician following graduation. I don't think I would have been hired for this job if it wasn't for the education I received at UPS.
Alum,5,"University of Puget Sound is a great private college. You get one on one attention from your professors, the food is great, housing/dorm life is good and the campus is absolutely beautiful. They call themselves the ""Harvard of the West"" due to their tough classes and high academic standards. I would recommend this university to anyone who wants to attend a smaller school that provides a fantastic education."
Freshman,5,"The teachers are intelligent, and small class sizes allow an approachable atmosphere. The subjects are interesting and unique, and the environment is friendly, clean and socially conscious. There is something for everyone."
Niche User,5,"This was the most welcoming, kind and inclusive university I have visited. Every single staff member and student was kind and welcoming. The campus is beautiful, and it is a very community oriented college which is wonderful."
Freshman,5,I disagree with the reviewer who said you can't take classes in your major.  I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science.  I took a computer science class my first semester.  I registered for another CS class for my second semester but was waitlisted.  So many people wanted to take the class that they added one to the schedule.  I've very happy at UPS!
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus with great studying resources such as the CWLT (free tutoring) and the library. Lots of fun clubs to join. Great one on ones with professors. A lot of rain and typically cold throughout the year. The food has so much variety, much more than other schools. There is an allergy free section that will cook meals special for your own needs. Overall, I think the school is well balanced and a great place to be."
College Junior,5,"Every professor I've taken a course with has been dedicated to their students, passionate about the subject, and incredibly knowledgable and experienced. I feel that the quality of professors at my university is outstanding, and the quality of education received as a result would be hard to replicate at a university with professors less devoted to their students."
College Sophomore,5,"People have a lot of pride in being a Logger, the campus is beautiful, and the professors are awesome."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is generally pretty safe. There are rarely any crimes that occur on or around campus, and the campus police is really great."
College Sophomore,5,I like that the greek life is not known for throwing parties. They are groups of intelligent men and women.
College Sophomore,5,"Employers like seeing this school's name on your resume. This school helps you build an awesome resume. CES has a ""Take a Logger to Work Day"" Job shadowing event it's been hosting now for it's second year over winter break where they connect with alumni and other community members to find people willing to let a logger shadow them in whatever company wherever across America for a day. It's a wonderful way to make connections, there's definitely lots of alum that come and have talks to students and are great connections to have as well. There is a huge chance you'll have a job in the field you want once you graduate. That is totally true but keep in mind the debt you might be accruing in the meantime..."
College Sophomore,5,"People here are amazing. They are liberal and accepting. The rain is light, yet consistent and beautiful. The classes are small and this allows for great discussion. TA's aren't often used because the teachers are so available."
College Sophomore,5,"Marijuana is legal in Washington, so the rules for marijuana on campus are very similar to that of alcohol. There is no three strikes type of policy. If you get written up you will have to talk to the dean, but it isn't a huge deal. It's all based on the severity of the offense and if you just get caught drinking in your dorm room its never a big deal. RA's are also fairly understanding."
College Sophomore,5,"Security is always around and available to help when needed, but they are not intrusive. Security will even pick you up off campus if you are drunk or do not feel safe walking home with no questions asked. Luckily, Washington has the call for help law in place which allows individuals to call for help if another is in danger, and not get in trouble if they are intoxicated. This makes it so people feel comfortable calling security or 911 if someone is in trouble, without having to worry about themselves. We also have Green Dot program during orientation that teaches about sexual assault and consent. People can get Green Dot certified, and it is a requirement for all greeks and athletes to complete the certification."
College Freshman,5,"There is something for everyone, whether it be varsity sports or club sports."
College Freshman,5,"This place is not only drop dead gorgeous, it's unbelievably welcoming and friendly. The food is great. Some dorms are better than others but even the older ones are adequate and the newer ones are AWESOME!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"University of Puget Sound is the total experience.  You'll find world-class professors in every department, who not only love their topics, but love teaching and are great at it!  Even better - the academic atmosphere extends beyond the classroom.  Puget Sound students love to learn, discuss what they are learning, and apply it.  The campus also has a strong focus on diversity and offers numerous opportunities to actively engage in important social topics effecting our culture and the world today.  I miss the Puget Sound community, with all of it's intellectualism and social justice minded individuals.  I have yet to find such a stimulating community anywhere else."
College Junior,5,"I love my school because of the size of it. It is not a big school so the classroom sizes are small and very personal with your professors. Many students including myself feel very comfortable asking our professors questions after class and to get help when need be. Since our class sizes are so small, the professor encourages to come in the get help if you need it since there are less people to work with. There are also many clubs and activities on campus that are great to be a part of and to get to know more people in a smaller environment."
College Sophomore,5,"I've loved my college experience so far. Although my school wasn't my first choice, it only took me a few days of being there to realize that I was very happy that my first choice denied me. The students and the teachers at my school make every day interesting and fun."
College Freshman,5,"Very small class sizes, even intro sciences aren't too big and they split into small lab sizes (professors know every students name). Professors notice if you don't go to class, and people tend to have very close relationships with their professors. I definitely find the courses challenging and engaging."
College Freshman,5,"Though a lot of kids are from California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, there are a great deal of students outside of those areas and plenty of diverse kids. I came from a school where we only had two Indian kids and five African-American kids and the rest were primarily white, so the breath of fresh air is nice."
College Freshman,5,"The on campus dining is absolutely nothing to complain about. They offer a very wide variety of foods and a pretty reasonable meal plan. We only have one dining hall, but many options. The quality of the food is excellent as well, and I can always eat healthy and/or hearty."
College Freshman,5,"Although the academics are quite challenging, everybody attending The University of Puget Sound are there to succeed. I have had a lot of fun and have met many new individuals. My school has a very beautiful campus and lots of activities to be involved in. I would choose my school 100% over other schools because it is the most comfortable place to be. I feel safe, have fun, eat well, participate, and never feel left out or judged."
College Senior,5,"I love the restaurants near campus! The staff know and love UPS students too, so we've got a great relationship"
College Senior,5,"I am a double major (Studio Art and Spanish Language, Culture and Literature) and absolutely adore the departments. All of the Spanish professors are wonderful personality-wise, are very intelligent, and truly care about their students. The art department is also great as the professors constantly push you to become a better artist."
College Freshman,5,"There are lots of beautiful houses surrounding campus, but they may be expensive, although less expensive than living on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Every student receives financial aid, whether it be need or merit based."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are great, some are better than others. RAs are hit or miss."
College Senior,5,"Puget Sound is the best. Wonderful faculty, great people, and fabulous opportunities. You are ready to move on, come senior year, but in part becuase you have been given such a great foundation from which to head into the real world. "
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. I can walk across campus and see multiple people that I know, but it is still big enough I am meeting new people every week. All the people there are friendly and the staff is approachable and helpful."
College Freshman,5,"Our school accepts everyone no matter what shape, size, color, sexual orientation, beliefs, or anything, "
College Freshman,5,I love it here. The people are great and I feel that I am really learning a lot.
College Freshman,5,"I came from the SF bay area, and compared to that there are barely any drugs on campus. If I were to compare it to the amount of drugs used in Singapore then I would give it a rating of 1 for drug safety. "
College Freshman,5,There are not requirements to get into the chemistry program other than being accepted into the school. They know that they can weed most of the incoming students out through showing them how hard chemistry can really be. 
College Freshman,5,I am receiving an amazing education here. I just hope that graduate schools will recognize it. 
College Freshman,5,I sometimes have to spend friday nights working on memorizing organic mechanisms rather than having fun. I am ok with it because I came to this college for the purpose of majoring in my major and not to have fun and get some piece of paper which might help me get a job later on. 
Freshman,4,I didn't take any online classes but the professors are amazing and very caring. My professors were there for me no matter what even if it wasn't about homework.
Junior,4,Most of my professors were super flexible and understanding with deadlines. the administration were not communicative with the student body
Sophomore,4,I love the community and the classes I've taken. I love and respect all my professors. I am a student athlete and I love my coach and my team mates. I feel respected and loved. I am also a member of Greek Life and I absolutely love the environment and all the amazing people I've met.
Sophomore,4,"UPS has a beautiful campus, and so many differeny clubs and activites for students to get involved in. Log Jam, the annual activites fair, is always a great way to kick of the year and brings all of the students together. The academics are rigorious, but they are not all-consuming which means that students have the opportunity to develop other facets of themselves. The campus does lack some diversity, and has a steep price tag, but financial aid is very accessible and is continuing to make the school a more feasible place for everyone to pursue higher education."
Junior,4,I’m a current junior on campus and I have had an amazing opportunity thus far. I have been given a lot of cool chances to be active on this campus in a lot of different ways. The leadership skills I have taken from both inside and outside the classroom have made me a better person and a more effective colleague
Niche User,4,The campus is extremely beautiful and only a few minutes from the west coast. It is located in a good area with easy access to shopping and grocery stores. The school focuses a lot on encouraging all of its students to reach their full potential through research initiatives and internships. There is a close-knit community on campus and many ways to get involved in campus life outside of classes.
Senior,4,The defining factor of this school for me was the people. The care they have for the students and academic success is probably one of their strongest attraction. The students here as well hold each other in high regard which makes the learning environment that much more positive and enjoyable to be in. The support is overwhelmingly positive.
Sophomore,4,Very expensive tuition. I like the area and the school but most UPS students are very radical and bothersome.
Senior,4,"Small inviting campus, could use more flexibility in majors. Food has little variety but above average quality for most colleges. Could use more funding and events geared towards preventing sexual assault."
Freshman,4,One thing I most the most amazing is the level of dedication and passion the teachers have. Each teacher really wants us to succeed here.
Graduate Student,4,"As I have only attended graduate school here, I have a minimal view of the school. The facilities are incredible, the food is cheap and my professors are outstanding."
Junior,4,I really love the community here. The class sizes are small and all the professors are available around their busy schedules to help all of their students. I wish our school did more community outreach to the surrounding area more and was more inclusive and diverse.
Sophomore,4,"The University has the most beautiful campus I've ever seen. The professors are exceptional not only in their field, but as people as well. The SUB (Student Union Building) has great food! There is always a lunch cart special with rotating food options, ad a delicious salad bar. Also, if you do not know President Crawford, you should get to know him. He is basically a celebrity on campus and is the kindest man around!"
Sophomore,4,Just finished my freshman year and loved it . housing is comfortable and the teachers are great . everyone is welcoming and engaging and encouraging .
Sophomore,4,"The school has excellent academics and really prioritizes student achievement, support, and community. However, the school is not very financially attainable for many in the first place and does not prioritize financial accessibility once there either."
Sophomore,4,"I think the university is very inclusive and provides lots of opportunities to its students. Some things that are not the best are that most professors do not put grades online, which can be frustrating and time consuming to guestimate your grade or go see them and have them calculate it. I think for the tuition, the food could be better and the university could expand its reach geographically as well as in the realm of diversity. It spends an absurd amount of money mowing all the grass on campus."
Niche User,4,"Puget Sound is a very small school. You can walk to one end of the campus in less than 15 minutes! If you are currently in a small high school, then you will have no problem transitioning to Puget Sound"
Alum,4,"University of Puget Sound has great academics and community with really committed professors. Lots of opportunity for growth. However, one big drawback to UPS is that it lacks diversity."
Freshman,4,"I chose The University of Puget Sound because when I stepped foot on campus, my heart told me it was home. The campus is very beautiful. Though in the beginning I did have some issues because I felt like an outsider, I had a hard time with making friends since I am very shy and quiet.  With the help of one of my professors he helped me come out my comfort zone. I was introduced to new clubs and I tried to be as involved as possible and now I felt as if I had really found my safe place at this school. This university provides so much outside resources and our professors will put their best effort in to make sure we achieve our goals. Most importantly, we have a large support system. There is someone who is always willing to help."
Alum,4,I liked the Asian Studies department best. The teachers are very personable and help me with everything from letters of rec to career support. It's worth the high price tag!
Niche User,4,"Everything around the school is connected in a way, it may look old but it is slowly progressing to become a more modern university"
Junior,4,"Small and intimate classroom experience with very attentive professors.  University of Puget Sound is extremely liberal and accepting of racial minorities and different sexual preferences. However, the school is not accepting of people with conservative views."
Freshman,4,"The University of Puget Sound has knowledgeable professors who are invested in their work and eager to help students succeed. The students partake in a variety of activities including sports, activism, and music. Altogether, it is a sweet college with an abundance of resources."
Sophomore,4,"UPS is basically whatever you put into it. If you want to spend your nights in a lab you can, if you want to party you can, if you want to protest you can. Of course, we are a small campus which means that there are only going to be a few people doing each thing but everyone is very friendly. If you are really into something and you want your whole college to be too don't  go here but if you want a small campus where everyone is pursuing their passions come."
Freshman,4,"Overall I have really enjoyed my time here at the University of Puget Sound. The people are super nice and the professors seem to enjoy working closely with students to help make sure they do well. I would like to see more diversity on campus, but it does seem like the school is trying to do that, albeit slowly. I would recommend the University of Puget Sound to anyone looking for a small school environment in the beautiful pacific northwest."
College Junior,4,"Career and Employment Services provides help with career searches, including resume prep, mock interviews, alumni connections through LoggerJobs, and assistance in career and internship searches. They host career fairs each semester, and encourage students to utilize their help and take advantage of the opportunities before them."
College Junior,4,"Our security services office does a great job of communicating with students and faculty. Incidences occurring on or near campus are identified to students quickly, with more descriptive emails sent out within 24 hours. I feel that our security is devoted to the safety and well-being of every student on campus."
College Junior,4,"The Resident Assistants responsible for the safety and happiness of students living on campus do a fantastic job. I have felt welcomed and cared for in both of my residencies, and they make an effort to create positiv atmospheres that inspire and encourage residents."
College Junior,4,"The small class sizes and intimate relationships formed with professors are fellow students are important experiences that may not be as easily attained at a larger university. However, even with extensive scholarships, I chose a college with extremely high tuition, and I regret not looking into schools with more funding."
College Sophomore,4,"At least one organization is there every week tabling for a hiring organizations, Take a Logger to Work Day annually."
College Sophomore,4,"I've loved almost all of my professors, some need to retire."
College Sophomore,4,"Students don't always take safety measures seriously, but the administration seems to. I've only heard of two sexual assaults, one of which happened before I arrived on campus, but I have heard of students stepping in tot prevent assaults."
College Sophomore,4,"TP was great, super social, right in the middle of campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Joining a sorority was one of the best decisions I've made. Greek housing is generally pretty nice and the same price as the dorms, and dues aren't exorbitant. Overall, a great group of pretty involved/intelligent students."
College Sophomore,4,"Soccer, track, cross-country, volleyball, and basketball are all good, and football and basketball get the most student support."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing are mixed. While it depends on which dorm the student lives in, most are renovated and have a great student atmosphere, others are somewhat rundown and have a negative vibe towards it from the students. The cost is average, though does require a meal plan purchase."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life also plays a key role in our university system. The atmosphere around Greek life is mostly positive, and most set standards on their involvement and other activities with the university."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics department on campus does have a large involvement in the university. There is definitely a lot of school spirit and student involvement.
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Puget Sound is overall a great place to attend school. The outdoor vibe of the university makes it unique. Greenery is everywhere. Diverse students also make up the population of the university, with a plethora of extra-curricualrs and clubs for students to join and participate in. The professors are very approachable with the student's well-being and understanding of the topics being their top priority. Classes are small so there is a lot of one-on-one time with the professor. The neighborhood surrounding the university is also very good with everything mostly in walking distance and a lot of activities to be done in the area. If given the chance to do it all over, I would choose this school again without any doubts."
Recent Alumnus,4,I've enjoyed the small class sizes and the learning shared among classmates.
College Sophomore,4,"i mean the capitalist system has really got this generation all messed up so i do not blame the ces office for any jobs i do not get, i blame adam smith"
College Sophomore,4,i think my advisor is a warmonger but that is nothing i can't handle
College Sophomore,4,So good relly fun yay huzzah loving it and life goal !!
College Sophomore,4,"I have been to a few talks on what to do in possible bad situations. The school offers a Green Dot education program, which has been helpful and is talked about frequently. I feel relatively safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I have really found my passion and hopefully it will lead me to where I want to go in life. I would not have been able to do that without the professors that I have had the opportunity to work with. I also learn better in smaller class sizes. University of Puget Sound has been a great growing experience for me.
College Sophomore,4,I think that getting a degree University of Puget sound has a certain level of respect that will be recognized by jobs in the future. This school is hard and there is a lot of work.
College Sophomore,4,The best part of living on campus is the proximity to classes. The social atmosphere is great because you really get to know your roommate and the rest of the dorm you are in. Living on campus is a great way to meet new people. I have had no personal issues with the housing process.
College Sophomore,4,"There was definitely an adjustment period freshman year, but I have learned to manage my time and extracurriculars. It is easy to get overwhelmed at this school, and it has happened. Sometimes the workload is so intense that there just isn't enough time in a day. Overall, I love this school, and I am glad I chose to come here."
College Sophomore,4,"Depends on where you're coming from. Because the majority of students here come from affluent families with vacation-homes in Manhattan or whatever they get freaked out whenever there's any violence near campus. We've had a couple altercations revolving around firearms around campus in the past year. That is incredibly rare but we are in Tacoma, the North End, which is the more affluent part of Tacoma but we're at the edge of the Southern border. Still, I come from LA and a predominantly lower-income part of LA and gunshots and car chases and helicopters hovering every night are common and I still sleep totally fine here. It is incredibly safe compared to other places in the state or even county. Campus Security is also really great unless they're responding to you having locked yourself out again but if you ever feel unsafe in or around campus campus security can pick you up or help you get to safety if there is an actual threat around. Also there are well-placed alarm/alert posts (?) where you can push a button and it calls security and lights up until someone gets there but there are still dark, quiet areas of campus where danger could lurk but with a bit of common sense you can gauge for yourself when and where you feel safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"This school is really great at making you or helping you be a great student. The faculty and staff are usually absolutely wonderful and haven't ever made me feel hopeless. They are professional yet friendly and I truly do love everyone I met here but there's a lot of social issues the school board needs to be addressing. There are some ways our money could probably be used differently for better purposes but the staff try to make the students feel heard and while that doesn't create change immediately, it's a start and we're lucky to have all the opportunities we do just by being here.

Its a great place to learn and get an education but also a great place to learn and grow as a person if you really open yourself up to that. Sure there's a large part of campus that is rich and white that don't care about trans, ethnic, or economic issues but if you stick with the people who are trying to have their voice be heard, it can be an incredibly enlightening and beautiful experience. Also frustrating but in the bigger picture it's really awesome."
College Sophomore,4,"For people that thrive in having a family like that and making friends this way it works. Some drop out but there still doesn't seem to be resentment between those who drop out of greek life because of the expenses or whatever reason. They don't throw that many parties... There are galas and formals but those are for greek members only (I think). If they do throw parties I know they don't allow first-years in anyways.. but most parties you'll find will be on off campus houses nearby. 

The Greek Life system here is pretty casual. Not wild. They essentially have cool events together, bonding, they study together and do community work and what not. It can be really time consuming is what I also hear."
College Freshman,4,"Pretty safe on campus but there have been some incidents off campus, or people coming on campus causing trouble (that's bound to happen on an open campus). I have mostly felt safe at all times."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Anderson/Langdon which is widely considered the best dorm for Freshmen, it's the newest and the cleanest"
College Freshman,4,Overall University of Puget Sound is pretty great. There has only been a few professors I didn't really like. Although it is overly expensive.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a two year on campus living requirement, and after freshman year the majority of students have the option for on campus houses or suite style apartments. The other dorm option is pretty basic, but nicer than many other schools. Compared to most schools, the dorms on campus are very nice. Greek houses are also on campus, so sophomores needing to live-in are able to live in their houses which is also great."
College Sophomore,4,"I am in a sorority and it was where I found my place on campus. The greeks on campus are pretty involved, and do community service/philanthropy pretty regularly. There are plenty of events that houses throw that include non-greeks. There is a new sorority joining campus next year (tri delta). There are currently 4 sororities (pi beta phi, alpha phi, gamma phi beta, and kappa alpha theta) and four fraternities (beta theta pi, sigma chi, phi delta theta, and sigma alpha epsilon). All chapters are nationally recognized. Houses have fairly good relationships with each other as well. With any school, there are problems in greek life. Luckily UPS has people addressing these problems and working internally on making greek life safe and accepting for all."
College Sophomore,4,"It was a tough adjustment at first, but I really began to love UPS during my second semester freshman year. The professors are accommodating and understanding, and you really get to know them. Classes are small which makes getting to know professors and students well. I am in a sorority and love it, but Greek life doesn't rule the campus. The campus is beautiful and the location is great. After awhile, you really start to like Tacoma. The one major problem I have with the school is its lack of diversity."
College Freshman,4,I live in a newly updated building so the bathrooms and communal areas are nice and new. My dorm is also really big but I know of people who have really small dorms. The rooms are pretty inconsistent between building and even within the same building. The cleanliness depends on the other people who live on the floor but there are cleaning people that come every week day.
College Freshman,4,I've had a great semester. All my teachers were great and helpful in school and in the transition into college. it was easy for me to make friends at this school but there is a style and attitude that people at this school have that I don't really have so sometimes I feel out of place.
College Freshman,4,"Something you notice when you move here is that everyone is extremely considerate and people are always holding doors open for you if you come up behind them. I feel so a lot more willing to speak up or introduce myself to people because of the general atmosphere of kindness. The campus and surrounding area is very beautiful, and it's widely encouraged to go out and enjoy the outdoors through Puget Sound Outdoors club or with field trips for your classes. The professors are all very smart and the majority of them are good teachers. A lot of them are amazing! The student body can generally be divided up into hipsters, athletes, and hippies, but it also seems like everyone here has or does something cool and unusual. Tons of people here have already done a lot of traveling abroad and student activism is becoming a very big part of student life."
Alum,2,"Great faculty, awful staff, entitled students. Many of the professors I had were informative, accommodating, and supportive.  If I could rate based on academics alone, the rating would be much higher. However, there was so much red tape that got in my way. I attended a good number of colleges in order to get my undergraduate degree, and UPS made it so hard to transfer credit how it should have been transferred -- a common problem with every single person who tried to transfer a credit. The school itself is hypocritical. ""We're so green!"" they say, yet they water the already wet grass constantly and accept money from fossil fuel companies. ""We care about the individual!"" -- BS! They care about graduation rate, nothing else. Every college I went to had it's problems, but UPS was worst than most. Now I have an EXPENSIVE, useless degree from a no-name school. Do not go here unless you like being frustrated and wasting money."
Freshman,2,"While not a bad school, the school was nota great fit for me. Pros: Tacoma is a decent city and restaurants aren't too bad. People for the most part are kind. Academics are hard and most teachers care about you. Beautiful campus. Cons: I got into the worst dorm and constantly found myself sick with a roommate that was far too different from me. I'm not very liberal, and I can say if you are not, DON'T go here, your opinions will not be welcomed by many. Parties are more like kickbacks, but you can only goto so many because you actually gotta know people to get in. The campus is so small that anything and everything you do is public the next day. The food gets repetitive with only one cafe. Rain. Lots of rain. I wish I could express more,  but I only get 1000 characters."
Niche User,2,"My year @ UPS was a disaster for many reasons, most were caused or worsened by UPS
 -quality of  education, housing,  food dont match up w/ the outrageous price tag
-The dorm I was in freshman year was a nightmare: so much trash it smelled, food trays left out, beans in the laundry room sink, broken light fixtures in the hall, also incredibly crowded and led to constant social issues between residents
-social structure of the school operates like a highschool, with cliques, popularity hierarchy, exclusive parties etc. If you're not 'in' you have NOTHING to do, especially if underage 
-Tacoma itself: transit systems poor, safety issues- In the 1  year I was 3 incidents involving guns occurred on campus. 
-Health services for such a small school  were terrible, somehow not able to handle its small student body 
-Housing services were a mess and imposed roommates on people with hour's notice
Overall save your 60k and pay a fraction somewhere that values your money, health, and safety"
College Sophomore,2,"Diversity is lacking. I have friends who are minorities who feel comfortable and who do not feel comfortable. It's something the school is actively working on. We just got a new president who is black, gay, and a first generation college student so I am hoping that he will help work on increasing diversity and acceptance."
College Freshman,2,It literally just revolves around the greek life. There should be more activities that are not greek sponsored.
College Freshman,2,"We have most of the big sports, however they are all d3. If you're looking for a big sports program this is not the place for you. Sports is not a big part of the social scene nor the social structure."
College Freshman,2,"The teams at this school that are good do not get enough support (such as the soccer teams), and the teams that are not very good (such as the football team) get the most support, which does not make much sense."
College Freshman,2,"I do not think the local food in the area is good.  Besides the metropolitan market, I do not think there are very many healthy options around the school, unless you go to downtown Tacoma.  The food is not of very high quality and it is very unhealthy food, such as Mexican and taco restaurants, bad asian food, and unhealthy breakfast foods."
College Freshman,2,"They don't give a lot of aid. The largest scholarship they give (after the 4 full rides) is less than half of the full tuition. So, lots and lots of scholarships. They do a lot better at giving you scholarships for your sophmore year."
College Sophomore,2,"There are definitely a lot of disappointing weekends. GOOD parties probably happen once a month, if that. Weekday things are completely out of the question. Frat houses have the best, normal parties."
College Freshman,2,If you like grey and rain then this is the schools for you.
College Freshman,2,Not smoking pot puts you in the minority.
College Freshman,2,School is pretty strict about most things. Administration handles disciplinary matters horrible. No chance of verbal warnings or second chances.
College Freshman,2,"Health services are unbelievably bad. Hours are limited, and appointments are nearly impossible to get. How foolish I was to think I could walk in and get care. Staff not friendly. Security services are decent/good."
College Freshman,2,"School is quite far away from anything worthwhile. Tacoma is very much a boring place to live. Restaurants are mediocre at best, no nightlife, crappy areas everywhere."
College Freshman,2,"Wifi can be unreliable and slow. Took them a few months to figure it all out. Tech services are pretty bad, seems like they aren't on top of it"
College Freshman,2,"There's not much school spirit, and we don't go to games because we find other things more fun."
College Freshman,2,I'm very unhappy here. Looking to transfer far far away.
College Freshman,2,Busses stop running very early even on weekends.
College Sophomore,2,"The only sport that gets any attention is our crappy football team. The gym on campus is small, overcrowded, and not very clean. I rarely workout in there and usually avoid it in general. Another big downfall of on-campus life."
College Sophomore,2,Really shitty internet and tech services. Probably one of the worst things about this school.
College Sophomore,2,"I may be partially biased to this review since I was born and raised on Maui, Hawaii. There aren't a lot of things to do here and activities are very campus-based."
College Freshman,2,"If you are gay and are thinking about coming to this school let me help you out with some simple math. 
There are 2600 students at this school. Lets assume that it is split 50/50 between men and woman. 
Then there are going to be 1300 students who are the same gender as you. If you give a very high estimate about the precent of the people on campus who are gay, and say it is 5% then there are 65 students on campus who have the same sexual orientation and gender as you. Now consider account that most straight people on campus cannot find anyone who they are sexually interested in because of how small the population of students here is. No matter how gay friendly the campus is, the small size will make it difficult for you. "
College Sophomore,2,"I love the outdoors and have the opportunity to rock climb, kayak and play club sports at UPS, but I miss a more spirited campus with more student connections.  I do have some wonderful friends, but many students here have receded into their own computers and virtual worlds rather than working socially together as I had imagined students would do in college.  I know most students in college participate in virtual worlds. Part of this is understandable.  But college should also be about interacting face to face, and part of that can be encouraged by the school’s architecture. At UPS there is not a central hub or a place to gather.  I do spend time in the tiny café, talking to others and studying.  I love the library, too, but again, these are more solitary experiences than communal ones.  The town outside is not connected to our school life and we are not to it.  This isolation moves me to apply to a school where there are more students who reach out socially, who want to connect and are encouraged to do so by the campus culture and the sheer fact that there are more students engaging.

I never struggled socially my entire life, but coming here I noticed something different. I feel many of the people here are people that have been swept under the rug before in their life and finally here they are making friends.  I feel like I came to a school that is under a rug, and I am nice to many people but have little desire to be their friends.  What I'm saying is I was considered someone who is ""popular"", but I have little desire to be popular at this school because I wouldn't want to fit in with the people that have never had the skills to fit in.  To fit in, I'd have to not fit in, in relationship to my standards.  Often someone who fits in here is edgy, and/or immature, and that is not me and I'm not willing to change myself to that to fit in.  

 "
College Freshman,2,"UPS greek life and the general definition of greek life aren't the same: it's not a prominent feature of the school, the parties are few and far between, and no one really cares except for the people in the greek system."
College Freshman,2,"This is a very liberal, democratic, predominantly non-religious school: the people I've met who identify as religious are either unorthodox or not practicing. If you fall on the opposite end of the scale, you should be respected, but you might stand out. "
College Freshman,2,"the campus network has had a few problems/it's really slow sometimes. I have spent way too many hours at tech support and they told me I needed a new part for my computer when the apple store told me I just needed to change my settings. Apple logos are abundant in Diversions/classes/on campus in general, I haven't met anyone who doesn't have their own laptop. "
College Freshman,2,"My RAs are up in my grill, but i hear other students got a better situation. meal plans and on campus housing is expensive and also mandatory for the first two years. You are involved with people on your floor as you want to be, and overall I've heard that contention is kept to a minimum. "
College Freshman,2,"This is not a Greek heavy school. Only about 25% of the school partakes in Greek life, and many don't live in the Greek housing. They do do some activities, but it's not the greatest program. If you want to join, it is there, but they are not that great."
College Sophomore,2,"In case you aren't from or familiar with the Seattle area, it is always raining!! Classes are super close to dorms, which makes it bearable.  It sometimes snows in the winter, but is usually melted after a day or two."
College Sophomore,2,"Tacoma is not the greatest place to live.  If you are looking for a school that is involved with the city, this is not the school for you.  Students don't typically venture of in Tacoma at all.  Tacoma has a lot of museums that are kind of cool.  The glass museum and the recently opened car museum are ones I would recommend.  There's really not a whole lot to do in Tacoma.  There are a few good restaurants but thats about it."
College Sophomore,2,"Tacoma has a few good resturants but traveling to them is impossible unless you have or borrow a car. The places you're able to get to by foot, with ease, are all fast food and/or just bad, over-priced food. But if you're drunk or high or anything, you'll feel right at home most nights."
College Freshman,2,"There is a very low percentage of diversity at UPS. Unfortunately, it's mostly caucasian with some asians and a very very small percentage of black people. Often times I wished there were more students from outside of the United States, but the students that attend my school can often times be judgemental and harsh to those who are from other countries."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, you won't find very many activities to do and will find yourself bored quite often.  If you do have a car, however, your options will vastly increase and you'll be able to find lots of things to do, especially in Seattle."
College Freshman,2,"They have a 0 tolerance for alcohol and drugs, but the RA's are all chill. As long as your not being loud and obnoxious, you should be safe. The Sorority houses however are fairly strict with NO alcohol, or even alcohol paraphenelia in the house. If thers a fire and something alcohol related is found, the inssurance won't cover it."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few fun places to go in Tacoma, but without a car it can be pretty difficult. The public transportation is terrible. Point Defiance Park is cool, as well as the Museum of Glass and Tacoma Art Museum. There's a cute movie theater close to campus, but there's a lot more to do in Seattle if you can get there."
College Sophomore,2,"Minorities Are Lacking – There are many white students, it's kind of difficult to be a minority. But I tried to not let it affect me"
College Sophomore,2,A Lot of People Do It – It seems that half the student body is in to doing hard drugs like acid.
College Sophomore,2,Not much better than an above average high school.
College Freshman,2,Diversity for me was a major part of my checklist which is why I'm sometimes surprised that I ended up at UPS. The majority of students at UPS are white and it is very rare to come across people of other races. The university doesn't always acknowledge its lack of diversity. I wish there was more of a variety of students regarding race and international students.
Sophomore,1,"I would never recommend this school to anyone. It is a scam. They claim to have tons of resources and claim to care about their students, this is false. All their resources are only available to 1% of the students. For example, PacRim is the only good thing about the school but most students don't even get in. They try to get more money out you whenever they can. The food is AWFUL!!!! They claim that Greek Life is not important, but it is. Greek life creates a divide between them and normal students. The diversity is an insult to America. The athletics are stupid. They treat their athletes like shit and expect so much from them. I would not recommend this school AT ALL!!!!!!"
Alum,1,"Beautiful campus. Most students here are unfriendly snobs. A few professors are excellent, but most are pretentious.  Overall, Puget Sound (UPS) is not worth the hefty price tag."
College Sophomore,1,"They'll waste your money as much as they can while you're there. You won't begin taking classes for your actual major until sophomore year, basically you'll end up wasting your money during the first year because they have their own classes they want you to take. If you don't want to dive directly into your desired major during your first-year, I wouldn't recommend Puget Sound. During my first year I felt like my parents were wasting a lot of money because I had technically started college but I had to take required classes just like a high school student. Since this school isn't diverse, the class discussions were one sided and unwelcoming to any one who wants to challenge social norms."
College Sophomore,1,"I always felt uneasy about any assaults on campus. I'm sure they keep them on lock if there are any. Tacoma is a very unsafe location and coming from out of state it wasn't what I was expecting. Please do research about the area if your coming from out of state. The school itself is in a safe neighborhood but everything around it pretty sketchy. Students call the school ""Tacompton"" because of the active gang violence in the city of Tacoma. If you plan on staying on campus at all times then you'll be okay but if you plan to venture, I'd be careful and bring friends."
College Sophomore,1,This place isn't the best place for Greek life. There are 8 Greek houses. They're trying to expand the Greek life here by adding more organizations but it's still pretty low-key. Since there's only a small amount of students doing Greek life it's really clique-y. Most Greeks are more proud about their national organization than the individual house. It's really exclusive. Most Greeks only hang out with Greeks.
College Sophomore,1,"This school is full of upper middle class Caucasian students that feel they're entitled and  don't care about any social issues that don't revolve around their own personal demographic. This school manifests privileged students, gives them an average but very expensive education and then sends them out into the world unaware about social issues and the skill to think critically in order to solve world problems. Based on the schools website they're really good at promoting diversity and acceptance and its false. As a student of color and a member of the lgbtq community I felt like an outcast. Having acceptance towards people that are different and having tolerance are two different things. Just keep that in mind."
College Freshman,1,I don't feel safe here.
College Freshman,1,Little to no students attend sporting events
College Freshman,1,Rain. Cold. Occasional Sunny Day. Crap.
College Freshman,1,"Most of the students I meet tend to come from the same socioeconomic class as I, and most grew up in upper middle class suburbs and are white. We do seem to have a pretty vibrant gay community though"
College Freshman,1,They are so slow that you could start trying to log in and then leave for 10 minutes and it will still be loading when you get back.
College Freshman,1,"Coming from California the weather is truthful not the best for a large portion of the year. When the weather is nice, it's beautiful. The weather isn't great that often though."
College Sophomore,1,"The only social places are two coffee shops and a pizza place.  While these coffee shops are good and the pizza is good, they are not the social hub the schools needs.  There is nothing to do when it rains, and no popular hangout to socialize. "
College Sophomore,1,"The Football team is the lowest division in the nation, and the last place.  Essentially they are the worst college football team in the nation despite the huge effort I see them put in.  Hardly any fan support, and most of it is from other athletes.  I would give school spirit a 1/10 fan support a 1/10 and athletic facilities a 3/10.  Often times the gym is overcrowded, and the set up is very subpar.  The football stadium really can't be considered a ""stadium"".

Mens soccer did win first this year."
College Sophomore,1,"The bars are not classy.  Drinks are not cheap.  Also get the stray tacoma locals coming in that roughen the atmosphere up.  There really is no ""college"" bar around here unless you go all the way up to Seattle.  Underage nightlife is horrendous. Greek life collectively has maybe 5 parties a semester, which they have to be scheduled with the school and there is no drinking allowed.  Off campus parties start early and end early.   You often time get obscure music that no one has heard of.  There is not much drinking at these parties either, mostly drinking happens in a pre-game form where people drink at their houses or dorm rooms then head out in the rain hoping to find a party.  Parties happen only on friday and saturday and there are only a few."
College Sophomore,1,"When I was picking college I was like ""yeah who cares about the weather, I'm not going to choose the school I go to just because of the weather.""  After one year at this school I've had a complete change in heart.  The school is not very social when it rains and there is nothing to do. Many students here have receded into their own computers and virtual worlds rather than working socially together as I had imagined students would do in college.  I feel college should also be about interacting face to face, and part of that can be encouraged by the school’s architecture. At UPS there is not a central hub or a place to gather. This becomes  even more problematic when it is raining because there aren't any people outside throwing a frisbee or hanging out on the lawns socializing.  I do spend time in the tiny café, talking to others and studying.  I love the library, too, but again, these are more solitary experiences than communal ones. "
College Sophomore,1,All S****y Houses.  Rent can be cheap if split with housemates.
College Sophomore,1,"It is the most pathetic greek life there is.  Not classy, not full of partying.  The stereo-types of the fraternities are the lease fraternity-like images that exist.  SAE is the ""hipster"" fraternity, Sigma Chi is the ""nerd/equality"" fraternity, and well Phi Delta Theta is just a bunch of football players who just like to say they are in a fraternity because they think that is cool.  These are literally the worst chapters that exist in each of the fraternities.  They are all on campus, and have to follow strict rules.  SAE and Phi Delta Theta are considered ""dry houses"" where alcohol is not allowed.  All parties have to be coordinated with the school and there are usually 1 or 2 from each fraternity a semester.  Most of them dress in sweatshirts and sweatpants on a regular basis. They like to pretend it is a status thing, it definitely isn't.  They are more proud of there national fraternity image rather than their own.

Sororities, I can say only a few sorority girls would even have a chance at rush for any big greek life schools.  Again it is all fake.  These girls are really immature and just love to talk about themselves on Facebook.  

I would recommend going Greek as it is better than the alternative at this school."
College Sophomore,1,"Theres not a huge bus system in Tacoma, and the school does not really stress the importance of transportation either.  There are a few zip cars available on campus, but I have never known anyone to use them."
College Sophomore,1,"UPS is really not a party school at all.  Frat parties are usually fun, but do not happen frequently.  Other than that, there are casual get togethers that happen through out the year. Parties do not happen every weekend here. If you are 21 or older, there are a couple of bars on 6th ave.  I believe the amount of parties are only going to lessen by the new 2-year housing rule."

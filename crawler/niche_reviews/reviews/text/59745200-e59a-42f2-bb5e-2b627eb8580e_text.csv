Junior,5,Almost Perfect! The professors are amazing and really care about you. Many of the professors take students input to heart and want to make learning engaging. All of the riding staff are also great and work really hard to make the riding program great. The school really makes an effort to be sustainable by using produce grown in the greenhouse and having an apiary.
Junior,5,Online classes are mostly organized and I've had no problems with them. Professors work hard to accommodate students.
Junior,5,Great! They really have put lots of effort to make online learning better. I really appreciate that.
Freshman,5,"The professors at Sweet Briar College are amazing and are there to help you when ever you need it. They genuinely care about you as a person, not just as a student, so if you need help or just listening ear for something outside of class they are there for you. The classes are engaging and informative allowing for you to not only learn information for class, but have fun while doing so."
Alum,5,"As an alum, Sweet Briar sisterhood is something I cherish the most. The school has a unique history and the ability to connect driven, confident women from all over the world. As a student at SBC, I was able to dip my toes into a variety of things... DIII student athlete, student life programs coordinator, Junior Year in France study abroad opportunity, and various science internships coordinated by our helpful alumna network!

Almost everyone has the ability to find their niche at Sweet Briar and create opportunities for academic and personal growth!"
Alum,5,"I’m a 2010 grad and SBC prepared me very well for life after college. I attended graduate school and received my master’s and felt completely equipped to handle the level of work that came with graduate school, as it was on par with the work I experienced at Sweet Briar. Our network of Alumnae have proven to be extremely helpful in many events throughout my life: finding housing, jobs, etc. I would absolutely recommend SBC to any young woman wishing to receive a top notch education."
Alum,5,"Going to SBC was honestly the best thing I've done. And i really thought I originally wanted to go to a big college and definitely didn't want to go to an all women's college. However, looking back on it I've become more outgoing and really speak my mind now. So much to the point that my teachers/coaches saw a difference in how I hold myself now compared to who I was as a freshman. The small class sizes helped me feel confident about asking for help when I wasn't understanding as well as getting to know the professors. Also the friends you make are literally going to stay with you. -Engineer major, bio and math minor class of 2017"
Alum,5,"Going to Sweet Briar was the best decision I ever made. It is not a perfect school but it is special in a way that I cannot fully describe. It is beautiful, the academics are extraordinary, you will make true friends, it is a magical place. It is not right for everyone but there was nowhere better for me. The kind of experience you get at a women's college is mind blowing, so much so that I can't describe it to people who haven't lived it."
Alum,5,"2019 alum here - You will get out of your academics what you put into them. I know many people who got a phenomenal education and took full advantage of the opportunities to do independent research, study abroad, and take on experiential learning opportunities. The campus is beautiful, the faculty are incredible, and while it isn't perfect (and there are issues, like a few office personnel in administrative offices such as financial aid can be difficult to deal with), it became home to me during my time there. The faculty and staff genuinely care about students, and there are plenty of opportunities to go around in student leadership positions from athletics and student government to campus jobs. It is not an easy experience, but if you want to grow as a person and become the kind of formidable woman Sweet Briar is known for attracting and producing, I guarantee that you will have plenty of opportunities to flourish and make friendships and connections that will last for a lifetime."
Senior,5,"The college offered me a fantastic rate. This ended up being cheaper than the price would be for an in state public college. The price that I was quoted for the college was what I ended up paying. The people at the school are friendly. You can find the type of people you would want to friend. The quality of education is  better than other colleges that I have attended. The campus is beautiful and contains 22 historical buildings. There are many activities for students each month. I have attended rock climbing, skiing, swimming in the indoor pool, and working out in the gym. If you have a gpa from high school that is at least a 3.0 you will be offered scholarships that will decrease the cost of tuition significantly. If you are eligible for work study if a job is available and you apply for it they make sure work study eligible students are given preference."
Alum,5,"Sweet Briar offers students a well rounded education that teaches students how to seek out knowledge, apply it, and make it work for them. Each and every student leaves campus as part of an every expanding network of woman professionals who are actively working to make a difference in the world around them. This is a school for people who strive to stand out, who seek out problems so they can build up solutions, and who want to find out just how strong they can be."
Alum,5,"It is an all women's college. However, I did not mind that. Being only with women gave me a chance to develop myself without male competitors. For those who do desire male company, the college does organize regular trips to the neighboring boys school.
   the professors are great. They are invested in each student. I am still in touch with them.
  the campus is gorgeous. The academic part is very close together, but there are tons of trails.
  the riding program and museum are amazing."
Freshman,5,"As someone who was in STEM programs in high school, I thought being the only girl in some of my classes wasn't a big deal at all. In the Engineering program at Sweet Briar, I realize that not only was it a big deal socially but it impacted my academic performance. The pink bubble has helped me find confidence in my abilities and future as a female in science."
Freshman,5,"Sweet Briar College is a place where women truly empower other women.  Here at Sweet Briar there is a sisterhood that can only be understood by a  fellow SBC Vixen themselves. We have a great alumnae connection, who help and support fellow Vixens in any way possible, they are looking to make sure you succeed.  As an all girls school the college allows you to truly focus on yourself  and your studies. It's a place of academic excellence where men only come to visit. The campus consists of beautiful acreage that makes it a sight for sore eyes, we have a great art barn and riding center. We will be waiting to welcome you with open arms always, so what are you waiting for?"
Sophomore,5,"Sweet Briar College (SBC) offers a wonderful, unique college experience. Due to its small size and all-female student body, SBC cultivates a welcoming, intimate community. By the second semester of my sophomore year, I can honestly say I know the names of the majority of the student body. Professors are always accessible and willing to help students; opportunities to work with professors on research projects are always available and encouraged. Ultimately, I feel blessed to have discovered this college."
Alum,5,Sweet Briar is a small school where you get to know all of your professors personally. I cherish all the friends and memories I made.
Sophomore,5,"I love Sweet Briar dearly! There are just a few things I would like to see change. The food isn't great, however, we have just changed our catering company so it will hopefully improve. I also think that some of the dorms and academic buildings could also use some renovation."
Senior,5,I like Sweet Briar college because everyone treats you like family. People sincerely care about you and your well being and people go out of their way to help you. The only thing I would change is that I wish there was more diversity and more students to add more culture and life to the campus.
Alum,5,"Sweet Briar is an academic gold mine for Math or Science enthusiasts.  World-renowned professors involve students in pioneering research and discovery.  Students receive one-on-one attention from instructors who genuinely care.  A safe, close-knit community ensures lasting friendships.  Extra-curricular activities available include horseback riding, athletics such as rugby/tennis/lacrosse, Theater & Classics clubs, Outdoor Adventures along with rock climbing, canoeing, and spelunking.  Sweet Briar is where Vixens find themselves."
Sophomore,5,Sweet Briar College is an incredibly unique experience.  The community is an amazing one to be a part of.
College Senior,5,We don't really have much of a problem with this kind of thing
College Senior,5,"We were supposed to close last year, but we didn't. That should tell you something about the people that have gone there and young women who continue to attend."
College Junior,5,"Sweet Briar allows students to balance a rigorous academic course load with extracurriculars and internship and research opportunities. This college prepares students for success in the ""real world."""
College Junior,5,A degree from a women's liberal arts college is highly valued.
College Junior,5,Safety is never a concern on campus. Campus safety is effective and aware and problems are taken care of swiftly. I have never felt unsafe while on campus.
College Junior,5,"SBC has a rigorous curriculum, wonderful traditions, and amazing research and career opportunities (if you work for them)."
College Junior,5,I only participate in one sport
College Junior,5,I am enjoying Sweet Briar
College Senior,5,"Professors are personable, helpful, available. Courses are interesting, applicable to the real world. Classes are personalized and attention is given to every student."
College Sophomore,5,I love Sweet Briar so much. Just stepping on campus for the first time made me realize that this was the school for me.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my school it's such a wonderful place to be. The small rural setting is absolutely perfect for me but Lynchburg is close enough and has anything you could ever want to do off campus. The all women's aspect wasn't a plus for me until I came to Sweet Briar and now I value you my all women's education more then I would ever would have guessed. Sweet Briar is such a special place and you don't understand that until you step foot onto campus and see for yourself the beauty of the landscape, people and education."
Recent Alumnus,5,Love every minute of my four years!
College Senior,5,"The courses are well worth it, as they are appropriately rigorous for whatever level you are with the subject matter. The professors are also very attentive to students, offering help where they can and making sure that the coursework and course load is appropriate for the students. They are also very open and willing to help if there is a complaint, and work with the students when possible, to ensure our success in the class and ones after it. There are many different classes, and a good variety in general, and the class sizes are small and very student oriented. Lectures are like you'd imagine, but definitely encourage discussion and questions. The largest classes are usually introductory classes, and generally for the intro biology or business classes."
College Sophomore,5,"Its great. You can party on campus on Thursday nights and several big weekends throughout the year. Other than that there are several great colleges near by including Lynchburg, Hampden Sydney, and UVA."
College Sophomore,5,If you drive in to Lynchburg (20 min) its pretty good.
College Sophomore,5,The school is strict on some things but very lenient on others.
College Sophomore,5,"They give out so much scholarship money, it is less than most instate colleges."
College Freshman,5,Best faculty who are dedicated and really care about the students.
College Freshman,5,"They respond to you very fast, even during the summer. I had appealed my financial aid package and got a decision very quickly"
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of closet space and the rooms are very spacious. You can decorate the room however you want. The hallways are very nice and spacious which makes you feel very comfortable.
College Freshman,5,Best part of the school- the ratings say it all.
College Sophomore,5,The Health Center is very easy to deal with and are very nice. The only thing to complain about is that they are closed on the weekends which can be a pain. Campus Safety is also very friendly and present. We are a closed campus so between six at night and six in the morning you have to be with a student to get on campus as you are stopped before entering. You can also easily call campus safety if you are having any issues. The same goes for the health center. You can easily call and make an appointment or try to walk in and see if they have extra time.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my college! I'm so incredibly happy I chose to attend because it's beautiful and unique.  Most people knock women's colleges but we're so amazingly unique. I mean how many other girls can say they go to a college where the school colors are pink and green?!?! There's things here you don't find at other colleges and we have so many traditions, which keeps things interesting.  "
College Freshman,5,We have great professors and great programs. 
College Freshman,5,"I love my school, some things irk me but I expect that's the same everywhere. I love my school and I've made wonderful friends and I have fantastic professors. "
College Freshman,5,I really love the small class sizes and discussion based learning. 
College Freshman,5,I'm really loving it here at Sweet Briar. 
College Freshman,5,"The computer situation here is wonderful, I really don't even need my computer. It's just easier in my room."
College Junior,5,"With Sweet Briar you don't have to know what department you're applying to be a member of.  You choose in your sophomore year, with assistance from your advisor and using a special form."
College Junior,5,The Process of getting into the Business program is not that hard all you merely have to do is apply to the school and chose your Major. Some of the Business courses are challenging but the professors make it that way so that you will be able to think outside the box when you enter the real world cause everything is not going to happen just like the text book taught you to think it might.
College Junior,5,"At Sweet Briar College I'm an Senior this year and I have truly enjoyed my time here thus far. I'm a Business Major, many of the professors here know first hand about the Business aspects.  The instructors are the best who have put me in touch with some very important aspects of the Business."
College Freshman,5,"The Freshman Dorm Meta Glass is great because it is connected to the Post Office, Dining hall Protho, Co-Curricular Life, Financial Aid,  Registration Office, and Residency all that in one nut shell. How great is that and it even has a back up generator and laundry room in the basement."
College Freshman,5,"each student gets one on one help from an academic professor. there are many degrees to choose from as well as people doing majors, minors and certificates."
College Freshman,5,"The financial aid department is very helpful. If one just goes into the office with a question, the staff is always ready to answer any and all questions. During my application process, I was in this office a lot and got most of my tuition covered!"
College Sophomore,5,"As a NCAA DIII school, Sweet Briar's main focus is academics. A wide range of students participate in Vixen Athletics. While there are not an overwhelming number of sports teams at SBC, there is unlimited support by both the student body and professors."
College Sophomore,5,"Students at Sweet Briar never feel unsafe. Campus police is never more than a phone call and a walk or 2 minute drive away. As you enter the front gates of Sweet Briar, you have to go through what students call ""Checkpoint Charlie"" if it is after 6pm and on weekends and talk to Campus Police."
College Sophomore,5,"Sweet Briar's academic standard is very high.  The College has seen graduates from every corner of the world and they have gone to every corner of the world after graduation.  I can't say much for specific academic programs, but the College has been converting classrooms in every academic building to ""Smart Classrooms"" complete with white boards, SmartBoards, televisions, and tables that have outlets in the table so students and professors don't have to trip over computer cords. All academic buildings are unlocked at all times, so students often study in these smart rooms as well."
College Sophomore,5,"Gorgeous Campus – The campus is absolutely gorgeous. There is a lot of room to roam and explore with 3000+ acres, which is especially fun on horseback. The Riding Center is fantastic. Between 4 stables, it houses approximately 40 SBC horses as well as privately owned horses. There is a large indoor ring with an observation area, a large outdoor ring with lighting, a smaller outdoor ring, a field with jumps, the Hunter Trials field and the Proving Grounds for cross-country riding. The Riding Program is set up to accommodate all levels of riders. The Fitness and Athletic Center is full of excellent workout equipment, a swimming pool, track above the main gym floor, the Bistro, and a movie theater."
College Freshman,5,"Step Into Our World – Being at Sweet Briar is a completely different atmosphere than any other school. First, we are a private all women's college. The classes are small and give you the chance to really get to know everyone and have that close feeling. We also have many traditions that you won't find at other schools. For example a major tradition would be Step Singing. Our current seniors sit on the ""senior"" steps in the fall and spring semester and each class sings to them and to each other. It is a great experience and true bonding time. There are many more differences between Sweet Briar and other schools."
College Freshman,5,"The availability of transportation and all of the opportunities are wonderful at Sweet Briar!
They often provide free shuttles to near by shops and stores on weekends and some week days as well. There are also a lot of people on campus that would be more than happy to give anyone in need a lift."
Niche User,4,not for me but it is a good school. you need to be a certain type of person to go here. i just got put into some social experiences that were unpleasant. but the school itself nor most of the people are all bad. given its reputation it is very liberal and has good professors
Sophomore,4,It really is an amazing school with opportunities you won't get anywhere else and it does become your home. If only the financial offices could help students more with tuition. If your a first Gen student it can be really difficult to try and sort through the information yourself-especially when your parents don't really know how to go about it either.
Junior,4,"I did have online classes, which had started after my spring break ended back in mid-March. They made it to where I could take quizzes and tests online, which actually helped because when I got something wrong, it told me the correct answer. The only trouble was being the two labs I had for both biology and chemistry. The students couldn't actually do the rest of the labs because all of us weren't able to be in class, so that made it really uneasy for me. I am a visual learner, for doing online labs was pretty complicated."
Freshman,4,"It was most definitely not the ideal situation, but professors worked with their students to make sure they were able to complete there work, even if they had internet or time zone issues. A lot of our classes are discussion based and rely on the in class experience, but all professors did their best to make sure we were still able to have those conversations, even when we couldn't all meet because most of the class didn't have reliable internet. Sweet Briar College also made sure to get out input on how we were going to go about things and made sure to check in on us to be sure things were going well."
Junior,4,"I love the people and community. I do feel the administration may only care about saving face. I also think it’s impossible to get things done, if you ever need anything you have to visit the same offices multiple times or else they will forget."
Junior,4,"Overall I've had a great experience here. It's a small, rural, women's college, which is perfect for me, but not for everyone. I can't overstate how beautiful the campus is, and I've met some lovely people. My professors and advisor are what's really keeping me here. They're dedicated and helpful. I transferred in from a much larger school, and being able to work more closely with faculty is great."
Senior,4,"Sweet Briar College is a unique experience where you can mix your passions and academics. For me, that means that I get to ride horses and be on the school's equestrian program all while getting a degree in Business and a minor in Classics. The benefit of being in classes with only 20-40 people is that the professors have a chance to get to know the students and offer help on an individualized basis. While following my passion and getting a degree, Sweet Briar offers a variety of clubs and events on campus. Becoming a member of these clubs help the students feel involved on the campus and allow for the classes to integrate in a way that other colleges can not offer. Rival classes and clubs have friendly competitions throughout the year like the rock and hitching post-fight (a friendly competition where the rival classes try to see who can paint the objects before the other class). The opportunities at Sweet Briar just simply can not compare to other colleges."
Junior,4,"From the moment you step on campus, you are greeting by many warm faces who want to help you succeed. It is easy to feel at home here, and feel like you have found your second family."
Sophomore,4,"Sweet Briar is a wonderful place that is going through some very drastic changes at the moment. They are re-structuring the curriculum which has involved cutting some majors and many of the professors that teach them, so it has been a stressful year here for many people. That being said, there are many good things about Sweet Briar. The class sizes are small which makes one on one with teachers much easier, not to mention that the teachers who do work here go out of their way to meet with you if you need help. I've had teachers drive to school on the weekend if I can't make any times during the week work. The social scene isn't amazing here, there are small parties from time to time. If you really wanna have a good time on the weekend W&L, HS-C, and UVA are all less than an hour away which is great when you want to party on the weekends but not have distractions during the week."
Junior,4,"Sweet Briar is an amazing place to grow as a woman. You truly learn to balance your academics and extracurriculars in a way my friends at other schools do not. The bonds you create with your professors at Sweet Briar are so strong and amazing, I've had dinner at a bunch of my professor's houses. The professors often put their cellphone numbers on the syllabus, that's how accessible they are. I couldn't imagine my college experience any other way!"
College Senior,4,"Most of the professors I have had were amazing. There is only one that I was not fond of, but the professors always make sure we understand what is going on and they let us know that they are always here for us and we can come to office hours"
College Senior,4,"I have never had any problems with the housing on campus, although there are some dorms that need to be renovated"
College Senior,4,"I work at the gym so I am a little biased, but I know a lot of the girls who play one or two sports and they live every second of it"
College Junior,4,DIII Sports allow students to balance their academics and their varsity sport. Funding is adequate and the GPA of athletes are higher than the overall campus GPA
College Senior,4,"Beautiful, historic buildings. Spacious dorm rooms with high ceilings and large closets and windows."
College Junior,4,Campus security is there at all times. After 6pm campus security is out at the guard gate to have those who do not belong to SBC to sign in. I have never felt threatened on campus. In fact the scariest thing just might be the wild animals which are carefully observed as well.
College Junior,4,There is a variety of courses to take and you will not have a problem finding something that you like. Most professors are there to help. You can have classes that are only two to classes that are 25(but those are very rare). The larger classes are typically lecture but most of the ones I have taken tend to be discussion based.
College Junior,4,The college may be small but the alums are always there to help out. They come from all different backgrounds so opportunities are everywhere. Career services has always been helpful and does weekly/biweekly talks. Its rural so jobs/internships opportunities  during the school year are going to be at least 30 minutes out or more.
College Junior,4,We do not have many teams on campus but are supported.  There is always someone to cheer them on but it is not the amount of people you would see at a typical school.
College Junior,4,"Sweet Briar has always felt like home. That is what drew me to it. The professors are always there for you n matter what Would I choose SBC again? Yes, and in fact I did. When my college was supposed to close and then reopened I went back because it was the only place I could see myself. Its so much more than just a college."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love my college. Everything about it, from the amazingly beautiful 3,200 acre campus to the comfortable small student body, is what I wanted in my education. The dorms are beautiful, with the dorm I'm in this year (as well as most of last year) being built in 1912. Despite the large campus size, all of the important buildings are close together, providing a wonderful walk to class every day! There are always fun events on the weekend to participate in. With the student body as small as it is, there are opportunities to participate in student activities and be an officer of whatever you want to! Women's colleges provide wonderful opportunities to those who choose to attend one, and with the rate of students employed immediately after graduation as high as it is for women's colleges, there's no place I'd rather be."
College Senior,4,"Never before in my life have I been able to find a place that both helps me to grow as an individual and completely accepts the individual that I am, no matter where I am in the process of that growth.

I have personal connection with nearly every one of my faculty members. For example: I took a Marketing course out of curiosity during the fall of my sophomore year; as a Musical Theatre major, I thought it could be a beneficial minor to take. To this day, as a rising senior, that professor (who teaches only one or two night courses for the College) periodically emails me to check in and to keep me aware of various jobs/internships that may be available to me - and that's not even the field in which I've chosen to major!

The friendships that I have fostered here at Sweet Briar are some of the nearest and dearest I have ever experienced. While many of my friends graduated as a part of the class of 2015, I have no doubt that we will remain close, despite being states apart. There are so many opportunities to create meaningful relationships here, be it on your dorm hall, in a class, on a team, onstage, or in any number of our myriad of available clubs and activity groups.

I have served as Student Admissions Ambassador since the spring of my first-year and I have never once felt phony or cliche when showing off our beautiful campus to visitors. I am not one to stomach ""BS"" and would certainly never stand for dishing it out on my tours. Just goes to show that all the love and positivity I feel for this school is 100% real.

Despite what some may think, our student body is diverse. We come from different backgrounds, have different goals, and different interests. But one thing unifies us above all else: We are Sweet Briar women who fought to save our school and who sure as hell are ready to take on the world."
College Senior,4,"Campus safety officers are very friendly and always willing to help. While the physical campus is quite large, all of the entry and exit points are patrolled and guarded at various points of the day, and throughout the night. Crime is very low, and when there are issues, the students generally handle it very maturely and calmly, without having to get Campus safety involved. I personally feel very safe on campus. Every student is given two keys- a personal key, to get into their room, and a general key, to let them into a dorm. Overall, SBC has a very safe campus, with friendly and welcoming officers who do their jobs well."
College Sophomore,4,"All but one of the dorms have high ceilings, hardwood floors, big/walk-in closets, and ceiling fans. Each dorm has a common kitchen and parlor. There are also GV apartments. These have 4 single bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, and a family room with a tv and couches."
College Junior,4,"The financial aid office was quick to get in touch with me during my freshman year, to help me fully understand what I was being offered and what I could accept. The staff there was never anything less that friendly and always happy to help, and could answer each of my questions thoroughly and plainly."
College Junior,4,"Generally very peaceful and quiet. Not a party campus, but you can still find plenty of activities and things to do! The only times you have any real noise in the dorms is when the sororities come around to tap new members, and that's not particularly often. There's a full kitchen/rest area in every dorm, including vending machines, so there's no particular problem with finding a late night/early morning snack. The dorms are located in the hub of the campus, and are, in general, pretty close to many other buildings on campus, including the dining hall. Getting a dorm room works on a lottery system, where the juniors get first pick of a batch of numbers, and choose their room as their number is called. Then the same for the sophomores, then the freshmen."
College Freshman,4,There are many cool places to try and i was surprised by the little cool places i have found.
College Freshman,4,"Its up to you, there are parties, but you dont have to go if you dont want to, but it is very inconvient to get to parties"
College Freshman,4,"Its decent food, the omelet station is really good and fresh. The sandwich station has a lot of option and the pesto mayo is really good."
College Freshman,4,It is great to be so close to everything.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had to deal with campus safety very much, but the campus safety officers are very friendly and helpful people."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy being at SBC. the environment is wonderful, the Campus is picture perfect, but we are isolated and getting off campus can take a while."
College Freshman,4,"Always spots, not too far away from the main part of campus."
College Freshman,4,"No violence, no theft, no break ins, but the health center is a pain."
College Freshman,4,"Never crowded labs, wifi generally works well."
College Freshman,4,"If you are anti-drug, you will very rarely or never be pressured into doing something you do not want to."
College Freshman,4,A majority of the students receive financial aid or scholarships.
College Freshman,4,"You meet girls from all backgrounds economically and nationally speaking, aside from the fact that it is only one gender (girls)."
College Freshman,4,This is the only good thing about the school in my opinion. The honor code gives us privileges such as self-scheduled exams and staff are very helpful and available.
College Sophomore,4,"I wouldn't say that our school is super diverse, but the girls are very accepting of the diversity that we do have. You can easily keep your beliefs without feeling peer pressure to change. You will still make friends no matter what you look like, who you vote for, or who you like. "
College Sophomore,4,"If you want to be apart of the party scene then you can find girls that are into it as well, but you have to go to other schools. We have one party a week, unless there is something else going on. Usually it's not that wild and wraps up around one or two and campus safety checks in. We are a small campus are very close so it is easy to become friends with upper class-men which makes access to alcohol easier, but that's true with any campus. I would say that it is way less available compared to other schools and I haven't experienced any peer pressure or heard of any."
College Sophomore,4,"The weather at Sweet Briar is very easy to deal with. We have seasons, but none are too intense. It does snow, but not a ton and when it gets warmer out it's beautiful. The only reason it's not perfect is that no weather is perfect. There are still the gross, rainy days and sleet every once in a while."
College Sophomore,4,"You can major in just about anything here, we even have a create your own major option. We also offer engineering, mechanical and electrical, and are one of 3 women's colleges to offer it as a major. It's definitely one of the most popular majors on campus. "
College Sophomore,4,The history department is phenomenal. All of the professors are quirky so you never know what you're going to get.  
College Sophomore,4,"Our college is consistently voted one of the most beautiful in the country! It's hard to compete with our ""Old South"" style and mountain views. "
College Sophomore,4,"You just have to visit to find out about all our crazy, wonderful traditions, our amazing staff and our fantastic programs ."
College Sophomore,4,I love participating in varsity athletics but I wish more students would attend them. The facilities are good and growing. 
College Freshman,4,Students get the aid that they need. They are good with helping you.
College Freshman,4,I got the scholarship I needed for the school year.
College Freshman,4,"It's a women's college there aren't often guys on campus. The LGBTQ+ community is small.
People are preppy for the most part but there are outliers. "
College Freshman,4,We have computer labs mainly with Macs. They're rarely used and printing is free. 
College Freshman,4,We have all four seasons. The weather is typical Virginia weather therefore not too bad. 
College Freshman,4,"I've only been a couple places, but I think they're wonderful for a girl's night out. "
College Freshman,4,"There are all kinds of events and clubs to get involved in. You just have to be able to manage your time well, because the classes can be really challenging, which isn't a bad thing. "
College Freshman,4,Everything on campus is really beautiful. All of the facilities are really clean. 
College Freshman,4,"I'm only in my first semester, but I think it'll be a wonderful four years. "
College Freshman,4,"It's a bit windy, and it can be cold, but it's a really pretty campus, so you almost don't notice. "
College Freshman,4,"It's still a college campus, in that respect. But it's not a problem. We have smaller parties on campus, but the majority of parties are at other schools. "
College Freshman,4,"The only problem I've heard about is with the health clinic. They're not very reliable, but safety on campus is spot on. People leave their things laying around all the time with no problems at all. "
College Freshman,4,"The school is paying for the majority of my schooling. I know about everything they have to offer, but it's on me to get the extra stuff I need. "
Junior,2,"Looking back,I would honestly RUN away from this college and go almost anywhere else. Have a G.I. Bill?Prepare to wait months into the school year just to use it. Have a budget?Prepare for most of the financial staff ( even upper) to have a terrible attitude about their mistakes and it's a nightmare just to try to get anything fixed.After being at the college for over a year and with every semester having more problems with exceptionally rude financial staff, I wish I didn't give this college as many chances as I did. I'm only here because the credits don't transfer easily and it would be another nightmare to start all over again.Think that mistakes and issues with what you are being charged aren't the norm? Most students on campus will say otherwise. Don't get me wrong, there are some great professors on campus. The scenery is beautiful and there are some things you can get involved in. However,there are a lot of nasty/snooty people on campus as well with only 300 something students."
Freshman,2,"After the closing the teaching and student life has plummeted. The administration is trying to revamp the curriculum and bring new life to the school, but it is without success."
College Sophomore,2,It used to be really good when Sweet Briar ran their own dining services. Since Aramark has been put in charge the food sucks.
College Sophomore,2,There is a Mexican restaurant and a cafe type place across the street and a McDonald's about five minutes away.  Everywhere else you need to travel to get to.
College Sophomore,2,"No one really attends, and there really isn't a reason to.  All of our teams are pretty terrible so it's hard to get excited.  Although the athletes probably strive the most here.  You often see the athletes with the highest GPA's and most involvement on campus."
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many off campus dining option around SBC
College Freshman,2,Sweet Briar is in the middle of nowhere.  Lynchburg is about 30 miles away but it is actually quite a haul for a quick night out for dinner on a night when you have an exam the next day.  There are only two restaurants close to the school and you get tired of them very quickly.
College Freshman,2,Our hall bathroom floods daily.  Our hall is never clean and I'm not sure how the conditions meet any sort of building code.  What makes it worse is that I am in honors housing which I feel should be nicer.  There is a hole in my floor and the molding is coming off the wall.  There was also mold in my room at the beginning of the year.
College Freshman,2,"I strongly dislike everything except for the academics. Apart from that, I feel as though I am wasting my life out here."
College Freshman,2,"Everything comes from Sysco, they have improved a bit recently (probably due to all the complaints) but there is really no variety."
College Freshman,2,"Again, we are practically in the middle of no where. The only food establishments who can afford to set up around here are fast-food or chains. A few local restaurants, and by that I mean two."
College Freshman,2,There are only shuttles that occasionally go to Walmart and Target.
College Sophomore,2,"This is one of the topics that is talked about at school. We have two places to eat on campus: Protho and The Bistro. Both can be used on meal plan, but you can only go to Bistro three times on your meal plan. The Bistro is just like a normal place to eat. You can get bugers, pizza, chicken, anything really. Prothro is our dining hall and it just is not the greatest. They try to keep the food different and there is always the option to make a sandwich, but if you want good, hot food then you're not always going to be satisfied. They really do try, but it doesn't always work out the best."
College Sophomore,2,The only way to get anywhere is to know someone with a car and hope they have room. There are shuttles but they're pretty infrequent. 
College Freshman,2,It's edible. We'll leave it there. 
College Freshman,2,"It's an all girls school, so the boys are mostly all taken, if you see them during the day. But there are a bunch of colleges close by that you can meet men at. "
College Freshman,2,Most students rely on making friends with someone who has a car or bringing their own car in order to provide for their transportation needs. 
College Freshman,2,"There are currently birds that have taken the dining hall as their new house. I get scared that they might poop on my food while eating, also being an athlete by the time practice is over and I get to the dining hall there is little to no food left- very slim pickings. You have to pick and choose between what the edible food is. "
College Junior,2,"When it comes to parties on campus, our Campus Safety officers are always walking around the parties when it is unnecessary to do so."
College Sophomore,2,"It is not impossible to find out campus housing. However, being in a small town I imagine finding housing options to be harder than most schools."
Sophomore,1,I didn't take classes online unless you count quarantine which was pretty much standard so thats that.
Junior,1,"Sweet Briar is bleeding cash and is dishonest to students and alumnae about the future of the college. Campus has been kept in horrible shape even before this pandemic, dorms are overrun with cockroaches, rats, and mold. Most students use it as a community college to transfer elsewhere and many of my friends have left after a few semesters. The course system is a joke, and any professor who's actually worth their salt is forced out."
Niche User,1,I transferred into the school and then left after the semester. A complete waste of my money. The food had no variety and the food was bland. The dorm I lived in had a rat problem and mold was everywhere. Nothing within a walking distance and you need a car to get anywhere. Almost all the students were white. And many came from money. The safety iffy. No call boxes (that I saw) and lots of dark areas.
Freshman,1,"This is not a good school for academically-inclined students. The honors program and writing intensive curriculum are jokes, the self-designed major is not a real option, the small class sizes make it easier to waste class time, and the school plans fire teachers and reduce the number of majors offered."
College Sophomore,1,"You are basically living in the middle of nowhere, but if you're into that, this place is perfect."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have Greek Life, we have tap clubs, which are basically like high school cliques.  It's all very odd..."
College Sophomore,1,The wireless network at sweet briar is unreliable.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing out here but mountains and Sheetz.
College Freshman,1,We. Are. In. The. Middle. Of. NOWHERE.
College Freshman,1,"We are in the middle of no where, finding off campus housing is difficult and not worth it."
College Freshman,1,"Of course none of this is at fault of the college.
The weather, quite frankly, is sporadic. 47 and raining on Monday, 79 and a cloudless sky on Wednesday morning...followed by 3-7 inches of snow on Saturday.
Okay, I'm exaggerating, but ever so slightly. We really have had two weeks like that this semester.

The only issues with mother nature here are that it can be a pretty rigorous trek to get to classes in inclement weather, especially if you have to go to the art barn and don't have a car."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol is very easy to get a hold of and you are sure to see your share of drunks shambling around on Thursday nights when Boathouse is going on. I haven't seen or heard of other drugs being prominent, but alcohol is definitely everywhere."
College Freshman,1,There is none. Everyone is required to live on-campus for all four years unless they have a special reason not to like marriage or their family lives in the county.
College Freshman,1,"The closet town that has anything to do is about 30 minutes away from campus, and the next big town is about an hour away. All of the really fun things are really nice. There are a ton of things to do in Lynchburg and Charlottesville: bowling, movies, dollar-movie, malls, nightlife, and downtown scenery."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Much – The school is trying really hard to make the diversity more widespread, but it's hard at an all girls college. It's almost like everyone is on one side of the spectrum, or on the total other side of the spectrum. Then there's a few people in the middle. I feel like the majority (BIG MAJORITY) of people are white, wealthy, conservative, and looked upon as ""stuck up,"" but I only fit in at white. And if they're not that, they're at the total other end of the continuum. Even though I'm not either, I still feel like I mostly am accepted."
College Senior,1,"the only parties we have are at our boathouse which are usually thursdays and are the only main parties unless you get invited to a party going on in the apartments. Many girls mainly go to a school within an hour radius to party with their greek like such as UVA, HSC or W&L"
College Senior,1,Nothing to Do – Lynchburg/amherst is the middle of nowhere. The closest city is charlottesville which has alot to do as does lexington.
College Junior,1,"You Need a Car. You need a car.  Period.  Or make friends with someone with a car.  There's a monthly shuttle that goes to Wal-Mart and that's about it, and you can't walk to anything off campus because of the distance."

Freshman,5,The online teachers were good! although I do prefer in class teaching when it comes to hard subjects but the teachers make it work!
Freshman,5,There is multiple locations where you can take your classes so you don't have to drive so far! I love the teachers and the students I get to work with every day. The environment is so friendly!
Sophomore,5,"There is a great support structure available to students: Academic counselors, tutoring, someone from VSAC is there weekly and you can set up a meeting with them, and all teachers and staff are friendly and very helpful. I really enjoy my classes and have learned a lot. I appreciate the hands-on experiences because it provides a well-rounded education. Their library is great too. The library is connected to other college libraries so a wide range of books are available to students as well as movies."
Freshman,5,"This is excluding the classes that were forced to go online due to the outbreak, as those were not designed to be made into online classes, and will fall short to most expectations as part of that. However the online classes that were meant to be online that i have taken have been very well structured and taught. I was given a weekly video lecture, a chapter from the textbook to read, and 2 places to ask questions, one publicly and one privately, making an overall excellent experience."
Freshman,5,"Through my past two semesters here, I have found that they are quite good at slowly bringing up the intensity of the classwork. It has been a slow and easy process which hasn't triggered my anxiety once while high school did it daily. My ratings are for the Williston campus."
Sophomore,5,"I am a nursing student at Vermont Technical College. I love this school because the class sizes are small and there is a lot of hands on work involved. This semester I averaged a 3.5 GPA, which is something that I have never done before. The professors are also engaging and really want their students to succeed in their program. I also work at VTC during the summer and the staff here are welcoming. The last thing I'm going to bring up is how  I feel safe at VTC because the public safety are strict and there are many rules that students have to follow."
Niche User,5,"I have heard nothing, but wonderful comments on Vermont Technical College. However, the college's programs are competitive, I am honored to be accepted into any one of their offered degree programs. Vermont Tech is highly competitive and caught my attention because of how competitive their nursing program is. I am excited to join the college in the upcoming year, as well as gain an exceptional education from my top college!"
Sophomore,5,"Vermont Technical College is a great school to attend. Students get hands on expirence in the field. The classes are small so professors have more time to work with students. Overall, a top school to attend."
College Freshman,5,"There is a 90% job acceptance rate after the completion of your degree. It may not be the best in the world, but its still very admirable and one of the reasons I chose this school."
College Junior,5,"Granted this school is a technical college, but it has the best offers for degrees around. You will get to know beyond what is necessary for your degree, and sometimes that is not a bad thing. It can allow you to be able to switch what you want to do down the road very easily"
College Junior,5,"I have overly enjoyed my stay here, as it has a great community, and is welcoming to everyone"
College Freshman,5,"The work load can be a lot at times, but it is worth it. By the end of your sophomore year, you are placed into a paid internship that relates to your major. Students in the technology field have a job placement rate of 99% by the time they graduate from Vermont Technical College. In the software engineering program at VTC, you start off learning Java, HTML, and SQL. The most challenging part of the freshman year is probably learning how to manage your time and get all of your assignments done. One piece of advice that I had received was to start the assignments as soon as it is assigned. Each assignment usually gets a two week deadline, so it is easy to put it off until last minute. Getting the assignment done in the first week is one of the best things to do, because it gives your room to ask your professor for help, and also decreases your stress from worrying about the deadline. Overall, I love the course work and curriculum!"
College Freshman,5,"I truly love this school! If you definitely know what major you want to go into, then VTC is one of the best colleges to look at. The classes are small, allowing you to know everyone and become friends with both your classmates and teachers. The teachers truly care about each student, and want you to succeed. A lot of the classes have hands on experience labs to help students learn the materials better. The admissions office is extremely helpful and understanding. If I had to go back and re-pick a college to go to, I would still choose Vermont Technical College."
College Senior,5,"My credits for my prerequisites transferred extremely easily with no trouble. My coursework is not very flexible and classes are set and fixed, however if i have to miss a class, the instructor is very good about being understanding that 'things come up' and they sometimes offer alternatives like study session questions posted or they might also offer to record the class."
College Senior,5,"I really liked my online classes through Vermont Tech; the class size was actually large, but I never felt like it was. The professor was amazing, very fair, very active and very much a strong contributor to my learning experience. I could ask questions and receive almost immediate feedback. Clear instructions were given so I knew exactly what to expect and feedback was available. In addition, the professor would review our drafts and make corrections before we submitted our final papers so that we had opportunities to learn from our mistakes and correct them. This was my favorite class and had a very positive outcome!"
College Senior,5,The job prospects for an individual graduating from Vermont Tech's nursing program are very positive. Most people I know have been hired on the spot when an establishment finds out the applicant is a Vermont Tech graduate. This says alot about the quality of the nursing education Vermont Tech provides and it happened to me too. Many Vermont hospitals and nursing centers want nurses who were educated at Vermont Tech because the hands on experience given to the new grads is immense and they can often 'hit the ground running' even compared to nurses graduating from baccalaureate programs.
College Senior,5,Vermont Tech offers lifelong job placement assistance once you graduate from school as well as if you ever find yourself unemployed in the future. They have professionals that work tirelessly to help people find work in the field they studied. I have also already have had job opportunity emails sent to me from people looking for employees while I am still in school. Vermont Tech is dedicated to helping you put the time and money spent on your college education to good use by aiding you in finding work within your career choice field.
College Senior,5,"The courses offered by Vermont Tech are not easy courses and the grading system is challenging. However, the professors are amazing and they truly want you to be successful. Te professors at Vermont Tech are very open and approachable and non-intimidating; they are professional and welcome student input. The class sizes are small and  it is very easy to ask questions and to learn. Vermont Tech also caters to myriad learning styles and welcomes diversity."
College Senior,5,"My major is nursing and it is very difficult. The program is intense, the workload is immense and the curriculum is very challenging. This being said, my professors want to help me succeed and are always available to provide help so I can be successful. I am encouraged by their high job placement ratings and they offer lifelong employment placing assistance. Vermont Tech is a wonderful college that will provide me with many opportunities for the future."
College Senior,5,"I love Vermont Tech because every professor I've had truly wants everyone to succeed. You're not a number. When you email your professor, they care and get right back to you. I was praised when I did well, and asked how they could help me when I voiced concerns. The school is very hands on and this allows you to gain lots of experience before its time to hit the real world. Vermont Tech is an awesome school with high standards."
College Sophomore,5,"They are always updated, appropriate, and valuable to my education. The convinience of taking a class from home (*mi commute) is very terrific."
College Junior,5,Love VTC! The staff is very helpful and the teachers are very educated.
College Junior,5,The student body is always sending emails to students to get their input for all the things that come up at there meetings. They want it to be the students decision not just theirs.
College Junior,5,The teachers try there best to set the students up with internships that may lead to a preeminent job.
College Junior,5,The teachers are really great at teaching you all the correct procedures and taking time to explain to you why/how these things are all done.
College Junior,5,workload was huge. classroom time did not end. spent similar time at home studying to be ready for the next day. Teachers are amazing and prepare you well for the career.
College Junior,5,"great placement rates, and success with NCLEX"
College Junior,5,I think online courses take more time weekly but I like the flexibility of doing my work any time throughout the day.
College Senior,5,I love online classes and the ease of use they offer.
College Senior,5,I had an issue with financial aid because I was waitlisted and as such did not get any scholarships.  I called the financial aid office and they were able to get me enough money in a scholarship to cover the remaining balances on my three semester tuitions.
College Senior,5,This is the best nursing school in the state of Vermont.  I would not want to go anywhere else.
College Senior,5,"We have a fully functional simulation lab for the nursing students.  This means we can make scenarios and play them out with a patient that crashes, has mutiple traumas and different body function issues.  "
College Senior,5,This school has the highest matriculation rate in the state for nursing students.
College Senior,5,The computer tech class staffs the IT department so our computers are always being updated and we always have the newest gizmos and gadgets.
College Senior,5,This program is definitely the hardest most rewarding in the state of Vermont.
College Senior,5,This college provides work based experience in every field from industry practicing professionals.  When VTC are done with school they are universally accepted as fully trained in their given field.
College Junior,5,"Overall, the computer labs at VTC are always available during the day depending on classes having them signed out. But, no matter what, I have never not had a computer I could use"
College Junior,5,The professors here are amazing. If you cant reach them at school or by email they don't mind you calling them at home. Very help full and a wonderful learning enviornment.
College Freshman,5,"Very Good Flexibility – Very friendly, knowledgeable instructors; very easy to change majors."
College Freshman,5,"Great Small Campus – Small class sizes, real hands on learning. All labs are cutting edge tech."
Freshman,4,"All the teachers are very kind and most are decent at their jobs too, the clubs are also fun, there are many and they all get a decent amount of funding. There are many services that help if you begin to fall behind, but the classes are well taught enough that i rarely need to use them. My main complaint is the housing isn't exactly the best. As far as I have found, there is no option for gender inclusive housing, the showers are mostly communal, and during my year so far the thermostat was broken, always having the heat on way too high."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the professors and having small classes. The students on campus are very friendly. The advisers are extremely helpful when helping make our schedule and making sure that we will still be able to graduate on time.
Freshman,4,"Nice campus (Randolph), helpful faculty, students from diverse backgrounds. Program has good reputation in the community."
Niche User,4,I loved Vermont Technical College. The student to teacher ratio was great so you could always get help when needed and the professors really want you to succeed. The overall atmosphere is wonderful.
Freshman,4,"I would highly recommend the early college program at Vermont Technical College.  The only negative is the English professors are not the best.  But all other faculty I have worked with have been fantastic.  
Also a beautiful campus."
Freshman,4,Very good college with good professors. Vermont Techical College has lots of programs to choose from. And staff are really nice and helpful.
Niche User,4,I did a visit to VTC recently and I really liked everything about it. the only problem i had was room size but being a college it's going to have small rooms. I would also like to see more vegan options in the dining hall.
Sophomore,4,One of the best things about Vermont Tech is that it is small in size and that makes it easier to have more one on one with the professors and it also makes it easier to maneuver around campus with a quick 5 minute walk between classes.
Alum,4,Nursing program was competitive to get into.  Helps prepare for nursing jobs directly out of the program.  I did not live on campus for the time I was taking the nursing program.  
College Senior,4,This school has a great friendly environment. I have had a great experience so far. The staff is very willing to answer all your questions that you may have. The classes are hard but the teachers are very educated in what they are teaching. Don't be afraid to ask questions. The environment is very nice and there are selected quiet areas for studying.
College Freshman,4,"The school is very accepting of who you are, but requires you to be professional in their workplace. The materials you needed to acquire before the first semester were hard to track down, but its all apart of the experience."
College Freshman,4,"The courses appear very challenging, and the professors seem very stern, that's because they are."
College Freshman,4,I value the degree from this school as much as the experience it gave me. Interning at clinics and working in the one provided by the school is something I actively look forward to.
College Freshman,4,"The heavy workload, at times, was very discouraging, and at times I didn't think i could make it. After a while you get used to it, you realize this is what you will be doing forever. So don't think about it as work, think about it as your future, and make the work your own."
College Freshman,4,"School is more than just an education, its an experience. No matter which one you choose, you will only learn what you allow yourself to. My experience has been truly amazing, I have grown as an individual and I am prepared for the years to come because of it. I would never chose another school, not because I never had a bad experience, but because it means I might have became someone else, and I love who I am. So, much like I would never chose a different school, I would never choose another me."
College Junior,4,"we have a high precent job rating when we graduate, and that, I find to be true!"
College Junior,4,"Well, I am a female mechanical engineering freshman, and there is however, only one other girl in the whole class. This can get rough at times, getting picked on, secluded, and having to deal with a bunch of guys, but overall the Professors treat us like humans and we are able to get the work done just like anyone else!"
College Junior,4,"Some courses are great to be in, and the professors are very helpful in teaching what is next, but there are some classes I wish I didn't have to waste my time with."
College Junior,4,The classes are at good times and there are labs at night.
College Junior,4,They help place you in work once you have graduated
College Junior,4,Professors are there to help in any way they can
College Junior,4,They are there to help and want you to succeed
College Junior,4,Its a small school but good enough size that you have an opportunity to meet others from other states.
College Freshman,4,"I had taken classes at a local community college before coming to Vermont Technical College. All of my credits transferred easily, and counted towards extra curricular's. Because I go to a sub-campus, there aren't as many classes to choose from as the other main campus. Because of this, my college allows me to take classes at the local community college, and those credits are transferred to VTC with no hassle."
College Freshman,4,"Even after you graduate, the school will help you find a job in your field of study. They are willing to work with you and give recommendations. It truly seems like they want you to succeed, no matter what your plans are."
College Freshman,4,"All of the professors are friendly. They insist that you call them by their first name, and ask any and all questions. They are extremely helpful when you are stuck on the course material, and are always accessible by email or in person. They are willing to listen to any of your concerns, even if it does not relate to the class they teach. By the end of my first year, I already considered some of my professors to be friends."
College Freshman,4,"Because I go to a sub-campus of my school, not the main campus, I don't see a lot of alumni or recruiters on campus, but that doesn't hinder the career prospects of VTC. At VTC, any student can get an internship within their field within their second year at the school. The professors are always telling us about career opportunities, and offering to put in a word at companies for promising students.Even though I'm only just finishing my first year here at VTC, I already have a job lined up for the summer that is within my field of study."
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard they all are good, but personally have not looked into these"
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small, no more than 25 people MAX. Teachers are very helpful and will meet one on one with you. The teaching styles vary, so no class is the same."
College Sophomore,4,"In the business program, you learn about being a leader and the process of ethical behaviors. These help you not only in work, but in day or day life because it is important to be a leader figure and help guide others."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the small classes, the atmosphere, and the personality of it all. Most classes are hands on and interactive, so you aren't just sitting in a lecture class all day"
College Senior,4,This school made me feel very comfortable and the teachers are all understanding a friendly.
College Junior,4,The professors are all student oriented and are always trying to help you in every way they can to understand the content.
College Freshman,4,There are varies options for the students to chose on their will. I will be great to be there.
College Freshman,4,I thought it would be great. I actually don't know much. I am a new student planning to attend the VTC.
College Sophomore,4,I personally have not needed to use these services yet.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not do much on campus. I use the online library. I know there are lots of available study centers and helpers but I have not used them yet. I work so do not have time for campus activities or athletics. The school feels safe, looks clean and organized."
College Sophomore,4,"Currently an online student through CCV and transferring to VTC in the fall. All my class experiences have been wonderful so far. The process of transferring to VTC has been really good so far. They have been on top of everything, great communication with me and the transferring school. I look forward to continuing my education. What I like about VTC are the small classes. Lots of dedication and attention available if necessary."
College Junior,4,"great class trip 

great teachers

great course work"
College Junior,4,"we live in a small area so not much diversity is seen around here. There were many levels of education in the field of nursing. meaning some brand new to the profession, others working as assistants and others growing up with a medical family."
College Junior,4,teachers are highly knowledgeable. curriculum was jam packed with information. nurse client course and history felt a little long.
College Junior,4,The history of the building. connected right to the hospital where we did clinicals
College Junior,4,Has nice areas to use computers with fast connections. Assimilation labs were similar working inviroments.
College Junior,4,brand new building in a nice downtown location.
College Junior,4,transfer of credits was easy...all online for a small fee.
College Junior,4,"Brand new building, state of the art lab equiptment"
College Junior,4,My interactions so far with the admissions staff and on site professionals working here have been nothing short of exceptional.
College Junior,4,"I have not started classes here yet, but I hear from others that the first year nursing program is very intense, fast paced and you learn a lot in a short period of time."
College Junior,4,"Currently taking undergrad classes as prerequesites for a nursing program.  Everyone I've spoken to at VT tech have been great, friendly and helpful.  They get right back to you when you call with questions and seem to go out of their way to help."
College Junior,4,I did some classes previously to lighten the workload.
College Junior,4,The 3 step nursing program.  LPN to ADN to BSN.
College Junior,4,Library and staff are very helpful.
College Junior,4,Very accepting of adult learners returning to school.
College Senior,4,They know that nursing students are non-traditional students and understand our challenges .
College Junior,4,"I've learned a lot, especially with subject pertaining to my specific degree."
College Junior,4,"My professors are great and understand when I need some extra time- if they trust the cause, and know when to help on hard topics."
College Junior,4,"Vermont Tech is a great school with caring and knowledgeable faculty/administration, that also has a fair tuition, and Financial Aid is easy to acquire if properly sought after."
College Junior,4,We have so much potential as a college. VTC has a ton of acreage and we could expand our campus tremendously. Our only problem is that we don't have enough money to begin any of these projects. If we could start these projects we have several different majors that could expand their knowledge and use that to help contribute to the projects around campus. I think we need to get the majors more into projects around campus even if it's building a new storage shed or helping maintenance with lights.
College Junior,4,Teachers make students comfortable and push them to keep on track with their homework and other submissions. I personally liked having the time to do my work when ever I felt like I had the motivation to do it. Sometimes the teachers will post something the night before an assignment is due and I didn't get online 24/7 to check so I lost a grade point for something last minute.
College Junior,4,"When I first began my construction degree, I thought that being the only female in the majority of my classes might be a bit of a struggle. I was proved wrong. I was accepted, and treated as one of the group. I still had to prove myself, but when I did, I was taken in and accepted easily."
Sophomore,2,"Classes were personal and well taught, and the teachers were clearly passionate about their work. However, it is everything else that makes this college a very poor experience for anyone wanting to attend full-time. It's cheap to attend, and you definitely get what you pay for, minus a little. Some areas of the dorms remind me more of prison halls rather than student living quarters. The faculty are severely lacking in assistance with financial aid, housing, and any other non-academic needs you may have while at the college. The school is in the middle of a purely residential community, and the only way to get to the nearest town is with a car, so if you are dorming without a car, I suggest you study up on remedies for cabin fever. The students are primarily...Rural-minded, if you know what I mean. I've attended 2 other colleges in my life, and I can safely say that if you are planning on full-time study, VTC is not worth it."
Freshman,2,"The Campus is in the middle of no where, it gets very cold in the winter and there is little else to do in the winter but go to class."
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of things that go on at Vermont Tech. There are some events that student council sponsors throughout the year, but there are not many 'unique' opportunities on campus."
College Junior,2,"Not overly impressed with the 'help' I've received through this school. I am on my own, and paying for school by myself, but see other students who are not struggling, and are living with two working parents... I don't understand how they figure their aid, really."
College Junior,2,More aid is needed for the lower and middle income students.  Many of us come from average homes and there is not much aid available or help with finding it.
College Junior,2,the library was recently remodeled making that knowledge difficult to grasp but from what i have seen not too much is different. last year the amount of resources for computing majors were greatly outdated anywhere from 10 to 20 years. teachers however are always available and able to help students in their class given the student does not embark beyond the scope of the class which is usually limited and about the scope of the teachers knowledge
College Senior,1,"The classes at the Williston campus especially are very bad in terms of flexibility. They are offered only one time during the week, and if they are offered any other time then they will conflict nicely with all of your other classes. This is a commuter campus, which is even worse with the fact that classes start at 7:00 and end at 21:00 and there are 5 hours of nothing to do between classes."
College Junior,1,"Most classes are going well., but the math class is taught to fast and the instructor assumes you know the material and will not  stop and answer questions or explain things further."
College Sophomore,1,"There are two groups of students.   Engineers and those that call themselves rednecks.   Most of us have taken out full loans.  The ag, auto, and anyone not taking engineering majors may be getting their moneys worth but i am not."
College Sophomore,1,"There are none.  There is the standard tutoring, library, and gym."
College Sophomore,1,Failed to actually complete multiple facilities due to lack of funds. Led to a terrible road layout tats thinner than regulation on a corner with a steep hill on one side.  Mediocre  library  and an awful and wasteful underground heating system that is never heating evenly.
College Sophomore,1,One of the slowest networks for a  school offering CIS software and computer engineering.
College Junior,1,"Software Engineering – there are not too many things to say about my major, VTC prides itself on putting people in jobs after school so i'm sure i could get one after i get out, however i feel like i haven't learned much and what i have i have had to mostly teach myself because it was beyond the scope of whatever class i was in."
College Junior,1,"the size is the only thing about the school, it allows for free tutoring and it also allows teachers to individually help students, but when the teachers don't know what they are doing it doesn't really help anyone"
College Junior,1,The Classes – the class schedule isn't horrible once you get beyond your first semester.   however the classes themselves especially for the computer department I am enrolled in is lacking.   Most of the teachers don't even understand what they are teaching or are just so horrible at it that you fail their class from lack of doing work event hough you can get 100 on every test and the finals.
College Junior,1,"The Student body at Vermont tech is mostly comprised of farmers such as agriculture majors.   60% of the students are either equine, agriculture, or construction majors, the remaining body is sparse and in-similar to one another making cliche's between the 40% non-existant allowing in some cases for more interaction or less depending on your own social adeptness."

Freshman,4,"For the first time yesterday I went to Arkansas Baptist College to get my classes situated for the fall semester. Not knowing my way around the college, a football coach helps me get to where I needed to be after asking for directions. After that, the faculty help me out with everything I needed. From the Information that was given, until it was time to leave was tremendous. I felt as if a was home again. I felt like the people that help me really cared about me and where I needed to be."
Senior,4,I attended evening classes and that was very good for me.  The class size was small so the if you needed a little extra help the professor was able to provide it.
Senior,4,Arkansas Baptist College is perfect college for anyone who went to build character of person. my learning  how me encourage to competition with each other to make us more eager to learn and study to pass the class. The way I amplify learning with classmate to increase their grade in class. Is to have fun with teacher and student to make them remember thing about the lesson to encourage them to reminder on the test day so they can pass the class.  Amplify the class will help my classmate attend class more and learned more about subject even if it boring.
College Freshman,4,Professors are great and supportive. The courses are easy to understand.
Recent Alumnus,4,The support provided is excellent.
Recent Alumnus,4,This is a small College that offers hope for many students who haven't had the opportunity to go anywhere else.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not attended this facility yet, however I have chosen this College for 1 main reason;  Arkansas Baptist  is a Historically Black College in Little Rock,Ar.  While attending my Middle ,Junior and Senior HIgh years at a predominant white school, it did show that race still does play a factor in our lives every day still."
College Junior,4,"The college is Great. I enrolled in 2009, And i Plan on Graduating from this College. I have already Registered for the next semesters and have my schedule and bill. They have a floor that you go to and do your work and get help from instructors"
College Junior,4,"My first year attending the college i was declared undecided so i had no speific major. I took the basic and required classes of the school. Because it is a baptist college, required courses included Intro to Bible and a series of Bible classes that must be taken in order to graduate. All courses were indulging and very interactive."
College Senior,4,Favorite Experiences – my school has greek life and a student body full of enthusiastic people.
College Freshman,4,"School Hours – I love the hours they have for class. You can come Mornings, mid-afternoon and evenings. I luv that fexibility about the school."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are willing abd able to owrk with you. They are very understanding when it comes to unexpected things that come up.
College Junior,2,Its an up and coming school that needs a lot of work
College Junior,2,The computer network has problems occasionally and a lot of student work are turned in late because of the the small size printing lab and slow network.
College Freshman,2,"Computer Labs Consumed by Social Network Surfing – ABC is still in transition but the library is mostly for hanging out and most of the 'jocks' take up the computers to listen to rap, facebook and other social networks. During the entensity periods, which are during mid-terms and finals, I can say that there is actually school work going on."
College Junior,1,"Lack of computers, no libraries with computer or anything. We basically had to do everything by general knowledge. Also lack of books."
College Junior,1,"Campus activities were bad. No library, no atheletic centers or anything. Just a big waste of time. I wouldn't request that school to anyone."
College Junior,1,"The post-grad service could be improved. As a student here, I need a lot more effort and external network on my path to get a job."
College Junior,1,"The facilities on campus are in progress, the library is being renovated, the student center is small with very few entertainments that cannot serve a reasonable number of students."
College Sophomore,1,"For us to attend a private school the tuition is already high, but on top of the high cost for tuition the school does not offer any form of a scholarship or grant to help us pay tuition."
College Sophomore,1,"This school lacks organization, And as you know organization can be the foundation on which a school is ran upon."
College Sophomore,1,"they have new advisors and the advisors dont know what they are doing, they send you an email when you dont bring something and when you bring it and ask do you need anything else they lie and continue to send emails now if you work full-time like i do you do not have the time to keep running to the school whenever they forget something on their email.  The overall experience is very poor and i think they can do better"

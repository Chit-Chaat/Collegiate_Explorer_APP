Senior,5,"I absolutely love my Forensics Department! We have brand new machines some police departments cannot even afford in their labs. We have Ex-FBI workers who direct and teach classes in our department are all super nice and approachable. 

The overall atmosphere on campus is great. I love going back in the fall: beautiful colored leaves everywhere, cultural celebrations and festivals right outside in the main courtyard, the food options are decent and the close locations of relative buildings to each other saves me travel time when rushing in between classes. I love that I have attended GMU the last few years, and will be returning in the spring for my master's"
Alum,5,George Mason is a very diverse institution that helps any student find their place following high school.

Freshman,5,"I like that George Mason offers an inclusive campus that is offers a great space to learn for people of all races. George Mason is a Very diverse school and I love it.

Located outside of Washington D.C., George Mason allows for a smooth transition from college to professional life including top tier instruction and internship opportunities. Their graduate programs are excellent and prepare you to better impact your field and make a difference in the community. The professors are passionate about the education and enhancement of each student and will go above and beyond to assist learning and growth."
Senior,5,My online experience regarding Mason is a bit limited. After the Quarantine started my classes were all online. It was a bit hectic but it all turned out okay. I have had nothing but good experiences for the most part.
Senior,5,George Mason is a fairly diverse college with enthusiastic Professors and provides students with a well rounded education. Their art facilities and classes there are probably my favorite aspect of student life at Mason. It feels like home and taking classes there has helped me to grow as an artist.
Niche User,5,"I did not take any online classes, but I have heard great things about it. I think that many of my friends have taken online classes and loved them"
Sophomore,5,"The school is so inclusive. The atmosphere is friendly and diverse. The actual campus is very nice and clean, easy to get around."
Sophomore,5,"I am about to start classes online. Due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, we are all trying to figure it out. The school administration has done a good job at keeping us informed as soon as new information is available. I wish we could know sooner the format of the classes but over all, its been great so far."
Senior,5,"great university life, always fun. many clubs that allow you to grow. great teachers and career fairs are amazing"
Senior,5,"I wouldnt be sure because I havent taken any online classes at the moment, however i am sure its excellent"
Sophomore,5,I felt at home right away. I was welcomed  by my RA and other RA's in my building. I wasn't overwhelmed but at the same time there was always something to do on campus. Dining was good at the beginning of first semester but after that I found myself buying food outside of the dining halls a lot.
Freshman,5,"The teachers I had were extremely kind, helpful, and really interesting. They were really hands-on, easy going, and supportive in and outside of the classroom."
Junior,5,I love how diverse the university's culture is and the amount of activities to do on campus! Majority of professors are willing to help you outside the classroom as well.
Junior,5,"George Mason is a wonderful university and I am absolutely enjoying my undergraduate years there. The campus is very diverse and it makes me happy to see people from different ethnicities all in one place. As I was preparing to come here, I was afraid there wouldn't be many people like me. As a Muslim, I am proud to say that the university and its people are very warm and welcoming and I wouldn't want to attend any other university. George Mason is what I would call home."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19, my classes had to be switched to an online format. For me personally, in-person learning is much better, however, it was inevitable to change to an online learning format. Nevertheless, it was not a horrible experience. In fact, my professors, although they familiar with the online format themselves, helped each and every student to get comfortable with the new setting. As a student in such a different environment, I'm happy to say that my professors really helped with the change, and even made it better for us to improve the way we learned and interacted with our peers."
Junior,5,"My experience at George Mason has been truly eye opening. I have been exposed to so many new cultures and have learned so much about not only the world itself, but the people who make up our world today. I’ve love being on a campus that is full of diversity, life, and passion. Everyone at Mason is passionate about something whether it be about marriage equality or women’s rights or even something simple like art or sports, everyone you meet at Mason has a huge love for something. Student involvement on campus is huge!!! It’s amazing how many different opportunities Mason has to offer their students! Another thing that amazes me is that every person has their own unique story about themselves, their history, origins, and culture. I’ve been able to gain knowledge about all different kinds of people from all over the world. For example, one of my best friends is from Dubai while I have another friend from Hawaii! It’s so cool!"
Junior,5,"My overall learning experience with GMU has been going very well. Although it was unexpected for many of my classes to go online, my professors were still able to provide us with the same knowledge and information as they would in person. They were also just as accessible and flexible with arranging times to help or meet with students which is something that I highly appreciated! Even though I may have not been in an actual classroom, I still felt like I was even when I was back home doing my online classes. I still was able to communicate with my peers and chat with them online!"
Junior,5,I like mason because its a spacious campus and how nice and helpful the advisors and professors are.
Junior,5,"I took classes in person but due to Covid-19, we had to transition to online and I would say I loved it. Ryan Cotter was a great professor."
Graduate Student,5,I am currently in the MHA program. What I love most about it is that my director is very hands on and she is passionate about  ensuring my success in the program as well as other students.
Sophomore,5,"I have not attended George Mason yet, but I visited the college before and had conversations with others regarding the school. Many people are open-minded but very laid back. That is the lifestyle that fits me. Also, the campus is in a great location."
Sophomore,5,"when I first got accepted to GMU, I was really excited. not only because it is one of the best colleges out there, it is also closer to where I live, I get to save up money while I go to school at the same time. You will enjoy it very much if you actually pick the right major, there are so many useful resources in the campus, good luck!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at George Mason University has gone really well. I didn’t know what to expect going into college freshmen year, but I had a great time. I met great friends and had many chances to meet different types of people and cultures. George Mason is a very diverse school that welcomes every kind of person and I really love hat about the school."
Sophomore,5,Mason has become my happy place. I never was a huge fan of going to school but Mason really helps me enjoy the aspect of school. I get to learn about serious topics and dig deeper into my field of study. Mason professors are great and the school scene and life is great. I have learned to socialize more and branch out of my comfort zone.
Sophomore,5,I feel that I am getting my money worth when it comes to my classes. I'm actually retaining information and having thoughtful and informing discussions within my studies. It truly makes me excited to take more courses within my major.
Alum,5,"I did take online courses with GMU, it was both engaging and informative. I loved taking online courses here and they went by super quickly! The professors were no different online than in person and still had frequent office hours."
Alum,5,I like George Mason due to their diversity of students on campus! Their professors really cared about their students and tried to teach for real world experience.
Freshman,5,"i am high school senior going into freshman year, i hope to have a rewarding experience due to my senior year ending early. I have to be optimistic during these times since i am also a black student witnessing how racism is a constant threat to my kind as well."
Freshman,5,"i am high school senior going into freshman year, i hope to have a rewarding experience due to my senior year ending early. I have to be optimistic during these times since i am also a black student witnessing how racism is a constant threat to my kind as well."
Alum,5,I did take my classes online during the summer  and it was excellent! It’s super easy to navigate the website and to see all of your assignments.
Alum,5,I liked George Mason University because of the diversity on campus and how easy it is to navigate the campus to get to class. The professors were amazing and my fellow students made it a wonderful college experience.
Alum,5,I loved George Mason University due to the professors and their drive to always help their students and the diversity that you see around campus!
Alum,5,I have taken classes online and Blackboard is very easy to use! I would highly suggest to read the syllabus before every class and to attend every class (if its held on a video platform).
Junior,5,I appreciate how most professors have real life experience in their field. This allows them to connect with students and relate material to concepts.
Junior,5,I took classes online and in person at George Mason. I think they do a great job of balancing distance and in person learning.
Sophomore,5,Due to COVID-19 I did have to take my last semester classes online. My professors were very helpful every step of the way. They responded to emails in a timely manner and scheduled office hours where we could video chat if we had any further questions. Many of my professors also video chatted with me once a week and kept blackboard updated constantly. I had a very smooth transition to my online classes.
Sophomore,5,"George Mason University has provided me with resources and courses to help me grow in ways I couldn't have imagined. I have learned so many skills that will prove useful in the workforce. Leadership opportunities present themselves frequently, preparing me to enter the world confidently. The diversity of life at Mason is beautiful and has allowed me to gain new perspectives on many topics and issues."
Senior,5,amazing experience on campus with all the activities and courses that you can take. diversity of students makes it much more fun!
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity at my school ranging from different ethnicities to different ages. Everyone is also very helpful and professors are really good at working with your schedule to help you. Only thing I would change is how much construction takes place.
Senior,5,"Professors were very accommodating when we switched to online. The staff at Mason are incredibly compassionate and understanding. I enjoyed my online experience greatly. The classes were a little more difficult given the stress of COVID and the huge transition but, overall, my online learning experience was fantastic and I applaud Mason professors."
Junior,5,"I love learning about in-depth concepts, like religion, computer science, English, history, Spanish, psychology, and so forth. Doing activities that promote my development has shaped me into a formidable player in the competitive market of today. I've already rated all my professors (from NOVA and GMU), most of which were positive. I have been applying to scholarships, and I have done so since I'm worried about financial aid. If I were a first-time, incoming freshman student, there would have been a greater chance for me to get financial aid. But since I'm a transfer student, I've learned to make do with what's available. I have definitely accentuated my writing skills, as well as my scholarly outlooks."
Freshman,5,"This university has excellent Living Learning Communities (LLC). There are lots of ways to get connected on campus, from student orgs to events, or LLC environments."
Freshman,5,"I love this school, they even allowed me to create a dance team, they have so many opportunities and there is always something happening on campus."
Niche User,5,My experience with the university so far has been extremely amazing. I love the campus and the city- life. I also love the people and the diversity in the university. The faculty and the professors also seem to be extremely nice and supportive.
Niche User,5,Going to George Mason is definitely an experience. George Mason has been my dream school for every since I’ve been in high school. I when I finally arrived to George Mason I was thrilled and excited to be apart of George Mason culture. Most of the campus is made up of commuter students who live in the area. I love the atmosphere of the campus. Everyone is caring and making sure everyone is having fun. I also love the diversity of the campus. They’re many different events based around different cultures where people are able to learn about the  different ethnicities. The professors are generous to help out students who need help. I’ve had plenty of professors willing to meet up and help me either after class or office hours to go over concepts that I need more help understanding. Mason is everything that I have dreamed of and more.
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my experience at George Mason University and will be returning to GMU in the next two years. The campus life was great when I lived on campus, even if it did feel cramped at times. The dining halls were decent, an offered a good variety, but portion sizes could have been better. The classrooms and professors were great at facilitating learning, and the size of the campus was just right for what I wanted. Parking was always a bit of a pain, and I hope Mason improves on it in the future. Overall, I loved my experience at Mason."
Freshman,5,Has great engineering program for IT Fields and Computer Science. Very large campus in the beautiful fairfax county region.
Alum,5,"George Mason University is a great school located in a very safe area with a very walkable campus.  It is also close enough to Washington, D.C. to offer great opportunities in the district for certain majors.  It is a respectable and reputable institution."
Junior,5,Mason offers a variety of programs and events across campus for all majors. I enjoy the engagement the community creates to connect students with the community. I am a proud Mason Student.
Niche User,5,"As a student at George Mason University, I've thoroughly enjoyed my life and education at the college. For this reason, I would love to see more minority students the opportunity to experience George Mason the way that I do. George Mason University is an excellent college and I hope everyone, especially minorities in race or religion, can attend and enjoy like me."
Freshman,5,I love that its a diverse campus because it allows you to meet so many different types of people and connect with them.
Senior,4,"Although college classes have been held online the last year, this has not stopped the rapidly changing schedules and prep work being done to handle in-person labs and all associated work for students staying home. They have nothing short of great for me"
Alum,4,There are many office hour opportunities and chances to meet with your professor for 1x1 meetings outside of online classes.
Junior,4,"I would give George Mason University 5 stars, but their financial aid department can be more professional. Their professors have been amazing for me so far, even in the classes I may have had trouble in. They always want to help and would not think twice to write you a letter of recommendation as long as you show effort!"
Freshman,4,"It is my first semester and it is online, so that kind of ruin the experience a little bit. I did get to visit the campus and it would have been great to actually be on it for classes."
Freshman,4,"Although I'm disappointed in taking online classes my first semester here, it is going as well as I hope it to be."
Sophomore,4,"I like my professor a lot, and there are always people I can reach out to if I need help. I would really like to get back to in person classes, but for now, it is just fine"
Junior,4,"I have been taking most of my classes online since I work full time because I was unable to receive any financial help. Typically the course load is manageable but due to COVID-19, many professors have gone overboard on the amount of work that has been assigned for students to complete. I fear that classes will no longer be manageable and will cause people like myself to take fewer classes per semester. Overall, I would recommend online classes if it is available because it can work very well for student workers."
Junior,4,"I think that George Mason is very inclusive and it has many opportunities but it does not support many students that work and go to school at the same time. I have had to take classes online although I would benefit from in-person teaching but it is not provided at an accomodating time for those of us that work jobs. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at the school for the past three years. I think that there are many opportunities provided for everyone, including students who are not U.S. Citizens."
Freshman,4,"Good school and very good at helping students. It’s very expensive so unless you have scholarships or a college savings, you might have to get a couple loans throughout your mason experience."
Alum,4,"Online education can be tedious and exhausting, but GMU professors have made the transition as seamless as possible given the unprecedented nature of the circumstances."
Alum,4,"As an immigrant, I liked the diversity in GMU. I would like to see more effort from the Department of Biology to connect with students and encourage them in their studies."
Alum,4,"Some of the professors in online classes were very organized and helpful, while others could not make the online classes engaging or interesting."
Alum,4,I'm reviewing as an alumni who majored in accounting since I know things change very fast in GMU (Which is a good thing!). What I liked: The diversity is great here and I was able to meet people from around the world. I like the location of GMU since you are in a metropolitan area. Fairfax is a suburb of D.C. and it has a cute old town with mom and pop restaurants and stores. Fairfax isn't exactly popping with nightlife so whenever I got a chance I would hop on the free city bus or GMU shuttle to go to Arlington/D.C. for the bars and clubs. And for the serious times me and other classmates were able to get jobs/internships in or around D.C. I know GMU can improve on parking (seriously if this school has a commuter school reputation you would think they would have excellent parking). I find the people who bash on GMU don't take the time to go to student clubs and go home immediately after class. Take advantage of living in the D.C. area and your GMU experience will be awesome!
Freshman,4,"Good university for those that actively search out friends and ec's, otherwise it's considered a hermit school."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a student at GMU and it is a great college. Great campus and classes. Very diverse and lots of great students and teachers.
Sophomore,4,Not bad. In person is better for classes like history and English. It all depends on the professor.  Overall it wasn't bad.
Graduate Student,4,"Due to COVID-19 the majority of my graduate education has been spent online. While there are limitations to this approach, George Mason's faculty and administration have done a great job and providing timely updates and resources to help facilitate online learning and instruction. Blackboard Collaborate, and Webex have allow for some good virtual instruction. Overall, the is enough content and contact with the courses and instructors to provide a solid learning experience."
Senior,4,"GMU's online program is well structured and easy  to follow. However,  academic quality really depends on the professor you get. I have had great online classes where I learned so much and others where I barely managed to survive because the professors didn't answer emails and simply didn't know how to teach."
Senior,4,"Orientation experience for transfer students needs work as it's not clear and user friendly. Business School counselors are excellent, very helpful, and easy to reach through email/web meetings. The campus in general is nice and there are good food options available. However, building signs should be place at the top of the buildings so that they are easier to spot. As a new student I found it hard to find my classes because most buildings only have small stand alone signs by the building's main entrance. Parking is very expensive."
Alum,4,Teachers work with you and want you to succeed. Diverse student  population. Plenty of student activities and clubs to participate in.
Alum,4,"The two I took where good. Able to submit papers online, easy access to assignments and professor when needed."
Sophomore,4,"Because of COVID-19, the spring semester was moved to fully online. The professors and students had to adjust quickly to remote learning. Students and professors worked well to create a good online environment. We still continued our learning and exams, office hours were still open for further assistance, and zoom  calls to understand material."
Sophomore,4,"Mason is a very accepting university with people from diverse backgrounds. That is one aspect Mason has to offer that most students enjoy. One thing Mason can change it their approach towards students' needs like sexual assault, harassment, discrimination, and many more. We need to prioritize students' needs and improve on those to do better as a university."
Sophomore,4,It is an overall okay school but it is not very exciting. Everyone mostly keeps to themselves and there are not that many activities to join.
Alum,4,"I took some classes online through this school, and it worked out pretty well. The teachers that teach online, are usually available when you need to ask questions or talk about the subject material. The amount of classes they offer is pretty extensive as well, so there are many options to choose from."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful and the people are so kind there. The clubs and activities you can join are endless
Alum,4,"Online classes are good at Mason. They're very comprehensive. If you get good professors, they'll really work with you. If your professor is busy/lazy, it's kind of confusing to get through, but there's always someone who can answer your questions. Look up the professors on Rate My Professor and read as many of the reviews as you can before taking their class."
Senior,4,"My favorite part about George Mason is the diversity. It's awesome seeing and learning new perspectives. Where I liked most of my professors,  I've had an issue with a couple,  and one I believe should never be a teacher."
Junior,4,"Incredibly diverse school with every type of community you could imagine-- gay, straight, white, black, asian, international and more. Infrastructure is very good and the campus is all encompassing so everything you need is inside its borders on a maximum 5 minute drive."
Junior,4,"It had a rocky start but once it got going it saved me so much headache. I was able to save money on gas, time on commuting and scheduling was much easier."
Freshman,4,"I loved the diversity the university had not only among students, but also among various classes, teachers/staff, events, and food places! They also provide extremely helpful resources in terms of finding a job, helping build your resume, and host great career fairs."
Senior,4,I enjoyed taking classes online - before and during the pandemic as long as I didn't have to log on and sit through a lecture for it. Enjoyed going at my own pace and the professors are still pretty accessible.
Sophomore,4,"Luckily, most of my professors were very accommodating when the corona virus hit our state. Also, they were able to teach through online mediums."
Graduate Student,4,"Communication and access to services is great. The one thing I hate is the service they use for online text books, but that's a small thing."
Graduate Student,4,It's very easy to communicate with professors about assignments or other things and they are very responsive and helpful.
Junior,4,"George Mason is a very nice school and offers a lot of different classes and opportunities for students. Some departments, particularly science, can be rude to the students. I wish they would pay more attention to who they hire and how they treat their students rather than them just having a degree. George Mason is also pretty expensive unnecessarily. Other than those two things, I enjoy George Mason."
Junior,4,I have taken online classes and George Mason does pretty well. Online classes can be difficult depending upon the professor but I have never had any issues.
Graduate Student,4,The professors at GMU are heavily dedicated in ensuring that all students succeed and become a productive part of the world. I also really like that they actually take out the time to make sure we are learning the material.
Sophomore,4,The online experience was great! I come from Tidewater Community College and the online service is better at this school.
Sophomore,4,"I took 3 online classes in my first year of college, it is very convenient to take online classes if you have job at the same time, I would not recommend to take all the classes through online, you can try to take class where you think it is easy  to finish."
Sophomore,4,I originally was an on campus student and loved it. However when Corona hit we had to take classes online and I ended up doing better at home than at school. My professors were very helpful and put the students in the best position possible.
Sophomore,4,"In my first year at GMU, I have met people that I know will be lifelong friends and I have taken classes that were genuinely excited and I looked forward to going to the night before. The staff are sincere people who care about preparing you for life beyond GMU. The only minor inconvenience is the construction going on but I enjoy living on campus for the most part."
Sophomore,4,"It is definitely more difficult to learn through online instruction but with the help of professors, it is as easy as it can possibly be. So far, every online instructor has been more than willing to answer questions and be readily available to offer any help they can give."
Junior,4,"Though I was only enrolled in online courses due to COVID-19, my experience has been incredibly grand! The professors know how to teach on any platform!"
Junior,4,"George Mason University is a school full of diverse people, ideologies, and experiences! If you're looking for a school with an active party scene, this is not your school unless you are in a fraternity or sorority. However, if you're looking for a school that is based on innovation and continuously making progress, this is your school!"
Sophomore,4,"I love being a Mason Patriot. As a freshman, the upperclassmen welcomed me with open arms. The RA's and CA's in my building were always there when needed! It felt like part of a family everywhere I went, and I was never excluded. I found many different clubs that I was interested in. I also enjoyed living on campus. My professors were very helpful during class and after hours, allowing me to reach my full potential. Overall, I love attending George Mason. The people are wonderfully nice and the campus is beautiful. Due to COVID-19 I was unable to finish my freshman year on campus, but I hope to return on the fall and continue making amazing memories with my family and friends!"
Freshman,4,"To say the least, my experience at George Mason University has been quite interesting. I entered university with a blank page ready to write the next chapter of my life. I was taken by the environment and the diversity of the campus. I was happy to know how inviting it was and that there was a place for everyone. In addition to the various classes to choose from, there were also countless clubs to get involved with. 
As for the academics and having completed my freshman year of college, I was proud of my results and thankful to all my professors who have done a wonderful job in helping me successfully finish off my first year. I was also able to maintain a social life with former friends as well as create meaningful new friendships on campus. Overall, I would say that I am very happy my experience and hope to continue in this manner."
Freshman,4,"Before the unfortunate events of the corona virus pandemic striking the world, I had not taken classes online. The use of online learning was minimal. My professors would send grade or assignment notifications and sometimes videos or modules that related to lectures through George Mason’s Blackboard cite. But, due to the severity of the situation George Mason is one of the many universities that had to shift its in person education system to one that is 100% virtual. Second semester was a very challenging transition and a tough end to the school year. Having said this, I did my best to still achieve the academic goals I had set for myself and was able to. Some professors held live class sessions and office hours for anyone who had questions or concerns while others posted recordings of the lectures and could be reached via email. I think my professors did a great job and made the transition easier considering the circumstances and how different it is to teach a class online."
Junior,4,"Its good, but really depends on the Prof of how they have the course setup. Every Prof teaching differently so extremely difficulty to predict. It really depend how well organize you are and you really gotta keep up with the prof in online course"
Junior,4,"It's a good college, very diverse but kinda expense to attend and lot of extra thing that they charge you for."
Junior,4,It depends on the class really. Some professors are more tech savvy than others. Some engage more with the students than others. Sometimes the material and subject of the class is easier to learn online compared to other classes.
Senior,4,"Most classes are very organized online, they have all of the information uploaded from day 1. Since I like to work ahead, I can see the content beforehand and complete the homework early."
Sophomore,4,"Though it has been challenging, my online learning experience with George Mason University has been good. Our administration and faculty worked tirelessly to make sure we were able to learn the curriculum and finish the semester successfully."
Freshman,4,Mason has a great environment and is an amazing space for education. Everyone is engaged with one another and the campus is very active.
Senior,4,Due to Covid-19 taking online classes. so far has been successful and a smooth transition but personally do not feel as comfortable than in person classes!
Junior,4,"George Mason was able to quickly coop with the ""stay-at-home"" order and take all classes online without losing a lot of time. 
George Mason University also did help students in need with Financial assistance. 
I just hope it could help more for the Fall semester as well"
Junior,4,I think George Mason University did a very good job in adapting to the online teachings since many of the Professors had not done such a job and it was their first time. More could be done if online extends to the Fall semester but overall it was done good and did not effect our learning and grades in the classes.
Sophomore,4,The professors tried their best to make it easier for us to continue to learn and just as we were learning how to do online school they were learning with us at the same time. Overall with the online experience George Mason gave students amazing help and options for alternative grading.
Senior,4,"George Mason is a great school. The psychology department is strong. However, the school claims it's diverse but has a very low percentage of African American students. It's definitely a commuter school. I would like to see more school events, like a homecoming etc. But as far as academics, the teachers are incredible. There's many resources available to students, like tutors, writing centers, language centers, computer labs etc. If you like to have fun this school shouldn't be your first choice. But, if you're in for just the education, not the experience, I recommend Mason 100%."
Senior,4,It a okay school. If you just want a degree and focus on your future. This is your school. Just focus on your study and make your future great!
Senior,2,"Mason's campus is nice. However, the administration does not care about sexual assault survivors, Black students or other students of color. They admitted a Neo-Nazi for the upcoming fall and students had to apply immense pressure to get Mason to rescind their acceptance. They also don't allocate resources and funds to departments meant to support minority students even though they make so much money off of being ""diverse."""
Junior,2,So far my online experience hasn't been the best. The quality of the classes have gone down as well. Especially the hans on class like Film.
Junior,2,"GMU is more or less a joke. I found a major that I enjoy and that challenges me, but I have friends whose majors consist of high school level classes. The on-campus housing situation is not great, and the dining halls are terrible. The campus is currently heavily under construction and there are clouds of dust in places that make it hard to breathe. There is nothing to do on the weekends, and it seems like half of the student body goes home every weekend anyway. I would have been better off going to VCU or any other similar school. Unless you're a STEM major I'd recommend looking elsewhere if you're considering GMU."
Senior,2,"Not by any means the college experience i was looking for. Generally students are unhappy, there is no school spirit because we have no reason to feel pride in our school."
Sophomore,2,"There is too much construction going on at the campus at the moment. And the food here is terrible. Most of the professors here are nice, but not all of them can really teach."
Sophomore,2,"George Mason has it's ups and downs. My main reason for attending the university is because of the potential internship/networking opportunities they have and it's proximity to Washington D.C., and it's probably the only reason I've stayed. This is my second year here and I've already had so many problems with my Academic Advisers, the Financial Aid office, and housing. I'm active on campus, part of one of the club sports teams, and a rather dedicated student, but as an institution, it never seems like they have everything together. I wish that Mason would also put more value on their students safety - it always seems like serious incidents will happen on campus and it will take days, sometimes weeks, for the police department to notify the rest of the student body. 
Overall, I have learned to enjoy the experience of attending Mason, but if i could tell the high school senior version of myself about what it's really like, I would've picked a different school."
Junior,2,"George Mason has a great climate regarding the students and professors. You can tell everyone really cares. Where George Mason lacks and lacks severely is their professional staff such as finical aid advisors, parking staff etc. I have never heard of had a positive expirence with either department and they make me regret choosing Mason."
Freshman,2,"Being a commuter student wasn't a great experience. It is very difficult or nearly impossible join clubs and make friends on campus if you commute to school. And also, for my morning classes, I would have to wake up at least 2 hours before my class starts. What a pain!"
Freshman,2,"The school overall academic wise is very good and at a great pace. The social aspect isn't the best, although there are many clubs. I feel as though some clubs could be better. I often lost interest quick in a club after I went to the first meeting or so, they could maybe spruce it up. Everyone around campus is very friendly and willing to help if you need help! Also the university is very diverse, which is a main reason I chose to attend."
Freshman,2,"GMU is not a place you want to go unless you are a commuter. The school does not offer any kind of activities for you to do so unless you want to go to frat parties, which are hard to find, you will be sitting around watching Netflix. My roommate was awful and I wanted to switch to commuting my second semester but housing would not let me because my situational depression was not a valid enough reason to release me from my housing contract. I even had a doctors note to help me get released and the school did nothing. I do not recommend coming here unless you commute. I will be transferring after this year."
Junior,2,"George Mason is located in the suburbs of Fairfax County, but it feels isolated from the rest of the community. Although the commute to Washington D.C is a 30 minute commute, George Mason has available transportation to certain location to D.C and NOVA. Furthermore, George Mason grading policy is very strict. I notice how much student here have to study to get a decent grade."
Freshman,2,"This school was far from good. There are way too many commuters here, which makes it very arduous to hang out with people after class. Additionally, two of my professors first semester were exceptionally incompetent. For example, my IT professor literally said to our class, ""We are too busy to give you feedback on your research papers."" This was absurd because how were supposed to know what we did wrong if we were not given feedback? Another example of the incompetence  was when I asked my professor about a homework assignment and she said, ""Google for instructions.""Don't get me wrong, I did have many excellent professors, but 2/5 is pretty bad. Furthermore, the food is not good at all at South Side, but it's okay at Ike's. Additionally, unless you are in a frat or friends with a frat member, then there is no way you'll ever hear about parties. Overall, this school fetishizes diversity and ignores competence among teachers and students."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most people outside of the area have never even heard of George Mason University, it does not help that george mason high school is right down the street, in many ways GMU feels more like a high school than a college."
Recent Alumnus,2,"No effort by the school to encourage participation in intramurals or even attend sporting events, outside of a weekly email that no one really reads."
Recent Alumnus,2,Many professors are difficult to understand and most seem to just be there to conduct research and collect a paycheck
College Sophomore,2,I do not take part in it so I cannot really say.
College Freshman,2,"There have been at least 4 cases of sexual harassment reported from parties, so that's not good, and I've heard some of the frats are sketchy.  I can't speak from experience though."
College Freshman,2,There are several cases of sexual assaults on our campus from one semester alone. It's hard to feel safe when these situations occur so frequently.
College Junior,2,"They are kind of a joke as well. There's nothing special or exclusive about them. Just pay a ton of money and sign the dotted line and you're in. Most of the girls are pretty weird in the sororities and the guys aren't very attractive or athletic in the fraternities either. They have lots of parties, but they mostly get busted by the cops because it's NoVa."
College Sophomore,2,Not much of a party school.
College Sophomore,2,Don't partake in the party scene
College Sophomore,2,I have not heard the greatest things about our Greek life.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty bad.
College Sophomore,2,"George Mason doesn't have a football team, so there are only few big-time sports that we can attend. The basketball games used to be a huge event, however, in recent years many people don't attend simply because there is a lack of school spirit/pride. The athletic facilities are great at George Mason and there are multiple gyms throughout campus for students to use."
Recent Alumnus,2,Fan support and school is spirit is quite low.
College Freshman,2,"George Mason is not the school for me. As on off campus commuter, having fun on campus is pretty difficult. Of course, I am not alone considering 70% of Mason students are off campus, though, not all of Mason's students dread it as much as I do. If you're looking for a fun college lifestyle--this isn't the school for you. There are no parties, barely any FUN events, greek life sucks, and making friends in huge classes is very difficult. Also, I'd like to point out how ridiculous the parking situation at this school is...they charge you $400 for a parking pass in parking lots that are ALWAYS full. Expect to have to circle around the lot for a good 10-15 mins before finding parking. Maybe even 20-30 mins during peak hours. Plus, these general parking lots are at least a 15 minute walk from my classes. As for academics, I have to say as a biochem major, I made the wrong choice choosing mason as my school. Mason is very weak in sciences, especially chemistry. The professors and lab instructors are terrible and do not even try to help you. The entire chemistry department is just awful, their teaching methods make learning difficult and are not beneficial. All of these reasons are why I'm choosing to transfer next year. Don't make the mistake of trying to save money and attending a local university, when really all you're doing is robbing yourself of an education and fun college experience."
College Freshman,2,"I'm currently a sophomore at Mason double majoring in Chinese and International Relations. I'm from South Carolina and chose Mason due to its location near DC and concentration of international students. There are a couple nice things about Mason, but overall it's a depressing place to be. I don't want to be too harsh but the majority of A average/AP high school students I've met agree with me. I'm in the Honors college so the dorms aren't bad. Average. The issue with campus life is that so many students commute. The school lacks any community feel. It's like 30,000 students just happen to attend classes for a few hours at the same place. The academics are pretty sub par. I've taken 3 400 level classes and am in all 300 levels this semester, but every single AP class I took in high school was far more difficult. Honestly, most classmates treat it like a community college and that's the vibe I get too. The extra curriculars are pretty good, and the food is definitely better than average compared to most colleges. The professors are intelligent but overworked so out of touch for the most part. One plus is that most people are really nice. There's a lot more I could get into, but for the sake of brevity, I would definitely choose a more academically rigorous school if I could go back to senior year of high school."
College Sophomore,2,this is not a party school at all. very boring at times.
College Sophomore,2,"One person would tell me to do one thing, and other would say something completely different. It was such a hassle"
College Sophomore,2,Off campus is the way to go
College Sophomore,2,There could be healthier options.
College Student,2,It is absolutely way too expensive and impossible to afford.
College Student,2,It's okay but could do better.
College Student,2,It cost way too much and I cannot even afford it.
College Sophomore,2,i don't eat off campus
College Sophomore,2,forced meal plans if you live on campus. extremely expensive
College Sophomore,2,Everyone roots for our crappy basketball team that did good one time several years ago. The only reason people go to the games is to see our Green Machine pep band because they're awesome.
College Freshman,2,The party scene isn't much of a scene at Mason. Weekends are very quiet unless you are involved in Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,I do not enjoy the food here on campus. The quality is bad and it needs to improve.
College Freshman,2,"GET RID OF ANYTIME DINING AND LET STUDENTS GET WEEKLY SWIPES FOR DINING HALLS OR OTHER PLACES LIKE PANERA, ETC"
College Sophomore,2,"I literally cannot get this school to give me any money and it's disheartening because I wanted to be a normal student and attend for 4 years but I know I can't afford that so I'm forcing my degree into 3 years instead.  It really seems like unless you're coming in with outside scholarships too, Mason doesn't want to provide you extra help, which is unfortunate because its those of us with no outside scholarships who really need the help from the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,The sports suck. Spirit is high but they need to get better at playing.
Recent Alumnus,2,not even half to support your tuition. a lot of people struggle working and going to school while wealthy parents of students pay their school.
Recent Alumnus,2,I am not a party person but I have heard that it is bad.
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of scholarships available for regular students.
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a lot of safe campus parties, only ferternity parties which are not very safe"
College Sophomore,2,little options and very little meal plan options for off campus students
College Freshman,2,"I've had bad experiences with off-campus housing, do not live with a family. Live in a place with people you know or other college kids or even adults but never with a family. It is so incredibly difficult."
College Freshman,2,It's really not a party school. That is all i'm going to say on the matter.
College Freshman,2,"Southside has some good constants going for it, the salad bar - great, the pasta/pizza bar - great, the deserts - great. But here are somethings to be aware of, the random vegan and vegetarian food is not good and neither are most of the meats. 

Ikes, they pump out some pretty good Asian and American cuisine. The meats and the salad bar is good at ikes. 

I don't really eat anywhere but those two places and the occasional Johnson Center food, which is pretty good too and since you have bonus money that they make you pay for in the meal plan you might as well eat there to get some variety."
Recent Alumnus,2,There really isn't much of a party life at this school. The closest thing to a party you could get to was always off campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"George Mason's main campus is essentially an island that closes itself off to everything surrounding it. Therefore, I don't think there a many places for students off campus that are easily accessible. Actually, I can't even name three places in my four years that I've attended George Mason. Of those places, I've never been given a discount and thought the food was too expensive with little variety."
College Freshman,2,"I don't leave campus very often, but when I do, it's typically dinner at McDonald's or Wendy's or other similar restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"I have the anytime dining plan which is new to Mason and the freshman class. It's possibly the worst plan because students can only eat at 3 places without using their very limited bonus funds. These three places (Southside, Ike's, and the Globe) are located far apart meaning students tend to only eat at one of them on a regular basis. When we want to eat another place such as Chick-fil-a or the JC we are forced to use either our own money or our bonus funds which runs out quickly. There is not a variety at any of the anytime dining locations making it difficult for people with special dietary needs to find food. Only Southside is open 24/7 so unless you live close to it, you either are working miles to get food or simply not eating."
College Freshman,2,"For out-of-state students, getting fair financial aid is difficult."
College Freshman,2,There are a very limited number of scholarships available and students who are in extreme need of financial aid more than likely did not receive it.
College Senior,2,"The only way to get to a real decent party is to go to a frat party. The problem is that you need to know someone in the frat and set up getting a ride to the house by one of the brothers. If you're a guy who isn't friends with any, you can kiss your chances good bye. There are very few on-campus, but they do exist you just have to find the right people and develop a group of friends."
College Junior,2,"Some people get pumped for the basketball games, especially later in the season, but sports besides that are relatively ignored unless you know someone on the team. As for school spirit, I do think people here are proud to attend Mason, but not in the athletic sense. It's more of a pride in our diversity or our professors as opposed to a pride in our sports teams."
College Freshman,2,not a ton of options for me if there are they are hard to find
College Sophomore,2,"Like Jack Nicholson said in ""Batman,"" ""this town needs an enema.""  There's only one way to get any nightlife going on Mason at all.  Before the weather starts getting cold, I'm going to organize ""naked Mason"" weekends.  There are only two rules:  it has to be on weekends, and you have to be naked.  Why?  Because the campus is so deserted that no one is around to notice."
Freshman,1,"This school literally has the WORST admissions office. I have been on the line for 30 + minutes and when my call was finally picked up, the admissions lady wasn't much help at all. The service at this university doesn't even deserve one single star. Very disappointed, but glad I didn't commit here. Applying elsewhere.."
Junior,1,"If you want a place that uplifts and encourages you, making you feel like you're a part of a thriving community, then this is not what you're looking for. It tries to be like the other schools, but it’s just a sad excuse of an institution that profits off of our suffering. We are just numbers to them, not human beings.
Go somewhere where they have a cohesive balance of a wholesome, healthy campus experience and quality academics that don't try to weed the weak ones out. Even the ones that excel here leave after class because because the environment, the overpriced food, etc. is just that awful. Only the ones who can't afford it or aren't eligible for other colleges go here for an easy way out, only to find out that they wasted 4 years of their life here. I wish I could've gone to Virginia Tech or VCU instead."
Junior,1,"Horrible school. None of the staff values the students, all they value is your money. This is the most money hungry school I have ever attended. I am a transfer student and am pleased to say after 1 semester I am leaving. Professors are terrible and are consistently cancelling office hours. Buildings are falling apart. Just to have a decent parking spot costs upwards of $1K. Save your money and go somewhere that actually wants you to succeed!"
Senior,1,This school is terrible. Seriously terrible. There are far too many students here passing classes and graduating that did not earn their degree at all. George Mason sets the bar so low and I am embarrassed to have a degree from this school despite actually working very hard for mine. The ONLY reason why there are so many students at Mason is because it has a monopoly as the only large public university in Northern Virginia. Get a more respectable degree elsewhere. I would never recommend this school to anyone.
Junior,1,"Terrible professors, staff, deans department, everyone! I'm a student in the engineering school and while being here for 3 years I've only been let down by this place. I've learnt way more at an internship than at Mason. The professors absolutely don't care about their students and the struggle of being a student. My advisor was mostly absent. I went through health issues and wanted to withdraw from a semester and despite providing sufficient proof (ER documents, scans, doctors notes etc.) I was rejected and insulted by the School of Engineering. . The university is so focused on money and being famous/known that they do not care about their students at all."
Sophomore,1,"I just finished my freshman year at GMU, and it has been terrible. GMU is a terrible school, the financial aid office is useless, most RA’s don’t do their job properly, housing is terrible, and don’t bother going to a person of authority if you’re having a problem with a roommate or whatever, because no one will help you. If you ever toured GMU with a Mason Ambassador, know that they fed you nothing but lies. They’re told to tell you how “amazing” GMU is, but in reality, GMU is a terrible school. Roommate problems WILL happen, deciding to room with a random person does NOT always end well, the dining halls kind of suck, but you get used to them, and the people aren’t very friendly at all! GMU feels like one giant high school, with the cliques and all. Honestly, if you’re Black, people will treat you differently on this campus. Even though GMU is very diverse, it is still predominantly white and full of rich white spoiled kids."
Niche User,1,George Mason is a publicly funded school that practices viewpoint discrimination. It is unwelcoming to students who do not subscribe to liberal orthodoxy and political correctness. The school lacks diversity of thought and takes a bullying and unwelcoming attitude toward half the people in the country.
College Sophomore,1,I actually like this rating. NO DRINKING!! YES!!
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are no emergency call boxes on the nearly 600 acre campus. The police justify not having any call boxes by saying they patrol the buildings and grounds, compared to other schools its a joke."
College Junior,1,"Registration is a nightmare. Random prerequisites that aren't actually necessary to succeed in the class. Departments are out to get you, advisors never help and barely ever have time to meet with you. It's been a very tough experience remaining sane going through my undergrad."
College Junior,1,"I lived on campus my freshman and sophomore year and then just had enough. It's ridiculously expensive. Also gmu will try and screw over its students any chance they can. The day before housing registration, gmu raised the cost of housing by hundreds of dollars a month, so students had no option but to pay it because they didn't have time to make other off campus housing arrangements since they were expecting on campus housing to be the price gmu had advertised it to be."
College Junior,1,"They don't even notify you about the sexual assault incidents until WAY after they occur, so you could be walking right in the parking lot where someone was assaulted and you'll never know until it's potentially too late. They also found students making bombs on campus and didn't notify the student body until maybe a week or two after the national news already had it publicized."
College Sophomore,1,its the absolute worst. police are not understanding and it doesn't feel like college
College Student,1,I did not receive enough financial aid and am still struggling to find enough money.
College Student,1,Most of the dorms make you get a meal plan and the dorms don't even have kitchens in most of them which sucks since I like to cook.
College Sophomore,1,Tuition goes up every year but i was able to get more loans that I needed.
College Sophomore,1,"George Mason dining is the absolute worst in Virginia, I guarantee it. The Freshman are stuck with these anytime plans that only allow them into the dining halls which are always hit or miss. The other food options on campus are very unhealthy; it's almost impossible to find properly cooked greens anywhere. I survived the whole semester just eating canned foods and Einstein's when I could. Also, all the food places CLOSE on the weekends, there's no place to eat on Saturday and Sunday!"
College Freshman,1,I only got a merit scholarship but no other financial help when parents make barely enough money to live.
College Sophomore,1,"They do not offer a variety of meal plans or late night options, also the prices are quite un-affordable"
College Junior,1,"GMU is not a party school. It is a commuter school. The frats are there, but you have to go out of your way to find them."
College Senior,1,parking is the worst. can never find parking
College Freshman,1,"If your a guy and you're not in Greek life there are no options,  you can drink in your dorm if you want but if you're looking for a party on the weekend after rush week there's on chance of getting in. If your a girl however you shouldn't have a problem."
College Freshman,1,"Greeks run the parties, if your not in Greek life your can't get into any parties"
College Junior,1,"So far I have been very fortunate to be in the Honors College LLC housing for the time I have been at GMU. I did some research as well as my parents and due to the location of GMU the housing cost is extremely high and not affordable for me. I hope that I am fortunate to finish my senior year on campus. I am very concerned about housing for graduate school, as I am planning on applying the GMU's Law School which is located in Arlington, VA - housing costs there are through the roof and I don't know if I will be able to afford to go and realize my goals and dreams."
College Sophomore,1,They are not very helpful when it comes to financial aid or any money issues you have.
College Junior,1,"Honestly, it is over priced and definitely not good. It's not even healthy. If it was unhealthy, but good I would be okay, but it's not even good."
College Senior,1,"I went through the process of off campus housing and it was even worse than on campus housing , which is pretty bad in itself. Off campus housing has no priority at Mason. There is almost no one to help you, it is all online applications that may or may not work out , then you just have to fend for yourself."
College Junior,1,Greek Life has a negative connotation on campus because many of those who partake in Greek Life are reckless students who party too much and fall behind in school. They offer nothing to the campus community expect collecting money for an organization and leaving chalk and spray paint residue everywhere.
College Sophomore,1,I get tired of campus food and it isn't that healthy. The only thing that is healthy is southside. Meal plans aren't worth much because there are items on the menu that you need more than a one swipe in order to get what you want. There are also some places on campus you aren't allowed to use a meal plan.
College Freshman,1,"I am an out of state student. Mason's aid is very limited, and it is very frustrating. I have had to turn to outside sources in hopes of bringing down the cost of tuition."
College Junior,1,"If there is one thing I can definitely say needs work, it is the financial aid here. Not many of us get scholarships, only loans, tuition here has been raised at 4.9%, and as long as I've been here coming in as a senior, I have not been offered anything yet. Even as an out-of-state student, don't expect any type of scholarships. The tips that I would have if you are looking mostly at the financial aspect of this school is to not go here, but apply for plenty of outside scholarships."
College Freshman,1,Rude people clustered down narrow road ways with constant construction.
College Freshman,1,It's really hard o get around. It takes forever for buses to get you anywhere.
College Freshman,1,Nothing is ever happening on campus at night or on the weekends. It is difficult to get off campus so people are stuck in their rooms drinking because they have no other option. Mason needs to step it up and give us more fun.
College Senior,1,"Watch out. They pulled a bait and switch on me. One semester in and established one semester of debt, then I was notified they were wrong with their pricing and they had changed everything now. They just took nearly $7,000 out of my loans this semester and said sorry about my luck and sorry for their mistake. They Bait and Switched Me. Now I am screwed."
College Sophomore,1,"Not enough spots at all, far from class and too many tickets for dumb reasons"
College Junior,1,"Academic advising in the school of management is the worst! They don't care about your academic success. They only care about their hours. Once, I had to wait for an advisor for almost an hour just because she decided to have tea time with a colleague at the conference room. "
College Junior,1,Parking is awful.  The spots are far from classes and priced expensively.
College Junior,1,hours to find a parking and you pay for parking a lot of money and you can never find a parking space.
College Junior,1,"Not scholarship, not much financial aid."
College Senior,1,I could never even meet with a counselor the person at the front desk always gave me a list of websites
College Senior,1,Parking is never available and they invite the circus once a year to take up parking spots you payed$300 for
College Junior,1,Domicile office is the worst
College Freshman,1,dunno. im a off campus student
College Sophomore,1,Pretty easy to get in... sucks that there is not dedicated houses for fraternities.
College Senior,1,"Mason is generally awful. Mason police are all disgraced police academy drop outs from the Fairfax County Department after they were all caught cheating. At least- that's what's been going around for the last few years. They're awful, if you're caught drinking, even at legal age, and anywhere in public they'll haul your ass to the Fairfax County ADC. Pretty much anything will get you arrested and sent to the ADC. It's pretty scary. The RA's are also awful- you'll get written up for anything from a noise policy violation to running a meth lab out of your dorm. You go through the same conduct process no matter what the offense is. And don't even think about having more than 2 people in your room at a time if you don't want to get written up for a guest policy violation- and possibly lose your housing."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is terrible.  You pay almost $400 for a parking permit, and then it takes you 30-60 minutes to find a parking spot.  You literally have to follow someone to their car in order to find a spot."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The food is not good at all. They need to provide more healthy food options for students. Almost everything on campus is fast food, and not very appetizing. GMU seems to always be promoting health and fitness, however the food they offer us on campus is the exact opposite."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is awful at Mason. Literally the worst thing on campus. Some parking decks cost about $500 a year. General lot is still about $150 but is far from classes and dorms. The parking police will give you a ticket for ANYTHING even if you have a parking pass. They send you a confirmation email about a week after you get the ticket but you only have a few days to argue the ticket, so if you don't go to your car everyday you can get screwed. Ticket start at $50 and go up to a few hundred. Literally the worst parking system ever. Ever."
College Junior,1,"Extremely EXPENSIVE! $600 for an annual parking pass, really?! We are students, we have no money or printing money machines. It is cheaper to park in Washington DC than it is in GMU."
College Sophomore,1,The University has shut down the cheapest parking on campus for the upcoming academic year and that wouldn't be such a big deal if the next parking option wasn't at least $200 more. If I wasn't an out of state student I would not be bringing my car to campus.
College Junior,1,There is not a lot of school spirit because we don't have a football team.
College Freshman,1,"The weather here is horrible. South of the Mason-Dixon line? You'd never know. It is just as cold as anywhere north, and the weather is so bipolar. When spring finally comes its beautiful, but months October-March are hell."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Unless your classes start prior to 9am or after 4pm, make sure to put 30min aside to look for parking. The number of spots decrease every year, alongside with increasing prices."
College Senior,1,"The teachers are more worried about their 9-5 job then they are about your education. Science department is a joke and unless you want to learn material from last century, you won't learn anything"
College Senior,1,everything is crap except Starbucks and thats about it. If you want to drive 30 miles out into DC then you can find something good to eat.
College Senior,1,"huge workload but it's just busy work. Doesn't teach you anything about the class, rather just teaches you how to write a 20 page lab report full of junk in 2 days."
College Freshman,1,They are awful and love to get people in trouble. Do not bring a car here.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm reviewing on both social and academic aspects
Socially, GMU PD will SLAM you for underage drinking. Drinking is known to be an acceptable part of the college experience, but on Mason's campus it seems to be the highest of criminal offenses. And drug use? Don't even think about it! First-time offenders are suspended for AT LEAST a semester.
Academically, there seems to be a very loose honor code. Yes, they tell you it at the beginning of the semester of each class, but it seems to be very, very poorly enforced. 
An institution should be looking more at academic integrity rather than sniffing out dorm parties on Thirsty Thursdays. Shame on you Mason!"
College Sophomore,1,The offices involved with this at Mason are extremely unhelpful.

Junior,5,"All professors have been very patient and extremely helpful. Above having online courses, all other resources such as tutoring, have been extremely easy to work with."
Junior,5,"East Bay, even through a pandemic, has been very helpful and resourceful to all the students. I have enjoyed every single class as every professor has been great help. My experience overall has been amazing and I am very happy to be at CSUEB."
Senior,5,I have taken many online classes. The professors make the assignments really straight forward and easy to understand what is going on in class.
Freshman,5,"In today's society, online courses are widely used in colleges providing easy access to course materials, classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home. I've taken two online courses since I've been in college and have benefited from those classes. There are a few reasons to why I'm drawn to an online education course as opposed to taking courses in a traditional classroom setting. First of all, I have a full-time job, which limits my opportunities to attend classes scheduled during normal school hours. Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace. Finally, these classes offer more of a one-on-one teacher-student relationship rather than a teacher having to spread their focus amongst thirty other students."
Senior,5,"Very good !!! East bay also have online class, hybrid (half online, half in person) class. 
Science class come with lab class. But many general education classes can be taken online."
Niche User,5,I have received swift answers on all my inquires. I look forward to my transferring to the college and hope that I can by the Fall of 2021.
Niche User,5,East Bay offer the online program for me to master money. I am entering the Business: Finance area of study and look forward to the opportunities that are offered at my school of choice.
Sophomore,5,The later half of my spring semester was online and I had no problems using the resources given to me to communicate with my professors and advisors.
Alum,5,Online and hybrid classes. Organized. Teachers and staff are helpful and understanding. Quarterly system.
Alum,5,Online classes are easy to follow through. Very organized. Curriculum is pretty clear from the beginning.
Senior,5,"Personally, I like online classes better because I am typically introverted and better enjoy virtually learning, so I would say that the experience so far has been pretty good."
Senior,5,"At East Bay, we have an amazing, supportive community of students, professors, and staff.  In my experience so far, I have barely come across a staff member that gave me a difficult time; everyone has been very helpful to me."
Junior,5,I will tell you now that this school is underrepresented and should be seen as a diverse and welcoming institution. CSUEB has done well to ensure safety during the pandemic and has a great communication system to ensure students are not anxious by only having a few classes in person- such as field biology and test taking to ensure grades are true. I have gained research experience  because the professors understand the hardships that students are facing.
Junior,5,So far so good :) The pandemic has made me emit some ratings such as student life and campus food but before this all happened I felt very good about this school regardless (and even more so because of the price)
Junior,5,East Bay is an awesome school for getting in and graduating in a timely manner. The staffs are great and classes are easy to get into so I don't always get wait listed or have to worry about graduating late.

Alum,5,"The diversity at CSUEB is huge! I believe we were either 2nd or 3rd most diverse college within California. I love attending CSUEB because of the area I was living in, being close to the City of San Fransisco and being able to play College Water Polo at the university level. I was very grateful to have attended CSUEB because of my teachers and coaches who were all amazing. My advisors were great when it came down to scheduling my classes around my practices and games. Overall, I would recommend CSUEB to anyone who is looking for a school near a big city and getting a great education!"
Alum,5,"Personally, I much prefer taking my courses online. I was so grateful to have majored in something that I could complete both online and in class! Being an athlete at CSUEB, it was hard to make sure I wasn't late to class after practices or games. Having online courses made it that much easier to get home and hop online for class. I also loved online courses because I could do them (somewhat) at my own pace and be able to still have a social life and do things throughout my day!"
Senior,5,"Online learning is very accessible and doable. Some professors however will overcompensate on weekly activities, but it is doable. Most classes taken online I was able to receive an A grade. Don't miss any assignments."
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoyed my overall experience at East Bay. It was a nice commuter school, diverse groups of people living in the Bay Area, and my experience allowed me to build great relationships with faculty staff and colleagues. The new gym/fitness center is beyond exceptional, and everyone is happy to help out the newly admitted students answer any questions/concerns. The clubs and organizations are a great way to connect to peers and stay informed about school meetings/events."

Junior,5,"I transferred to CSUEB from another CSU this spring. And,  I am very impressed with the amount of attention and support I have received from the teachers and staff at this institution. The counselors are super knowledgable and very willing to help eased during this transition and major change.  The campus is on the smaller side which is great because I've been able to get into all of my required courses thus far. There are courses  are offered at a couple different locations as well so, if you live closer to the another campus location other than Hayward, you save on your commute."
Junior,5,I like the scenery people teachers i would like to see more halal/kosher meat to eat because my protein and iron intake is becoming less the longer i live on campus
Senior,5,The campus is very nice with a view looking over the bay. All the professors are nice and will push you to learn at your most highest level.
Senior,5,"It’s such a diverse campus , and people are so friendly . Only thing I’d complain about it the waitlist on some classes . Profesor’s here actually love their job and makes it easy to learn"
Freshman,5,"As someone who has been informed about how bad ""state"" schools are, it truly is not what it seems to be. State schools have been overlooked by ""name schools"" and have constantly received different forms of negative assumptions. East Bay, is one of the many state schools that is frowned upon. As a student who has recently been a part of East Bay's community, I have seen new lights and new opportunities for myself as a student who constantly works hard.  The academics, diversity, athletics, student life and food are all well-rounded. CSUEB and other state schools in California - deserves to be respected as a school that provides a chance for all students to achieve their goals and dreams."
Senior,5,Eastbay is a very good school and campus. Great professors and counseling  programs. Highly recommend.
Sophomore,5,I like the amount of resources available to the students and events such as workshops and career exploration. I’ve never had a problem finding and getting help in anything I had a question or concern about either.
Junior,5,"The teachers and counselors that I have encountered at CSUEB all really seem to care about student success and satisfaction. They help when needed and offer advice when requested. Overall, CSUEB is a great school."
Niche User,5,Very supportive school and I can't wait to attend this school after a college visit. This school focuses on getting people the support they need and also works on getting their students to graduate. I am very interested in the Music major and also the Nursing major.
Junior,5,"I like how the professors and academic counselors are very helpful. They were also very encouraging of the students when it comes to succeeding in their classes, as well as college in general."
Junior,5,"I love Cal State East Bay Concord, its very diverse and very open minded school. I love hoe convent it is from my house and work place."
Freshman,5,"Cal State East Bay is such a good school. It is filled with so many opportunities, so many nice people around you, a great view. The teachers are really nice and very supportive and try to understand you. It has a great view where you can see the city. It also has a food court, a lot of different things you can choose, a lot of snacks as well. Two different types of stores to buy snacks from. Very good staff too where you can ask them questions and they would gladly reply, no rude attitudes. Everyone is really friendly."
Junior,5,It's not busy and crazy and like in the city. You can see the entire bay from the school. Housing is good. I enjoy the school very much.
Sophomore,5,East bay is a great campus with amazing professors and help on campus. Whenever there was help you needed there was a place in the library to go to.
Freshman,5,What i like about East bay is the Majors they have especially that they have criminology and if that doesn't work out i will do photography as my other major. Another thing i like about this school is that it is in California and is close to San Francisco but also the diversity.
Freshman,5,Its a very friendly environment thier are always new people to meet as well as everyone is very friendly. The classes are small witch makes learning easier and the professors are very understanding and are clear to understand when they are teaching.
Freshman,5,Very diverse and the professors understand and are accepting of everyone compared to other CSUs. The campus was built on sacred Ohlone land and I am grateful to be able to attend.
Junior,5,The campus is very clean and the orientation that I attended was very informative. I was also able to meet with a counselor who sat with me and told me what kinds of classes I had to take. I really appreciate how I have been treated and helped so far.
Alum,5,"I loved East Bay. has a good campus life, and is also easy to commute to if you live nearby and want to attend from home. The faculty is great,  I loved every teacher I had during the duration of completing my degree. There was also good financial aid compensation in order to enable students of all backgrounds with the ability to attend."
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my two year at CSU East Bay. They have many online programs which makes it easy to work and go to school off campus. I live farther away form the university so being able to still attend their school has been a blessing. Their hospitality and recreation programs are very straight forward and are full of classes that I have enjoyed taking.
Junior,5,"With having no traditional HBCU in California, I was interested in doing my research on finding a school with the most diversity in the Bay Area, and I was lucky enough to find that at CSU, East Bay was the most diverse around. Being biracial makes it hard to find a sense of belonging, and I am thankful to have found that here."
Junior,5,"California State University is an exceptional four year institution determined to provide students with proper support and guidance associated with academia and finances. The professors, campus faculty, and other available resources go above and beyond to deliver assistance to scholars. The campus is high diverse and contains a fusion from students all around the world. CSUEB contains a wonderful environment that allows individuals to prosper."
Freshman,5,"I like how many resources you have while attending there and how eco-friendly the campus is. they have rental cars and a very good gym where you have yoga classes, workout rooms, and nap rooms. you get to see the bay area from the library and they phones out on the campus that immediately connects you to the police in case you don't feel safe."
Freshman,5,Everyone is friendly and I made lots of new friends. The school is very diverse and all of the students cares for each other. The campus is fairly medium sized which I like because all of the buildings are not that far away so you can just walk everywhere.
Graduate Student,5,"The professors at this state university are top notch.  They really care for their students.  As a graduate student, I don't get to experience student life on campus since I only attend classes at night.  The campus is beautifully maintained and they have an excellent platform ""Black Board"" for course communication which meets modern technology.  It would be nice if some of the food vendors stay open later for the night students.  And I think that parking should be discounted for students only attending classes at night."
Junior,5,CSUEB made me feel welcomed the moment I stepped into the campus. Not only is this a very diverse school and you get to know so many people it's a local school with easier access too. Theirs a lot of clubs and student activities that will make you feel a lot more connected to the students and staff. One of the many great things about the staff is that they are always there when you need them. Even if you don't have questions during office hours and want to get to know them better they are willing to listen to anything!
Sophomore,5,"There are many positive things at Cal State East Bay. The thing you notice as soon as you step on the campus is that it is very diverse. Everyone is accepted at Cal State Easy Bay regardless of their background. Another thing that's great at East Bay is that most professors truly care about your education. They're always there to help you understand the  material and are willing to help you. In my experience, all my professors have always cared about each student and their education. They don't mind repeating the same material a couple times in order for their students to fully understand it. If you want to go to a school where you want to feel safe, accepted, and where your education is the top priority, then Cal State East Bay is for you!"
Freshman,5,"East bay is a great school with tons of resources and help right on campus. I love the diversity and the welcomeness the school has to offer. If I had to change anything about CSU East Bay, it would be to offer more majors."
Senior,5,Whenever I have a question they are always there to answer and if they don't then they refer me to someone who can. Overall great!
Senior,5,"My favorite things about attending California State University, East Bay is the diversity and location."
Sophomore,5,Cal State East Bay in Hayward is one of the most diverse campuses you will step foot on. There are so many different clubs and activities to participate in and get all kinds of help and form communities with.
Freshman,5,CSUEB is an extremely diverse and inclusive campus. Its location is perfect for students wanting to be near the city while still being in an area that feel like home.
Junior,5,"Beautiful school in a city that is not too much compared to San Francisco over the bay bridge. Extremely diverse which is the best part because there's so much student life options available. Most of the dorms on campus are relatively new and nice. Many students are commuters from different parts all around Northern California. Professors are known here for being super kind, helpful and accommodating."
Freshman,5,My experience at East Bay is by far going amazing. It has become my home away from home. I the campus is wonderful and the professors are incredible.
Senior,5,"I really like that professors care about their students. The environment is relaxing, not too much hassle for the status of students."
Senior,5,"This was my first semester as a transferring returning student.  As an older student, it has been difficult juggling 16 units, a full time job and assisting in caring for my husband who is on dialysis.  However, the experience of being able to go to school and to study  from home and not have to commute or leave my husband has been awesome.  I can't wait to enter into the Master's Program."
Junior,5,So far my experience has been great. CSU East Bay has many more options for working adults. I have been able to work towards a degree fully online while I live and work full time in another area.
Niche User,5,when i went to see the campus i felt like i needed to go to this school. i want to be far but not so far from my family and cal state was the best choice.
Alum,5,"CSUEB is a fantastic option for students on a budget (time and money). My major was Health Sciences, I noticed a return on investment immediately upon graduation, as I was hired into the Healthcare industry. Teachers are incredible here and truly care about your education. Distance education is available as well for those who don't have the option to be in a classroom format. Again, I'd highly recommend!"
Senior,4,"East Bay is a pretty good school. I would recommend that people understand what classes they need to take and not to rely on counselors. People make mistakes and if you know what's going on, it will limit those mistakes."
Senior,4,"Very good !!! East bay also have online class, hybrid (half online, half in person) class. 
Science class come with lab class, so it can't be online. But many general education classes can be taken online."
Sophomore,4,"East bay is a great school, I would love to see a better line of communication and understanding between professors and students."
Sophomore,4,"We switched to online learning due to the pandemic once it was needed, and most professors were understanding and okay switching platforms, however other professors seemed like they made sure you struggled."
Senior,4,"I was a 2-year transfer from Socal to East Bay, the transition was overall good. Most of my professors were easy-going, taught well, listened to students' thoughts. The administration could be better out giving information out to students during fire season, for example, due to the air quality didn't know if the campus was open or closed."
Senior,4,"I have taken many online classes through East Bay, each had their own experience. The teachers, for the most part, were understanding and very communicative, however some were stricter meaning if you missed the deadline you missed the deadline. Other teachers let the online class have no due dates meaning most students procrastinated till the last minute."
Sophomore,4,"It definitely taught me more than your average classroom could. I learned how to properly identify important people to me and choose my passions. I am grateful for the experiences I've had with those around me and for those I no longer choose to keep in my life, I have learned much from them as well. I rate my experience a 4/5 because I definitely would have appreciated more school spirit. No football team/stadium = less fun during the fall semester."
Sophomore,4,"In all honesty, I expected online learning to be difficult, but all my professors were super understanding and willing to help us during our transition. I didn't have trouble reaching out to my professors when I needed help, and they all provided enough online material that remained accessible."
Alum,4,"While East Bay is a commuter school, and away from the city areas like Oakland and San Jose, I felt like the area was in a good place to find potential and explore what was around. The campus had done it's best to be school spirited, but when it did grab the attention of others, it would bring big crowds in."
Alum,4,"Learning experience was helpful, flexible, and beneficial. Our teachers would give us clear instructions to follow, but with a challenge to open our minds and ask more questions to grasp a deeper understanding."
Senior,4,"Great commuter school. Bang for your buck. If you find an academic enrichment group to join take full advantage. They were able to get me resources such as laptops, tutoring, financial assistance, scholarships, internships, and advising!"
Junior,4,I got used to the online curriculum before the sudden changes of in-person lectures to online. East Bay's IT support team was very kind and helpful to any problems you will encounter. The professors were very empathetic to our struggles with online so they are lenient when announcing due dates.
Junior,4,Cal State East Bay is a great place for local Bay Area students. It's an equal drive from my home and the college so that I don't have to pay for dorms. You also can't beat the view overlooking the entire bay from the hillside.
Junior,4,"My experience at east bay was rough in the beginning, I was on academic probation in my first semester being there. But if the help of my professors and my determination I was able to  stay at east bay for another 3 years. I love this school, its no stanford or private school, but in the end it like a second home where I share a ton of memories with my friends and family."
Freshman,4,"What I like about the school is the environment is nice and relaxing, but some of the buildings do need to be updated."
Freshman,4,"I love the Diversity of the students and faculty! The professors like to include the students within their lectures! However, a down side of CSUEB is their late responses to environment issues."
Junior,4,"Students who attend East bay come from all backgrounds and walks of life. Everyone Ive encountered has been really friendly and helpful. Students are constantly trying to help one another. Professors are a hit of miss, Ive been blessed with great professors so far and have learned a lot"
Junior,4,"I chose Cal State East Bay because it is close to home, and I wouldn't have extra bills living on campus. It is a great in diversity, it is a beautiful campus. I enjoy it very much. Very chill and everyone minds their business. The offerings and recourses are very helpful to help one succeed."
Niche User,4,"Overall the experience is great and they have a lot of things there that could accommodate everyone. They have many things around the campus that can be helpful if you ever just want to relax and destress. However, I don't know if this college is the right choice for me."
Senior,4,"California State University, East Bay is an extremely diverse school. A lot of the buildings are newly renovated, so the campus is beautiful and peaceful. CSUEB is mostly a commuter school so unless you live on campus or are extremely involved, you will only be there for class or meet with others for projects."
Junior,4,"Its a cool school. food isnt that great but it makes up in student life especially greek life. Dorms are great and big, very spacious."
Niche User,4,MY experience was great would definitely recommend this college. You don't feel out of place when you start and you can really connect with the students. There are plenty of opportunities to get to know you professors and it really became a second home.
Freshman,4,So far my experience at East Bay has been very good in regards to my first semester as a college student. The GE classes required are well planned and executed as a transition into college work loads and life as a student. The campus is well located on top of a hill making it safer for students being some ways away from the city where it is more dangerous at nightfall. The dorms are also quite comfortable as they are designed in an apartment style housing with keycards required to enter both rooms and buildings which I personally think is quite a well thought out design of the security system. The campus is close to downtown Hayward making it easy to out with friends to have some quality time and is also close to the BART station which is convenient for traveling around the bay as well as commuting for students who are currently not residing in the dorms. As one of the; or the most diverse campus' ipeople of all different kinds of cultural backgrounds.
Freshman,4,East bay is a really good school very open and nice.  I love the open space and its a nice distance from home. The people there make me feel at home and i just love it there the dorms are average an nice . East Bay has a good sports program  and the diversity in the school is great. The housing there is pretty good its nice and the game rooms are fun and nice and a cool spot to hang out. the extra help and the tutoring are nice. the office hours are very open.
Freshman,4,"When walking around the school, it is very spacious and the buildings are very well made. The faculty and the students are generally nice people and not much problems are made between them. The food there and the options around it is very good. There is nothing that would need changing at the moment."
Sophomore,4,"CSU East Bay is a good school in the Bay Area. The school is safe and for the most part the people who attend are very welcoming. In terms of school fees, the school is pretty expensive. It’s known as a commuter school but staying there is a good experience."
Alum,4,"The campus was diverse. We were uniquely located by many startups and tech companies;cultural and historical sites, and it made the learning experience relevant and actually applicable."
Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate the diversity at my university. I appreciate it because my whole life when growing up I have been surrounded by colored skin and I am used to that. And now that I am going to college, I am not uncomfortable with people around me on campus, it feels like the environment hasn't changed."
Junior,4,It is a good university. Great professors and the area is very accessible. Lots of opportunities for clubs and programs.
Senior,4,"My experience at CSU East Bay so far has been well. I would say that it's wonderful having professors care for their students and provide them the assistance they need in order to pass the class and further excel in their classes. I can't say that for all professors, but majority in this college help you succeed. The events in this school happen at least two to three times a month and the assistants who work through the events are very welcoming and majority of people are able to participate. I'm not so much of a party person, but my friends who do party seem to enjoy it ."
Graduate Student,4,"I appreciate how CSUEB is so close to home. My professors are highly educated and have the ability to enlighten and fulfill any educational needs students may have. The professors make themselves available through office hours, emails and zoom, an online video chat such as facetime or skype. As a working RN in the online MSN program I appreciate how the program tailors to the needs of a full time employee also going to school full time. I find the online courses to be convenient in that I am able to study and complete assignments at times that work best for me as a night shift nurse."
Junior,4,"Overall CSUEB, is nice school and has a lot of diversity on campus.  There tons of things that the campus set up  and there a clubs to join. Usually the first week there are clubs set up in front of the University Union. Depending on the major there is usually a 7-15 minute walk depending where the classes are. There is a trail that goes up a hill that gives a view of hayward and other things which is located in the back of Pioneer Heights near the second to last parking lot. I sometimes go there during sunset and it is beautiful. Also, the dinning commons has good food depending on the day but usually have the same almost everyday."
Freshman,4,"I really love our campus, it's not too big, it's not too small. Orientation team gave us a warm welcome. I also love the diversity we have here. We are basically at the top of a hill so we have breathtaking views of the whole bay area."
Sophomore,4,"This college is a very decent college. It has all the things one may think to look for in a college and them some. Everything is amazing however, the only thing I wish they would work on is the application process because when I was applying last year I experiences a few difficulties. It was very difficult to reach them on the phone and I was on hold for a very long time. That being said after they did answer the phone they were quite helpful. I would recommend this college to those who want a medium size population, decent food, interesting professors and who wants to meet new people."
Freshman,4,"It's an overall really great university, with really passionate professors who care about connecting with their students and helping them succeed."
Alum,4,"My professors made me feel heard and a part of the department, which is a feat considering how large the student body was. The resources and opportunities provided were ideal and I loved how accessible everything was. -1 Star because housing was extremely difficult to aquire on campus, and student life/communitu suffered because of this. The city of Hayward is on the rougher side, but the campus felt sectioned off into it's own little world. Definitely affordable and generous to low income or 1st generation students."
Senior,4,"This school that I am attending is an extension of the main campus, but overall it is safe and easy to get around. It is a very small and intimate setting, especially in having some of the same people in my classes within the realm of my major. Overall, it has been a pretty solid experience and I have learned a lot from the professors that were willing to help and be a resource."
Freshman,4,"So far I am liking what the school had to offer me in terms of academics. With a month before I start my freshman year. I do have at least a few things to look forward to before the school year begins. Despite its imperfections with the class enrollment process, I do look forward to the next chapter of my life and step onto campus for the first time."
Senior,4,"Good school! Great selection of courses! The transition from quarters to semesters was a little rocky, but the school was quick to have everything ready for fall 2019! Online classes are easy! Financial aid office is very helpful! On campus, living is expensive, yet fun to live in! Recommend for students who want to branch out and live on their own!"
Senior,4,"All of my four years at this university have been pleasant. The professors for the most part are very helpful, they teach the material very well and the university does a very great job of keeping their students involved and motivated. There are many resources that this university provides and it is very helpful in giving these resources out to their students"
Freshman,4,I like the diversity in the campus everyone is really nice and live around the bay area  there's places you can go and it's the center of the bay you can go almost anywhere !
Alum,4,"My experience was as a commuter student. I did not live on campus at any point, but I enjoyed my experience. I liked the diversity represented on campus and met many great people in my major. The student rec center was brand new when I attended and was well maintained. The campus is a bit hilly, but relatively easy to get around. There were also many social and cultural events as well as career fairs that were held on campus which was great! Not a big sports school so it won't have well attended sporting events. Greek life is present, but not super noticeable either. For day to day commuter student life, I enjoyed it."
Senior,4,"The professors are amazing and truly care about our education.  The class sizes are great and foster a wonderful learning environment.  The food is good, and the library is very nice and filled with quiet study areas.  I was also told by multiple professors that csueb is the most diverse school in the continental United States (second only to University of Hawaii)!  However, the administration and counseling departments are generally unhelpful (although after seeing 5 counselors, I have found an absolutely wonderful one), but generally speaking it is very frustrating to try to find out information.  Administration does not always respond to emails and phone calls in a timely manner, and it is helpful to speak in person.  You must start very early to try to find out enough information to accomplish your goals."
Senior,4,"As a transferring student who works full time and has many outside obligations CSU East Bay is a school that absolutely understands! They offer many enjoyable and insightful online classes. Not to mention, CSU East Bay is a beautifully located campus with great diversity."
Senior,4,"Everyone is friendly and the diversity is amazing. My advisers are responsive and always helpful. I would like more classes to be offered online. I had to change my major from accounting to finance to switch to the online program. Even thought the same classes are available online for business, if you are enrolled on campus (not the online program) you cannot take these business classes. It forced me to go completely online when they changed to the semester system this past academic year. I miss the on campus experience."
Junior,4,"The east bay campus is very diverse and very  cultured. It used to be quarter system,  but now it's converted to semester.  Personally,  I prefer quarterly because it fast pace so you can finish all your classes faster."
Freshman,4,The one thing that I would like to be changed at this school is that they have a very low graduation rate. The reason for this is because the average person who comes here takes about 5-6 years to graduate. I think that all students should be given help in order to graduate in 4 years.
Sophomore,4,"California State University East Bay is a college where you can easily adapt to. There are many resources on campus such as academic advising, clubs, tutors, counseling, and medical help. The professors are easy to talk to and are usually always available when you need them. The courses move along according to the course syllabus so I strongly advise you to follow your course syllabus so you don't fall behind."
Freshman,4,"What I like about California State University - East Bay is the diversity and the support. There is many people that care and want to help. Furthermore, the campus is really easy to get around and get use to where everything is located. The only complain that I have is having one Starbucks because the line gets very long."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, before I went to East Bay I thought it would be bad. After seeing it first hand I saw it was really different. The people there are very social and making friends is pretty easy. Classes are simple at first but get harder after a while but are still pretty understandable. Its a small campus so getting around is easy and you could honestly walk by a person you know all the time."
Freshman,4,"It has been a great ride so far as a freshman at East Bay. The large takeaway here is that the people in charge truly care about your education and success. East Bay institutes a class of people who have the same major as you and in doing so, make connections and collaborations among peers. However, the image of East Bay can lack, as it grasps the idea of only being a commuter college with somewhat deteriorating buildings and lack of cleanliness."
Sophomore,4,"Overall there are aspects to the campus life and quality of living at the dorms at CSU East Bay that could be improved, but for the most part the housing department does what they can to ensure our safety."
Junior,4,This is my first semester at Cal State East Bay and it has been a good experience so far. The campus is easy to navigate and find classes and facilities. The professors here are exceptional. Many go the extra mile to accommodate student needs and to see them succeed. I have no regrets choosing this university over San Jose State.
Niche User,4,This school isn't too big but its the perfect size for a person who came from a small school district. The weather isn't the best but the campus is very pretty and there are a lot of places you can go visit on your free time.
Junior,4,"This is my first year at CSUEB and I love that it is affordable, local and flexible with their academics because some degrees can be earned online or on campus. This campus is beautiful up in the Hayward Hills with the view of the SF Bay.  The only thing I would change about this school is lowering the all-day parking permit prices and even the semester parking passes.  So far I like being a Pioneer. 

Jessica"
Junior,4,"I actually really enjoy being at this school, I love my field of study and the teachers I've had so far have been mostly great. I hate how parking passes cost more and tuition is up the roof."
Senior,4,"CSU East Bay is the best university you can go to if you live near the Bay Area. The professor there are nice and they just recently transferred into a semester system so classes time are shorter but will last longer. The only thing I would change is their financial aid office, they make a lot of mistakes on a lot of students applications causing their financial aid to be delay."
Junior,4,"The campus is nice and the views you get can be even nicer. Classes I've had so far have been chill, interactive and interesting"
Alum,4,"The diversity of the population is this university’s greatest aspect. With a wide array of faculty, staff, and student ethnicity, anyone attending this school will gain a wide array of perspectives and knowledge. Moreover, the services available on campus will help any willing, hard-working student succeed in their time at Cal State East Bay. Be aware though, as with many institutions, there are drawbacks. One drawback of East Bay would be their financial aid department, and the setbacks that occur on a regular basis."
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at Cal State East Bay, majoring in Health Science, pre-clinical preparation. The campus at East Bay is very small which makes classes enjoyable because I see familiar faces everywhere I go. Most professors, especially in the upper division major classes, truly care about helping their students succeed. I have established positive relationships with numerous professors, allowing me to feel comfortable asking them for help with obtaining a successful future for myself."
Sophomore,2,"The housing is sub-par at its best, the food in the dining hall is decent. The education there is very mediocre. Most of the professors are just lecturers who got hired and don't know what they are doing. There are of course some very wonderful professors who teach there but from my experience, they are few and far between."
Sophomore,2,"When things break here, they stay broken. The computers are all old and never maintained correctly. They freeze, are not updated, and students cannot complete their work. Computer administrators are a bunch of students that come and go, and nothing gets done. The campus is falling apart with old buildings, and water fountains that contain high amounts of lead. The campus is too crowded and no place to study."
Sophomore,2,I feel very discouraged at this campus. The counselors aren't interested in hearing you out and I felt very ignored when I sought their help.
Sophomore,2,they take a long time to help with classes. The events held on campus are advertised but no one ever goes. A good amount of sororities and fraternities but their events suck.
Junior,2,"It was hard to get the classes I needed to graduate. As a transfer student, I was given a late registration date and could not get all of the classes I needed in order to graduate. Teachers are not that good. Would have been better if there were online classes for business majors."
Junior,2,"Definitely a commuter school, so only come here if you just live nearby for the sake of convenience. Most people come here to save money (especially if they already have a job here). There are a few remodeled buildings but I'm not sure why they can't spend the money to remodel the school library. Lack of study spots and loud students mean that you're probably won't be able to study on campus. However, the workers here are surprisingly dedicated to their jobs and will go above and beyond to help you. 
A lot of the professors here genuinely care about their students and want to help you, so make connections with them! Letters of recommendations are very easy to come by here. Some of the professors care more about teaching than anything else here. 
Also, come here if you're a computer science major and you don't want to take the Physics requirement! But make sure to check local community colleges to see which courses you can take over there before taking upper division courses here."
Freshman,2,the school is ok they're financial aid sucks and they don't answer or reply right away. they have a lot of issues to fix
College Sophomore,2,Most of the people in fraternities and sororities are jerks
College Sophomore,2,I don't approve one of my previous professors and I hate one.
College Freshman,2,"The Dining Commons food is terrible. As for freshmen dorms, they are susceptible to cockroaches and spiders. Not worth your money."
College Sophomore,2,They aren't really good at sports
Recent Alumnus,2,"In the Master's program, you are discouraged from taking more classes than you ""need.""  The advisers blame financial aid, but it since it does not cost more to take more classes, this response is disingenuous. Certainly, it is the campus that does not want to fork out the extra expense. As a philosophy student who entered the Master's program, I wanted to take as many anthropology classes as possible. I am not allowed to do that. Shame on this institution. Obviously, they care more about money than having the best educated graduate students. Shame on the dept. for acquiescing to the administration and this deplorable rule."
College Junior,2,I've never noticed we had team
College Freshman,2,"I tried getting into one. Got the bid and became a pledge. The commitment was too much and I felt tied down. I don't wan to see the same people everyday especially since I like my alone time. and I don't want to be forced to remember everyone's sister name, pledge class, big sister, little sister, and other BS that doesn't benefit to me."
Recent Alumnus,2,I received a scholarship and the financial aid office took a long time to process it so I ended up getting dropped from my classes. It was a hassle because it was not my fault that the office did not do their job quick.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There isn't much to do in Hayward. There are also are parts that are not the safest. From what I've seen, most of the city is pretty run down."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unless your getting a loan, receiving financial aid is a huge hassle at East Bay. All my attempts for work study, scholarships and grants were exercises in futility."
College Freshman,2,"The DC is the worst place to eat. The plates are sometimes dirty, the food is not fresh, and the staff is sub par. There is actually a petition that is going around to make the DC change how they're running things and to take better care of the food."
College Junior,2,"Not too sure because I do not live in Hayward, and I commute, but it seems like the area outside of the school is the hood."
College Junior,2,"An absolute headache! After receiving an estimate my freshman year, I ended up receiving nothing back even after all the trouble. Just some of my personal experience with FA, I dealt with a lot of run a round, a lot of back and fourth to end up getting nothing in the end."
College Junior,2,"Being that Hayward is pretty quiet and quaint, theres not too many opportunities for parties. You create your own experience at East Bay; make it worth your wild!"
College Senior,2,"Hayward does not allow greek houses. Greeks don't seem to treat non-greeks any differently. The chapter members seem more diverse on this campus. Its worth it to join and get involved, greeks have lots of events on campus for members."
College Senior,2,It is not very organized and does not have much variety. They are always out of food and is not up to par with other campuses
College Freshman,2,"I understand that the campus food in the DC has rotations so there are leftovers for about a few weeks, that's why the variety is so little. It is very rare to find something good in the DC that is not a sandwhich, grilled or salad. The prices for the meal plans are ridiculous. They change it almost every quarter to try and improve it but it just gets worse. A friend of mine was on the unlimited plan and they changed it this spring quarter. They told her that if she wanted to stay on the unlimited then she had to pay another $500. Never choose the unlimited. You think you'll be in there a lot but you wont be.

I suggest taking the one with the least amount of swipes for the DC so you can have the most flex dollars to by panda or subway"
College Freshman,2,the School's Wi-Fi should be extended because the connection is very poor. even with an Ethernet cable the connection is bad.
College Senior,2,An internship can be time consuming. Should have 10 hours extra per week. Commitment is a plus because grad schools love seeing commitment and a person who is responsible
College Sophomore,2,"I currently am taking classes and tranferring soon.  The classes are okay, but I was put into a track in which i have absolutely no interest because I was told it was the only one available.  I don't like that they have a track system if they are unable to accommodate students interest.  Some of the courses I was required to take I hated, but I had not choice and was told I could not swap them out. My major is English, they put me on a environmental science track, it made no sense."
College Freshman,2,I honestly do not know. I don't affiliate myself with that.
College Junior,2,"There are very few things to do in Hayward. Once you leave the city though you are connected to many vibrant places such as Berkeley and San Francisco where museums, shopping, sports, and friendly individuals are prevalent."
College Junior,2,There are very few options for off campus dining. Most of the restaurants are out of the price range of college students and offer hours that do not coincide with a night life.
College Freshman,2,"Technically I am a business major right now. But CSU East Bay has the cluster program so no matter what your major is, you are put in a random cluster that you have a slight say in. Right now I'm in the Earth Crisis cluster which actually helped me decide that I want to change my major to Environmental Studies, but I know many students who hate it because it has nothing to do with their major. For example, my friend wants to be a biologist and she is in the Psychology Cluster. So he classes are based around psychology, just like mine are based around the environment. Luckily, we are only in this program for Freshmen year."
College Freshman,2,"Instructors do not give a damn here in the class, and if you go to their office hours, they are not in their office once out of every two times."
College Freshman,2,"Have not had an internship yet, but there are not many internships available for STEM major students."
College Freshman,2,It is really hard to find a place to park. This is a commuter school and less than ten precent of the student population live on the campus.
College Freshman,2,"It is so nice to be in the Bay Area, but this school is nothing but a waste of time and money. The quality of the education is extremely poor, and the dorm life is horrible (The Pioneer Heights is even worst than a prison!)."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, you are stuck on top of this hill. And if you have a car, you should drive to San Jose or San Francisco to have some fun. Hayward is nothing but a ghost town."
College Freshman,2,Poor quality of education. Horrible faculty. The instructors just don't care.
College Freshman,2,"The one thing which you think about Greek life is partying, but our school's rules makes it impossible to party."
College Freshman,2,The network is overloaded and our school's funding only allows for low quality equipment.
College Junior,2,its like high school drama for the pledges.
College Freshman,2,"I could never find parking, it takes me about half an hour just to find parking. "
College Senior,2,"Its really hard to get classes.. waitlists are easier to get on. Those go up to 50 people. If there were more teachers, and more classes it would make it THAT much better. Class blocks don't usually start until 1200 noon, and stop at 1800. There is nothing earlier and nothing later... there are three classes within that timeframe... that's it. and it sucks and makes the program harder to finish."
College Freshman,2,The cost of a parking permit is horrible. It is way too much money to spend on something you only need for a few hours. 
College Freshman,2,"The school needs to get rid of ""checking in"" hours because it has gone to the point where your own parents cant visit you at your dorm that they are paying for because it is past a certain time. Also, the RA's are pointless. They are rude to people. "
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid is horrible! It takes so long to receive your financial aid and on top of that, they don't even tell you when you received it. You have to go up the FA office to check on your status."
College Junior,2,No one really cares about the athletics at this school.
College Freshman,2,Parking sucks. There's too many lots and never any parking.
College Sophomore,2,"Not many different types of guys all either seem to be really fit and stupid or preppy, stuck up, know it all jerks. There are some exceptions but not many."
College Senior,2,Did not receive enough aid. Always a very slow response time.
College Junior,2,"It is very difficult to find a parking spot if you don't start class until 10:00 or 11:00 am. It is almost impossible, actually. After 12:30 pm, parking is a breeze. The cost of the permit is excessive."
College Junior,2," There is a required internship that all students must complete but there doesn't seem to be any hospitals, clinics, or community health centers that are partnered with CSUEB within 20 miles of my home. It is going to be very difficult to actually complete this internship and move on through the major."
College Junior,2,"The health sciences program is okay but there seems to be a lot of busy work. It is kind of understandable that there will be a lot of busy for a major with a student body of over 500 students, but after a while it can become mind-numbing. My career goal is to become a sonographer, but this major is my fall back option."
College Junior,2,"This is a commuter school. No one here is under the illusion that CSUEB is hub of activity with copious school spirit. Most of the students here live off campus and work either full or part-time, so there isn't much time to just ""hang out"" with other students on the fly."
College Junior,2,"The registration process is horrible, although I imagine this is the case for many Universities these days. The workload is not too bad. Some popular study areas are psychology and business."
College Junior,2,They do not have a football team. Enough said. Also they do not have many varieties of sports in general.
College Freshman,2,"No one pays attention to the sports at our school, they might as well not be there. I don't like that the athletes get priority when signing u p for classes either."
College Junior,2,"It is very confusing so it would be helpful to see a counselor to make sure everything is in order. On MyCSUEB they have a checklist on with documents you need to submit but it is sometimes not accurate. Before freaking out on what you are missing, it is critical to seek advice from multiple sources. You will probably get the run around but if you stay on it, it will get done. Once you get it, it is easy to use it toward tuition and books."
College Junior,2,"There are a variety of people at the school but in my opinion, it lacks in the ""hottie department."" I wish there was more of a sophistication with the guys but many dress juvenile and like they rolled out of bed. If you are a guy, you will be pleased with the girls. They are sweet, spunky, and cute, like me...lol."
College Junior,2,On campus housing is very limited and expensive. The area around the college is very intimidating. There are some apartment complexes surrounding the college but are VERY expensive. Try to stay close to campus or else you get into more of the dangerous areas of the town.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking can be extremely had on campus, so when I find a good parking spot I'm definitely hesitant to give it up. Living in the freshman dorms its the hardest I believe because the gym parking lot is always packed which leaves you no option but to park in the last parking lost behind the upperclassmen dorms, which can be an extreme struggle when you have tons of book or groceries."
Recent Alumnus,1,I didn't even know until last week we had pools. We don't have a football. I have only met about 3 people in the year I have gone there that play sports. I never hear anyone talking about our school sports. There is no spirit in our school sports.
College Sophomore,1,I would like to transfer
College Sophomore,1,There is not a lot.
College Sophomore,1,I hate living in the dorms.
College Freshman,1,"This school is awful, don't live on campus, if you're from southern California coming here could be the worst decision ever."
College Freshman,1,"Not a party school. I mean it. This school is a small little chat school with great education but parties are nonexistent here. We have frats and sororities but there are no parties. Everything cracks in San Jose, Berkeley, and San Francisco."
College Freshman,1,No one is really social. Housing has a strict policy on guest. Anybody past 11pm on weekdays can't have guest over. Yes that means a friend from the next dormitory across from you. As freshman you live with 8 people. There is a small amount of double bed rooms for sophomores and up. So register for housing the first hour the contract opens up. I'm serious. Not a party scene in the dorms. Can't play loud music and no guest
College Senior,1,Having to share a room and paying full price
College Freshman,1,"I have bad social skills and i'm not very good at making new friends so when I was able to bond and get along with all my roommates I felt very happy....but at the beginning of the quarter my roommate moved out into a single because she didn't feel comfortable around so many roommates. This was no problem like I get how she feels but since she moved out and she didn't want to live here the school is trying to either make me pay an extra 2,000 dollars to stay where I live now or I would have to move. This rule is really unfair to me and it posses as a big inconvenience at this time of the year. Cal State East Bay should have notified me earlier not around the time we take midterms; how my roommate was or wasn't able to adapt to new situations should not affect me this largely."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process was a huge headache. There's only like two people who check all the paper work and it takes time to receive your financial aid but the good thing is that they don't drop you out of your classes depending on the situation.
College Junior,1,"I spend most of my time in the library when I'm on campus-- I wish the quiet study areas were quieter, but students can be rude: what are you going to do?

There's a few places to hang out, mainly around the buildings; no large and spacious areas, though.

Overall, my experience at this school has been very lonely. I don't know if it's because it's a commuter campus and everyone seems to be coming from somewhere else (Stockton, Antioch, Tracy), or because people don't really care, but it is difficult to make friends here. In free moments before and after class people are literally glued to their cell phones. After class is over, people are in a mad dash to leave.

The best thing to do if you go here is to make sure that you already have friends. It seems like many people that go here came with their friends from high school, or with all of their cousins; some also went to the high school down the street, Moreau. You might also make friends if you're super, super outgoing, or if you join one of the Greek organizations (but with those, you have to be a certain type of person). Perhaps it has just been my experience there, but I haven't made any of the close relationships that people hope to make in college. As a Black female who is seen as ""weird"" by other Black people, I feel out of place, and so don't fit in there; I guess I also don't possess the typical interests that a college student is supposed to have, and so, like I said, it's difficult to meet people.  

Overall, it seems to me that coming to this school seeking out a campus with an active social scene is not a good idea. This school seems to be geared towards those who want to come to school, go to class, and then go back to their hometowns right afterwards. Any sense of a community is nonexistent here."
College Junior,1,"Speaking from experience, only join a sorority if you are the ""sorority-type"", and you know what I mean. If not, you will feel extremely lonely and out of place. Trying to join a sorority, like I did, to find friends is a bad idea. I'm pretty sure you'll be looked at is a freak if you're not into drinking, partying and random hookups."
College Senior,1,Its a commuter school so not many people are around. Frats have parties but they are pretty small.
College Sophomore,1,"The freshman barely have any freedom, it's actually pretty annoying."
College Freshman,1,I wouldn't know i drive
College Freshman,1,I honestly don't know since I'm a commuter and i do not like to go out and party.
College Freshman,1,"CSUEB is full of fat and ugly girls, who are here only and only for studying!"
College Freshman,1,Parties? There are not parties here! This is like a Christian children's camp! You are not allowed to party here!
College Freshman,1,"Extremely unhealthy, and very expensive foods and meal-plans!"
College Freshman,1,There is no student life in CSUEB; this school is the most boring school to go to!
College Freshman,1,This is probably the only school in California in which you can not party at!
College Freshman,1,"I think they forgot to name this place California State University Catholic School!

You can not invite friends, you can not party, you can not drink, you can not play your music, et cetera. Inmates have more freedom in a prison camp, than students in CSUEB!"
College Freshman,1,"We can not throw even a small party here! There is no way to get laid and have sex in the Pioneer Heights The Housing rules are horrible; they remind of a children Bible camp!

The quality of the food is equivalent to a high school cafeteria at the price of Applebees. 

The RA's are super-annoying! To the extent that they do not allow us to use our front sliding doors! The Housing staff are extremely incompetent. They separate the European residents from the rest of the residents, due to the successful parties of the past.

The internet cuts out every single evening. They make Housing residents pay for parking.

During Fall and Spring quarter they keep the temperature too high in the dorms."
College Junior,1,no communication and just a pain. the worst
College Senior,1,"There IS NO off campus parking... parking is mostly in the big parking lot which is all the way on the other side of the school. There is usually no parking. You WILL spend 20 min looking for parking. Parking is $2 and hour. QUARTERLY parking permits are $160... parking tickets for no permits or daily parking passes are $49.
In a nut shell: parking is monopolized by the school, expensive and EXTREMELY hard to get."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing in Hayward. The only thing interesting is the school and the off-campus apartments.
College Freshman,1,"No one knows of a basketball, football, or even volleyball game. They don't even announce it. The only time people hear of it is when its already over. I think that needs to be changed because I would love to go to a basketball game; if only I knew when and where."
College Freshman,1,The school is slow and don't keep you updated. You have to bug then in order to get any information about it.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office is unhelpful. They don't give you any advice on how to deal with financial problems. You are basically on your own. You have to pry and pry in order to get any help. 
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are very strict, no one is allowed in the dorms that is not a resident past 8 o' clock. People can come in but they have to sign in and leave by a certain time. Even your parents have to sign in if they wanted to come up and see your room for a second. No overnight guest unless approved by suite mates and by the school at least 48 hours in advance. I know of private schools that have less strict dorm rules than we do."
College Sophomore,1,"Being a commuter campus there are a lot of people who drive,  a large parking lot but they all fill up fast. Also parking permits are really expensive and you have to pay by the quarter."
College Junior,1,"As a photography major, my dream was diminished but the photography professor, not only was he rude, but unjust. He even went as far as to ridicule one of my photographs in front of the entire classroom. Worst of all was the fact that he did not give many students attention when they needed help."
College Junior,1,"Getting financial aid at CSUEB is a nightmare! The workers at the financial aid office are rude and not very helpful. The first year I attended this school, I applied for FASFA and checked back with the financial aid office in due time. They told me that I did not receive any aid. The summer after that school year, I was told that they lost my financial aid and that they owe me money. It is very frustrating dealing with the people in the financial aid department. There is always a huge line you have to wait in to get help with your aid and once they do help you, they often send you to someone else and then you have to wait in another huge line, just for someone else to be curt with you. Getting assistance or questions answered is a dreadful experience."
College Junior,1,"The best thing they have going for them is the jamba juice restaurant located on campus. However, for student like me who are vegan or vegetarian there are almost no options and the ones that they have are very poor. Also I live about 2 hours away from the school so I must fill up before I get to school and make a lunch/snack etc. otherwise I will starve as the options are less than satisfactory to me. They have panda garden, cafeteria food and subway on campus. If you like this kind of food then you'll be in heaven!"
College Junior,1,The places on campus does not offer the best food. In order to have a great college experience the food should be fantastic. All of our food places on campus are contracted by Aaramark which means the quality of food on campus can be a lot better. The dining hall has improved over two years as far as what is served there is always different varieties of foods. I would not recommend having a large meal plan the smaller the meal plan the more flex dollars.
College Sophomore,1,parking can be hard to find because there is a lot of students on camps
College Junior,1,"All I have to say is good luck! It is so hard to find parking and you can easily spend 45 minutes to an hour to find a spot. I recommend giving yourself at least an hour. Even for early classes, parking is a pain. Even though the parking permits are $130, it is worth it because the daily parking permits range from $4-6 daily and there is usually a line at the machine. If you do not have a pass, expect a ticket. Campus cops are ticket happy. However, the Concord has more than enough parking and is never a problem no matter what time of day it is."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process can be a hassle and most of the time if you call to regard any financial aid questions, you went go through because of all the people and the lack of workers. I was just given loans for financial aid which is very stressful. I suggest going in person to the financial aid office for any questions and applying to scholarships."
College Senior,1,"the baseball team is good, but who likes baseball?"
College Sophomore,1,That is the one downside here.  If you live on campus without a car and cash you are pretty much stuck with hanging with you dorm buddies.  If you can be creative and able to get along with your floor mates as well as your dorm mates you can enjoy yourself but it does get boring quick.
College Sophomore,1,Don't get fooled by the food they serve at orientation. Its a trick and once you attend her its horrible
College Junior,1,"Besides the social smoking, there has only been a couple of instances where I have seen students actually come to class intoxicated. Teachers don't notice, but the only reason it was visible to me was because they were talking about it near me. The times that I've seen students intoxicated was because they were nervous about a presentation."
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are $130 every quarter for only 3 months, that is way to expensive, parking should be more affordable. For sure you have to arrive early before class to find a good parking, sometimes you end up parking far away from class."
College Sophomore,1,Sigma Delta Upsilon is the only real fraternity on this campus. There is no greek housing and a weak greek council system. Join Sigma Delta Upsilon fraternity if you go here because they are the best fraternity on this campus.
College Freshman,1,"Okay so the nightlife is very poor. If you are 21 or over, you can drive about 30 -40 minutes away to San Francisco to go to the club. There are also 18+ clubs in San Francisco too. In the city of Hayward though, there is nothing to do unless you have friends that throw good house parties but other then that your best bet is to drive 40 minutes to San Francisco. Hayward is a boring city."
College Junior,1,"Hayward is not a safe place to go out at night especially if you are a female. I'm here for an education, not to party."
College Freshman,1,"There isn't a huge athletic program at CSU East Bay and the school spirit is extremely low. East Bay is I believe in Division III so watching the games isn't really fun. In my own opinion, the only college sport I am interested is, is football and we do not have a football program here at East Bay. If you are thinking of attending East Bay for athletics I suggest taking a look at another school nearby such as Berkeley or SJSU"
College Sophomore,1,There isn't really anything unique around the city. The dining options are very average and there are quite a few of them too. There are a couple of good ones but you do have to have a car to get to those places because this school lives up a hill.
College Senior,1,"They lack communication within their own office; one person tells you one thing while another tells you something completely different. They take forever to help you, then they don't update you on your aid when it's finally processed but claim they will."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We are a small campus with a very big parking. The disadvantage, the parking permit is so expensive!!"
College Junior,1,"Way to Expensive – The parking is $180 dollars a quarter, and there are not enough spots."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There was not enough parking for normal day time classes, you often have to follow someone who looks like they are leaving to steal their spot."
College Senior,1,"Proximity to Oakland Exemplified – The majority of people on campus dress, speak, and act as though they belong in a rap music video."
College Junior,1,"Unless you live in town with your friends, the town of Hayward is pretty flavorless. There are a handful of good places to eat, but since this is a commuter college, I'd say make your own food or commute back home. Other than that, there is virtually nothing appealing about this town."
College Freshman,1,There is a very few chance of finding off-school housing in Cal State East Bay. It is even harder to find help on compus. There is no near parking unless you pay for the Parkin Permit.
College Freshman,1,Parking at CSUEB is a crisis. The parking structure of the school is terrible. They also give out many parking citations and a parking permit is too expensive. $130 for 1 quarter?
College Senior,1,"I've had some the worst experiences parking at Cal State East Bay. The school administration approved a multi-level parking garage, but a local judge didn't approve the construction due to the environmental impact it would have. Parking fees are outrageous. You'll end up paying $150.00 dollars for a permit. Ticketing is dismal too. If you forget to purchase a parking permit, it will cost you over 60 bucks. Luckily, you have the option of contesting the ticket."
College Freshman,1,"The Greeks Aren't Thriving – Unfortunately, the Greek life is not noticeable on campus. I wish the Greek Life had more to do with the campus and the social events around the campus. The Greek students are like the non- Greek students. The Greeks do not dominate anything. They do stand out because they wear their Greek attire, but not because any other reason."
College Freshman,1,Computers are available in the library and computer lab but there needs to be more. We also have to pay 10 cents per sheet that we print or photocopy and that's unfair.
Niche User,1,"Dorm Life – The Dorms at East Bay are very expensive and they were not clean when we moved in the dorms. There are 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 shower rooms, a kitchen and a living room with 8 girls. Overall the dorms very social and you meet more people but it is too expensive and we only have basic cable and for 11 thousand dollars we should have the movie channels also."

Sophomore,5,Sonoma State gave me some of the best experiences I’ve ever wanted and friends as well.  The Financial Aid Department could get better at its timelines of getting back to everyone and loans but despite that everything is great. All the faculty I have met is great and very accommodating. After a while you find your place and you find what you like to do and what to do in a town like Rohnert Park and if you like to get your nails done I recommend Rohnert Park Nail Salon.
Alum,5,"Sonoma State is a great school! The professors in my department really helped me in landing great internships, write great recommendations letter and were always available when I needed extra help in office hours."
Alum,5,"Sonoma State is a great school! The professors in my department really helped me in landing great internships, write great recommendations letter and were always available when I needed extra help in office hours."
Sophomore,5,Sonoma is a great college! I highly recommend. The professors are wonderful and small classes. The dorms are very good and clean.
Senior,5,"I enjoyed the faculty, my fellow students, and the gorgeous campus. Every person there has a positive attitude, and the teachers help foster the intellectual curiosity of everyone attending. Never once have I been let down by a professor, and felt I had a personal relationship with all of them. A truly gorgeous experience, and a place with a real sense of community."
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful. You can explore nature without stepping off the campus with lakes, mini forest, even a creek flowing through the grounds. The professors are for the most part approachable and understanding of life situations. The largest classes are about 100 people but those are just general classes. Most classes average about 20-40 students. The campus life such as greek life and clubs are very active and and friendly, and there are so many to choose from. Dorms are beautiful and maintenance, like when something happens,  gets on the problem quickly. Night life is mostly for those 21 and older. Most places close early but there are many yummy restaurants around. As an alum overall I had a wonderful experience with the campus and surrounding area."
Freshman,5,Sonoma state has a beautiful campus and the dorms are amazing. The campus life could be a bit better because there’s  not much to do outside of classes. The campus is pretty safe for the most part. I would highly recommend this college.
Alum,5,"I live locally in Sonoma. Sonoma State University is the local State school for this county. This school was established in the early 1960s. Currently this school is amazing during natural disasters, such as, 2017 wildfires and the current COVID19. They made sure the safety of students are first priority."
Sophomore,5,The environment of this college institution is amazing! their is something to do every single week. Anyone can easily start to get involved in the community or find a club or organization to join and feel like they are doing something good!
Sophomore,5,I have found my home away from home within Sonoma State University! It's a beautiful campus and there are many ways that one could get involved.
Junior,5,Sonoma State University is a wonderfully diverse and invested college that’s absolutely beautiful and a great experience. Their professors deeply care about their subjects as well as their students.
Niche User,5,"A beautiful school in a beautiful area surrounded by wine country, pretty good professors and an internationally recognized wine management program. Not to mention the school is only 40 minutes away from San Francisco and only 30 minutes from the beach!"
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the scenery of Sonoma State and the people are very friendly. I really hope Sonoma State had a football team but besides that I recommend anyone who's planning on attending Sonoma State University to do so. You won't regret your decision.
Sophomore,5,While at my time in Sonoma State I had a great time it was an enriching environment and has a beautiful campus
Junior,5,Just transferred to SSU from Mendocino College. So far my experience has been excellent and can’t wait to start my classes.
Sophomore,5,"super super super great! i love it so much! ten out of ten, would recommend to any high school seniors!"
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus. Small, warm and welcoming. Very good one on one experience with the teachers because of the small classroom sizes. I have also never seen bigger dorms on a college campus. Great public transit and campus life."
Niche User,5,I went and visited the campus last summer and it is the most beautiful school I have ever seen. It felt so serene and relaxed. I could absolutely see myself studying there.
Senior,5,My experience here at Sonoma State has been an amazing  4 year journey of growth and finding my purpose. Some of these amazing experiences were influenced by me getting involved in the leadership avenue. This strengthen the bonds of community and connections with other students and faculty that really support  me. What I wish to see is more diversity within faculty in classroom. Which I believe  would established a sense of welcoming more diverse students  groups.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, lots of trees and space to walk, and the buildings are great to look at. There are lots of things to do on campus like the rock wall or swimming or fishing which is a lot of fun. And the dorms are some of the nicest I have ever seen. The only thing I would change is having more availability for a more flexible schedule, I could only find afternoon classes to fit the classes I needed to take."
Senior,5,"Sonoma State University offers a community for students who like to put their academics first. The business department is full of teachers who want to help get you to the next level of your career and give you proper guidance as your pursue your dreams. There are also a bunch of other support systems for students to take advantage of. I think that Sonoma State stands a part from other campuses due to its hometown feel. The university is on the smaller side, so it is easy to make a lot of friends within your major (which really helps with networking if you can maintain these relationships into your career). I was lucky enough to transfer into Sonoma State after experiencing two years at a junior college, and the transition was very easy as the university allowed the proper resources to do so. Overall, as I head into my final semester, I hope that others can experience all that I have been able to during the time I called myself a seawolf."
Graduate Student,5,"great wine business program: well-connected, solid niche education, great faculty with top wine experts. safe campus, although far from big city."
Alum,5,"Sonoma State has a beautiful campus.. There are many dorms that are very new, with a lot of modern features. Try to avoid the older dorms if possible.
There have been so many new buildings like the new Student Center and the beautiful Green Music Center. One area that can be improved is the diversity of the student body."
Senior,5,I just transferred this past year and I enjoyed it greatly. Everyone is so welcoming and helpful. I didn't have a car and the public transportation was great. I can't wait for this upcoming school year.
Graduate Student,5,"top in the country for wine business. very passionate educators, great learning environment, very well connected for future opportunities. overall great experience!"
Alum,5,I loved Sonoma State! My undergrad experience was amazing and walking on campus was always peaceful! I would maybe change more emphasis on athletics and spreading money to more than academics.
Senior,5,I like that there’s a great student body at school and professors are great. Academics are challenging yet rewarding. The only thing that needs improvement is advising. It would be better if advising with counselors was more than just 10 minutes.
Freshman,5,Very goood Very goood Very gooodVery gooodVery gooodVery gooodVery gooodVery gooodVery gooodVery goood
Freshman,5,I love everything about Sonoma. I knew I was going here the moment I stepped on the campus and could see myself thriving here. The scenery is hard to deny because of how beautiful it is. It is a tight-knit community. The size is just what I wanted in a school.
Freshman,5,"I love Sonoma. Great classes and friendly people. Diversity and cafeteria food could be better, but other than that it is a wonderful school."
Freshman,5,"I am only in my second semester of college here at Sonoma State University, but I grew to love this school so fast that I would like to call this area home. It has a beautiful environment filled with all sorts of different trees and the people are very kind.  I am proud to call this my school and I recommend it to all my friends who are currently applying to colleges."
Sophomore,5,"The college campus is amazing, the students there are all approachable and are highly interested into the academics given. I also enjoy the help from the staff and factuly, they all seem highly attentive when needing assistance."
Senior,5,The staff and faculty have been so helpful on campus. I couldn't have made it the last year and a half without them. The campus is also clean and well kept. The meals are amazing in the cafeteria and the choices on campus where to get snacks between classes have saved many days. My professors I think have been the best influence on me succeeding in my goals and my future. Their inspiration and continued belief in my success has kept me going. I can not thank them enough.
Senior,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my academics on campus.  It's a fairly small campus with beautiful trees and old buildings with many nooks to hide out in.  The professors have really stood out to  me.  They are attentive, intelligent and seem very interested in their student's success.  Most of them in my Psychology department are professors in other prestigious Universities or have an established clinical practice of their own.  I have enjoyed their teaching methods and feel that they are invested in the student's learning."
Junior,5,"I love Sonoma State it's such a unique and beautiful campus, the student to teacher ratio is perfect. I am not big on lecture halls or having a bunch of students in the classroom and Sonoma has very limited classes that are structured in that format. I enjoy how I can easily speak to my teacher and make a connection with them and I am comfortable speaker to all my professors."
Junior,5,"This is my first semester at SSU and I am loving it.  I am transfer student and the programs to help transfer students are so helpful.  I never imagined being able to feel settled so quickly.  The are so many resources that I've never seen at any college.  This school is very up with the times, has a great support system for its students, and has so many fun events. I LOVE SSU."
Niche User,5,"I'm applying this year, I've only heard good things about the school from a number of friends from how professors are there to help you along the way to how much school spirit there is."
Senior,5,"This university offers a variety of majors and programs that gives students a quality education. A rather small campus, this university is beautiful and allows students to build connections with the professors and other students."
Senior,5,"I like this school, easy to commute to, my financial aid was covering it, and the teachers are great!"
Alum,5,"College is all about what you put into it. If you put yourself out there and get involved at Sonoma, you will enjoy your time there. I made life long friends and so many memories here. It is a great school for those who are not meant to be at a large campus."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience here. The professors really care  about their students and want them to succeed. The campus is beautiful and small, making classes easy to locate. If you like a quiet community, then this is the school for you."
Sophomore,5,"I honestly love this school. It is the best decision I have ever made. My major is Environmental Studies, so if that is also yours then this is a great place. There are so many different branches and concentration you can choose within this major. There is much more than just my major. A lot of majors at our school are great and have huge explorations opportunities. The only downside of our campus is that it is not super diverse. This school is in a pretty small town but it's a pretty fun party scene. Most professors are great here, but just make sure to utilize RateMyProfessor.com."
Sophomore,5,Interactive community where people from all walks of life thrive together. Beautiful campus. Helpful staff and knowledgeable professors.
Freshman,5,"Overall in the Seminar and times I have visited the campus, I feel immersed by the staff and the amount of help they offer when it comes to academics and what can be done to better our future as students attending college!"
Niche User,5,"Sonoma State is a great choice, it is a beautiful campus and the people are very nice. Would recommend 100%."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Sonoma State University! The faculty are extremely helpful. The school has a lot to offer living on campus and even off campus. The places to eat at are fun, as well as the other activities that you can be involved in the recreation area and the gym. The library is very large and accommodating for all needs whether using the computers, internet usage, or the study rooms for group assignments. The library and the student recreation areas are open until 12am. I am very lucky to be attending such a school that knows what students need to be successful. The career center is another place where students can get help putting together resumes, and getting jobs. It provides a full service help center for new, transfer, or current students. I just can't say enough about them! Love it!"
Niche User,5,"I love it here. The ability to be outdoors whenever I want along with how social it is Freshman year allowed me to make so many friends who are into the same things I am. All I had to do was apply for housing and was placed in a community of people into the same things as me. I also love how the campus is laid out, it just has this welcoming atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"The school is absolutely beautiful! All of the teachers I've had have been really passionate and cared a lot about their class. It's a great environment to learn, and not on the expensive side of colleges."
Junior,5,"I love the campus and the professors, they are all very understanding and willing to help you no matter what time of night or day. When registering for classes they will help you every step of the way and their office hours are always at great times. The campus is in a great location so leaving to get food or find housing is fairly easy. There is always something interesting going on on campus and they offer fun things for students like free bowling on the first Thursday of every month."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the campus numerous times with the campus being very open and inviting. The campus offers a gym and cafeteria for the alumni to use, as well as numerous other locations to purchase food an beverages. The library is very organized, and is an ideal location to study. The classrooms are vast however still allow for an attentive learning experience. the parking however can be difficult during some times during the day."
Freshman,5,"It is a very fun and engaged school! The professors truly help students. There are so many classes for students to take. There are also many clubs for anyone that is interested in sports, or other fun things."
Sophomore,5,"Sonoma State University, is the place where I want to be. The beautiful nature that surrounds the amazing campus gives Sonoma such a peaceful and beautiful vibe. I chose to attend Sonoma to become closer with my inner self, as nature consumes most of campus. There is not a thing I would want to change from Sonoma, because I have found very amazing friends from different backgrounds and honestly, I could not ask for more. My life is starting to revolve around Sonoma and I am honestly, truly happy here."
Senior,5,"The campus is beautiful and my academic department (Geography, Environment and Planning) is full of well-qualified professors and educators who know what they're doing and are super helpful."
Alum,5,"I was a freshman at Sonoma State University back in 2014, I have to say, the school is extremely welcoming and has a great learning environment. Due to smaller class sizes, professors are able to get to every student who are in need of help. In fact, all my professors have been extremely supportive when students needed them to explain things they didn't understand multiple times. There is a tutoring center for a number of classes (free) and it comes in extremely handy if you need more help outside of the classroom. The tutors are great at explaining concepts you didn't get or even walking you through entire problems. 

The campus itself is also great. We have a lake where you can just chill and relax in nature. This really comes in handy if you just want to relax or if you need to relieve some stress. Sonoma State University also has the best dorms across the entire nation. 

This school is honestly a hidden gem! Transferring out of it was the worst decision I've made in my life."
Freshman,5,"Sonoma State is a very welcoming university no doubt. From the start everyone was really nice, I like how whenever I'm out walking to class or doing something and I pass walk by someone they always give a smile or even say hi, even if they don't know me. During my first couple of weeks here that made it a lot more better because I was scared and nervous about starting college. My professor's have also been very kind and helpful, they are always okay with answering questions or explaining things over again so everyone understands. Even though there is not much diversity how I would like there to be it's still an amazing school. Another thing I enjoy about Sonoma State is that it has a small campus so it's not difficult getting around classes and you don't have to worry much about running late to class because it's too far.Overall I think Sonoma is a great school, every school has its flaws but here it's difficult to see them because of all the other great things in the way."
Freshman,5,Sonoma State University is an exciting place to attend school. The campus and city of Rohnert Park is beautiful and I feel safe. The professors are accomodating and go out of their way to help the students. The living experience is wonderful also. I really like the dorms as well as the cafeteria. The food is really good!
Alum,5,"I graduated from Sonoma State University several months ago in May of 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Studies.  I absolutely enjoyed everything about my experience at Sonoma State, and I am so thankful that I chose to earn my Bachelor of Arts from that University.  I had not been exposed to diversity and culture in my hometown education given that I grew up in a secluded and small town in the middle of nowhere, therefore when I began my educational journey at Sonoma State in 2013, I was in complete culture-shock.  Looking back now, I did not know the amount of real-life experience and life skill knowledge that I would learn in my 4 years at Sonoma.  My thoughts, beliefs, personality, education, culture, and understanding of social advocacy, evolved throughout my educational experience, and I am so thankful that I was able to grow with the students and faculty at Sonoma."
Niche User,5,"Amazing! It is so beautiful and refreshing, especially with all the trees. All the professors are so nice. The food is amazing. And the nearby downtown is so cute."
Junior,5,"Sonoma State is a great school. Good student to faculty ratio. Great opportunities. Nice campus and dorms. Rohnert Park is a nice area, close to lots of local shopping."
Freshman,5,"There are very good facilities, there are both large lecture halls but also small classes. The dorms are all very nice and well maintained, the campus is not small but its not too big that you can't walk to classes with some time to spare."
Junior,4,"I personally struggle with online learning, so that's going poor, but primarily on my end. I have been fortunate to have some professors that have been very adaptive to online learning. Some profs have been rather negligent though and are attempting to act like everything is 'normal' and it feels like they're trying to pretend that everyone has the same accessibility to be able to fulfil the course work assigned."
Junior,4,"It is a good fit for me personally because I love to dance, and it has a decent psychology and French program. However, I think that the school could do better with diversity. There seems to be quite a bit of ignorance in different cultures and their importance to the community. Most of the 'diversity training' that is required feels like it is primarily to fill a quota, not because they actually want to diversify. I am in several clubs (QSA, BSU, French Club) and they are doing their best to diversify the campus, but I think they could use more support from the school."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning may not be the ideal but we are all getting through it together. Professors work hard to do right by their students and never has this been more evident than in my online classes. All of my professors are regularly communicating with the class, providing us with the tools that we need, and making changes to the class when necessary so as to accommodate students facing evacuation or connectivity issues. Last semester in the spring the switch to online learning was rather abrupt and people were not completely prepared for it but great strides have been made since then and everyone has proven their ability to adapt."
Sophomore,4,"Sonoma State is an absolutely amazing school that encourages excellence, responsibility, integrity, and respect from staff and students alike. A beautiful campus, interesting classes with enthusiastic professors, and a close knit sense of community makes being a Seawolf a wonderful experience. The needs and wants of the students are always taken seriously because they are always seeking new ways to improve despite already being such a great school."
Sophomore,4,Online learning was hard on everyone but i think we all tried our best and that some teachers were better than others but eventually we will learn and this will always be apart of future lesson plans.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I was able to find my group of friends very quickly. Many people disagree but this college is not for everyone. Although, this school has become my second home."
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I was able to find my group of friends very quickly. Many people disagree but this college is not for everyone. Although, this school has become my second home."
Senior,4,"Small campus so easy to get in contact/ be known to professors. The school does a decent amount of outreach and gives students a decent amount of opportunities for internships (not at school but outside of it). Student life is not abundant unless you are in clubs/greek life and there isn't much to do around the area. For transfers, they do have a transfer resource center as well as a transfer peer mentor for your first year at school to help you transistion."
Junior,4,"SSU isn't diverse, but if you get involved on campus, you'll meet more people, and have a great experience"
Alum,4,"Excellent professors, terrible administration that handcuffs them from time to time, pretty diverse student body, way too many $toners that end up dropping out after freshman year, excellent dorms, overall 8/10 experience."
Junior,4,I am currently attending Sonoma State and really enjoy attending this school. My advising experience has been less than stellar. I found it very difficult to see my advisor for an issue with a simple fix and that delayed by registration for classes.
Niche User,4,"I loved my school, it pushed me to grow into someone that works hard for what they want. I loved how they would always tell us about college, how it was going to be. I Loved the support that we got for teachers they pushed to work hard everyday. This helped all the students to do there best, it also encouraged us to give back to the community with was amazing because now I know the importance to give back once I am out there doing my career. I will never forget to always give back to the place that I grew up in."
Alum,4,I loved the Psychology department at Sonoma State! The campus is small but beautiful. I do wish the campus had more emphasis on diversity and inclusion though.
Niche User,4,I have not attended this college but I plan to this fall. I would like to attend Sonoma State because I love the campus and the people there are very nice.
Freshman,4,"Sonoma State is a small, but mighty campus. Each classroom size is small where you get to interact with your peers and professor more often. It's a very friendly campus where students are willing to help anyone in need. Sonoma offers a wide variety of opportunities for students like internships and jobs, as well as many different clubs to join. The dorm rooms are like suites in hotels where the highest floor you might live on is the third floor. Another plus is that we have a couple that walks their dogs on campus and Bismark as became our mascot and you can always call his name and he will stop to let you pet him on your way to class. The downside of the campus is that we don't have a football team any more and the students aren't super school spirited."
Sophomore,4,"Sonoma State is a beautiful school. I am currently a sophomore, studying Criminal Justice. When it came down to my final two schools to choose from, it was between CSU Fort Collins and Sonoma. I committed to Sonoma without even touring it, it was a very scary choice to make. With this said, I was very lucky that I had just committed to an environment that made me feel at home. Being a student with ADD, I was very scared that I would not be able to get the help and support I needed. Fortunately, I was surprised and have received incredible help and support through the DSS. Looking back at my freshman year of college, I was so scared that I wouldn’t be able to make it through the first few weeks, however, I have been so blessed to be able to go to a school that supports me for my learning differences. I highly recommend Sonoma State to anyone who is looking for an educational environment filled with support and love."
Freshman,4,I had great first semester in the dorms at Sonoma State University. I was able to manage my classes well and I became great friends with my roommates. Sonoma State has a beautiful campus that is enjoyable to walk around.
Niche User,4,"I took a field trip to the school and also took a tour of the campus. It was a very lively and friendly campus. All of the students and other adults around were very helpful in pointing out directions or other things and polite. It is a very clean place, there wasn't any trash on the ground, on tables and there wasn't a trash can overfilling either."
Alum,4,"Sonoma State University is a beautiful campus in an idyllic setting. The new buildings are !great! but the older buildings are shabby, dishevelled, and generally an impediment to learning.  The faculty is generally above the average one might expect from a CSU,. The politics on campus is surprisingly moderate and free of anger.  At one point in the past SSU was at the leading edge of technology and innovation, but has since fallen far behind the times.  This school is a member of the somewhat prestigious COPLAC, but this organization is invisible on campus.  Finally, you can walk around the campus saying ""data science?"" and get nothing but blank stares.  Great potential, desperately needs innovative, visionary leadership."
Freshman,4,"Sonoma State provides a positive ambiance with its nature surroundings. If you're a very independent person, this is the school for you. Everyone does their own thing, I haven't had one encounter with drama or a mean look. As a whole, people are glad to be apart of Sonoma and earn a degree. Athletics isn't huge here, it's more based on music, business, criminal justice and computer science majors. As a freshman, I get unlimited food at the cafeteria and I always have the rec center (gym) to help me stay fit."
Niche User,4,I got accepted from Sonoma State University just last month and I'm excited to take the tour to visit the school. Loved the fast acceptance letter
Sophomore,4,"It’s a very good school and I enjoy going here. The campus is very quite and peaceful which is something I enjoy. It’s nice to just walk around and see all the different types of plants that they have, it makes the campus more inviting."
Junior,4,Everything about this school is amazing. I would like to see more renovated classrooms because many of the smaller classrooms are becoming outdated. The lecture halls are also in need of an upgrade!
Sophomore,4,"Sonoma State is an amazing school, I feel safe and the environment is very welcoming. We have a green campus that is maintained very well by the maintenance crew. I would say that the parking prices are rather excessive , not to mention we already pay thousands of dollars for tuition. Overall is it a great school."
Freshman,4,I like how SSU has a diversity and has a beautiful campus you can explore. Not only is the campus have a beautiful view but they offer a great amount of different majors and minors and have programs to help support the students.  When being on campus you feel safe and comfortable like if you are at home and you receive helpful support from teachers and other services and there is activities to help bring everyone together.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I've had many welcoming experiences both from students and teachers. While the lack of diversity was a bit of a disappointment, it was to be expected. Teachers here are a hit or miss; some care and some don't. It's relatively easy to get the classes you want, so long as you don't wait til the last minute to apply. Food is mediocre and lacking, but there's many other food options outside of campus that are in walking and driving distance. Dorms are simply the best."
Freshman,4,"It had a very cozy environment, and all the buildings and exterior design makes the school look amazing."
Alum,4,Overall had a great experience with the department of Physics and Astronomy. The only downside is the relatively small size of the department which limits some of the class choices but the professors make the experience much better.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and I love all my classes. The dorms are probably top 10 in America; they're basically apartments. All the professors are amazing. The social aspect isn't quite there, but it is great if you're looking for a quiet, academics- focused college experience"
Sophomore,4,"Sonoma State University is definitely a very welcoming & social school.  Not only is Sonoma state filled with school spirit but Sonoma State also makes learning very fun. The staff are always very enthusiastic to teach & you can tell they love their job. The campus is open & very accepting to anyone of any background, ethnicity, sex, etc. Sonoma State is the place to be. Go Seawolves!!"
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the meals and scenery of Sonoma State University. The dorms looked comfortable and they were affordable. They had many different programs that specialized in different fields and had a great support system. I would consider Sonoma State for anyone looking for a comfortable, affordable, and close to home area."
Freshman,4,The first time entering into Sonoma it is such a beautiful scenery. It is it's own space and very quiet they have a lot of nice places to go in study. Love that they do not have dorms instead they are called villages.
Junior,4,"Sonoma State University offers amazing experiences in several different departments. I had the chance to explore different departments on campus and each individual is inviting. The professors cater to the individual learning environment when needed and will do what ever it takes to exhibit clarity to their students. As a biology major, I am able to grasp several concepts fairly quickly due to the determination of the professors. They offer what they call ""university"" classes that help first time freshmen to transition from high school, which aided very much so. Sonoma pursues to make students versatile not only in studies but also with volunteering; offering several programs."
Freshman,4,I chose this college because it was smaller and close enough to home. The drive there is scenic and the students seem to be very involved in campus activities.
Freshman,4,The campus is very nice and the people are friendly. The dorms are like apartments. However there is little to do outside of the university.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the campus, it's a beautiful place, and it's not too big either. One way I've heard it described is as having the size of a private college for the price of a public college. So far all my teachers have been pretty great and supportive and enthusiastic, and the area is a great place too."
Sophomore,4,"I like all the different clubs and activities that they offer, that you almost always find a club or an activity that you can fit into and meet new people and enjoy your time in college."
Sophomore,4,"Sonoma State is very clean and very beautiful. It can improve on buildings such as Stevenson, however, overall a great school to be in. Great range of academics."
Freshman,4,"I had an enjoyable academic experience here and was grateful for the free resources and seminars offered to help form better study habits, improve time management skills, as well as inform me about other methods to get better organized in general. I did run into some strange enrollment errors I had to correct in order to receive credit for a class I took and there was some confusion about whether or not I'd been attending school in the first 3 weeks, which I was the entire time, so I don't know how that came up and threatened my on-campus housing. Overall great school with interesting curriculum implementation; it just could stand to improve the office related inner-workings of the school."
Alum,4,Small community that allows you to run into your friends everyday.  Rohnert Park is not a good college town so you'll have to go to Petaluma or Santa Rosa.
Sophomore,4,"After a year at being a freshman at Sonoma State University, I honestly really enjoy it here. Sure, my first semester wasn't the greatest and it build up during 2nd semester with new friends and people. However, SSU has its flaws. The food needs to be better and include alerts like ""contains nuts"" because I al sit ate some chicken that had some almonds but it wasn't mentioned! So allergies can be very risky for people like me who's allergic to certain things. The athletics environment isn't as big but we do hear about scored and who wins if you follow them on Instagram or Twitter. Some professors are amazing but from what I'm hearing there aren't any good Statistics professors. Dorm life is great, many resources, much you can do if you want to do anything!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors are fairly decent depending on what your major is. I personally love my professors who are in my major. For GE, it is not worth your time. It is easier to go to a two year and then transfer. The dorms are nicer compared to other colleges. The campus is more secluded and there is not much to do if you don't have a car on campus."
Freshman,4,what I like about Sonoma state is the community that is easy to build due to the fact that the campus isn't that big. I loved how the classrooms were small enough to get 1:1 with professors and everyone is always so happy to help.
Freshman,4,I like Sonoma State because is very welcoming. I like the learning style and the classes they offer here. You can make new friends easily and get to know people.
Junior,4,Sonoma State is a great school! It is local and the teachers really care. If you try your best you will succeed.
Freshman,4,"I really like the atmosphere at Sonoma State and the size of the school, and the rural location of the school. As a college freshman I have really enjoyed my teachers and the support that the school gives the students."
Sophomore,4,"The school has done a great job at preparing me for my future career and life choices. I have appreciated my advisor's dedication to my success. The staff in the office has always been extremely friendly, supportive, and professional. My dorm far exceeded my expectations."
Freshman,4,The thing I love most about Sonoma State the most is the atmosphere and beautiful surroundings of the area!
Alum,4,Beautiful campus and great food however look into your instructors very closely. Many refused to do recommendations for some reason.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful. A commuter school that can leave one lonely if home is 5 hours away. The food is okay, I wish there was more of a variety. The mandatory freshman meal plan for students on campus should be reconsidered."
Freshman,4,"I really like how the professors are willing to help you if you approach them during their office hours. Something else that I really like is how clubs and fraternities try recruiting new members in the area between the student center and the recreation center. Buildings around campus are divided based on the majors and general studies, making it fairly easy for students to be able to find their classes. Lastly, having a decent student to professor ratio makes it fairly easy for students to be able to interact with the professors."
Senior,4,"Great instructors, but wish there was more science based degrees here.  The environmental studies program changes way too much."
Freshman,4,"I believe that the teachers at Sonoma State University are very passionate about wanting their students to succeed while also firm on deadlines to prepare them for real world situations. They take attendance very seriously just as any job does and they're very open to helping their students understand material. Most teachers I've had so far teach with great enthusiasm which enables the students to be interested in even the most boring topics. Besides the teachers, it's a very beautiful campus filled with nature and ponds that they do a great job at maintaining."
Freshman,4,"I would personally like the financial aid, housing and student services to be more involved in student's situations."
Junior,4,"Sonoma state has a beautiful campus and makes one feel safe. I have visited that school many times in college field trips in elementary school, middle school, and in high school. When I have visited the school I see that there's a fair  diversity that shows that the school can bring the students together. The professor show great interest in the subjects that they teach. The students are very nice can and have helped me get to certain parts of the campus. The students are smart hard workers that will have great futures."
Alum,4,"I had a great time at SSU, I was a transfer student and I was able to be involved in clubs and campus activities as if I attended since freshman year."
Sophomore,4,"I love how this CSU has one of the smallest campus in California, which makes me feel at home since I have always grew up in small towns. It is super welcoming and makes me feel like I am involved and I will achieve great things in the future."
Junior,4,"I love SSU. The campus is beautiful and peaceful. Every professor I have had has cared about the success and well being of their students. The school is small enough to get to know a lot of people and not feel overwhelmed, but big enough so that there is always someone new to meet or something new to discover. There are plenty of ways to get involved and make new friends. The dorms are incredibly nice and big. It definitely has its issues, but overall, I feel at home here."
Senior,4,Beautiful and quiet campus. Sometimes campus is a bit too quiet and lonely. The Green Music Center is inspirational and a must visit!
Alum,4,"Beautiful Campus, and a great place to study. Quiet, very friendly, the people on campus want you to succeed, even when the going gets tough they still push you to do better and be better, which I find to be amazing."
Junior,2,"The campus is nice and there are a few really good professors, but food options are poor and you really have to fight the school bureaucracy to get anything accomplished."
Senior,2,As a transfer student I was very excited to start my actual college experience. I was looking for engaging thought as well as professors that would help inspire me to want to learn. It took me until my senior year to find a new professor that helped me to navigate the system. Most of the rest taught the what was needed and assigned busy work. The school is beautiful and always well kept. 45 minutes to San Fransisco and in the heart of wine country creates a large tourist economy. Overall a beautiful school with a small and sleepy student body.
Senior,2,"Overall, my time at Sonoma State has made me who I am today which I am thankful for. I was in a sorority on campus and I am a double major going to graduate school and was able to maintain a high enough GPA to do these things. However, I would not say that the school made it easy. Parking on campus is a huge issue that effects everyone and is really something that needs to be worked on. The availability of courses is another issue that could use some serious work. It is not easy for students to graduate in four years, although they will tell you that they offer enough units for a student to graduate in four years. What they do not tell you is that the courses that are offered may not be any that are actually helpful for you to graduate. I was told by a few different staff members that I am not doing college ""right"". I am happy with how I did college and am excited to go on to graduate school."
Freshman,2,I’m leaving after my freshman year. So boring and housing is set up so you meet no one. It’s also in the middle of no where. Do not recommend. Try harder in high school
Sophomore,2,"Honestly, I made a lot of friends. It's hard to find good people, but when you do find them, at least you can go out and do something. There is literally nothing to do in this town, but if you have friends, you can all just chill. A lot of people out here seem to only be here to be away from their parents so they can party which is really annoying. It is hard to get good professors and also hard to get classes you need because the school is severely limited. Advisors are never available and are not useful at all. Housing is insanely expensive on and off campus which has caused me to possibly need to transfer soon. I will miss my friends, but at least I'll be saving money. For real though, way too expensive for a college of this level. Not terrible, but definitely not great."
Junior,2,"I spent two years at Sonoma State before I decided to transfer, and I'm glad I did. It is not a very academic environment and students generally do not care. There are not high expectations placed on students, causing lots to slip through. Research is not common or emphasized here either. It There is a ""bubble"" and detachment from the real world. Not a typical college experience. There is not a lot of school spirit. Students seem unhappy and uncaring."
Sophomore,2,"Overall, the professors are mediocre (in a sense that the majority seem generally uninterested in what they are teaching), the dorms are amazing, only parties that exist are for frats and sororities, and safety is  clearly of minimal concern to the administration as there were security poles, but few of which worked. There is a specific part of campus that is not lit in anyway and has a sign reading that we should avoid between dusk and dawn, so they obviously know it isn't safe. Right across from that section, they recently recovered a body in a shallow grave, justifying the students' complaints about lack of surveillance/security. Long story short, when you don't feel safe, you don't want to be there. When you don't want to be there, you'll never be able to focus and put in 100% because you're worried you'll be the next body in the ground."
Sophomore,2,"Sonoma State University, overall, has been disappointing. The cafeteria has food that tastes fine, but when having to east it everyday my Freshman year, I was sick almost monthly (and I am typically a healthy person). Administration causes more issues than they solve, most professors seem genuinely uninterested in what they are teaching, and the CSAs for on-campus residents are practically useless.  On top if it all, the board recently blew THOUSANDS of OUR dollars on a huge electronic billboard that everyone highly dislikes. Aside from the people, parking is terribly inconvenient, but the dorms are absolutely beautiful. Truly the only real plus."
College Freshman,2,"This school is not really diverse. A good majority of the population here are Caucasian and although there are a few people who are nice once you get to know them, most people are kind of in their own cliques based on your ethnic status. People aren't necessarily biased about your race, but it's really hard for different ethnicities to communicate and actually take the time and effort to get to know others, because most of the people here look rude or stuck up."
College Freshman,2,"I feel like a degree here really doesn't have much value, because this school tends to try to keep you to stay as long as possible. I feel like the degree is of value if you major in business or something in the arts, but I feel like it is of little to zero importance if you are a person who is planning on majoring in science. I can't say much about internships, but I have friends who have graduated from this school and have said it is a waste of money and it is really hard to find a job in their field because of where they got their degree. Just something to look into, but it's really up to you."
College Freshman,2,"This school is honestly different for everyone and it really just depends on the person. I think that if you're someone who truly cares about their education and wants an environment where people actually care, I would suggest looking somewhere else. The scenery is beautiful and so are the campus buildings, but the quality of the school in terms of education, athletics, and the overall college experience just isn't worth it. Most people don't seem to care, but I think it's because this school has such a high acceptance rate and most kids that go here only go because either their parents wanted them at a university or it was simply the last school they got into and didn't have any other choice. I definitely think that Sonoma isn't a first choice for anyone here, but it really just depends on what you're like. If you're a person who likes the quiet and a very rural area then I would suggest this school, just know that there isn't much to do and you will get bored very easily. The food isn't that great at all and you will get sick of it within the first week. The school is definitely one of those where they try to make classes harder to get just so you can graduate in 5 years instead of 4. It just seems like business to me and I feel like only a few professors care about students and their success. Overall, it's not the worst, but it's definitely not decent."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much to do at this school, which can totally affect your overall experience. This school is located in a very remote and secluded area and if you don't have a car, good luck finding things to do on the weekends. Most people who live within three hours leave or if not, a vast majority of the students party and do stupid things on the weekends. It's definitely not the school where I think students can really have the ""college experience"" you're looking for, unless you're only going to school to party and not care about your academics at all. Most of the people here come from wealthy families and are only here to get a degree with a decent GPA. If you're serious about your education or want the real college experience, I don't recommend this school."
College Sophomore,2,Could be more emphasized and encouraged.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not enough courses offered. People can't graduate in four years.
Recent Alumnus,2,No divine nine. Racist Greeks
College Sophomore,2,From what I have heard about alumni is that a degree from SSU has very little value.
College Sophomore,2,"We are a Division 2 school, so sports aren't very relevant. The school tries to make it relevant, but it doesn't really work. The rec center is pretty nice though."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't feel a part of the student body or included, I'm just kind of on my own. People are genuinely nice once you talk to them but not initially friendly. I have a great experience with my professors all are accommodating and caring. The financial aid office is a sham."
College Freshman,2,I just really think that greek life gets annoying.
College Senior,2,"As a guy who never takes night classes, I don't feel unsafe on campus. But I know that my LGBT and female friends are worried about recent assaults. My lesbian and trans friends are particularly anxious, even during the day. They're critical of how the school treats rape on campus, and I can see why. 

In an attempt to fix it all, the school had us do this online, anti-rape myth activity last year. The program had good content, but it was very cheesy looking, and I've heard that people purposefully messed with the program or otherwise treated it like a game."
College Freshman,2,"I feel like most people are really into the Greek life and lots of kids ended up rushing. I feel like it was easier for girls to be accepted in sororities and boys had more difficulty in being accepted into fraternities. I remember in the beginning of the school year, there was lots of hype around rushing and it seemed to be the only thing that people talked"
College Freshman,2,"Sonoma State is D2, so already off the bat, it's tough to get the students excited for games and such when our school doesn't play any ""well-known"" teams. In the second division however, Sonoma state is well established, so we're not awful, I just think that if we played schools that people actually knew of and were division 1, athletics at Sonama would be way more popular."
College Freshman,2,"Sonoma state have sports which, are mosty club base. Popular sports are overlooked because the school is not sport driven."
College Freshman,2,Haven't necessarily been involved but there's no school spirit
College Senior,2,"The diversity at my school is the worst. I came from a very diverse city and coming to a predominantly white college was a big shock for me. I felt out of place, there wasn't any clubs or organizations that I felt I could belong to, and the my roommates freshman year were both racist. If I could do it all over again, I would not go to Sonoma State University. I would have liked to go somewhere more diverse and with people who make me feel accepted."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everything was very expensive and small. It was better to live on campus.
College Freshman,2,The CSA's take everything too far.
College Junior,2,"The only food that you can get across the street from campus is McDonalds or Taco Bell, nothing else."
College Junior,2,We don't get to have huge parties because the people surrounding Sonoma State hate the students. Parties are fun for as long as they go until they are stopped and broken up by the police before midnight. You mostly need to be in greek life in order to have fun at parties.
College Freshman,2,nothing in town to do if your under 21
College Freshman,2,"small town, not alot of options"
College Sophomore,2,The party scene is bad. No one can have a party on campus. There are fraternity dances and the school also provides 1 or 2 dances. Most of the parties are off campus but the it gets shut down very easily.
College Junior,2,Most of my friends have not received very many scholarship or grants from Financial Aid
College Sophomore,2,"Rohnert Park is a very small, quaint town that doesn't bring in much traffic which makes the town at times boring. Students have to go to the next town of Santa Rosa in order to have access to a mall in the downtown area. Students usually in order to have a night on the town also make the hour long drive to San Francisco because their are much more social events and attractions to attend."
College Senior,2,We don't really have choices just fast-food.
College Senior,2,"Not so much diversity, its hard for the minority to get recognized and invited to social events."
College Senior,2,"The athletes on campus are not noticeable, no really attends the games, our school teams are not really in high division in sports, fan support is there only when there is free stuff given out other then that only certain student attend that enjoy and support the sport. School spirit really lacks and the majority is involved in Greek life on campus."
College Freshman,2,"fINANCIAL AID AT SONOMA SUCKS ASS, HEY DONT GIVE YOU ANY MONEY. MY MOM IS A SINGLE MOTHER RAISING THREE ON HER OWN AND SHE IS CONSIDERED ""RICH"". SHE DOESNT EVEN HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE, ONLY WENT TO HIGHSCHOOL, BARELY MAKES ENDS MEET AND SHES CONSIDERED RICH? LIKE WHAT THE HELL, IM SO POOR ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY. I HAVE TO BUST MY BUTT OF IN WORK TO TRY AND HEP HER AND GO TO SCHOOL. SOME BULL."
College Freshman,2,Everything at this school is crazy expensive.
College Freshman,2,"MOstly white students, it feels like."
College Freshman,2,Parking police don't give anyone a break.
College Freshman,2,Was not eligible for any SSU scholarships despite good grades. The application process is tedious as well.
College Senior,2,"You apply for financial aid online. Getting your financial aid is a process like any other school. It is fairly simple and straight-forward. You may get a refund check, generally a week before school begins. The financial aid office, however, is made of inexperienced people who are not very helpful. There is a red-headed lady that needs to be avoided. "
College Freshman,2,"If you want to have fun, don't go here!"
College Senior,2,Curriculum is organized...and timely. I wish there were more choices 
College Senior,2,I've enjoyed it...but not for a lack of opportunities. 
College Senior,2,we all have to go off campus to have a party.  The police are always in the way
College Senior,2,weather is always mild. sometimes it rains.  We don't usually have an issue with it
College Senior,2,Its average. there isn't much support from the school for athletics
College Sophomore,2,The campus itself is fantastic but most of the people here make it less enjoyable. 
College Sophomore,2,This school has really low school spirit though lately it has been growing 
College Sophomore,2,They just built a new student center and moved pretty much every dining venue there which i personally hate and think that the quality of the food has gone down and campus is now packed there if you're trying to get food as opposed to when they different venues where placed around campus and a couple had a pretty cool atmosphere going on.
College Sophomore,2,"Registration is one of the worst times of the year for half the school because half were able to someway get priority registration (they register before anyone else) and the other half is left to try and fit a working schedule in after almost all the classes have become wait-listed
"
College Senior,2,it is almost like a police state...the health center is always giving away free stuff 
College Senior,2,It has a small town feel to it...and I'm over it  
College Senior,2,seems like there is a limited selection...and the departments are pretty small
College Senior,2,Its okay. I'm just lucky I'm getting course credits and working towards and MA
College Freshman,2,"Mostly fast food, no healthy options. The only healthy option is to go to the grocery store and go home to make your own food. "
College Freshman,2,"I've never been one to ever want to join a sorority, I think that they are a waste of time and money. "
College Freshman,2,"My school is only about 45 minutes away from San Francisco, but around my school is a very boring town. You need money to go to the city for gas, food, etc. so going there often as a college student isn't practical. "
Senior,1,"To start with the positives: some pleasant areas of campus, the new gym is nice, & the dorms are great - but that's about it. The campus is actually in a boring suburb at least 30 min away from Sonoma. It's structured like an incompetent bureaucracy that's very frustrating to deal with. It's designed so that you can't graduate within four years; classes are impossible to get, counselors are not helpful, & there are a million forms to be signed by 3-4 ppl for unknown reasons. The food options are terrible & nearly everything closes at 3 which sucks if you live on campus & have a meal plan. The academics are subpar & the school allocates all their $$ into ridiculous projects like a new business center they can show off to investors with frivolous decor, meanwhile, one of their main academic buildings is riddled with asbestos. Please spend your money & time elsewhere. You deserve to get a quality education in a timely manner & frankly you won't get that here. I regret my choice so much."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is a damn joke and everyone at SSU knows that.  Most of them are full of phonies just looking to have a group of friends to party with and that is literally all they do.  They make no contributions with the intent of doing good.  It is all just for show so it seems like they are doing something so they don't get disbanded.  They are very selective too and only want the people they like.  If you are not white then you better have money, if neither then goodbye.  One of the worst parts of SSU.  You can also tell that they are selective through their tabling outside the Student Center.  They typically just stop certain people, ones that look like they would fit in to their fraternity or sorority. I'm done."
College Junior,1,The althetics at Sonoma are a complete joke. The school makes no attempt to encourage students to attend the games. The whole program is very under-funded.
College Senior,1,I could not get any financial aid or scholarships. I was offered a loan with an 8-10% interest rate from the school which I declined.
College Freshman,1,STUPID. GETTING CLASSES FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER IS WHITTY. IM STUCK WITH ALL HISTORY CLASSE BECAUSE STUPID ASS SONOMA IS HELLA BOOTSY.
College Freshman,1,"LAME, CSAS EVERYWHERE MONITORING WHAT YOU DO AND CHEKING UP IF YOU HAVE ALCOHOL AND/OR WEED. LAME ASS S***"
College Freshman,1,"EVERYBODY IS RUDE, NOBODY IS FRIENLY . IT SUCKS. I WISH I NEVRE ATTENDED HERE. ONLY GOOD THING IS THE CAMPUS BC IT BEAUTIFUL."
College Sophomore,1,"You cannot be loud, drink, have visitors, or play loud music in the dorms because you will be kicked out."
College Sophomore,1,"You will hate this city. It is full of meth heads, it always smells bad, and the cops hate college students they give tickets to any college student they can. This city is absolutely horrible and the people here hate students."
College Sophomore,1,Teachers are really bad. Impossible to get classes. You will end up with classes you do not want or need. 
College Sophomore,1,impossible to get the classes I need. I will not be graduating on time. Everyone I have talked to in my major is going to be at least a 5th or even 6th year. I am a Business major.
College Sophomore,1,It is very difficult to find off campus housing and you can  never throw parties if you do. On campus and off campus is very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,I have hated every minute at this school. No one gets along and there is nothing to do. Everyone complains about it even if they are in Greek life. Also it is nearly impossible to graduate in 4 years. No one can ever get the classes they want and the teachers are horrible. One teacher even told his class that he doesn't care about them because he has ten year and cannot be fired.
College Sophomore,1,There is no football team here. It doesn't even feel like a real college. 
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing to do here but go to class and no one really cares about that either here. People just seem depressed here. Houses are not allowed to have more than 10 people at a time in them and if they do they get fined and everyone has to leave. No parties at all, ever."
College Sophomore,1,Most of the girls on campus seem to be in Greek Life which means they all hate each other. Even when you're in a sorority or fraternity there is nothing to do because police shut down everything within 10 minutes of it starting. Do not attend this school!
College Sophomore,1,The facilities are basically just for freshmen. Once you're not a freshman you will hate this school.
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely nothing to do here.
College Sophomore,1,Slowest internet I have seen on a college campus.
College Sophomore,1,"No good ethnic food, all very expensive."
College Sophomore,1,Never parking unless you want to pay for reserved parking which is basically for rich people who are willing to pay that much.
College Senior,1,They say they have a lot of money but never helped me out..it has been a struggle
College Senior,1,I am not familiar with this at all.   I have just gone to school and gone home
College Senior,1,I've never lived on campus but I've heard it is just a mess.  
College Senior,1,"it costs a lot to park on campus

The campus police are out of control....."
College Senior,1,"I drive to and from campus with my own car. I don't know about the transportation.
some times I see people having to resort to public transportation"
College Senior,1,"I always bring my own lap top.

The average computer at the school sucks"
College Senior,1,"I really dont know.  I just go to class and then go home..

It seems like basketball is the biggest thing on campus and it still sucks"
College Senior,1,It is in the middle of no where
College Senior,1,"Dining is all pretty cookie cutter franchise after franchise

There really isn't a signature hangout place for the students "
College Junior,1,In the middle of no where 
College Junior,1,"The school is not very diverse and everyone is aware of it, however the school is trying really hard to have diversity be something that is learned about, noticed, and accepted. We have had some incidents of students being rude or bringing down on some specific groups. The school does make it clear that that type of behavior is frowned upon. As a whole, the school is mainly a white campus, and you see very little of any other groups."
College Junior,1,"In my opinion, it is way to expensive to live on campus in a dorm in a single unit, when for a few hundred more I can have my own one bedroom apartment off campus, or for less can rent a house with close friends. The random housing lottery made for a situation where I only got along with one suitemate, and the rest were unclean and often I found my food missing. The only positive thing about on campus, is that you are right there on campus and are able to get to class quickly. However, this can be done off campus, such as I have done- and am only a block away, so still close enough to campus where I do not consider it a ""commute""."
College Junior,1,"I hated the Caf! The worst food ever. Instead of ""freshman 15"" your more likely to lose 15."
College Sophomore,1,IT IS HORRIBLE.  But on the bright side they getting a new dining service this school year!
College Sophomore,1,"Sonoma is pretty strict.  It is not a dry campus, but the RA's act like it is.  The noise policy is the most obnoxious part."
College Junior,1,"Most guys I've met either fall under the ""quirky and weird"" category or the ""fratty douchebag"" category. Neither of these are very appealing."
College Freshman,1,"Parking sucks. If you live on-campus and have to leave early in the morning for dr's appt., work, etc., you better hope you don't need to be back on campus until at the earliest 5 pm, because you won't find parking. During the day anyone with a general parking pass can park in housing parking, which means you can't park near your dorm. Even if you're commuting to campus it's horrible finding parking. You drive around from parking lot to parking lot sometimes for 30 minutes just a find a place."
College Sophomore,1,There is hardly any diversity. Most diverse students such as minorities transfer or drop out.
College Sophomore,1,"My freshmen year the campus was really good when it came to parking. However, when construction began for the new Student Center (opening summer '13), they took a lot of the parking. However, you will always find parking, but you should get to campus at least 30 minutes before."

Junior,5,"I'm from Industrial design and I can tell that everyone here is awesome, from passionate Professors to talented, friendly classmates. The great thing is that we don't have many traditional classes but instead we all working in an open space :D"
Junior,5,Great school for engineering in all disciplines but especially in areas with hands on lab work like computer engineering and mechanical / manufacturing
Sophomore,5,I had a good online learning experience. The professors were very interactive. They responded to emails and were helpful towards my learning experience.
Sophomore,5,I am incredibly happy to be attending Wentworth Institute of Technology. It has met all my expectations.
Sophomore,5,I love Wentworth. It's been a welcoming school since the beginning. I attend their CPCE program for adult/working students. It's convenient and provides me with a real degree program that's worthwhile. Their Student Service Center has always helped me with any issues and my advisor is proactive. All-in-all a great choice.
Senior,5,"Overall, Wentworth has been a great school. There is an abundance of support from faculty and staff. The University is on the smaller side so it makes one-on-one education easier. The dining hall could be much better."
Freshman,5,"All the staff at Wentworth Institute of Technology are nice and altruistic. They always put the students' problems first and want to help as soon as possible. The professors are patient, and they do everything that they can to make sure their students are doing good in their classes. The school gives many opportunities for the students to understand what they are looking forward to in the future."
Freshman,5,"Wentworth is definitely a great college for those interested in the STEM field. The impeccable reputation the school has built for itself is indicative of it's dedicated professors and encouraging staff. The upper rank faculty such as President Mark A. Thompson are driven towards helping the students get better and better. They care about Mental health and push to make the learning experience diverse, in-depth and easy on the stress so as to not burn out the students. The school is in the heart of Boston and is a part of the colleges of the Fenway. As a result, the students can easily mingle with students from the surrounding colleges. Wentworth is a very welcoming environment full of story waiting to happen for all new comers that seek an education."
Freshman,5,Everything about this school is amazing. The only exception being teachers. This is a very much hands on teach yourself kind of education.
Sophomore,5,I am going into my sophomore year and I am very excited. I am in the interior design program and it is fantastic. The studio spaces are so nice and the teachers are all very experienced.  I love that every year is cumulative and all connects. The reason we are wonderful that the school offers as well. The best one is the alumni program that allows you to contact the school if you are at any point unemployed and they will help you find a job.
Freshman,5,This is an amazing school with an amazing atmosphere. The students that come here are highly motivated and willing to help each other with no problem. The professors are kind as well as the staff members. If anyone is feeling overwhelmed or hopeless; go to them as they will help you as much as they can. The campus life is great and the food is as well. The only thing I would change is the parking situation.
Sophomore,5,"There’s a huge growth in women entering engineering and more male dominating fields due to the benefits and opportunities Wentworth offers. I loved the welcoming environment, staff, and campus when entering Wentworth"
Senior,5,"Wentworth has a great co-op opportunity for those who really want to experience what they're learning in class. We learn in school and out of school and have a high average of students getting full time jobs immediately out of college. The Master's program involves dedication and lots of participation. Study abroad opens the doors to a completely new experience and allows students to apply their knowledge from class into the real world. Its an amazing way to learn and understand how things work.  The campus is nice and small, meeting people is easy. Wentworth's location is surrounded by many other active schools which encourages new friendships. It is also located near many fun activities that constantly occur in the city. Wentworth is a great school for achieving your goals, getting your dream career and also experiencing an active and friendly social life."
Sophomore,5,"Wentworth Institute of Technology was a very intimidating endeavor when I began, as any college would be from the get go. My feelings of anxiety and confusion were quickly transformed into feelings of welcoming and hospitality. I enjoy life as a student and very seldom find myself being overwhelmed in any sense."
Alum,5,"The five years I attended Wentworth were some of the best years of my life. It is the perfect school for people who are willing to work really really hard to earn a degree. It has very focused curriculum, and I would not recommend it for anyone who is unsure of the field they want to pursue. I had a wonderful experience socially and academically. Co-op is a huge plus. After graduation, I was hired by the top architecture firm in the state! Wentworth in a nutshell: easy to get into, very hard to graduate from. Wentworth instills work ethic in its students and companies love to hire Wentworth grads for this reason. It is one of the best colleges for anyone seeking to enter the construction or design field."
Graduate Student,5,Wentworth is a fantastic school with great programs. If you apply yourself and try you can get great internships that will lead to an easy flow into the workforce.
Freshman,5,"Wentworth has a lot of resources to help you get use to college and to provide the tools and opportunities to gain the best education in mechanical engineering.  I believe Wentworth is the best place for me to become a robotics engineer.  Its co-operative program exposes me to using what I am I’m learning with doing the work onsite at a company or organization.  The classes are challenging and push me to be my best, but also to take responsibility and initiative for seeking help, looking for and taking advantage of the help that's available and achieving my academic and career goals."
Freshman,5,I liked their co-op program and the flexibility of being able to take a first year introductory course for engineering and decide after the first year.
Freshman,5,Wentworth is a fantastic school at a great size. It is perfect for anyone who is tired of the high school method of forcing you to take classes that have nothing to do with what you want to achieve. At Wentworth you jump straight into your major and get down to the stuff that you actually want to learn. On top of that the Co-Ops are a phenomenal way to get valuable industry experience as a part of your education.
Junior,5,I have attended WIT on and off for the last 8 years. The teachers are the best asset for WIT. I found the teachers to have real life approach in teaching and the teachers have real life experience. my book that's super importent.
Freshman,5,the school has the best programs and the educators are so respectful. the eduactors will sit down with you and help expand your mindset and help you the best way they know how. the students are nice and helpful. the campus isnt too big  which is a plus in terms of intergrating into a unfamiliar place.
Sophomore,5,"Wentworth Institute of Technology is a great School. Right in the heart of the fenway area, the school is right next to many other schools such as Northeastern University and Simmons college. It is a small school with a big school feel to it."
Junior,5,"I have gained so much knowledge studying in the Construction Managment Field. The hands on labs, co-op opportunities have been a great privilege. The professors are great, helpful and willing to work with you all the time. The campus is friendly and easy to get around. So much to do in Boston on time off!"
Junior,5,"Wentworth Institute of Technology is a small Engineering and Design based institution that is quickly rising as one of the more respected universities in the region in terms of job placement. Wentworth gained university status this year, and as a current engineering student at Wentworth, I would recommend any student who is serious about their career to considering attending Wentworth. The professors work at Wentworth to teach, not to do research, which makes them particularly invested in their students. The Co-op program also sets Wentworth apart, requiring students to work real companies during their time at Wentworth allowing students to potentially leave Wentworth with a degree and a year’s worth of work experience between three different companies. The social life and ""Party Scene"" many students look for in their college search is not great, but you are living in Boston. Dorms could use some improvement, but overall, I highly recommend Wentworth for its educational value."
Niche User,5,"I have visited wentworth which is located right in Boston. It looks like an amazing school, everything is close by and the facilities look amazing. It is my top choice."
Freshman,5,"I am happy with my decision to come to Wentworth, playing a sport definitely helps you get connected around campus.  Really nice living conditions for freshman and even better for sophomore, junior and senior housing.  Love being in Boston, there's always something to do and really good restaurants to try."
Freshman,5,"I'm studying Construction Management at WIT and I really enjoy it, their program is the 1st one in the nation and the teachers have a lot of experience."
Freshman,5,"professors are good, food is OK, dorms are nice, in Boston, high average starting salary, two semesters of coop to graduate,"
Sophomore,5,It's a great location right in the middle of Fenway so there is always something to do when your bored.
Senior,5,"Great school in the perfect location. Mandatory co-ops set you up well for your career, and the school provides plenty of extra curricular activities to entertain any type of student."
Sophomore,5,"The small class sizes allow us to be close to our classmates and professors, which helps everyone excel. The classes are difficult, but you learn so much."
Sophomore,5,"There's a lot of great things about Wentworth that makes it a good college, especially if you're interested in learning about specific areas of technology."
Niche User,5,"I visited Wentworth Institute of Technology as a prospective Freshman. I was impressed with the small class size. The ratio of student to faculty is 15 to one. There is a focus on engineering, and other tech fields, which is what I am looking for. The location is great, right off of Boylston St in Boston. There are five other colleges right in the area, and I would be able to take classes at any of them. I also ate in the dining hall, and there was a good variety of foods. The dormitories are clean, and everything is within a small footprint. It is an expensive school costing more than 50K/year, and that is the only negative that I can see."
College Junior,5,Wentworth has some of the best connections with employers in MA. And they host several career fairs which are super beneficial..
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,Sport is a main priority at my school
College Sophomore,5,"For me WIT has been a great choice. I did not want a large University or party scene. I like that the other students are similar to me, focused and engaged in their classes. I would choose WIT again, I have made great friends, love being in the city. Baker sucks, avoid it if you can. The food also is the worst, so disappointing. Overall great teachers. I have completed one COOP at a Tech company in Cambridge. great experience and I hope to wrokf for them when I graduate."
College Junior,5,"Wentworth is awesome, I have had an amazing three years and think that the school staff is helpful anytime you need them and at no point have I felt that I cannot get help when needed."
College Junior,5,The percentage of students who get a job within 6 months of graduation is 96%
College Sophomore,5,Even in online classes there is enough of a community setting to be able to make friends and work with other students.
College Freshman,5,I love the friends I have made and the campus itself it makes me love college life.
College Sophomore,5,"So far at Wentworth I have had a very positive experience. Educationally I wasn't sure what to expect going in because Wentworth didn't seem to have to high of standards for admission but since day one I have been very impressed with the teaching, the students devotion to learning, and the course material was more challenging than I expected but still manageable. All of the professors and students here are very friendly. I haven't met someone here yet that I wouldn't want to have a conversation with or eat lunch with."
College Sophomore,5,"I could go on forever about the career prospects and the value of a degree from Wentworth Institute of Technology. The career prospects from Wentworth are outstanding; you do co-op for usually two semesters or more and you are pretty much guaranteed a job, sometimes before you even graduate. A degree from this school means everything; when people hear you are graduating from Wentworth they usually applaud you and some will offer you a job on the spot or refer you to someone they know immediately. The alumni are pretty involved and the employers recruiting on campus are great, especially when there's job fairs, which happen often. The career center/services on campus also help you a great deal and help you get a co-op you really want, while making sure your professionalism is on point."
College Sophomore,5,"The quality of courses and professors here are amazing. I have never been disappointing with my choice of classes and the professors really care about you and get to know you. Every now and then you get that professor you don't like but that's normal at any college. There are tons of courses offered for specific majors, but they should work on offering more electives at better times. The class styles are like any class style; the professor teaches, they want respect from the students, they use the white boards and power point slides. The class sizes are usually small or average sized, which helps you retain what the professor is saying much better. I love the classes and my professors at Wentworth."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Wentworth Institute of Technology so far has been that I am overly satisfied with choosing to attend college here. Wentworth is unique because we are a tech school and we get right into learning about our chosen career path and we must complete two co-op's (in most cases) while attending. You are pretty much guaranteed a job when you graduate Wentworth and that is hard to say if you attend any other college. If I could choose Wentworth all over again, I would choose this college every time. The opportunities here are endless and the knowledge you gain while attending is so vast. This college continues to encourage and truly guides you to pursue all of your dreams."
College Freshman,5,"As a part of the volleyball team, I'm very involved in both the school itself and extracurricular activities. The students and faculty are welcoming, easy to speak with, and want the students to succeed. The co-op program is geared toward each student's success, and the curriculum is tailored to their major. Although the campus and population of the school is small, Wentworth is in the city surrounded by many other colleges, which makes it seem much like a larger university without the chaos. There are always activities going on and places to go."
College Junior,5,"Its Boston so there is plenty going on for 21 and over crowd. But besides bars and clubs, Mission Hill is a party paradise. off campus housing provides for plenty of house parties"
College Junior,5,Any degree from Wentworth will only bring you open doors if you use your time and co-ops wisely. A job offer will typically be provided to you even before graduation which is great
College Junior,5,There was a lot of things to do on campus. The school always have many different events going on during the semester and for many different types of students such as lunch time with commuters or spin the wheel for free prizes. There are many friendly people that you can interact with and you always meet new people at these events. That's why I would definitely choose this school again if I had to.
College Sophomore,5,"I am on the varsity softball team at Wentworth Institute of Technology and I am a student leader for New Student Programs at my school.  My overall experience has been a great one, I have met so many great people and have had so many good times.  My roommates are my best friends and had a very successful year during my first softball season as a Wentworth Leopard.  As a student leader for new student programs, I serve as a role model and mentor for the new students entering the Wentworth campus and help them adjust to the college life.  What makes Wentworth unique is that the people are fun, kind and understanding.  The teachers care about how I do in class and want to see me succeed.  If I need extra help in a course, they are there to help.  There are also so many programs on campus to go to if I am struggling in class.  The greatest thing about going to Wentworth is it is in the greatest city on earth, Boston, Massachusetts.  The benefits of going to school in Boston is that there is so much to do and with Wentworth, you have so many career opportunities set for yourself.  Wentworth has a great career service program where during your college experience, I have two mandatory co-ops so that when I graduate, I will be set with a job or be ready to go to grad school.  There are also so many places in the city for job opportunities and so much fun things to do with my friends.  I wouldn't change my college decision for any other school."
College Sophomore,5,Boston has plenty of restaurant options
College Sophomore,5,Apply for FAFSA as soon as it comes out and you will get the most amount
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is the best choice! You get to know plenty of people and socialize a lot. I would choose evansway over baker because its cleaner.
College Freshman,5,"You're in Boston, a quick T ride or short walk and you have endless amounts of options!"
College Freshman,5,"It's incredibly easy to find an apartment in Boston, and I know people that will be getting an apartment incredibly close to campus next semester. The cost is very reasonable."
College Freshman,5,Boston food is phenomenal and incredibly varied.
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't have it any other way. They are strict on the things that they need to be strict on, but they're more helpful, than anything. Just don't be an idiot and get caught."
College Sophomore,5,It's Boston! There are plenty of great places to eat.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone gets job placement after graduating.
College Sophomore,5,Professors and faculty are always looking to help
Senior,4,"Good school, facilities are very new and the academics are good. Situated in a bad area. Professors are generally good."
Junior,4,We're all new to this but I think the school and my department is doing a good job adapting to it. We have some course that I wouldn't call ideal for online such as studio but we're trying our best
Junior,4,"I am a junior in architecture. I have found that you have to go out of your way to seek a well rounded social integration. The campus tries to improves it's community, and while it is nice, it needs to be improved. It is not quite diverse with its representation of POC, and LGBTQIA+ students, but it is somewhat there. I have found that you must be determined if you want to go here, you must seek excellence and strive for it.

Wentworth also has some of the best professors around, they are very well-educated and well diverse in their studies. This school is focused on academics and success, not partying and extreme socialization.

In all, I adore this school, and if you have the determination, you can achieve so much."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors are just as passionate online, as they are in person. It really doesn't feel all that much different as it does in person."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Wentworth Institute of Technology has been pretty special, because I am able to connect with my professors and it is a perfect learning environment. What I like about it most is the co-op, which is why I chose to attend there in the first place. The only improvement is the lack of diversity."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience was good, the teachers did everything possible for every students to be successful in the class."
Sophomore,4,I have had a pretty good experience. I really enjoy how the school is very big on hands on learning. I feel that this tactic benefits the students the best towards their future careers.
Sophomore,4,Good school. I like the campus and it's in a good area. It's nice knowing people at other Fenway schools.
Sophomore,4,More work than having actual classes. Online schooling isn't as good as in class and they don't charge any less.
Junior,4,"Some good teachers, good dorming and food (some times). Labs are modern and updated. You get a new computer built into your tuition depending on your major. Beautiful but small campus"
Sophomore,4,"Although Wentworth doesn't really have a big campus as compared to other universities, people here are extremely nice and helpful. You'd have no trouble making friends. Co-ops are required to graduate here, and although it may be hard or even frustrating to find one, it can help you in the long run. Rather than being stressed about finding a job after graduation, you would have the experience to look for one before graduation, or maybe even receive an offer to work at a major company after you graduate. If you're looking for a college that holds parties every week, this isn't the right one for you because students here RARELY party. This college is great and all, but be careful of group works. Find people that you can learn from in a team rather than being the one to do everything yourself."
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth is a school relatively easy to get in, but hard to stay in. A school that is dependent on the effort you're willing to put in our assignments, projects, studies, tests and so forth. A school that fast tracks you directly to the career path you've been dreaming of, but only if you have what it takes to mange your time and look for opportunities on your own. And with just a few clubs on campus, you can take advantage of the COF programs and meet like-minded college kids from all over Boston."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, a great school with intelligent professors. Offers many clubs for everybody, including clubs specifically targeted for certain people."
Sophomore,4,It’s a great school if you are interested in engineering or construction and you know what you want to do.  Be prepared for weird class schedules and lack of involvement of your advisor.
Freshman,4,"Wentworth Institute of Technology is for the people who apply knowing what they want in life. It is specifically geared toward helping students find life long success in STEM fields. The manageable class sizes allow for more one on one time with instructors. Unfortunately due to my change of interests, I no longer have the same passion for STEM that I used to. As a result, Wentworth is not right for me. Still, I implore anyone who has a love for science to attend Wentworth. There is no other place that is dedicated to you as a student. All the staff members there will do everything in their power to help you grow."
Junior,4,"Wentworth is a very nice place for an education. Although their community isnt as tight knit as other schools, you aren’t paying for that."
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth is an academically fantastic university. The small class sizes make it much easier to remain focused and reach out for help when necessary. The Center for Academic Excellence is a free resource for students struggling with difficult classes, allowing you to schedule tutoring appointments during the week. Wentworth also offers many free events for students that encourage a positive social environment and reduce the amount of time students spend looking for something to do during the winter months. However, the meal plan at Wentworth could be much better. If you eat a lot, your (full size) meal plan will run out with about a month left in the semester and you will be forced to pay absurd prices for food in the cafeteria or at grocery stores in the city. After freshman year it is possible to reduce the size of your meal plan and purchase food from a grocery store, ultimately reducing meal costs overall and greatly improving nutrition content."
Sophomore,4,An excellent school. Needs some renovations on older portions of the school. Some buildings do not have second or third floor access for handicapped persons.
Sophomore,4,"Good professors who care about properly teaching you practical skills for whatever profession you plan on pursuing and are very considerate of your situation. Great area surrounded by city life and good food in the area. Easily accessible by the MBTA, making it convenient for commuters and people who want to live off-campus."
Sophomore,4,Wentworth Institute of technology is a small campus with a very friendly environment. The faculty and the student service center is helpful for upcoming new students.
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth is a small community that makes you feel at home. There are many clubs and extracurriculars that you can join to get involved. If you find yourself struggling in academics, there are tutoring sessions that you can sign up for and professors are willing to make the time to go over material if needed. The food there is average, but the overall academics and job outcome after graduation are great."
Sophomore,4,Being at Wentworth has shown me a perspective on how engineers work and what type of environment they are in. I have been able to meet many student with many different talents and traits that I have been able to handle many different types of social interactions.
Freshman,4,"Wentworth Institute of Technology is a great Engineering school, located in the heart of Boston and excelling at teaching students various aspects of engineering. The only improvement can be made on the living situation/dorms."
Junior,4,"I love my school. It's a great learning environment. It's a small school in a big city. 
The  on-campus housing is a little rough freshman year, but upperclassmen housing is worth the wait. The food is bad but the education is great. The teachers are knowledgeable and approachable. The co-op program is amazing and gets you out in the field before you graduate.
I wouldn't recommend the school if you're going into computer science, but it's amazing for engineering, construction management, and industrial design among other things."
Senior,4,The reputation Wentworth holds set all students apart from students attending other schools.  The coop program allows you to leave the school with real worth experience and connection.
Freshman,4,"Overall the school is great, it's in a great part of Boston with lots of things to do which makes up for a lack of things to do on campus. The academics are challenging but that is the nature of the subjects offered. Some of the professors   are great and will make their class enjoyable, most classes are small and the professors can actually get to know their students and help them understand the material. If you don't have a good professor or simply struggling with the material there is plenty of help available from organized study groups to one on one tutoring sessions. The school is fairly racially diverse however only about 20% of the student body is female. There isn't really a ""party scene"", you can still find parties but mostly people have fun within their friend groups. My only real complaint about the school is the food, there is little variety with what is served, the good food is only out for a short period of time and I often find myself eating off campus."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at Wentworth Institute of Technology and what I can say about my experience here was that it has been great!
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth is by far a great technical school, but what it is slowly becoming more well known for is its Architecture Program. This college puts its architecture students through hell, and you'll never be more grateful. If this is what you are passionate about, Wentworth wants you to prove it. You have to earn your spot in this program, and that may mean numerous all-nighters, no sleep, and no life outside of school, but you're here because something told you this was the major you wanted to pursue. You learn so much in the first year alone, without even realizing it. All the Architecture students here did not choose this major on a whim. We are students who dream of a future in this field and are determined, passionate, and driven, so if you want to know whether Wentworth is the right fit for you, answer one question, are you?"
Niche User,4,"The location of Wentworth University is very appealing. There is plenty to do in the schools community, along with what is around it. The learning experience they offer appears to be hands on."
Niche User,4,"I loved the Architecture program, and the location was great. It is also a very good school for everything else as well."
Freshman,4,Wetworth's Architecture program is very interesting right from the first semester. The campus is filled with supportive student clubs.
Niche User,4,The campus is a great blend of a traditional and a city campus. The people are very kind and helpful. There's so much to learn and the environment is great!
Freshman,4,"As a freshman so far, I am more excited than ever to learn. Not only is it what I'm learning that intrigues me, but having such great working professors that really care and want us to become the best we can be. Looking up to upperclassmen and seeing how their hard work has paid off and landed them internships and jobs really motivates me/assures me I came to the right place."
Junior,4,"Very good focus on school work, all about hands-on work experience. Food is not amazing but the ability to eat at the other colleges of Fenway is a great. Location is amazing as it lays right in the heart of Boston giving yo uplenty of oppurtunities to go out and experience the city life."
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth has a wonderful Computer Science program that includes two internships and you still get to graduate in 4 years, but includes a summer.   You really need to make sure you take advantage of the professor's office hours to stay on top of your grades."
Junior,4,"A school meant for learning, you have to try but if you do the pay off is worth it. Each major has its own struggles, architecture has time consuming work, engineering has harsh tests, management has a lot of areas of focus. Despite this almost everyone I talk to says they made a good choice coming here because it prepares you for reality."
Freshman,4,The Institution in the sense is quite good at educating the incoming freshmen and they value education over anything else which gives all student fair amount of help and services.
Sophomore,4,Wentworth allows great opportunities for hands on students to be able to acquire the knowledge for their area of interest. Minor changes would be how the curriculum is set up so the student doesn’t feel pressured or overwhelmed.
Sophomore,4,Wentworth is a pretty good school I decided to attend here mainly because of their big influence on Co-Op opportunity that they offer. They enforce greatly to have work experience before graduation. I would like the college to have better food.
Freshman,4,"Overall, the food is average, teachers are good, and the dorms are okay. I live in a quad in evans way and its a little small. id suggest a double to anyone else trying to live in evans way. The other dorms are alright but they only get better as you become an upper classman."
Freshman,4,"Very career oriented school. Small campus in the heart of Boston. The city is accessible by a short train ride. Not perfect, but worth it."
Sophomore,4,"Wentworth programs are very good at preparing you for your career. The facilities are up to date and you have many opportunities to learn and develop there. The school is also located in Boston, where technology jobs are on the rise so finding a co-op won't be hard. Co-Ops are very important to Wentworth and are a requirement for students. The only downside to Wentworth is the campus life is a bit boring, luckily you are in Boston."
Freshman,4,"I chose Wentworth not only because of the many possibilities and opportunities the school provides, but because of the many positive stories and experiences that I have been told by alumni and friends of alumni.  In my experience, it seems like a great learning environment.  The staff are all friendly and helpful if you have any questions.  The campus is small but that's the beauty of it because all of the school's buildings are within a 10 minute walk from each other so there is no need to stress about getting too much exercise! There are countless activities and stores within walking and biking distance of the school if you decide to wander and explore the great city of Boston.  Move in day was a breeze and the staff was very helpful and organized to make it as easy as possible. My recommendation would be to consider Wentworth because everything from the location to the academic possibilities are amazing."
Junior,4,"Great location, 10 minute walk from Fenway Park. Classes are pretty rigorous, but that's to be expected for an engineering school. Has a mix between antiquated and modern buildings. Lovely quad, but being blocked off until new building is complete."
Freshman,4,The teachers are great the the community in and around the school itself is amazing. The city of Boston never fails to have something to do or to see.
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my first year here and plan on returning for fall but there are a few things that I was not fond of in my first year. I had problems with few of my teachers and felt as though the workload was too big and they moved too quickly. Also on a non-academic note, the food court was not too great and i felt as though chartwell (the food service) was not too people friendly."
Freshman,4,"I love Wentworth Institute of Technology, the location is perfect. It is right in the heart of Boston, so there is no need for a vehicle. One can walk anywhere or use Boston's great public transportation system to get around which is wonderful. As far as I can tell the Academics are great, if someone were having trouble keeping up Wentworth has a Center for Academic Excellence which is designed to help the student excel. The Professors are willing to work with their students to help them. They have a great public safety department and police all over campus to help keep students safe."
Junior,4,"Wentworth is not a party school. If you are looking for a place for a ""typical college experience"" then this is not the right school for you. However, if you are looking for a school that will prepare you for your post-grad career, this college is a smart choice. Students graduate with a minimum of 2 internships. Classes are tailored toward your career, so you can be sure that you'll know what to do when you enter the workforce."
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman at Wentworth, I have enjoyed my time so far at the college. The teachers are amazing, Knowledgeable and always open to communicate and help with any issues. I highly recommend this college and look forward to the next 3 years as a student."
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty good so far, but it is not very diverse, consisting of mainly white, male students and professors, and some of the professors are a little ""iffy"" with their teaching methods, but it is fine otherwise."
College Sophomore,4,People from all over the world comes here .
College Junior,4,Career prospects are very good
College Sophomore,4,"The campus does make me feel comfortable, however, the school is located near a dangerous part of the city. Fortunately, polices and securities are always on patrol around the school and because of their work, I have not encounter any serious, scary issues on campus."
College Sophomore,4,No partying at Wentworth but you can go to every other school and party your life away. Uber and the T make partying everywhere else super easy.
College Sophomore,4,"I am in the architecture program and I definitely feel like i'm getting what I paid for. You might die a little on the inside from the workload but it's all good. As well as for my other classes, I feel like i'm getting a good education but if you don't understand something I suggest you seek out help immediately because you will fall behind most definitely."
College Sophomore,4,"I had a great overall college experience but I had an okay Wentworth experience. The school is kind of dull and has not much going on. They'd try to have these little things on campus but it just seemed kind of ughh, I cant think of another word. Like you'd go to these events and just stare at whats happening, maybe laugh cause its just so ughh and then walk back to your dorm, thats the feeling I had. But I did do all the stereotypical things college students do but all at other schools. The city is great to be in, it makes the experience 10x better."
College Sophomore,4,"For my first year (this past year) I lived in a suite of 8 in Evans way. I thought it was great, it had a huge common room and two pretty good sized bathrooms. Each room had a walk in closet which was pretty spacious. I'm one of those girls with waaaayyyyy too many clothes and they all fit. It was a little rough being in a quad but once we moved the furniture around it was good. LIVE IN EWT! not Baker."
College Junior,4,internships and job placement is very important
College Junior,4,"close to classes, nice buildings. very spacious"
College Junior,4,School has be super helpful and very inspiring. I've enjoyed the professors and their wisdom and I continue to grow and learn from them.
College Junior,2,"One thing about my school is that there is little to no school spirit. The athletics at WIT aren't much of a big deal as it would be at a D1 school. At a normal D1 school, the very first home game of the season would normally rack in the whole campus in attendance to the game. But at WIT, we wouldn't even know when the game was and no one would really be eager to go unless you personally knew someone on the team and went for support of a friend."
College Sophomore,2,"As an African American female on campus here at Wentworth, I can definitely say this is not the place you wanna attend if you're looking to be somewhere diverse. There are clubs here like NSBE which is for black engineers but I've also seen other minorities attend but that's pretty much it. There just isn't much poc here but I've been to other schools in the city, other school parties so thats how I made more diverse friends."
College Sophomore,2,"I wanna say it's bad because i've witnessed lots of drug use and when people do get caught they face their consequences but being in the city and in the area we're in, getting drugs and alcohol is not difficult"
College Junior,2,"This is Boston and there are mice. Incoming freshman, do not live in Baker residence hall because it resembles a prison. Get into Evans Way/Tudbury"
College Junior,2,"There aren't frats or sororities for our school in particular, we share a frat with the other students at the colleges of Fenway; Emmanuel, Simmons, MCPHS, Wheelock..."
College Junior,2,No one cares too much about sports here. The courts are barely ever open to the public
College Sophomore,2,The greek life at Wentworth is pretty nonexistent. The is one coed fraternity that I know of but I'm not sure if they even have their own house. Greek students aren't really viewed any differently than non Greek students because to get into the fraternity you have to have a gpa of above 3.5 I believe so the members of the Greek scene aren't really viewed as the type of greek kids that might be seen at a southern school like Alabama or Missouri. In general the ones I know are very pleasant people who just wanted to get involved with the community more.
College Freshman,2,The food is not great by any means. I try to eat in my dorm as much as possible but if I need to eat in Beatty I would like to see some healthier options other than the pizza and chicken fingers.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to choose from, food is not healthy, and most likely you will get tired of the food within a month there."
College Sophomore,2,"Beatty has terrible food, MassArt isn't much better"
College Sophomore,2,There is minimal greek life on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Costs are crazy!  Safety is a big issue, and forget about parking."
College Junior,2,They keep on giving me problems.
College Junior,2,WIT has a not party tolorance and people really don't have time with hw.
College Junior,2,"uncooked, burned, doesn't tast good, you name it."
College Freshman,2,"The campus food is not extremely healthy aside from the salad bar, which gets boring because who wants a salad for every meal every day? There is not a big variety either."
College Junior,2,"There is nothing good happening at WIT. No one really cares though. If you want to have a good time, you figure out how to do so. I have been to many parties on campus, and they're fine but usually leaving campus is best if you want to be loud."
College Junior,2,"So far my experience has been exceptionally negative. I've lived in EWT, Louis Prang and 610. The first two have cockroaches, and all three have mice. When I say mice I mean You can easily see one or two a day once the cold weather sets in, if your food isn't in plastic boxes it will be eaten. One mouse lept out of my closet at me.

The temperature regulation is poor at best, one of the rooms in EWT, the exterior walls are very cold to the touch, and there was a constant breeze through my window even when closed and locked.

Also many of the quad rooms are forced, there's bairly room to stand, let alone store four people's worth of clothing."
College Freshman,2,"Although the dorms are extremely convenient, nice, and allow for an extremely good social scene, the cost is extremely expensive and it becomes difficult to afford these dorms when a student is already required to pay such a large amount of money for tuition."
Recent Alumnus,2,"We are pretty much all white, non religious people."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are no scholarships in school for graduates....
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a lot of activities going on because its a small school...
College Sophomore,2,"there are some brand new dorms that they have just finished, but they fill up quick. if you get stuck with the old dorms like I did, then you are in for a life of frustration. sometimes i could not believe how old and crappy the old dorms were. the newer dorms were awesome, but hard to get into"
College Sophomore,2,"there is a good amount of crime on or right around campus, wentworth is right near roxbury and mission hill which are notorious for gang violence and crime. campus police doesnt do much to stop these crimes, but campus police does a lot to prevent parties and illegal parking, which i find extraordinary. if a crime does happen, the campus security will send an email and text message alerting the students and faculty, but this is about the only thing they do right."
College Sophomore,2,"no parties allowed on campus, overpriced bars"
College Sophomore,2,Some how paperwork goes missing or the info they give electronically is different then when you get the form.
College Sophomore,2,Not enough housing to supply all the students. Pretty expensive as well
College Sophomore,2,It's almost too strict to enjoy ourselves at our school.
College Junior,2,A lot of guys but different ethnicity .
College Junior,2,They are usually hard to find but cheaper.
College Sophomore,2,If you are interested in having parties or trying to play music late at night you might as well forget it. Unless you get close with the RA's you will most likely have someone at your door if its after hours and good luck if you have drinks or drugs there. They have a no tolerance policy which is awful. Luckily you won't get kicked out your first time but they make you pay fines and go through education classes etc. 
College Freshman,2,The food at Wentworth is pretty bad. I would not expect otherwise from a college campus but I try to avoid it in general.
College Junior,2,barely any sports... though all sports and clubs are free.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't like the food on campus. My classmates and I are convinced that they put laxatives into the food. It's overpriced, but overall edible."
College Sophomore,2,"The underage nightlife is quite boring and most of the time not worth it. The campus is very dry meaning, absolutely no liquor, no partying of any sort, not playing loud music. On the bright side for upperclassman there are many off-campus scenes to come across such as bars, clubs even parties in the apartments are decent. Long story short, the last two years are probably the only time to enjoy the nightlife"
College Sophomore,2,"The professors are hit or miss. Registration process is frustrating, confusing and complicated and should really be reevaluated to help make things run much smoother. the workload is heavy but necessary, popular studies are engineering and architecture."
College Sophomore,2,"If you truly look for the people doing drugs you can find them. If they aren't hiding it well enough, Wentworth security will get them, but honestly they don't enforce room inspections or outside areas enough. It is very common to find these people who even distribute right in front of you. They don't care"
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone above a 3.0 GPA is asked to rush, not too big."
College Junior,2,Parking on campus is pretty terrible. Being in the heart of the city they charge you outrages prices and there are only two parking lots on opposite sides of campus.
College Junior,2,"Some kids know what they are doing and can hide when they are smoking, while others basically have clods of smoke in their dorms. The enforcement is extremely strict if you just happen to be in the room while someone is doing it then your going down just as hard as the kid smoking."
College Sophomore,2,If all the forms that needed to be filled out could be done on the lconnect site and not have to be sent though the mail it would be much easier
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many guys to look at and they all dress the same.
College Sophomore,2,I was kind of sick of the caf after the first semester. Just thinking about going back makes me nauseous.
College Freshman,2,"All of the guys at my school are considered ""Bros"" and the few girls that attend are very wierd"
College Freshman,2,This is a private school and there is not very many students but the ones that attend the school are not very nice. When you hold the door or do something nice by opening a door for someone or say hello they usually do not respond. It is sad that my school is this way. There is an art school right next door with tons of nice people most of my friends are from there
College Freshman,2,"There are students that participate in sports at Wentworth, but overall, it is not an impacting part of the school.  I don't believe many people attend the games, since I myself have not attended even one.  Maybe as the school develops, the athletic field will get better. :)"
College Freshman,2,there arent many dining halls but a cafeteria which is as far i know closed at most nights. The food is good but some might be a little pricey.
College Freshman,2,"Lots of night life, a lot is 21+, however, its possible to find 18+ clubs, and theres some shopping in the area."
College Freshman,2,Although manageable it is difficult to find a good price for an apartment. Most off campus housing is expensive considering that we are in the city.
College Freshman,2,"I'm leaving Wentworth because i do not at all feel challenged.  Furthermore, the virtually non-existent nightlife and low female enrollment only makes me bitter and cold.  It's a good school for a lot of people, but not for me"
College Freshman,2,"Sure, Boston is Boston, but there's very little under 21s can do for fun. The default way to find a party is to amble around mission hill looking for an open door. On campus parties are non-existent because of the schools strictness, and the 19% female population is far from ideal"

College Freshman,2,"There are many apartments in Boston for sure, but it seems that there is not a great selection near Wentworth, and for the apartments that are near, the price is quite high. I am only a freshman living on campus, so I have not done too much research but I have heard these details from upper classmen with the opportunity to live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Slightly strict. I dont know anyone personally who has been caught, but I hear of people getting in trouble (though it doesnt seem like they get any serious punishment, just a fine usually)"
College Freshman,2,"Very few professors speak fluent english. Its tough to understand. Regardless to that, most of the teaching is very poor."
College Junior,2,"Do not spend much time out of studio, always working.  Studio could be a little better renovated"
College Junior,2,Large amount of workload with unresponsive professors
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food from Chartwells is bad. Thought we (as a school) fought for higher quality going into a contract year. With a brand new dining hall, we are hoping the food improves with the major upgrades they got."
College Junior,2,Forget the Clubs – The small parties on campus are fun most of the time and you feel safe.
College Sophomore,2,"It Is Pretty Average. The options are pretty limited, but the fact that Massart's cafeteria is also available is very convenient. The sandwiches at Massart are very good, and a pretty good deal. The meal plan paying system is good, but everything is very expensive. The c-store is conveniently in the middle of campus, but the cafeterias close very early."
Junior,1,Teachers were unprepared and cannot effectively switch to an online environment. Classes were rescheduled several times and held at odd times.
Sophomore,1,"Few professors are good, most are bad. They complain about school in class all the time.
Ministry and registry are terrible.
If you are looking for a good education, go somewhere else."
Freshman,1,"Things that Sucked: food, housing, sexist community, diversity, social life, Beatty Dining Hall (yuck)

Things that were Okay: local restaurants (s/o Grubhub), professors, courses, health center, c-store

The Architecture courses were amazing, and I loved studio life. But campus was hell, I am praying that the food I consumed was partially real. The staff was always arguing in the dining hall. All they had was frozen ""chicken tenders"" and fries. So gross. The campus always smelled like a hot dumpster and I don't even know why. The freshmen dorms looks like mental asylums and the bathrooms were crawling with bugs and smelled like sewage.
 
If you're confident in the major you chose and don't want to DO ANYTHING ELSE with your life, then Wentworth is for you. This is a place for people that have known what they wanted to do and just need the degree to get a job. 

So happy to be transferring...."
Sophomore,1,"Positives - some of the hardest working professors at WIT who actually want you to learn and see you pass.
Negatives-
Some professors dont care whether you passor not and egos are too big to be proessors. Some are filled with hate too and i've ran into this issue countless of times.
The food is terrible
There is NO diversity - we're unwanted outcast here
Social life - there should be some social life, you should be able to enjoy college while still being able to work hard. 
Local area - i grew up here, we're surrounded by hoods who shoot every other week

Honestly if youre okay with being anti social and learning a shit ton by YOU putting in straight work wentworth is for you.

If you would like to enjoy your college experience and still be able to reieve a decent education go somewhere else."
College Sophomore,1,"The only greek life here is the academic one.You have to have at least a 3.5 to be in it, Its more like a club than the typical college greek life. Other than that greek life is absent and not allowed. My friends and I all tried to create sororities and Frats here at Wentworth and were shot down so fast so...no cool greek life for us."
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life at this school, no greek housing either."
College Freshman,1,Greek life really does not exist at Wentworth. From what I know there may be academic-based Greek life but nothing too popular.
College Sophomore,1,Not much variety at all
College Sophomore,1,They will make your life hell
College Freshman,1,Living off campus in Boston? Good luck! It's expensive and hard to find. The dorms are expensive too but at least you can take out financial aid to pay for them.
College Sophomore,1,"We only have one fraternity, it is female and male, and its an academic fraternity that does nothing."
College Sophomore,1,"This is not a party school, we are all engineers"
Recent Alumnus,1,You really don't want the food here
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't live here so expensive
College Sophomore,1,"awful. they do not allow parties on campus and the cops are very serious about it. if you get caught with alcohol or drugs i believe there is a 3 strike policy, but even 1 strike can get you in some serious trouble with the school. if a cop sees you doing anything that he or she does not like, they will come in and search your whole dorm, regardless if you are even in your dorm."
College Sophomore,1,"biomedical engineering at wentorth is a brand new program, and I have already had 2 professors get fired for incompetence. very disappointed when i finally got to wentworth and saw what it was really like"
College Sophomore,1,"lame. no attendance, no school spirit, not very good teams overall, not enough sports available, facilities are ugly and old, only sport that is of any value to wentworth is hockey"
College Junior,1,there is no such thing at this school.
College Sophomore,1,"I live in a dorm building that was built in the 1920's...and it still feels like it's the same. There is absolutely no residential community or feeling of togetherness. The RA is a joke. We've complained to him about multiple issues (a lock on a door not working properly, cockroaches in the bathroom), and he hasn't done anything about it."
College Senior,1,I don't use a car but I could see where parking would be an issue.

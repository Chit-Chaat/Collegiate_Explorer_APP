Sophomore,5,"Overall, excellent. The professors will always make time for you if you have a question. The campus is always maintained and very beautiful. The only problem is the lack of parking on campus, if you do not have an early class, you more than likely will be parking in the gravel lot."
Sophomore,5,"I have been very fortunate to have my professors for the online learning. They all were very helpful, forgiving and very understanding."
Sophomore,5,"I truly enjoy going to Heidelberg. There is such an amazing staff and campus truly feels like home. I am a music education major, and I feel all of my professors are very supportive and helpful."
Niche User,5,"The community surrounding Heidelberg is one of the friendliest. Every time I visit, I feel more and more welcomed by both teachers and students. I enjoy how they encourage everyone to get involved and play an active role in making Heidelberg better than it already is."
Freshman,5,I like the small college atmosphere and getting one on one help. Getting to know my professors makes it much easier to have conversations about the concepts we are learning. I play basketball so having that group of friends who enjoy the same things I like has been great. The community is very supportive and has much to offer.
Sophomore,5,It is a great campus. The professors are absolutely amazing. With the smaller classes you can get close with them and you are able to meet with them one on one.
Niche User,5,Heidelberg University offers great academics along with a family oriented atmosphere.  Friendships are easily formed as you grow both in the classroom and outside.
Freshman,5,I love the one on one experience with the teachers.I love the small campus it makes me feel like a student not just a number on a roster. I absolutely cant stand the hype career program it is the worst thing they make you do to be able to graduate. Also the food is absolutely terrible.
Niche User,5,I have decided that I will be continuing my academic and football career at Heidelberg University. I loved everything about Heidelberg. The campus is beautiful and in a small town which I am used to. The football coaches are awesome and everyone around is so welcoming.
Freshman,5,"It’s simply amazing everything from dorms to their academics! I haven’t spend much time here yet, but I know it’s the right choice for me. Almost all the professors have the highest degree earned in their field which means you’re getting an amazing education. The small student body makes for a more inclusive learning environment where it’s easy to ask questions."
Alum,5,"Wonderful small college with deep tradition. Very personable professors and faculty. Mixture of new and old architecture and building, making a beautiful campus. Sitting in a very nice small town of Tiffin."
Graduate Student,5,"Since application to know, everything has been a dream! They have a ""big university feel"" with a personal touch."
Sophomore,5,I loved the closeness of Heidelberg. everyone is so friendly and there's always something to do on campus. I never walked anywhere without someone waving at me.
Sophomore,5,I would not want to go anywhere else. Heidelberg really set me up for success and the faculty and staff are really encouraging and nice.  This is the perfect college.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere here is great for those like myself who came to school knowing nobody. The faculty helped the transition to college very easy, they made me feel welcome here. There were icebreaker activities set up including a weekend camping trip -- F-U-N! There are monthly days dedicated to career readiness skills. No classes and famous entrepreneurs, athletes, etc. visit to tell success stories and tips to put us on the right track. But, these days aren't strictly business. They're an opportunity to travel to different cities and see things like museums & other experiences that you can simply enjoy yourself. Heidelberg's teachers are so amazing, with small class sizes they tend to each student and are easy to get one-on-one help. There is a very diverse population to our student organizations. Our unlimited access to our all-you-can-eat cafeteria makes it easy for healthy eating with fresh products and is very wide range of foods that cater to different diets. The Berg is awesome!"
Freshman,5,Love the class sizes and all the friendly people I don’t think I would change a thing .  My experience so far has been fantastic!
Sophomore,5,"I love Heidelberg! It is very welcoming and the faculty care a lot about their students. The extra-curriculars are amazing which include sports, music, Greek life, educational organizations and more. One fun on campus event is the Harry Potter Fest which happens every spring semester"
Freshman,5,"I love how at Heidelberg University everyone is a family. The students all care for each other and for outstanding success in everyone no matter what grade level they are. Also, the staff cares for all students and makes it their priority that all students do well in the class while still challenging the students to broaden their knowledge and abilities."
Sophomore,5,Heidelberg is a great small D3 school and is almost like a high school atmosphere where everyone knows everyone pretty much. The class size is small enough for you to get one on one connections with all your teachers in order to get the help you need. 
College Student,5,I feel safe on the campus. There is always people around ready to help you.
College Student,5,They will help you anyway they can to get you a job!
College Student,5,"Dorm life is amazing. You meet excellent people, and become a family."
College Student,5,It feels like you belong to a family whether you join or not.
College Student,5,When game time comes for any sport everyone jumps in to cheer them on!
College Student,5,This school is by far the best I've come across the people care about you and your education and that's all you can ask for I'm a school.
College Freshman,5,"One of the first things my school brought up is the importance of sexual assault. We spent our entire first week on campus in sexual assault seminars, getting information on what to do if someone suspects it happening, and who to go to about a situation if a student were to be a part of it."
College Freshman,5,"The second I visited my school's campus, I was immediately hooked on coming. The faculty is very welcoming and the campus itself is quite beautiful. What I like in particular is how updated they keep the classrooms and how small the classes are so the students can learn better."
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe in anything I do on campus.
College Freshman,5,Everyone sport supports each other!!!
College Freshman,5,Great I love it and was what I was looking for in a school.
College Junior,5,I love how flexible they are.  The guidance offered for completing your program is amazing.
College Student,5,LIVING ON CAMPUS IS COOL BECAUSE YOU GET TO MEET TON OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
College Student,5,Better than on campus food.. way better.
College Student,5,YOU FOLLOW THE RULES HERE..
College Student,5,"Being here on this campus. I feel that there is a lot of students and professor that accept each and every student as one. everyone one here is welcoming and comforting and my opinion. This campus has a worldwide of diversity and easy to talk to people here. I personally enjoy attending this university having transferred from another institution, i easily made friends."
College Freshman,5,"This school has become my home away from home. This is where my new family is, and I just feel comfortable here. I have a great golf team to play for and an amazing corollary to be apart of. I feel like I've found some great people there; it's a cliché, but this is where I've found my place. I would not hesitate to make the decision to come back to this school again."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is amazing on campus. The different groups took a weekend at the beginning of the year to hold events to adjust freshman to college life. Greek life is huge on this campus, and the people in it truly look out for all their members. It's a great asset to this campus."
College Freshman,5,You rarely see students out with drugs and alcohol however everyone knows where the party's are with the drugs and alcohol.
College Sophomore,5,"Computers and wireless are available in almost every building. I can only think of one that's older that might not have computers available. Printing is free, so it's really nice to not have to worry about the cost of that. There always seem to be plenty of computers open. I've never had a problem finding one to use."
College Sophomore,5,"Because our school is so small, you get to know the security officers, many of them students themselves. At welcome weekend all the freshman girls (I don't know about the boys) were given the number for campus security and we all put it in our phones. The staff assured us that security would be more than happy to escort us anywhere if we felt unsafe and actually preferred us to call rather than walk alone at night. Heidelberg is a very safe campus and they do a lot to keep it that way. There was one instance where a man was flashing people on campus. The security sent out a text message and email to warn everyone of the danger."
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience was mostly held on Zoom at the meeting time the class was during in-person classes. Some professors did pre-record lectures and then have a quiz over the content. Overall it was a positive experience.
Junior,4,I had a few classes online prior to COVID 19 and they were as expected. I tend to get more out of in class learning due to the amount of courses I take that involve a lab or hands on learning. I will admit when COVID 19 cause everything to go to the online format I was not impressed with the quality.
Junior,4,I really appreciate the personalized service provided to ensure I am getting the most out of my time there.
Freshman,4,"I love the small school layout of Heidelberg University, and how even though it's a small school I am always able to meet someone new just as often as I see someone I know. The professors are amazing and I truly feel like they care about my success. The food and housing are both under construction to get better and I can't wait to see the improvements to something already pretty good."
Alum,4,"Historical castle like buildings, feels like you're in Hogwarts. The staff are all friendly and nice. The student to teacher ratio is 17:5"
Freshman,4,"The community around the campus is very warm and welcoming. Everyone knows everyone since it is a very small campus. There are great resources available to students at all times. Also, organizations and groups are always active producing fun activities to do. The facilities are very well kept and the faculty is very open and helpful. This wish to see you succeed instead of fail."
Senior,4,"I like that Heidelberg University is a small campus, the food is better than the previous years and the professors are very helpful and supportive."
Sophomore,4,"I am a current second year at Heidelberg University and so far, attending here was the best decision of my life. I chose Heidelberg because of the track coach, the campus, and the friendly atmosphere that seemed to surround the whole campus. Since coming to Heidelberg, I've met some of my best friends, acquired new life skills, met several professors who have changed my life, and joined groups that I never thought I would be interested in. Being surrounded by people who come from all across world has helped me realize my values and what actually matters in life. Overall, my experience at Heidelberg so far has been the best and I can't wait to see what the next 2 years hold."
Freshman,4,I was recruited to play football for Heidelberg.  They have great coaches and are focused not only on the game but on the student athlete  and their academics.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time at Heidelberg. I cannot wait for the last year and a half! It is a perfect schooligans if you are looking for a small school with professors that care about you and your studies. You will make friends that last for a long time and be involved on campus. I found my perfect school and cannot wait for what's to come.
College Junior,4,My college is heidelberg university and I feel they are a very well rounded school
College Sophomore,4,Overall m happy with my school.

College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus and since I've been here, nothing too serious has happened."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are friendly, knowledgeable, and respond to emails well."
Recent Alumnus,4,Athletics are very important on campus and the varsity teams are very competitive across all sports.
College Freshman,4,"I do not know much about the job prospects on campus, but I know that following graduation, the school is very supportive in helping find jobs."
College Freshman,4,"The dorm that I live in is further away from the rest of campus, only a couple of minutes of a walk. However, our room coordinator and room advisers are great people to us, it's almost like a family atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"Being a football player and track runner at my school, having a good facility to train in is an asset that I look forward to having; my school provides us with such."
College Freshman,4,"The school is great overall. The students are friendly, the professors are very helpful whenever a student is struggling, and the campus life is simply wonderful."
College Freshman,4,I like everything about it. Its small but not to small I like the one on one attention.
College Freshman,4,I wouldn't know to much about it I am only a freshman but people seem to get jobs.
College Freshman,4,I am an athlete so I may be biased but Heidelberg does everything thy can for us athletes and they take care of us well.
College Freshman,4,My school is a great school. I love doing what I'm doing there. you can really tell the professors really care about you and want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,Everyone gets along and enjoy the time together in the hall ways.
College Sophomore,4,I am happy with my choice of schools
College Junior,4,It's great that they take to time to talk to me.
College Junior,4,They do a good job of watching for all students.
College Freshman,4,The whole town is supportive of the two universities that are in the same town.
College Freshman,4,Try the best you can during the SAT and ACT to get a better scholarship.
College Freshman,4,There's usually a variety of things to do at night on and around campus.
College Freshman,4,"Campus is very strict when it comes to violence or sexual violence, but as far as underage drinking, unless they can clearly see you with it, they cannot bust you or search your room."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is pretty diverse. While most students are from in state, a lot of sports players are from out of state. Also, there are many people with ethnic backgrounds and we have international students from many different countries."
College Freshman,4,Campus is very safe and well lit at night. I feel very safe on campus and campus security is always on duty. The health center is nice too.
College Freshman,4,"The computer labs are great. Also, printing on campus is free. However, the wireless network is sometimes hit and miss depending on where you are on campus"
College Freshman,4,"Being a liberal arts school, there are many to choose from"
College Freshman,4,"Pretty standard, mix of races and backgrounds."
College Sophomore,4,I do enjoy my program but I think that they need to make it have more classes.
College Sophomore,4,I think that the dorms are very clean and very fair in the housing lottery.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe when I walk around campus at night.
College Sophomore,4,The student involvement are good but the facilities could be better.
College Sophomore,4,The computer labs are available and very reliable.
College Student,4,"The Greek life here at Heidelberg is amazing simply because they are like brothers. The Greeks are the one who are the leader s of the school, who show outstanding community service skill, demostrate's superiority of academics, or what ever they think is a bug issue they want to address. I am considering becoming a Greek next semester.."
College Freshman,4,"Being a small school, professors truly do take a caring approach to their students. Professors learn who each student is because classes are small; you're not just a number to them. Teaching assistants are rarely used, so professors do teach the class and make sure you understand the knowledge. "
College Freshman,4,"I do believe the strictness is at a fair level. The administration just wants students to be safe, and not harm those around them."
College Freshman,4,"Due to a small campus, you truly get to know you're fellow students. All of the buildings are fairly close, which is nice in the cold weather. Every one of my professors have been amazingly helpful. There's not much I would change about this campus."
College Freshman,4,The process was extremely easy due to it al being online.
College Sophomore,4,I am very happy with my school choice
College Sophomore,4,Some of the top programs in the country
College Sophomore,4,There are new buildings but also old ones
College Sophomore,4,The athletic programs are very good
College Sophomore,4,Great teams for girls and guys. The volleyball team is awesome and very competitive. The football team is trying to beat Mount Union but not many teams have been able to do that yet.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel as if Heidelberg is very safe to walk around campus anytime and feel safe. Heidelberg has people on security 24 hours a day that make the campus a safer place to be. Then they also have keys that you have to swipe to get into every building. This will keep from unknown people from walking into campus buildings to keep it safer. Then there is also security checkpoints that are located around campus. If you feel as if you are in danger, you can go find on of these and there is an emergency button that will notify Heidelberg security and then another button for the police. There are many things that Heidelberg university does to keep their students as safe as possible."
College Freshman,4,"Our parking isn't the best, but relative to other colleges I think it's pretty great. Campus is small, so there really isn't more than a 5-7 minute walk anywhere. I've only had trouble finding a parking spot once all year, and I park literally within a 100 feet of my res hall. You don't have to drive from your dorm to anywhere on campus because everything is so close, so finding parking near your classroom isn't an issue."
College Freshman,4,"This campus is very excepting about diversity. Everyone here is treated the same and their is no discrimination because of your reigion, political beliefes ect. It is a great school and a great campus."
College Freshman,4,The classes range from nearly impossible to very easy. The one common factor among all of the classes which earns the aforementioned grade is the passion which all of the teachers have for their respective subjects. I love it.
College Freshman,4,"There is very good selection of restaurants off campus. We have many of the popular chain restaurants (McDonalds, Taco Bell, Dennys, etc) as well as a lot of locally owned diners and several ethnic options."
Alum,2,"One of the things that was important to me when I was deciding on colleges was the ability to study abroad. I asked if my scholarship would cover the cost of the university abroad and was told it would transfer. When I actually went to apply, the financial aid office told me that the type of scholarship I had didn't transfer. 

Mostly, professors are wonderful. However, there are many faculty and staff that act like the 18-22 year olds they teach (if not more immature). They gossip with and/or about their students and other faculty members. 

The health center is atrocious. There's a doctor there 7-8am which doesn't allow for a sick student (and may be resting, as is recommended when one is ill) to come in to see someone. When there's no doctor there, the nurses are often cold and unhelpful. They can't give you medication and don't seem to want to. The mental health ""professionals"" don't take you seriously and the whole counseling process is really a joke."
Freshman,2,"The faculty at Heidelberg as far as the Dean and Disability Services goes, is very poor. The professors were much more supportive. Money says a lot when it comes to this school, if you do wrong your parents can easily buy your way out of it. Very bias and discriminative towards people with disabilities. They do not support service dogs either, which is incredibly disappointing. They witch hunted for ways to kick a service dog off of campus. I plan on transferring after the year is over."
College Sophomore,2,The houses are breaking down and there is not much availability.
College Student,2,"I had my good days and bad days here in this town.. they have the recreation center for the towns people. parks, etc. They make sure there is something to do here in tiffin ohio"
College Freshman,2,The Wifi network goes down often and its hard to connect your phone to the Wifi
College Sophomore,2,Adults are concerned and try to get help for serious abusers.  It's hard for the freshmen and sophomores-those under 21- because there's a lot of drinking going on.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid people were great to work with but the cost of the school requires more financial aid so that I am not in debt up to my ears before I start working. I will be paying off loans for a LONG time and I will have to go to graduate school-more debt.
College Sophomore,2,The parking at Heidelberg is very limited. It is very difficult for students to find a parking spot. This does not seem fair because the students have to pay $50 for a parking pass. It makes space very limited and makes it pointless for students to bring a car to school. If more parking was available that would make it so much more convenient for everyone.
College Freshman,2,"For the most part freshman housing at Heidelberg is not good. We live in older dorms with not many new features. Some of the beds, desks, etc. are damaged and broken. There are nice dorms on campus as well. They just built a new dorm for freshman and sophomores a few years ago and that is very nice, but for the most part the dorms are old and run down."
College Sophomore,2,"There are parking lots, but the walking distance from the lots to some of the dorms is madness. Whoever picked the locations for the parking lots made a mistake. Plus, you are not always guaranteed a spot."
College Sophomore,2,Food Options – The only places nearby to eat are the basic fast food options which are fairly cheap.  If somewhere nicer is desired you have to drive 30 minutes to the closest city.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid is available, but not very accessible. Communication about financial aid is definitely sub par"
College Student,2,"Usually, parking at Heidelberg University is not a problem.  Recently, there have been floods in the area and several vehicles were severely damaged. An advanced warning system needs to be used."
College Freshman,2,Down Right Horrible – There is little transportation avaliable to those who dont have a vehicle on campus.Freshman are allowed to bring cars. Most people do have cars.But for people who dont its hard to find rides and have fun. Heidelberg has on bus its four dollars each way.
College Freshman,2,"Small, Smelly, and Expensive – Dorms are small and very old. They have no air conditioner and smell really bad. The price of the dorm is too expensive to live in for the value. The shower stalls are very molded with rust. There is train that passes through every 15 minutes, it so loud u cant hear a thing til it goes through."
Niche User,1,"Most professors incompetent or simply do not care enough to actually do their job well; pursuing a degree in at least half of the departments would be a complete waste of time.  Extremely toxic Greek life culture and athletic teams culture. Outside of track/cross-country, every frat, sorority, or sports team is a cult, and if you do not join one of them you're going to have a hard time.  Some school staff pretend to care about the school's Christian roots but it's just to trick newcomers into thinking it's a decent place. People in the admissions departments will deceive you and lie to you to get you to enroll. On-campus living is just plain unpleasant. Student body is generally composed of a bunch of adult babies."
College Freshman,1,its pretty bad nobody really wants anything to do with the fraternity's.
College Freshman,1,"Student Life is non existent. There is little variety in clubs, the frats and soroities are tiny and boring. The biggest party youll go to will have 20 people and the bar seen is terrible."
College Freshman,1,No one supports the teams unless its a huge game. Feels like a high school sports atmosphere 
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are old, dirty, and tend to smell horrible "
College Freshman,1,Worst decision I have ever made. Hopefully the next school is a better experience. 
College Freshman,1,These people charge you for anything! The wifi barely works and there is a 300 dollar fee.
College Freshman,1,Very small selection to choose from
College Freshman,1,"The health center is horrible. It takes hours to simply get cough medicine or cough drops. Safety is a concern when it comes to valuable items, never leave your door unlocked "
College Sophomore,1,"The city of Tiffin provides its students with stores that provide the essentials like Wal-Mart and basic fast food chains. Other than that, there is a movie theatre and a not so impressive mall. The nearest big city is Findlay, about 30 minutes way, where nice restaurants, shopping, and nightlife can be found."
College Sophomore,1,"Tiffin, has a few crappy bars. No shopping whatsoever----but there is a walmart! lol"
College Sophomore,1,"Your Sick? O Well – Fairly safe campus, but the health care facilities are extremely poor!Stoner (the health care office) only has a doctor available from 7-8am! The 2 nurses that work their are not allowed to give ne prescription drugs to student, they send you to a hospital 15 miles away. AND without school transportation this is awe full! I had mono and they wanted me to go to the doc in 5 ft of snow at 7am! couldn't do it. i was sick for almost over 1/2 a semester. the school didnt advice me on taking a medical leave or nething. Very disappointed with the berg."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is more geared towards commuters. Residents can only park in certain parking lots, many of which are across the street from their dorms, and are too small to accommodate the number of residents in the dorms."
College Freshman,1,"Heidelberg and the town of Tiffin are painfully boring. There is never enough to do, and there is nothing for underage people to do."

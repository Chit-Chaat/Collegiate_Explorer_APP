Sophomore,5,"Each professor took a slightly different approach to the online aspect (a lot more common due to Covid-19), but each one has made the online learning experience as interactive and effective as is possible. It has been a great experience in every online class thus far."
Freshman,5,"My teachers have been very understanding and accommodating in these circumstances. The online portal that my teachers use individually have been easy to navigate and ensure that the material is explained and understood. 
Although you have to pay for other online applications besides Canvas, I have found that it has been worth it, as they are very detailed and well structured. 
My education here, although it has been online, has been my saving grace. I feel like I will be well prepared to join the work force once I graduate."
Niche User,5,"UNC is a very excellent school for Nursing program, not only that but UNC stduents and professors are very excellent and very generouse to income students."
Freshman,5,"All of my classes were moved online this year, and I am taking a better liking to them then I thought. All of the professors are very understanding and are constantly working to make sure that everybody has a chance to succeed in this crazy COVID world. I am very appreciative of all my instructors and I love my classes!"
Senior,5,Classes taken online were laid out very nicely and it was very simple to know where to find assignments and how to contact professors if I had any questions.
Senior,5,It is relatively small and cheap college to attend. Everyone is very nice and the faculty are always willing to help students.
Senior,5,My experience at the University of Northern Colorado is very positive. The campus is beautiful and the atmosphere is very friendly. I'm going into my fourth year at UNC and I have learned a lot and pushed my artistic boundaries to create  different pieces of work. Through each class I have been able to explore different kinds of media to further my work. In the art department there are many classes and teachers that will push you out of your comfort zone and push your artistic ability.
Niche User,5,"University of Norther Colorado has a beautiful campus. Large trees, vibrant flowers that fill the air with such wonderful aromas. When I first stepped onto campus as a brand new freshman at 18 I was scared, but when I looked around, and the people I met, and the activities I was able to participate in, getting to know professors all those anxieties disappeared. I loved being at UNC for all of those things. I loved the connections I was able to make and the long life friendships and memories. Yes, these can be made at other universities however, I do not feel like you will have the full experience unless at University of Northern Colorado."
Niche User,5,"My learning experience at UNC was hand down one of the best. I was provided with the materials needed to exceed, and if I felt I needed more resources I was never afraid to ask, my professors were open and helpful. Yes, not all professors are the same but if you give them the same respect you wish they will return it. They are helping you figure out what you want to be when you grow up, they are apart of your resources to learn and guide you. Sometimes tough love is the way they need to be to best help you learn and scaffold for you to understand and make connections."
Sophomore,5,With COVID-19 we all had to switch over to the online classes and personally I found the transition really easy. The professors were very honest about their struggles and made sure we knew that they were doing their best but willing to help us. I created a nice schedule to keep me on track but the professors also made sure we were aware of any changes to the syllabus and schedule.
Junior,5,So far I love the University of Northern Colorado. I have met some really good people there and have had a great time. I loved all of my professors and can't wait to go back. I did not like the old President at the school but the new one is really good.
Junior,5,All of my classes got put online after spring break. I was not looking forward to it but it ended up not being a bad thing at all. my teachers did a really good job with it and I was super happy with how it ended up.
Junior,5,"Learning online rather than having a traditional education poses its own dilemmas. It can be extremely difficult for a student to learn material on their own in a virtual setting. However, in my experience all of my courses that have been online were provided in a well thought out manner. The information was given in a way that made it easy to learn and apply to course assignments. Faculty at UNC provide students with plenty of help in their online classes."
Junior,5,This institution provides a plethora of helpful resources that enable a student to succeed in life after graduation. The faculty at UNC are extremely helpful and go above and beyond to help their students thrive in their education.
Senior,5,"I am completing an online program and for me, I have found a great amount of support, great classes that are well taught, and an affordable tuition that gives me the ability to work and pay for as much of my college as I can while I am still in school."
Graduate Student,5,"The campus is gorgeous and well laid out. Faculty is warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. UNCO is super close to where I live which makes it convenient. The application process was straight forward and easy. As a new student, I am eager to see everything that University of Northern Colorado has to offer me but I have heard many positive reviews going into a two year graduate program."
Junior,5,I love how welcoming and homey the campus feels. My favorite place is the library because there are places to hide and study but also places to socialize with friends and classmates while studying.
Freshman,5,"I love how small the actual university is. It is an overwhelming feeling coming to a school with a class of 200+ students, but other colleges such as CU Boulder have up to 400+ students in one lecture hall. I prefer how quiet and calm it is here at the school not to mention how helpful everyone here is. Not only am I talking about the staff but the students as well. This place is diverse and friendly, a great way to get the college experience. There are so many resources to help you in just about every single class that you can take here, so that is also great!"
Sophomore,5,I have attended the university of northern Colorado for two years and I love everything about the school. This university does a great job on building a community that is inclusive and supportive to many individuals. One thing I would like to see change is more diversity on the campus. As this is a PWI I would like to see more students of color.
Graduate Student,5,"I have loved the faculty at UNC. They are very attentive, listen to their students and help us along the way throughout the program."
Freshman,5,"From the very first semester I observed how great the professors are in this school. My Biology and Chemistry professors were there to help after class hours and if they made a mistake, they were willing to change it. Fitting in was one of my biggest concerns entering UNC. However, on one of the very first days of college there was a huge event where campus activities, clubs, and sports were showcased. That was a great help to me since I didn't know how to get involved. I became part of Challenge, a Christian organization on campus, and it has been a huge blessing! These people helped me fit in and inspired me to love others."
Sophomore,5,"I have been a student at the University of Northern Colorado for two years now. Overall it has been I great experience, I have gotten involved with greek life (Pi Kappa Phi). The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has allowed me to grow as a person be involved with other students, give back, and keep my grades in check. 

The professors at the University of Northern Colorado are great, they are always working their hardest to make sure that each student is succeeding. The professors make sure you know and understand the knowlage rather than just providing it for you."
Freshman,5,"UNC is a great size of a campus. Although I have to walk across the whole campus sometimes, it is manageable. I can make it where I need to be in 15mins max most days. And on days where I dont want to walk there is a bus that makes getting across campus super easy. The classes have also been great. I was immediately put in classes related to my major so I was sure I had made the right choice."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of Northern Colorado has been excellent so far in my time here. The classes I am taking are amazing and the professors have been very nice and helpful to me. I have enjoyed the dorms and my roommate is very nice and we have become fast friends. The food in the dining halls is good most of the time and is worth the money I paid for it with many different options. While on campus, I feel safe and welcomed by other students and staff. I have also joined a sorority that has made my college experience even better in my short time here. Overall, my college experiment at UNC so far has been amazing and I look forward to the next three and a half years here at UNC."
Freshman,5,"So far, the University of Northern Colorado has been great for me. I've meet some fantastic friends, and have been able to be successful in all my classes due to the great professors."
Freshman,5,Amazing on campus feel. Everyone is very welcoming. The professors are amazing and truly want students to succeed. The dorms are rated best in Colorado which is very true. As a student you get free access to many things even streaming services! Also very diverse campus. You meet so many different types of people. They have so many clubs and activities to get involved in!
Alum,5,"Great school that provided me with great learning. The campus was small yet felt big enough, the staff and administration are so awesome and helpful. Class sizes were great and not packed with students. Greeley has so much to offer in the college town with affordable housing , great food, and awesome college culture. This was the best university for me !"
Niche User,5,I haven't gone to the school yet but I have visited it all the time. Since it is so close to home.  I love the campus. You can go anywhere and see many stores or even quite places.  The school has a great nursing program. That is the major that I was to go in. The one ting that they do need to change are the activity's that they have. I want the school to be more as a family have everyone be close and go to all the games.
Senior,5,The University of Northern Colorado is great school I have been here for 4 years and it has been amazing time. The professors that I've had have been great throughout the years. I would not change much about this school.
Freshman,5,"The staff and students are extremely nice, and very willing to help. Support system is set up pretty well to keep students in touch and succeeding."
Junior,5,"I may be bias, however, I know the University of Northern Colorado is absolutely amazing. I work for UNC and see new faces everyday. You cant go a week without meeting someone new and interesting. If you are thinking about coming here, but need an extra push come walk the campus with one of our amazing student ambassadors. GO BEARS!!!"
Junior,5,"University of Northern Colorado is a good school. They sure do help when you need it. I would like to see a change on the how long it takes to get help, and get much more information on the questions you may have."
Junior,5,"The university has been beneficial to me as a music student. I have been able to improve immensely as a performer, and the professors are always looking for ways to help. They are always helpful when you reach out to them and are always happy to help outside of the classroom."
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere that the UNC community gives! Like all schools, there are a few rough patches, including transparency in the financial aid department, and retention of subpar professors"
Freshman,5,"So far I've had a very good experience with UNC. All of the faculty has been very supportive and quick to respond, and the other students have made me feel very welcome and comfortable. It's a very good school with a very positive atmosphere!"
Graduate Student,5,I love UNC! their campus is the perfect size in a beautiful part of Colorado that is away from the busy big cities. The faculty is so helpful and encouraging. Their online classes are easy to navigate. I would go to any other school.
Freshman,5,"The class sizes are reasonable, the. dorms are nice, the dining food is very good.  The community is amazing, and everyone is kind and happy."
Sophomore,5,I will now be a sophomore and I have to say that I am absolutely in love with UNCO. I personally feel that it has all of the clubs and opportunities that can help me in succeeding in the major that I am pursuing. I lived in Lawrenson Hall my first year and will continue this upcoming year and I feel that that was a great choice in dorms because it exemplifies an apartment style living space.
Sophomore,5,UNC is so diverse. This school has one of the most beautiful campuses. Professors are always willing to help when needed. There are so many sports or clubs and activities at the school. You’d never get bored.
Sophomore,5,"Coming from Columbine High School I loved the small/medium community feel. I new that the University of Northern Colorado would be my home for the next four years because when my brother was up there he raged about how amazing his friends are and the people on campus are. How amazing the professors are, though you will find that one professor you just can't seem to connect with. 

In my major, Recreation, Tourism, and Hospitality, specifically because I was able to make friends fast not just friends in the class room but people whom I can go out with to the movies or get dinner."
Freshman,5,I love the campus. It is so small that you are always seeing people that you know which is super cool. Professors are always out and about around campus. It is a very pretty campus. In the winter with the snow it is just beautiful and then when all the flowers bloom in the spring it is beautiful.
Freshman,5,My experience with the University of Northern Colorado was amazing. The whole vibe of the school was amazing. The students and teachers gave you the facts about how the school goes. What are the hardest times and what are the easier times? it just amazing and I wouldn't trade this school with anything else.
Graduate Student,5,"The online Special Education graduate school program is excellent. The classes are well organizers, the teachers are responsive, and the schedule is flexible."
Niche User,5,"I am a Senior in high school, and I visited UNC twice. After visiting, I knew that UNC has a good community and the environment is amazing. Everyone is helpful and are willing put a hand out to support other UNC students; it's not so overwhelming like other big Universities. I would Highly recommend students like me to come here."
Freshman,5,Something I enjoy about the University of Northern Colorado is how friendly it is. I have never had a problem since I have been here with anyone. I am comfortable here and you can tell people who come here are focused on their academics.
Niche User,5,"I am planning to attend UNCO for the fall of 2019. I had a few options but this college in particular really stood out for me. The campus is located in the beautiful town of Greeley, Co. What I first fell in love with was the shear beauty of the 208 acre property. They have really done a good job of keeping the architecture of all the buildings on the college to as close as they first looked back when founded in 1889. Although the buildings look like there from 1889 they really have seriously done an amazing job with keeping the classrooms, dorms, and recreation buildings on the inside up to date. I love how personal this college feels for its size, they really try to make u feel like one of them even if you choose not go to there. Go Bears!!"
Freshman,5,It just feels like I'm at home here. I applied solely because they gave me an application fee wavier and when I got my college acceptances and have a few in state options in my home state of california but not really vibing with any of the UC or Cal States I decide to visit and I just knew UNCO was right for me.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere here. The people are great and very kind as well as accepting and understanding. The courses are challenging and the professors really want what is best for the student and can be very understanding when it comes to conflicts.
Sophomore,5,Amazing staff & amazing students. I have never felt more comfortable and welcomed on a college campus. Beautiful rec center and everything you need to succeed in your future schooling!
Freshman,5,I am very excited to be attending the college and I can't wait to really step out of my comfort zone and see what the school has to offer! I think that this is going to be an amazing and self-learning 4 years!
Freshman,5,I like the atmosphere of this school. All of the students are very nice and the professors care about their students. The students are academically challenged and most students graduate within 4 years
Freshman,5,"The University of Northern Colorado is a great place to be! Not only do the division 1 sports out shine many other Colorado schools, the programs offered are diverse and well accredited. Professors and other students are diverse and kind to all others. Campus life is good, I wish there was more city life rather than farm life, but besides that its wonderful!"
Junior,5,It’s a beautiful campus. At UNC  all the professors are wonderful and caring. Every residents hall has 24hour front desk so you can always ask for help.
Freshman,5,"The University of Northern Colorado has everything one can need, from campus activities, dorm living, athletics, and academics. The campus is so beautiful and needs to be seen to feel the community of Bears!"
Graduate Student,5,I completed my undergraduate degree at UNC and now I am working on my graduate degree through an online program at UNC. I love this university and have really enjoyed my educational experience. Faculty are experts in their field but still care about their students. I never felt like just a number in my undergraduate career and still have that same feeling in my online graduate program.
Sophomore,5,The thing I liked the most about UNCO is the atmosphere. I know a lot of people have a culture shock when going into college but UNCO helped a lot with the transition. There is so many nice people willing to reach out to you and help out connect with everyone to help you get the full college experience.
Junior,5,"I transferred to The University of Northern Colorado this past year from a community college. I was nervous, being a large University, that it would not be as personable and I would not get as much attention from my professors as I did at the community college. But I can happily say I found my place and every single class I took this past year I became close with all my professors and I knew every person in my classes by first name."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, the campus is amazing and is such a good environment! There are smaller classes with great professors making it easier to learn because of the smaller spaces. The school is not too big, but not too small either, its right in the middle. So far, I have had an amazing experience with this school and I can't wait for the future there!"
Sophomore,5,UNC is a great school and provides many opportunities to get connected with other students as well as make connections in the real world. I have enjoyed my time at UNC.
Sophomore,5,"This University has wonderful professors, resources, and activities for everyone. They are such an accepting school with zero tolerance for bigotry. The only bad thing is its location; there are some sketchy people that live by Bond Hall."
Sophomore,4,"This school has been amazing! The staff and professors ave been so accommodating with all of the Covid-19 chaos that has been going on this year, keeping up with communication and extending understanding for unforeseen struggles that this year has thrown at students."
Senior,4,"UNC is a good school especially for those who want to go into education, nursing, or theatre. It is much more affordable when compared to UC Boulder or CSU but the education offered is comparable. 

Physically UNC is a nice campus and easy to navigate without being scary or overcomplicated."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at UNC, and I am loving it very very much! I've met some wonderful people, both peers and faculty, and I enjoy all of my classes. I believe UNC was the right choice for me, and I hope other people can discover it for themselves as well!"
Alum,4,Being involved on campus made the time at the University of Northern Colorado better. It allowed you to make genuine connections with students and gave you opportunities to connect with staff.
Senior,4,"I would say this is a perfect place to go for a teacher education. They help you out every step of the way. It is a tough program to be sure, but it definitely prepares you for your career."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere. It has a good mix of small and large classes and has plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. The professors/instructors and people are great too, which makes for an awesome learning experience. While the surrounding area in Greeley isn't the more up-kept place, the city is really big, so there are lots of areas to explore and see what else is out there; you really get a good mix of economic classes to expose yourself to. Overall, the whole experience is pretty great."
Senior,4,The online learning experience was very different and I definitely missed going to campus. Regardless of the complete turn around my teachers were very good at changing the class so it could be less stressful changing to an online class. I had a good experience based on the fact that my teachers were very prepared and made changing classes to be online run smoothly.
Sophomore,4,I love the location first off because it can be nice and quiet and is just a beautiful place to live. I love the ability to walk to classes but also have the opportunity to have free bus transportation. Everyone is also so inclusive and I am able to feel like I have a place there. The professors are always really helpful and willing to get you to your goal. I do wish there was more clear information about the activities and other events happening so that I would know where to find new people.
Senior,4,"Transferring into UNC from another college was a little confusing credit wise, but the staff helped me so much in finding the correct course and putting in requests for substitutions for courses that didn't directly apply.  I love the professors in my field, they always check in, especially during remote learning. They have been flexible and helped so much during this crazy time."
Freshman,4,"I love being a UNCO Bear! Their music program is phenomenal, the professors are wonderful, and the atmosphere is very inclusive."
Alum,4,I was an Audiology and Speech Language Sciences (ASLS) major with minors in American Sign Language (ASL) and Psychology. The professors and faculty of the different programs were great. There were occasionally some issues with registering for classes and getting information about testing for graduate school.
Freshman,4,"What I love about UNC is that campus size is the right fit and you can get to know your community very well.  Also, the class sizes are really small compared to other universities which allow you to get one on one connection with your professors."
Niche User,4,"i only went there to visit the campus and tour it, and i loved the size of the campus and fellowship of the tour guides."
Freshman,4,"As college freshman, I am use to having  to share a limited number of supplies but at college I no longer have to do that. I like that UNC has more and enough room and equipment for all the students how go there."
Freshman,4,"UNC has a generally safe atmosphere and great programs. My major complaint is the fact that UNC is currently attempting to lower the funding for our so needed multicultural classes. That being said, the multicultural classes offered are phenomenal and worth taking."
Freshman,4,"going into my second semester of freshman year i feel as if the University has really helped me prepare for what’s next. although there has been plenty of screw ups on both ends i believe that the university is doing their best to help me become the best i can be. with be a collegiate athlete i am working hard to do what i have to be a great student athlete, with student coming first."
Sophomore,4,"Almost all of the professors that I have had have been very personable, helpful, and genuinely care about you and your education. The class size is perfect for the Professors to get to know each student and for the students to get to know the teacher. 

The food is very poor and the biggest problem at UNC!"
Sophomore,4,"The music school is amazing. The professors are some of the most caring individuals in my life to date. The music students are a tight group but will always add new people.

As for the university itself, I think there is a lack of critical thinking pushed in core classes because instead of the professors teaching multiple views and letting us decide what our opinion is, they teach their opinion as fact. I find this especially true in classes on sociology, race, and gender.

Overall, I love my school. Every school has flaws but that only allows space for good change which can definitely be initiated by students. However, I know this will only happen when we take full advantage of the power we have as students."
Freshman,4,"This institution is a very welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds, ethnicity, and identities. Not only does one receive a fantastic education from outstanding professors, but a warm environment that is safe and supportive. 'Sko Bears!"
Freshman,4,"Alright UNCO is a large campus but with a manageable amount of people. You can easily find parties but can just as easily find endless internship opportunists. The people are diverse and that means every one is mindful, hopefully."
Freshman,4,"So far already very satisfied with my existence here, even as a freshman I am really enjoying life here.  Classes are good, not too hard not too easy.  Professors are very personal and one on one with their students because classes that are big are not insanly big to the point of not being able to connect with students. Tons of different connections and food options. Most people are very friendly and there is always some activity that you could be able to do any time of the week. Nothing is left outdated and unkept, very nice university very happy to be here."
Sophomore,4,"I recently transferred into this university after an awful experience at another school. I originally didn't want to come here because it's in Greeley but it turned out to be the best fit for me out of all the schools I applied to transfer to. The campus seems big at first but it's easy to navigate and class sizes are not too big but not too small. Most classes I'm in are lectures, which I prefer over smaller, interactive classes. People here are generally nice and I feel a lot more welcomed here than at my last college. Some professors are great, others aren't but I think that's how it is everywhere. I also think the dorm quality is great and I like that campus is kind of close to other towns and cities so I don't have to stay in Greeley on weekends. I am having trouble choosing a major and it's kind of hard to find guidance from anyone but that't my only complaint right now.  Overall, it's a good school and I hope I choose to stay here for my next few years of college."
Freshman,4,"I have not started school yet, but everything seems great! The school provides a ton of resources for students, and everyone here is very friendly. The dorms are nice and well kept, so is the campus. The food is alright, the best part id the variety. So I can't wait to continue my journey here and experience all college has to offer."
Junior,4,"My experience at UNC has had its ups and downs, none of which were solely the responsibility of the university itself. Any concerns that I had with professors, supervisors, guides, or staff members were handled respectively and with care. I appreciate the guidance that comes from the university and their counselors are top notch."
Junior,4,Many of the professors are very kind and respectful towards their students. The faculty are also always willing to help when needed.
Junior,4,The University of Northern Colorado overall is a very good school. The academics are up to par and I feel as though I am Learning quite a bit. The profesors I have had go above and beyond to help me and ensure that I am getting the proper education and help I need in my four year journey.
Niche User,4,"I went to University of Northern Colorado for dance camp and the dorms were super nice. The staff were super friendly, super supportive and respectful. I would love to go visit and go see games."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy a majority of the professors and the access to technology on campus. It is very nice to be able to attend workshops as well and have open tutoring when needed. There are so many diverse clubs as well.
Freshman,4,"I  love the university size, and the smaller class room sizes. I just wish the school had a bigger nursing program"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Northern Colorado is the gem of Greeley. The class sizes are small, every dorm is very very nice compared to other schools (especially for the price). The tutoring center is incredibly helpful and covers a huge range of subjects. The food is good with lots to choose from."
Senior,4,"Most professors are good and accessible. The campus is pretty and it is very safe. Greeley is pretty dull and I don't feel safe going out alone at night. Also, need to be able to put up with the manure smell which is present most of the time."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at UNC! Would recommend to anyone that doesn't mind the smell of Greeley every once in awhile. Loved every professor I had directed to my major and will use what I learned for my future career. I had a great time attending this university, got my school work done while being on a sports team here and also had fun with my friends on the weekends!"
Alum,4,I had a great experience at UNCO. I think they could improve on how they spend their budgets. They spent millions of dollars on a building that they didn't need and now are really in debt. They are really good at listening to student feedback on teachers.
Sophomore,4,"I really love the community!! Everyone is willing to help each other, whether it's figuring out where your classes are or help with financial aid. It's also not too big where you're just another student filling one of the seats, professors know your name and know your individual progress in class. I wish the university was more organized with their programs."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus. It's very open, but not too far apart. If you're really up for it, you could walk anywhere on campus. The college has great professors, for the most part. There are a couple I would avoid, but they were luckily one time professors for me."
Freshman,4,"This university has many pros and cons! The cost of admission is very high for a school with such a small campus and not very nice dorms as well, but some of  the pros are the professors and the excellent business program they provide."
Freshman,4,I like that the professors and faculty try to get you involved and put on events for student to have something to do.
Freshman,4,My experience at the University of Northern Colorado has been very good to me and others. They do what they can to make it easy and help guide you with nearly every step of the way. From before your first days to your last. Everyone has good humor and good attitudes making UNCO positive atmosphere to be in.
Freshman,4,"The campus is not oversized and easy to maneuver. The building are well kept, and the campus staff is willing to help with problems. The professors are also willing to adapt certain assignments or test dates to ensure success for the students."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere of the school. Everyone is nice and polite. It also a great campus to live on.
Sophomore,4,"I like the diverse community, there is always something going on. Very easy to get involved in many extra curriculum activities. The academic programs are amazing, very competitive to get in. Makes you strive to do the best you possibly can."
Junior,4,"Overall the college is fairly good. Students and faculty are around and what to help you succeed. There are a lot of resources and events offered to students.
However, some of the programs only have one teacher for upper division classes and the timing of events aren't great for students who are commuting from near by towns."
Freshman,4,"This school has a bit of funding issues, but it is very nice. Most people are very kind and the atomasphere is great! Easy to find a job and dorms are pretty good too :)"
Freshman,4,"So far I'm loving this university.  All of my professors have been great, and very helpful, and I'm happy that I decided to attend the University of Northern Colorado."
Freshman,4,"I think just about everything about UNCO is good. The only thing is the smell, but that can't really be helped"
Freshman,4,"I love how everyone fits in it feels like everyone has a family. it is a fun campus! the food could use some improvement. diversity is great and so is the academics. There are a lot of girls compared to guys here, tho."
Niche User,4,I’d say that I don’t ever regret attending the University of Northern Colorado. I had a great learning experience personally & academically. The friends I met there were great. Most of the professors were helpful. Although there were little diversity. I didn’t feel comfortable as a minority. Besides the lack of diversity the school was a pretty good school.
Senior,4,"Faculty has been A DREAM. Lovely and sharp professors with a lot of knowledge. School lacks funding, especially the art programs. If you are a business, nursing, or education major the funding won't be a problem. Relatively inexpensive compared to other state institutions, and decent living areas."
Freshman,4,"This is a great university. It was a perfect choice. My only reccomendation is if you don't live in the area, make sure you're ready to move away from your parents because it will be hard at first."
Senior,4,"Very friendly and welcoming staff.
Most diverse school in the state of Colorado, but I would like to see more improvement. 
Academics are second to none. 
Sports are ok, we are not the best school, but we do show up when we play.
Overall, would recommend for the staff alone as they are like a family to me."
Sophomore,4,"So far I have truly enjoyed being a UNC bear! I have a variety of professors that so far have all been pretty good, the campus is very beautiful and the people are cool too. So many different kinds of people are around has meant a lot of great conversations."
Freshman,4,"One thing I love about UNC Greeley is it’s very open minded. No one is judged, and you can be yourself. They make sure I am safe. They also make sure I get the appropriate guidance and information. I also like the free tutoring and study group idea. Nothing needs to change for me. This school is perfect for me."
Alum,4,"I absolutely love the campus and the overall feel of the school, but Greeley is kind of a gross town. Student life is great and there are a bunch of clubs and orgs you can take part in."
Senior,4,I love the campus. You don't feel like you're in Greeley when you're on campus. It's got a lot of options for being a smaller university. I like the faculty and students as well.
Sophomore,4,I like how the people at the campus want to see you succeed. They take the time to help you and make sure you know what to do. I would like to see more extracurricular activities being offered
Junior,4,"The school is amazing with really good facilities and great programs along with teacher. North/ South hall dorms are the best I’ve ever seen. They look super new and extremely confortable and clean. The downside is the location- Greeley. In the end, you get used to it like a second home."
Graduate Student,4,"Good professors and classes, read program and college information very carefully and ask questions to prevent delay in degree completion."
Junior,4,Your university experience is exactly what you make of it.  While I believe that there is a lack of diversity I think that is because it is a predominately white university.
Junior,4,My experience here was different than expected in a positive way. Living in the dorms was hard at first but you meet and connect with a lot of other students in your hall and other halls. The food is pretty good but sometimes it's repetitive. I loved majority of the professors/teachers I've had and felt they truly cared about their class and your success. The library is my favorite place to go and hide out to study because the study rooms and seating selections really allow me to be productive and not distracted; there is also some great coffee/breakfast burritos at the coffee corner.
Junior,4,"I love this university. It has many passionate professors that make their classes enjoyable, and most are easy to work with when you need help. I personally don't have the time to get involved on campus but there are so many clubs, sports, and a variety of Greek life for people that want to get involved. There's always tables for clubs and fundraisers around campus when the weather is nice. Everyone here is friendly too I've had some amazing ab partners."
Junior,2,"I ended up taking all of my classes online, but I am not great at distanced learning. I don't believe the teachers were the issue here, I just have a very social and interactive major/emphasis which caused a lot of uncertainty. The biggest hurdle was that my student observations were cut short, but not a lot could be done for that."
Sophomore,2,"This school has no money and is 10 million dollars in debt, which affects every aspect of school like, primarily the food they can provide and the faculty they fire."
Alum,2,"Just don't go here. I don't have enough characters to explain why you shouldn't. But I will say that it is not worth over $20,000 a year."
Niche User,2,Non diverse horrible food horrible experience even worst price. Working there as a student I was paid less than minimum wage and often getting checks months late . Meth and racism is rampant around the campus and area.
Freshman,2,"For me, classes tended to be really slow paced and unchallenging. The campus isn't anything special, and the surrounded city of Greeley is very unappealing. The food is alright, but other than that, there isn't anything special about this school."
Junior,2,affordable school with a great nursing program. the town of greeley however is lacking with a high crime rate and sub par nightlife for a college town
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the professors are either brand new and inexperienced or just do not know what they are talking about. The head of the chemistry department is a perfect example of this. However, most of the classes are taught by TA's because it is cheaper for Norton. Overall I feel very limited."
College Freshman,2,i never really notice them
College Junior,2,"Do not stay in a dorm with community showers, they will never be clean. I'm not sure what the cleaning staff does when they close the restrooms to clean them but it can't be much. There is so much hair in the showers that I didn't take a shower for the last 2 weeks of school. It never gets cleaned out and it's repulsive. The dorm rooms in Wilson and Weibking are abysmal. They are so tiny it's ridiculous."
College Junior,2,"The real question is what do the greeks even do on campus? Most people would not even be able to name 5 fraternities or sororities on campus. I know they're supposed to do philanthropy, but I never see them. The people who join greek life are seen as people who are so lonely they had to pay for friends. Nobody really cares about parties thrown by greeks."
College Junior,2,I was on the Track and Field team. The program is severely underfunded. In the winter we run inside next to the basketball court because we don't have an indoor track facility to use. The talent is under appreciated by the coaches who do not respect their athletes. The weight lifting coach is not certified. The men's basketball and football programs have all the money and all the fame. Students and administration alike bow at their feet and greet them with full ride scholarships in return for a 2.0 GPA. On the other hand track athletes with a 4.0 get no reward in scholarships. At the track meets there is little to no turn out or support from the student body.  The world of athletics at this school is unfair and disappointing.
College Junior,2,"This school only has 9,00 undergraduate students. Which means there is a lot of relationship drama. There is a 60:40 ratio of girls to guys, which means good guys are scarce and everyone tries to date the same people. In addition, this school is severely under funded. Scholarships are hard to come by if you're not the best in one field or another. Classes are not to difficult and they took a lot of my credits from my honors courses in high school, which is why I'm not transferring. Otherwise I would leave the school and the tiny insignificant town it resides in."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is the most unsocial place I have ever been to. I was hoping for a ""college experience"" but that is just not possible at my school. I really only went here for the program I am in."
College Sophomore,2,"Our athletics are not good, except women's volleyball. Why does the school spend so much money on athletic facilities, when all the teams stink? They should put more funding to the programs that UNC is known for, like education, music, and the arts. We have poor facilities, whereas sports majors get really nice facilities."
College Freshman,2,"Athletic teams are definitely not the best at UNC, but a lot of people join intramural sports."
College Freshman,2,The RA's don't plan or advertise any fun activities for the floors and there's quiet hours which aren't enforced on my floor because there is always drunk girls screaming at 1 AM while the RA does nothing.
College Sophomore,2,"I am not going to sit here and say that UNC's sports teams are good. To be honest they are quite terrible, so awful that I think I have gone to one football game! The sports are not a big deal here and are almost of a second thought. Not many people attend the games, just because the results are horrendous. However, the club sports are way more attended the Varsity sports. For example, hockey is a major sport that everyone at UNC attends too."
College Sophomore,2,"While I am on campus I feel safe but once I go into town or away from the school, I definitely want to be with people. The police do make effort to help you feel safe and we do have panic buttons throughout campus. ""Never cross the railroad tracks."" Greeley is known for gangs and violence. Just be smart and stay close to campus."
College Freshman,2,I'm to far away from home and I don't have anyone to guide me
College Sophomore,2,No one goes to the games especially the football games. Some people go to the hockey games.
College Junior,2,The only financial aid I received was a valedictorian scholarship for $500 for having a 4.0 GPA in high school.  I did not receive any financial aid.
College Junior,2,People go to the football games mostly to drink. I mean its fun up until maybe halftime. The team is good but not great. UNC doesn't really pay attention to much of the Athletics.
College Freshman,2,"I absolutely hate the food in the dining halls, 90 percent of the time its gross. The only thing I ever enjoy eating is in the UC and it's only open once a day."
College Freshman,2,"As a vegan who also has special dietary needs due to medical issues, there is almost nothing I can eat besides a stir fry and a limited salad bar.  Yet, ever with multiple doctor's notes, I was still required to be on a meal plan. I am throwing away money, and still have to spend money that I don't have on groceries and supplements."
College Freshman,2,"Terribly overpriced, cramped, living quarters."
College Junior,2,"There are so few things I can eat in the dining hall that it is hard for me to justify spending so much money on the meal plan. There are not very many choices. I can imagine the meal plans they have set up work great for athletes or people who eat a lot of food, but for someone who doesn't eat very much, it is definitely not worth it."
College Sophomore,2,I don't participate in the party scene.
College Freshman,2,Greeley is not the best. Just saying
College Freshman,2,Hard to party if you are not in greek.
College Junior,2,Some of the worse team in Division I athletics.
College Freshman,2,Not like CU or CSU in terms of professors. The few good instructors that are worth the money are impossible to get classes with.
College Sophomore,2,It is so gross and VERY unhealthy.
College Sophomore,2,"The cops shut EVERYTHING down, even if the party is not out of hand and when everyone is 21 and up."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything around is poor quality chains, everything gets old, fast."
College Sophomore,2,"Around Greeley is very dangerous, most houses are dilapidated. In order to get something affordable, you will have to deal with a high crime rate."
College Sophomore,2,They keep to themselves and drink and party every week.
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do and it smells very bad.
College Junior,2,to be honest the local college i went to didnt have that great of a school spirit i guess.
Recent Alumnus,2,The on campus bus can be pretty convenient but transportation and night and downtown especially on weekends is either expensive for taxis or unreliable. UNC really needs some form of transportation for areas around campus on weekends.
College Senior,2,"The wireless around campus sucks, especially in butler Hancock."
College Junior,2,Greeley is not known for great dining experiences whether you are a student or full time resident
College Sophomore,2,Mostly fast food and chains. Very rarely can you find a unique restaurant. I do not know if there is even a vegetarian type restaurant. The off campus dining needs more options. Plenty of burger places.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life here is not huge but it is growing. The girls are incredibly cliquey and do not venture out of their comfort zone often. Some Greeks are very open but most aren't. Fraternities on the other hand are wonderful and they are very welcoming of anyone and everyone.
College Sophomore,2,"Greeley is a small farm town, so there is not a lot of things for college student to do. We pretty much have to go to a different city to do something fun."
College Freshman,2,It was really hot at the beginning of school and now that it's winter it's absolutely freezing all the time!
College Freshman,2,"No one has any school spirit around here because all the teams suck. I only know one person who played an intramural sport, and she wasn't very serious about it. The gym isn't great, but it'll do."
College Freshman,2,"There's almost nothing to do in Greeley besides drink or do drugs, which is still hard to do if you don't already have connections here. A lot of people just get trashed in their rooms."
College Junior,2,The permit costs to much and the parking services can give out tickets for the most outrageous stuff. The tickets are usually $20. You don't need a car most of the time but it does come in handy other times. 
College Junior,2,"We don't live in a very safe town, so it's not a good idea to walk alone at night. The police officers will escort you if you would like and they help you stay safe. "
College Sophomore,2,"The school requires students who would like to park on campus to pay an outrageous amount of money but there is not nearly enough parking spots or even lots to justify buying a parking pass. There is not a real need for a car if you are a freshman living in the dorms and eating at the dining hall because everything you need is within walking distance, although if you live off campus then there is a higher demand for a car. "
College Sophomore,2,The wifi is always booting you off. 
College Sophomore,2,"Yikes, the men at UNC are extremely below regular standards and since it's such a big school for music, education, and nursing, about 70% of the school consists of females. And lucky for you men, the females at the school are really attractive I think! Maybe I'm biased, but I do think the female outrank the men a lot. HOWEVER, all the people at UNC are the nicest people I've ever met. :)"
College Freshman,2,School is located around run down areas. Though some very nice houses.
College Student,2,The price paid for dorms is ridiculous. Live off campus as soon as you can. 
College Student,2,I always forget that we have security until there's a cop car. 
College Student,2,I only feel safe when I walk with a man at night. 
College Student,2,"It isn't good. Enforcement is strict, but that doesn't stop anyone. "
College Sophomore,2,"Greeley? Nightlife?
There are two dance clubs. Maybe a couple bars."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not care for the Greek life - it is not my thing. But it is a big part of campus, just not for me."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall food is okay. Not great, not terrible.

It's nice that there's always a lot of options, though, so there's always something you will like."
Freshman,1,"The classes were very knowledgeable, yet everything else was terrible. I lived on campus and there was a lot of spiders and roaches in the dorms and bathrooms. The financial office repeatedly gave me the wrong information, they are part to blame for me loosing my financial aid."
Graduate Student,1,"Academic Appeals Board is a ridiculously pathetic. What should have been an simple and easy correction, turned into wasting over 4 months and over 60 pages of proof because professors don't want to own up to their mistakes. Don't even bother trying to get help from this process because all the professors know each other and they will obviously stand up for their coworkers over a student. It doesn't matter if you have straight black and white facts, they will avoid answering difficult direct questions and say that their decision is final and to move onto the higher person. The higher person, will do EXACTLY the same thing, until you run out of people to go to, and your facts are NEVER ADDRESSED. It is the most biased and one sided battle that you will never win. I have had many classmates warn me about it, but I didn't believe that it could be so corrupt. "
College Sophomore,1,"This school is an absolute joke! The first month into school and they STILL have students living in lounges and study rooms because they accepted too many students; Kay Norton did do a good job of keeping that hushed from the population though. I was moved from a dorm that I booked the beginning of second semester last year! Most of the professors are average at best, but it is not their fault. The school gets new professors nearly every year. The head of the chemistry department is an absolute nightmare. He does not truly know what he is doing and constantly gets math and other concepts wrong; just read his incorrect textbook. This is true for many departments. However, this year Kay Norton got rid of most of the professors and replaced them with TA's that she does not have to pay very much at all because they are also students here. I feel like this limits my learning, as well as all of the students, because they are not as experienced when it comes to teaching college courses, though some are very knowledgeable. As basic as this next complaint may sound, it is truly important for students in this generation of college learning. The WiFi never works! When Kay Norton is confronted about it, she simply states ""she cannot get good WiFi for the university,"" yet everyone around us can. She also does not heed the advice given by the students, but simply regurgitates the information they brought up into a lengthy email stating why certain tips cannot be implemented due to money or whatever other excuse she can come up with. I find this somewhat alarming considering she was able to give herself a $100,000 raise; this is after she raised everyone's tuition by a couple grand and then took more away from us. Overall, I feel this university has taken a giant leap backwards and has gone from one of the best value universities in Colorado, to a greed-driven corporation focused on making the greatest profit while providing the least quality of service possible."
College Sophomore,1,The sports on campus have no promotion and it is even a struggle to find out when games are occurring.
College Freshman,1,I am having a seriously hard time finding any aid to help me through school. All I do is keep applying but it's still not happening for me.
College Junior,1,"Do not even try to park in a space without a permit even for just a minute to drop something off, they will find you and fine you."
College Junior,1,the local college i went to there was no housing.
College Junior,1,When it's bad weather it's the worst. The sidewalk become hard to walk on and it takes longer to get to class. 
College Sophomore,1,The athletic aspect of my school is very sad in the essence that sporting events are often a huge part of the whole college experience. I am a cheerleader and often times we are cheering to an empty set of bleachers because students have entirely no interest in attending these events or there is a possibility that they simply do not know what is going on at our school. 
College Student,1,Do not park without a permit. They give out tickets like nobody's business. 
College Senior,1,"Parking sucks. Dumb rules, and they write a ton of tickets. Money making machine!"
College Junior,1,Parking passes are super expensive specially for business students. It is horrible that at times you can't even find spots and you have to go park somewhere else and have to pay and end up being late because you can't find a spot. During the winter time is worst because people forget how to park and they don't remove the snow quickly.
College Senior,1,"The facilities in Denver are run down. There are enough classrooms, but no library no real study area."
College Freshman,1,UNC police are very strict. Every party gets busted by at least midnight. They walk up and down the alleys ways just to give students MIP's. Every student that parties regularly has had at least one MIP throughout their 4 years of being here. It is said that ticketing the students is a way for Greeley to get money towards the city. I don't know if that is true but you have to be very cautious and responsible here. The party scene is big on the weekends but the police kill everyones vibe.
College Junior,1,"If you want a nightlife, choose a different school."
College Senior,1,"No Love for Non-Residents – Because UNC is a public university, funds for non-residents are limited.  I have received no scholarships from the institution.  The financial aid process is sometimes tricky."
College Freshman,1,"It's Greeley....There are two night clubs in the whole town, most the time they will not be very busy (except on Whiskey Wednesdays). There's one nice hookah bar that gets very busy, and a mall that is very close to campus. There are a few good bars to hit up but that's about it. At least Fort Collins is near by?"
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid was a little troubling. The main problem was getting scholarships. Hard to get any, don't offer a lot, and hard to find."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a fan of Greek life, I think most of the girls are very rude and mean and feel as if they are above everyone else."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather determines the activities and life of the campus more times than not. If the winter is bad, you will only see people out for class, and meal times. Unless it is the first snow fall. More times than not the sidewalks are clear for walking. Class does not get cancelled very often due to weather which can be both a blessing and a curse. You definitely know when it is warm out because you have to avoid frisbees, football games and kite flyers. The camous is amazing and caters to the weather with the events, activities and items offered."

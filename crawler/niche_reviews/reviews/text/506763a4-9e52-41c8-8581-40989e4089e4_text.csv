Sophomore,5,"I love this university. I have made so many close friendships and gotten involved with many things on campus. They make it easy for their students to be able to get involved in multiple things such as a work-study, Greek life, campus ministries, and much more. They also offer scholarships for so many different activities. I know, for myself, it was hard to find a college that gave cheerleading scholarships, but Midland was right there to offer me one. Not only that, the scholarships help tremendously with the price of attendance. I would recommend Midland to anyone who is looking for a college because of these reasons!"
Sophomore,5,"Midland Makes me feel like I’m in the right place. The faculty knows me and I always feel like if I feel uncomfortable with something it gets looked at. Plus, there are so many great opportunities for me"
Freshman,5,The teachers helped us a lot during the times of online learning and you really felt their support although you didn’t see them in person.
Freshman,5,"You feel the support of your teachers, coaches and other students every day, which makes it easier for you to be successful in the classroom and on the field. Everybody gets treated respectfully and you feel comfortable wherever you are. Meeting new people everyday and making friendships is easy because of the really familiar atmosphere here."
Junior,5,"Being in class while it was online was honestly the best part of my day. My professors took time to let us interact with each other (talk, laugh, share stories) all while making sure we also completed that days lessons. It brought me a sense of normalcy in those crazy times. Most of my professors even had individual zoom call with all the students multiple times during the online learning to make sure they were doing OK with it and to check in on how their students were doing in general. Going though this pandemic Midland did an awesome job of making sure I felt heard and cared for."
Junior,5,The staff and atmosphere are amazing and gives me such a warm feeling! I am able to achieve my academic goals knowing I have the full help and support of my professors.
Sophomore,5,"I would say that my professors did an amazing job with the transition to online classes and I am really grateful for that. Just knowing that they spent so much time trying to transition all of their content and teaching ways to online was so encouraging to me. Professor Manish and Nick Schreck were two of the best professors I had through online learning because they would do separate Google Hangouts with me so I could ask questions and I knew/could tell they spent a lot of time outside of their normal time to make the transition work with everything. I liked when we wouldn't meet all together when we would normally meet for class, sometimes because we could easily do the work on our own too. That is a side note, but it made it awesome for me to be able to enjoy my time at home more through these bad times. The only really sucky thing about my online experience was that I felt like some of the work in classes was busy work. It was also hard to separate between being at home & school.."
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at Midland University. My experience so far has been such a dream (for the most part). Of course there are difficult times and negative experiences, but from the University itself, I have been provided with nothing but opportunities and support. My overall experience is definitely a positive, 5-star one! I would recommend Midland to anyone, and I do that all the time to the people from my high school since I'm out-out-state and nobody from my hometown really knew about MU before I came here!!! Orange and Blue, GO MU!!"
Senior,5,"I have loved my experience at Midland! The learning environment, the culture of campus, and the people are among my favorite things about Midland. I have been given many amazing opportunities and have been happy with my time here!"

Senior,5,I love Midland! It’s a great school with outstanding professors and a family vibe on campus.  It fully encourages involvement on campus and has the resources to allow all students to follow their passions while staying on top of their academics.
Junior,5,"Of course with the recent pandemic going on, all schools were required to switch to online learning for the remainder of this spring semester. With all these sudden changes, I feel that my school handled the situation very well. We were able to transition smoothly, and I personally had no problems whatsoever."
Junior,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Midland University so far. I play football here at Midland, so balancing a school/sport life is pretty difficult. However, Midland has made it much easier to handle, and has made my experience pretty great. For any high school senior that is considering a college that will give them a great education, I highly recommend Midland University!"

Niche User,5,"Midland is an amazing, small college. Everyone there knows everyone and there are awesome people there to talk to."
Alum,5,"What I loved most about Midland were the resources!  Not everywhere you go do you get free unlimited access to all the extra departments we have. Like the Personal and Career Development Center and our Student Affairs! They are all amazing! Another would be the community feel everyone talks about it and you don’t quit understand until you step foot on campus but it is truly a feeling like no other, and something you don’t get just everywhere! Only thing I would change about Midland is for it to last forever:)"
Junior,5,Great professors in the biology department and smaller class sizes allow me to get to know my professors well and learn the material better. They are always making sure I am succeeding in my classes and have the resources to do so.

Works Here,5,"Amazing people,  great students and faculty! Students are well-prepared for their life and career.
The food isn't bad either..."
Freshman,5,Midland's small size is very helpful as a student. We are able to create relationships with our professors and get heavily involved on campus! I also like the security of the campus. There is not a time that students are worried about walking around because of the safety.
Niche User,5,I love the way that everyone has been so welcoming and willing to help me. I love the business administration program and the way they want you to get involved in the community.
Freshman,5,"Midland University has the nicest and most outgoing staff that I have ever met. The professors are truly there to help you and make your experience the best that it could be.

Even the students are very friendly and are always willing to help each other out."

Sophomore,5,"Midland University has a diverse culture and that's what I like the most about it! Each year Midland continues to grow as a school and as a student body. Everyone knows everyone on campus so there is always support when you need it. Also, I love how the teachers know each student more than just their name. All of the staff truly care about each individual. One thing that I would like Midland to change is the food in the cafeteria. I would like to have healthier options such as salads, sandwiches, fruits, and other healthy foods. I love Midland and I wouldn't want to go to any other school."
College Sophomore,5,"Majority of the professors are great. Classes are very small, so this will allow more one on one with your professor and they will get to know you on a more personal level if you allow it."
College Sophomore,5,"Midland has a lot of diversity. We basically have people of all races, we have people that are from other countries that come to Midland to participate in athletics. Midland is also accepting to individuals what are straight, gay, or bi."

College Freshman,5,They make sure that all of us feel safe.

College Freshman,5,Even though there are downsides I love Midland and am glad I chose it
College Freshman,5,My advisor helps me out with everything all professors are nice and helpful
College Junior,5,"Midland is very diverse. There are a variety of students and teachers with ethnicities, religious views, sexual orientation and backgrounds that differ from the rest.  The different races, backgrounds and sexual orientation don't only hang out with  their own clicks, but everyone is mixed together and hanging out together. I really enjoy that about Midland because we're all together as one instead of split into different groups."
College Senior,5,"The school does a great job of promoting sporting events, and they do a great job promoting intramurals! There is always something going on for athletes and non-athletes! The facilites are fantastic! The campus gym and weight room is open to anyone, and every student recieves a free membership to the local YMCA!"
College Senior,5,"The secuirty department on campus is always out and about! They will walk anyone to their car if they don't feel combfortable, and they handle every type of situation! They are always there to lend a hand and there is someone working 24-7!"

College Freshman,5,the teachers are great here. they really care about you and take the time out of their day to work with you
College Freshman,5,"I am extremely happy with the academic programs at Midland University. The professors are all extremely competent and have a lot of experience in their respective fields to share with the students, and they all have a passion for teaching and education that I just never saw in high school. The class sizes are relatively small and the professors really take the time to get to know you as an individual and get invested in your success."
Recent Alumnus,5,The teachers here are amazing and helpful. They really make everyone feel welcome. There are a ton of places for students to just go hang out and relax.
Recent Alumnus,5,The school is big on keeping everyone involved on whats going on oncampus. The always let you know about the big games coming up so you can go support them.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are tons of computers to work on in the library and other places. It is very helpful for the printing to be free as well.
Recent Alumnus,5,The internship I am in now is for 3 credits and I have to do 135 hours but it is fun and the people I work with are amazing and helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,Parking is great here. You don't have to pay for a parking pass which is nice and also it is pretty easy to find a parking spot.
College Junior,5,"I love the Education Program at Midland. It has great professors who want to be there and who want to turn you into great future educators. There are opportunities available for internships and because of the great success rate Midland has in their teaching program, jobs are calling you right after you graduate to hire you on the spot. It is a very pristine program to be in. The workload is a little rough with reading, but it's worth it, and mainly common sense since it's being a teacher. I love their program!"
College Junior,5,"Always parking, campus isn't very large so it's all reasonable and within walking distance."
College Junior,5,They always have plenty of parking and you dont have to pay for a parking pass. The campus is small so you dont have to park really far away from campus.
College Freshman,5,There are very few students that partake in drugs here. Midland is a very safe campus!
College Freshman,5,The psychology professors at Midland are amazing. They are all experienced in their fields and bring an entertaining aspect to class.
Sophomore,4,"The majority of midlands classes are half online when it comes to assignments, so when it came to completely transferring to online learning it wasn't a huge change outside of the lectures."
Senior,4,I love the size of the school. Every experience I have with the campus and school has been nothing but positive
Sophomore,4,"Going online was a struggle for Midland at first due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the professors adjusted very nicely to the transition which made it easier for the students. The administration of Midland gave the professors the necessary tools that they needed in order to have a successful online community. Not only that, they also would send out surveys throughout the period of us going all online to make sure that the students were getting the necessary tools they need in order to do well in their classes. I appreciate all that Midland has done for the professors and the students while we went online. It is always a learning process, but Midland adjusted just fine to it."
Senior,4,Although it was something none of us wanted or fully understood at the time. The officials at Midland made our online experience as enjoyable and applicable to our learning as possible.
Senior,4,"Midland has developed me in to person I want to be. Proud, hard working, and blessed. I have made connections here that will put me in good stead for the rest of my life."

Sophomore,4,Most of my Professors were very understanding of the situation and was constantly in communication with the students for how to improve.
Senior,4,"I love the connection I am able to make here at Midland University. However, i do wish the programs were not as ""clichy."" -Meaning, football athletes only hang out or interact with football."
Senior,4,"I did not take any online classes this past year, but, because of covid-19 all of the classes became online and i am honestly impressed with the professors and how they made it possible."
Junior,4,"change: better activities for students to be involved in,  better facilities for athletics 
like: my work study job, my friends, the education program."
Junior,4,"I absolutely loved online classes. I know that is not a very typical response, but I truly loved how my professors switched and how they did so relatively smoothly. I really missed the social aspect of going to class, but I think Midland did the best job possible in the switch to online learning."
Senior,4,We were on the forefront of online learning and I believe that Midland handled it very well.  All of my education professors were extremely understanding and accommodating during this time (and always) and supplemented our learning with guest lecturers and interactive online instruction.
Niche User,4,Midland is a small campus but it is very welcoming and homey. Everyone on campus is willing to help in any way possible. Professors are super understanding and the small class sizes make it easier to learn. Midland is also very into sports so if your an athlete professors will know how to work with you.
Sophomore,4,The professors and administrators truly care about you here. The coaches will do everything in their power to help you become eligible. The school is also putting a lot of money into the infrastructure to make the learning environment better.
Niche User,4,"From just a campus tour alone I was hooked! Beautiful campus, amazing fellowship opportunities, great coaches, and super friendly students!"
Sophomore,4,"For being a small school, Midland does pretty well in providing its students a college experience. The school focuses a lot on nursing and education majors, so some others may be left behind. Music is not the main focus, which is detrimental to me as well as many others who are involved in music activities. The buildings and dorms are old, so that is a little inconvenient at times."
Sophomore,4,"Midland has been a great experience for me. I love how small the classes are, which ensures that I can connect and matter to my professors. Everyone on staff campus is willing to help make your life easier as a college student. If you embrace all the opportunities available to you, then your future is bright because of Midland University."
Senior,4,"the quality of cafeteria food is low. The dorm situation is also very low in almost every building. Midland has issues with keeping kids here, if they were not required to be living on campus and having such expensive meal plans and housing for two years they might be able to stay"
Senior,4,I like how small Midland University is so we are able to form connections easily within Midland and the community. I would like to see potholes around campus fixed with something other than packing in dirt and rocks.
Senior,4,"Midland University has a ""family"" feel. The minute I step foot on campus, I feel like I have a home and family away from home. Staff and faculty care deeply about the students and it shows."
Senior,4,Midland university is a great experience for those who enjoy small town atmospheres. The staff and students are overall friendly and encourage the best out of everyone.
Junior,4,"I love the community feel at Midland but facilities lack in many areas. The campus is not kept up well. Most professors are amazing and care deeply about there students but a few have fallen short. Overall, Midland is a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"Midland is a place for small classrooms, and lots of athletics. So many sport teams are here, such as E-sports and a national winning power lifting team. There is also the arts for all mentality that anyone can be in the theater or music groups."
Niche User,4,"It is close to where I live. The people are amazing, and friendly. There are programs that are interesting. there are a variety of clubs and sports to join. The dorms are comfortable and cozy."
Freshman,4,It's a great school with a few flaws. Suffers from an outdated campus but the teachers are very personal making it easier to pass classes with the one on one interaction.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy this place, due to the fact that I have really good people around me  who are always willing to help and make this place enjoyable."
Freshman,4,I really liked how it wasn't a huge campus so I could actually see my professors and get help from them and got to other outside sources if needed.
Freshman,4,This University is home. Its like gaining a whole new family that loves each other. When I first applied here I was looking for a small private university that had a great arts program and that's exactly what I got. There are so many opportunities at this school and you're free to try out anything. You can even be involved in several things at once. The only reservations that I have are the dorms. They are extremely small and old. They are in need of lots of maintenance. Other than that my time here so far has been amazing.
College Sophomore,4,Only a few sports have good programs
College Sophomore,4,"Great School, great employment opportunities, only thing is their finance department could be better."
College Freshman,4,I noticed a few people here and there who would partake in the odd drink or smoke but nothing out of the ordinary for university students.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, all of my professors seem to be not only knowledgable, but friendly swell. their willingness ti help is greatly appreciated as I often stay in study spaces to further my understanding."
College Freshman,4,Being involved in the psychology field comes with many benefits in this school. The knowledge about the subject is vast and the class dynamic is excellent.

College Freshman,4,All staff and admin has been great with the pre-arrival process
College Freshman,4,The employers were very personal and great to work with.
College Freshman,4,"My professors and courses were great, I got to know them one on one and they gave me the attention that I needed. The class sizes were small and that is ideal for me."
College Freshman,4,"There is not a lot of crime on Midlands campus.  I feel very safe walking on campus at night, but if there was trouble there is a security officer always available."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is not very big at our school because of the involvement in sports.  People often are overwhelmed with being in athletics and a fraternity/sorority.
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone on campus is involved in a sport.  They all work really hard and some of the teams go a long way.  Everyone loves to attend these events and cheer on the teams.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience is great! I love the friends that I have made and the clubs I get to be a part of.  What makes my school unique is how small it is.
College Freshman,4,"Campus security is available on a 24/7 basis, and responds asap."
College Freshman,4,Majority of the professors are great and they will make class entertaining. Class sizes aren't very big so you will get one on one with your professors if needed.
College Freshman,4,The career center will do a lot of things to help you prepare for things after graduation.
College Freshman,4,"The volleyball team has a lot of fan supporters, and the student section always shows a lot of school spirit while attending the games."

College Freshman,4,So far I feel like the school has done a good job.
College Freshman,4,The courses are diverse. And it easy to also to change your major and the advisors wwith you to ensure that the classes you take are what you need. The class sizes are small and it ismeasier to interact with the teacher.
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are good, but the course load they give is difficult to keep up on especially when you are working and don't have time to complete work from two major classes. The classes are nice and small sized so it's easier to learn things that way."
College Junior,4,Athletics are a big part of our school but we support the arts departments as well!
College Junior,4,Its a great and welcoming school!
College Freshman,4,"I'm in Mens Hall and despite all the dorms being really old buildings without air conditioning (except the girls' dorm) Mens is good, much better than Beegle (unisex) because you get a room to yourself."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are the main reason for most of the students being here, so naturally the facilities are pretty good. Doesn't hurt being just next to the second biggest YMCA in the country with free membership."
College Junior,4,I enjoy the personal atmosphere that my school provides. It is nice to have professors and faculty members know me and not just see me as another number on a list.
College Sophomore,4,I like the business department because it is teaching me how to excel in the outside world after college. I am also part of the work study program where I work in the communications department. These skills are allowing me to practice skills that I will need to use later.
College Sophomore,4,There is a good variety of girls and guys from any type of social stereotype.
College Sophomore,4,"My experience has been great so far, making new friends and lasting relationships with students and staff."
College Sophomore,4,"One of the perks of going to Midland is that it's a small campus, so you can count on having one on one time with the professors and getting any kind of feedback on assignments you need."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of varieties of restaurants in Fremont. You really could never get bored.
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very strict on honor code and alcohol use on campus. also they are strict on attendance policies, late work, and not turned in assignments."
Sophomore,2,I had to take all of my classes online when Midland went virtual. I found it very difficult to focus and without any Kind of structure or accountability I found it hard to find the motivation to do things.
Junior,2,"unorganized, hard to adjust, hard to stay focused, some professors had no idea what was going on or how to use online learning"
Freshman,2,"I liked that they were there to help you if you needed help,  They helped with making a transition to college"
Junior,2,"Very diverse sports opportunities, but academics were definitely placed second.  Professors were very helpful and eager to work with missing class for sports. Buildings and class equipment were older but still functional. Credits transferring out were a nightmare."
Junior,2,"Midland is an expert at drawing in students with false promises. The performing arts especially. Each year I hear recruiters, and staff member tell prospective students about something that we have planned for the next year, and then nothing comes from their promise. Also the administration will do anything to save their image. Even activities that border on immoral."
Freshman,2,"They school is not a bad place. Beautiful campus and most staff and teachers are willing to work with you. That being said, the school doesn't adapt well to different learning styles and can make learning more difficult. The school is also way overpriced and the dorms are in poor condition. The school also has a required two year policy where you have to live on campus for two years and it just ins't worth the price and conditions. Some dorms don't have air conditioning and one dorm even had rats. On their tours they show one room that is bigger and nicer than the rest and try to say that all the rooms are like that but it's not true."
Senior,2,"They continuously want to you to feel like you're doing something wrong while also ""supporting"" you. I feel like they want to make sure you need them in order to succeed, which is not true at all. "
College Sophomore,2,There are shady people that try and sexually approach girls on campus
College Sophomore,2,The buildings are falling apart
College Sophomore,2,"Almost everyone parties on the weekends, and that's where a lot of under age students get drunk and sometimes if they're drunk enough they will go and smoke weed."
College Freshman,2,"Parties are awful, just a lot of people crammed into a small house off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Parties are awful, just a lot of people crammed into a small house off campus. All bars and clubs are in Omaha - 45 minutes away."
College Freshman,2,"I can only compare to university in Australia, but school here is unbelievably easy."
College Freshman,2,"Most people only use legal drugs, a few people smoke weed regularly."
College Freshman,2,It's in a boring town with nothing to do on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The pasta is always dry and the sauce you put on it is watery. The meat is always bad, they never have good pizza, they never have good cereal, the chocolate milk taste bad all the time, and the pop machine in the grill taste like soap."
College Sophomore,2,They don't have much options for dining in Fremont
College Freshman,2,"I absolutely hate living in Beegle. The RHD Lex, charges everyone for damages that someone else makes. And the room they show you in the tour is nothing compared to the other side of beegle. Ask the tour guide to show you a room over there. I bet they won't. Because they're huge! But they don't tell you that."
College Junior,2,There is not much of a nightlife at all at my school.
College Junior,2,There is no real greek life on this campus.  It is pretty nice though because I think greek life is pretty annoying.
Niche User,1,"I unfortunately had a very bad experience at Midland and would not recommend attendance there to people.  I did not feel as though the school cared about it's students struggles. And they were very big on you matter, midland family but it was mostly fake/forced."
Junior,1,Completely unprofessional in all areas. The arts is a joke here. Directors take favoritism and are greedy with their department. The education is not worth the outrageous price tag. #midlandisatrap
Freshman,1,"Its an adult Middle School out here, terrible college scene. Good for people who aren't yet ready to be at an actual college."
College Freshman,1,"The thing that Midland calls 'Greek Life' is just people who are a bit desperate for friends, they don't party or anything."
College Freshman,1,School is to strict feels like a high school
College Freshman,1,"If you do not have a car, or don't have friends with cars, you will be miserable. Most people live in or around fremont and they have cars. They all leave campus on fridays and come back on sundays, so the campus is always dead on weekends."
College Freshman,1,if you have no car its really hard to get around town..
College Freshman,1,There are no bars or places to hang out. If a student wants a bar or club they they must go 20 minutes to Omaha or hour and a half to Lincoln 
College Freshman,1,There are 2 dining options at Midland. The first (the only option your meal plan works for) is a bland traditional style cafeteria where I go every meal to be faced with the same dull and bleak options every single day. Every meal you face an onslaught of empty carbs that only exist to plump you up and your only healthy route of escape is a never changing salad bar culminating in an array of fat filled dressings. Then to just add insult to injury the cost of the meal plan is outrageous. The plan I use is ten meals a week and when it comes down to it you are spending over $12 per meal for food my 12 year old sister could cook in her easy bake oven. The other option is the Warrior Grille which does have a few slightly healthier options but suffers from high prices and extremely prohibitive hours. Then on top of that your warrior card meal plan is not accepted.
College Sophomore,1,"Poor maintenance, poor wi-fi signal, food isn't very good, loud students late at night. Privacy is almost nonexistent."
College Student,1,My friend has over $300 stolen while she was showering the other day and i heard a bike got stolen from an underclassmen. Security is good for people but not for materialistic things apparently
College Student,1,Theres nothing to do in the tiny town of fremont. If you want to go anywhere decent make the drive to Omaha.
College Student,1,"I dont understand why they only give tours in beegle. I mean, people dont even get a good idea of how the dorms REALLY are.  for example. a majority of freshmen guys get put in men's hall and there are several rooms with paint peeling and it smells awful. It really isnt worth the money, i suggest get off campus housing."

Alum,5,I did not take any classes online. All of my classes were in person. My in person experience was great. Every teacher had their own teaching style but they were all great teachers.
Niche User,5,the thing i like the most about Illinois college is that they did not take long to accept me into their campus as well they have offered me a scholarship if i decide to go into the institution.
Freshman,5,"First Year college can be overwhelming, but Illinois college has made it wonderful and smooth.  What I like about the campus was the fact they have   different variety of food, something going on everyday and IC isn't big nor a small school. You have a chance to interact with professors outside of class. The campus is beautiful. What I would like to see change? I think IC is still expensive. They do offer a good amount of financial aid, but it's still expensive for someone like me who come from a low income family."
Freshman,5,"A beautiful campus that made me feel like I was at home.  I stepped on to the campus and instantly knew this is where I want to go to college. The staff was wonderful, the athletic department blew me away, and overall it was an amazing first impression. I have been accepted and plan on attending Illinois college in the fall. I cannot wait to start my college experience there!"
Sophomore,5,"The small community atmosphere makes it super easy to connect with people and make friends. On top of that the professor are extremely personable and intelligent, making learning relatively easy and fun!"
Freshman,5,"Illinois College is an amazing four year private college. This college has many choices of academics with a very welcoming community. The campus is not too big or too small. The campus staff will help you with any question you have and direct you in what path you should go. This college has many dorm options as well as on campus apartments and homes that can be shared with 5 people. Also, if you love food Illinois College has many different options not only in the dining hall but around campus. Many people struggle to find friends on campus but at Illinois College you are instantly brought in by staff and students to feel as welcome as possible. Lastly, financial problems are a big issue when it comes to attending a college but with Illinois College they do whatever they can to help you with paying the cost of tuition. Overall, this is an amazing college with many perks."
Freshman,5,I made a good choice. The campus is awesome. The facilities are unbelievable. The classes are small so you can get help from the professors. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The small town atmosphere is nice.
Niche User,5,I like the size of the university very diverse the students are friendly I’ve been there for a college visit in Upward Bound I remember spending the night there to get an experience of The Who setting
Sophomore,5,"I loved the small college feel, get more acquainted with teachers on a personal level where they actually care about you.  This environment has made it very easy to learn and a higher level of education."
Niche User,5,I love that the admission counselor takes your circumstances when sitting down to talk too you about your college experience.
Sophomore,5,I loved Illinois College's campus. It was so beautiful and diverse. I love the welcoming environment provided there. It was amazing to walk into my advising meeting and have the professors and advisor know my transcript front and back. They knew exactly what I needed to take and what I had already completed. It was a very personal experience.
Sophomore,5,I love Illinois College. It's a small school and the teacher really helps you and wants you to succeed.
Freshman,5,Illinois College is by far the best college that I've visited. It has that very home-like feel to where you feel very welcome. It's campus is located in a very safe part of Jacksonville and the campus itself is amazing. Nothing is too far of a distance to walk and faculty and students are willing to assist with everything you could need.
Senior,5,My overall experience with Illinois College is great. Illinois College is a high academic private college that offers numerous academic opportunities for students.  The professors are always willing to help after class.It is diverse and the campus life is great. Illinois College is well known for the importance in athletics.
Freshman,5,I had a great time my first year.  I got to meet new people and try new things.  Class sizes were small enough that I could get help if needed.  The professors worked to help me be successful.  I have met people from all over the world on this beautiful campus.  The campus is not so spread out that I had to worry about getting from one class to the next.  I was far enough from home to have independence but close enough go home if needed.  We had decent choices for food and tons of different activities throughout the year.  I can't wait to go back next fall.
Junior,5,"It's small, and the professors know you personally. Everyone wants you to succeed. You're likely to run into professors outside of class, so try not to skip unless you're actually sick."
Freshman,5,Illinois College is a good college where they help everyone to the best of their ability. Illinois College is a small campus so it's easy to connect with professor and make new friends. I wouldn't want them to change anything because I only can cover my experience with first semester. I am a freshmen at Illinois College.
College Freshman,5,they're really strict about alcohol abuse.
College Freshman,5,Everything is great. Campus and studednts are really friendly and care about you. I'd recommend it to anyone.
College Freshman,5,The liberal arts studies value a lot this school
College Freshman,5,They do an amazing job in helping the students understand any kind of problem/dangerous activitie.
College Freshman,5,I love it. Residence halls are really friendly and clean.
College Freshman,5,I love greek life. They do a lot og good stuff.
College Freshman,5,"The sport is hard, but efficient and prolific."
College Freshman,5,"IC really cares about its students: it helps them in any field concerning building a strong an accurate resume for any kind of post-undergrad opportunities, from grad school to employment. I'd recommend this school to anyone."
College Senior,5,Illinois College has an amazing athletic department and athletic center. You can definitely say that it stands out from other schools.
College Senior,5,"Although Illinois College is a small liberal-arts college, the environment is so welcoming that it makes you feel like you are a part of a family. Because of the size you get extra attention from your professors and they are always willing to help. Sure it may not be the biggest of schools but it provides you outstanding opportunities through its academics, clubs, and internships. I can safely say that because of my experiences at Illinois College, I know that I will be a strong candidate entering the workplace after I graduate."
College Freshman,5,"Every year people graduate and go off to amazing careers or post graduate work. It's crazy to see where everyone has gone, whether to fortune 500 companies or even sports organizations. People always find amazing work and live what they are doing."
College Freshman,5,"Illinois College is n extremely safe campus, I haven't heard of anything bad really happening. If you even feel threatened or scared you can call security and they will walk you wherever you need to go just so you feel better. Illinois College is one of the safest places in the surrounding area."
College Freshman,5,"I thoroughly enjoy my housing, have a nice sized room with everything I need in it. My roommate and I re able to move and do things easily in our nice and spacious room. I love everything about my dorm including the air conditioning."
College Freshman,5,"At Illinois College we actually don't have fraternity or sororities we have literary societies, which are the originals. I feel it's actually a lot better. Fraternities and sororities get a really bad reputation for being all about parties. But with literary societies there is a place to actually learn and perform plays at the end of each semester. I feel they better help you learn and get involved to make new friends I'll last a lifetime."
College Freshman,5,"Illinois College is a small division 3 level sports school. However no one truly cares about what level we are at. Everyone loves sports and attends sporting events. Most students at Illinois College participate in a sport. We are small but mighty you could say. Our fans have a ferocity you could see at an NFL game. Sports of all kinds bring us together as a college. Not only varsity level sports but also intramural sports. Everyone wants to have fun and a good time, people take intramural sports very serious but also in a playful manner. With our excellent athletic facilities we are able to be the best we can be at any sport. I feel sports make us an extremely tight knit community and why I feel Illinois College is the best school in the nation."
College Freshman,5,There is always a security guard walking around the campus so I feel completely safe when outside at night. There has not been a lot of crime that has been seen on campus or that I have heard of at least.
College Freshman,5,The professors are incredibly helpful throughout your time at school. Since it is a small school students are able to get a more one-on-one relationship with each professor. This helps students get more help on their homework resulting in better grades overall.
College Freshman,5,The dorm life is safe and sociable. Its a great experience. I would suggest living on campus in dorm to everybody because it changes you either for the better or worse. The housing process is fairly easy. All you do is apply for a dorm and ask for a certain roommate and you get it.
College Freshman,5,"Illinois College campus has an amazing atmosphere that makes every first-year student feel welcomed. The professors actually care about your success and take time out of their busy schedules to help each student pursue their passion. Since it is a small school, students are able to get better one-on-one help with all of their homework. Overall an amazing academic establishment."
College Sophomore,5,"Being a two sport athlete, I've had the chance to go to multiple different campus. None of the schools compare to IC's. The facility is clean and very up to date. It convienently holds all the sporting events in one area. I'm always upset when my team is on the road just because I never know what the next facility is going to look like."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school. It's a small campus, and everyone knows everyone. It's clear that the professors are not teaching for the money but for the sake of their students. They truly care about their students. There are so many opportunities that I would never have at a bigger school, and if I had to choose a school all over again, I would still pick Illinois College."
College Freshman,5,I fell in love with the campus and felt right at home. Everyone made me feel very comfortable there which is why I chose Illinois college as my place to study.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school! You feel like you belong the minute you step on campus!  I have created so many memories on this campus and can't see my self any where else!
College Sophomore,5,I feel so at home on campus. It is only two hours away from my hometown but close enough I can get home if needed and far enough away to be independent. The staff and other students make coming into this school so welcoming and comfortavle. This was actually the only school I visited and absolutely fell in love. There is always something going on to keep you included around campus too.
College Freshman,5,"I always feel very safe and secure on campus. The security are always very attentive to calls, although I think they rarely receive them for anything serious."
College Freshman,5,"Our althletic centers are good, neat and new. They have useful facilities and a big variety of different ones. "
College Sophomore,5,It's great to live on my campus because of the controlled environment that we live in. The temperature in the rooms is always comfortable with just the occasional cold room.
College Sophomore,5,The campus and their policy regarding technology is outstanding. There are always technicians to help you at all times with any problems you encounter. And there is always a place for you to print out an assignment or paper with fast internet as well.
College Freshman,5,People are willing to help.
College Senior,5,at Illinois college its great to be in a specific major everyone who is a teacher in the field of any major is very passionate at what they do. always doing research and always looking for new developments. i love being a sociology major and talking to people who are also majoring in sociology because every one has a different perspective on what sociology is. each individual at IC are so tight knit like a family that we are very passionate about our expertise and the world around us. its awesome to be a soc major.
College Sophomore,5,Nurse Judy is great; she is very kind and helpful. Security is great; all residential buildings and rooms within the buildings require keys or key cards. The security guards are very helpful also and are available 24/7.
College Freshman,5,The service is great. I just wish they didnt charge but maybe thats just me being cheap lol
College Freshman,5,It has its good days and bad days but even when it rains or snow....we always have activities going on to distract us from the weather
College Junior,5,Workload is attainable. curriculum is fair. Facilities always clean and looking really nice. programs are wonderful!!
College Junior,5,LOVE THE PROFESSORS! The college is great! I couldn't be more happy with it!
College Freshman,5,"I think the statistic is that around 95% of students receive some sort of scholarship, and I myself received a substantial one."
College Sophomore,5,Its Great Everyone Works Hard At The Sport They Play. Great Sportsmanship & Dedicated  Players. Also Top Grade Fans.!!
College Freshman,5,"This semester was challenging, but not overwhelming."
College Freshman,5,Illinois college is a blue light campus and has campus security.
College Sophomore,5,Everything Is Close – I am an athlete at this college and we have our own workout facility. Every student knows and understands when to go where at certain times of the day. Any facility that we do have we all as students know what they for. The dining halls are great and the food we have many choices.
College Junior,5,Very Convenient – Illinois College makes available a lot of computers through the library and the IT department. We also have several labs on campus and they are hardly ever crowded because the school has a small population which is well catered for by this provision.
College Junior,5,"Affordable Alternative – Living on campus costs an average of $4000 annually at Illinois College, and this is quite expensive for the average student. I live in a big house with four other students off campus during the summer  I pay significantly less for rent and utilities; almost half what I have to pay to live on campus. This  is a decent small town so there are safe neighborhoods around the vicinity of the school."
College Freshman,5,"Excellent Experience – I can say that my school is great and they teach you alot of new thing that you dont know. They also try their best to make sure everything is going right with you meaning they make sure you not stressing, ect... and give you all the help you need if you is. For foremost they have a good academic program."
Alum,4,I attended Illinois College all four years and lived in campus all four years. It was a great experience. My professors really devoted themselves to teaching inside and outside the classroom. There were a lot of opportunities to get involved.
Freshman,4,"Illinois College is a very nice liberal arts college. The campus is small in size and population, however, it makes the campus feel more like a home than a school."
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity, and the campus is small enough to able to walk to all my classes. I have so many academic resources for assistance."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the professors were great, fellow students were friendly and focused. There were not too many parties to take away from students' success but there were enough to enjoy. The only downside would be, in my opinion, that the school is taking away the Grill which is a good food place on campus in exchange for a fully functional Starbucks. I'm not a great coffee fan and the food in the cafe is not always that appetizing. Luckily, there are sandwiches."
Sophomore,4,"This college is a solid option compared to many other colleges, mainly due to the fact that it plays to its strengths. Campus size is the thing that can attract or repel many students, which is totally understandable. This college is a great place, I'd say 8.5/10. The atmosphere is what attracts students. I would recommend IC to anyone that doesn't mind a smaller campus, with about 1000 students nowadays. It seems most the positive reviews are recent(ish) and the ones that didn't prefer the college are older, generally. Overall, I love this college and what it has to offer, it suits me well."
Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been well.  The professors for the most part are really nice and care about their job and students. The student services provided come in handy.  IT has already fixed my laptop twice. Books are free so that’s amazing the weight room is brand new and still improving.
Freshman,4,It's a small school so you really get to know the people around campus. It's also a very comfortable campus with a variety of well-taught courses.
Sophomore,4,I just finished my freshman year at Illinois College and I enjoyed it a lot. The classes are very diverse and teach many different things and expand your horizons as a student. They challenge you just enough for you to grow academically but aren't too challenging to where they are impossible. The professors are all very good and easy to get along with and help you out when needed. I play baseball at Illinois College and that too has been a good experience. Two things I would change is the food on campus and how the campus is so politicized. But besides these two things my experience has been good and I would recommend the college to anyone considering going there.
Freshman,4,"Overall very inviting. The students are very diverse and so is the campus life. The price tag is intimidating, but there are plenty of scholarships to apply for."
Freshman,4,Really enjoyed the small campus atmosphere.  The new technology and emphasis on each student.  Many groups and organizations to get involved.  One on one attention from faculty and staff.  Everyone that we have interacted with has been very helpful and answered questions and concerns openly and without hesitation.  The campus feel like home and makes everyone feel safe and welcomed.
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman, and so far the experience has been good. The professors are hard and assign a lot of work (depending the professor), but they care about you and if you are lagging behind, they’ll work with you to get you on track. In High School, I attended classes at the local college (OUC) and I feel I’m learning a lot more here than I did there. They offer a good amount of financial aid, but it’s still expensive for someone like me who comes from a very low income family (I’m out of state). The parking passes are $70 for the year unless you park in the orange lot (free) but it’s about a block and a half away from my dorm. It sucks when it’s too hot or too cold and I have to carry a lot in. I love this school. Pixley is the all girls dorm and to me it seems like the biggest room dimension wise. There’s no evevator but there’s A/C (unit) in every room. I can get to all of my classes within 5 minutes of walking."
Sophomore,4,"IC is not too big of a school, which means that you, as a student, have the chance to interact with professors more one on one. Compared to going to a bigger school where it can be hard to contact a professor outside of class. The campus is beautiful, and everybody knows everybody."
Junior,4,"It is a very small campus so it does not take long to get to class. You will never get lost on campus since it is so small, which is a plus because you won't feel overwhelmed like you would at a larger school. Illinois College feels like home. No matter where you go on campus, you will run into someone you know."
Senior,4,"IC is my home away from home. When i stepped foot on campus I could see myself there for the next four years. Others schools i visited didn’t give me the same feeling. I love my school, the students, my professors, the staff and the campus. I am very involved and IC has made it easy for me to be studious and still be involved."
Sophomore,4,"It is a small college, due to you have opportunities to meet every one and build new connections. Due to less numbers of students in class you experience a better relationship with your professors and fellow students."
Freshman,4,"Illinois College has a small campus, which makes it a well-built community. Professors know the students, and students tend to really help each other."
Senior,4,"I absolutely loved the ability to connect to faculty and become part of their research! It completely changed my life and prepared me for a career (the only reason I put four stars is because politics on campus can get annoying at times, but I also recognize that such is everywhere)."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently a freshman and Illinois college, and overall I found it to be a good experience. There is plenty to do around campus, but no so much outside. People are really friendly and it is a good fit for anyone looking for a small school. The biggest complaints are the food and the freshman housing. The food is very hit or miss, and the dorm rooms are really small and the bathroom showers are worse."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Illinois College has been life changing. It has opened me up to meet new people and try new things, and it has definitely changed my life for the better."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the college is great. The professors do a very good job at making the students understand their courses. The professors are easily reachable and easy to walk up to. The class size is just perfect, which gives room for interaction with professors and students."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the college is great. The professors do a very good job at making the students understand their courses. The professors are easily reachable and easy to walk up to. The class size is just perfect, which gives room for interaction with professors and students."
College Sophomore,4,The health and safety on campus is great. The counsellors are extremely friendly and helpful. The security does very good at their job.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is great. What is very important is that the campus is close to the classes.
College Sophomore,4,The greek life at the school is great. It is a big part of the campus life.
College Senior,4,"I have never had to drop out of a course because of a professor or because I thought it was overwhelmingly difficult. I have even been put in situations where I wasn't doing well in a class and I was able to work together with my adviser and professor of the class and take steps into guiding me into the right direction, I ended up passing the class and I couldn't have done it without their help."
College Senior,4,"Illinois College is always creating opportunities for their students. The career center does a fantastic job offering students job fairs, networking events, mock interviews, free professional clothing, helping with resumes and looking for jobs and interviews."
College Senior,4,I have never felt like I was in danger on campus. The health center is an amazing place to go to when you are in need of anything. There is also the student organization called PHEs (Peer Health Educators) that educate students on different health aspects and bring awareness on certain subjects.
College Freshman,4,Everything is great! Everybody is really helpful with the process of figuring out what you want to do as a career in the future.
College Freshman,4,"On the Illinois College campus we do not have sororities or fraternities, instead we have literary societies where we give productions on controversial topics. I am currently in Chi Beta on campus and have enjoyed ever moment of the pledging process and making great friends."
College Freshman,4,"I don't necessary participant in sports at Illinois College, but I do know that we support our athletes in everything they do."
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt unsafe on campus. We have public safety on patrol at nights, and if you ever feel unsafe you can call them and someone will escort you back to wherever you are wanting to go."
College Freshman,4,"Living in the dorms is definitely an adjustment if you aren't used to living with other people, and the community bathrooms are smaller than I'd like, but I love living on campus. If you can, I would suggest living in a co-ed dorm because it gives you a chance to make a lot of friends - no matter the gender. All of my closest friends live in the same building as I do, and it's really nice."
College Freshman,4,"Coming from a small high school, Illinois College is a great fit for me. The small atmosphere gives me a chance to really connect with the people on campus; I don't think that would be the case if I was at a large state school."
College Sophomore,4,"I am apart of Peer Health Educators, and we educate our peers about mental, emotional, and sexual health. I think students are very aware of the dangers collage life can bring."
College Sophomore,4,"I've taking some interesting classes, and I've had even better professors. I know I have an advisor if I need anything. I love the class sizes because they're small, and I learn more."
College Freshman,4,"Our campus security always makes me feel safe. As long as I am on campus, I feel okay. Being in the neighborhoods around campus at night can scare me, but on campus I feel secure."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are small which is nice. Professors care deeply about each student and make them feel welcomed and important.
College Freshman,4,"There are very good ratings for this school as to graduates of a year or less already being employed, which makes me very hopeful."
College Freshman,4,"Gardner Hall is a very nice freshman year dorm and is set up to encourage a friendly environment on each floor and between floors. There are often issues with drinking violations and people being loud at all hours of the night, which is unfortunate. The ease of the housing process is nice."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the campus, but not the general requirements put in place by the Blueprint. It is hard to complete and finish my major."
College Sophomore,4,There are many options and it is easy to find what you are looking for.
College Sophomore,4,"I think they really try to make us look good, and help us get the education we deserve."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the dorms is great.  The cleaning staff are very nice, and do an excellent job in cleaning every day! Everyone in the dorm is friendly, and it's easy to find someone to talk with.  Although the cost is a little pricey, it is totally worth it!"
College Freshman,4,"The campus has many decent dorms to live in. The older you get, the better the dorms will be."
College Freshman,4,The nurses and the aides here are very kind and help when needed.
College Freshman,4,The teachers here are pretty great.
College Freshman,4,"They are making the program a little harder, but they are improving it"
College Freshman,4,I came here over another school i was already commited to
College Junior,4,The nurses's are always very helpful.
College Junior,4,"The people who work in the administration are very helpful and friendly.  They help you with almost anything or if you just need someone to talk to, they will always lend a listening ear!  :)"
College Freshman,4,The local malls are not to far from campus
College Freshman,4,We having a lot of places I like to eat off campus.
College Freshman,4,I like the party scene because Iam athletic so I always have a NICE TIME.
College Sophomore,4,Wish I could get more money.
College Freshman,4,There are many different types of students and backgrounds at this school. I like it because you meet people and learn a lot about their culture.
College Freshman,4,"It isn't actually considered Greek Life, but we have literary societies that do a lot for the campus and community and a lot of service. I was rushing and it seemed like a lot of fun..
"
College Freshman,4,"I like the major so the workload isn't bad because I like to write and read. The oppurtunities around campus are also great, we have the writing center and also things to do like reading nights, ect."
College Freshman,4,It is not bad living on campus because the buildings aren't old but they aren't brand new either.
College Freshman,4,They offer skits and situations/plays about when dealing with drugs and drinking so they make sure we know the consequences. 
College Freshman,4,"There are 3 different places that you can eat on campus. As it is a small campus, they are easily accessible. Also this gives you the availability  of meals at times suitable with class schedules. Each place has a good variety to choose from. If nothing suits you, there are always the vending machines."
Niche User,2,"This school is not well known on the map. Most students come from small towns in Illinois, not much of an out of state or international student population. School cares a lot about it's history which is nice. 

Pros: Small class sizes, nice and safe campus to live on, professors are good but some could be better. 

Cons: Needs Bigger student population (at least 2,000), better food options on campus, updated dorms and housing, more options for majors, more extracurricular activities/events (not much to do besides party or go to athletic events, which not many do), more diverse student population."
Junior,2,Dont come here if you dont want to be treated like you are in high school. Res life and public safety will try to find a way to screw you over if you ever thing about taking alcohol in a dorm. Also there are a lot of over sensitive people here that believe that they are entitled. Teachers are great and the athletics program is great.
College Freshman,2,There aren't very many options for restaurants in Jacksonville. There is mainly fast food options and not much of a variety.
College Freshman,2,"I don't pay attention because I have my own car, but I haven't heard of zip cars or taxis so I never see them either on or around campus. The shuttle it fairly ok for students to use."
College Sophomore,2,"The places to dine on campus are very limited in what they serve. We have the dinning hall which is usually home cooked meals with a large salad bar. ""The Grill"" is just like a McDonalds on campus and the coffee shop is usually your go to place to eat or grab a sandwich"
College Sophomore,2,"If students are drinking or using drugs, it's usually not in the dorms and is under the rug. No one judges if you drink or smoke pot or whatever; it just depends on who you hang out with."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is not a huge aspect at Illinois College if you are not in one. You don't hear about them, unless you know some of the participants. Our greek life puts on literacy productions so they are known for that. I am involved with a service fraternity that is co-ed and I love it. As far as greek housing, I honestly do not know about that. I know you could apply for a house together. It depends who your ""clique"" is so you can talk among each other."
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm involved in basketball at IC and have learned a lot through the sport. Varsity sports aren't as big here as they are in bigger schools but I still enjoy playing.
Recent Alumnus,2,Nightlife can be fun at times but there are a lot of times that there are no parties going on. This is unfortunate but it is still possible to have fun.
College Junior,2,Average for on campus parking the off campus parking for commuter like me is hard to find arrive early to snag spots on the street.
College Freshman,2,"I am fine with the parking situation here, but it is very inconvenient to have to walk down by the football field just to get to the freshman lot. Also, I see people without proper permits parking where they shouldn't and I never see a ticket on their windshields. It seems unfair that they get the free parking pass for the freshman lot, then abuse it by parking in the upperclassman lot. The desired spots tend to be the spots along the street,but those are very limited. Freshman get the short end of the stick when it comes to parking spots."
College Freshman,2,"Although the Admission staff here at IC have done a great job at recruiting students of different races, regions, ethnicities, and so forth, the school hasn't done the best job at making everyone feel at home and at peace with one another. Although we have had Diversity Week, arranged a Black Student Union (BSU), and have a Multicultural Center for students, many are stuck in their traditional ways. With a capus size of approximately 1,000 students, a large percentage being Caucasian students from rural areas, it should be easier to promote change and unity amongst everyone; however, the school is very segregated."
College Freshman,2,"Illinois College offers free parking for those who do not care to purchase a parking tag, however, the free parking lot is a distant walk from campus. Students are permitted to park along the street, but spots fill up quickly. There are only three parking lots on campus for those who have paid for a parking permit. Guests or visitors have a difficult time finding parking around our campus."
College Freshman,2,No air conditioning in my dorm. Laundry facility on every floor is nice in my building.
College Freshman,2,Midwestern and national chain restaraunts. Plus a few good local spots.
College Freshman,2,A lot of people on campus wear sleeveless shirts to show off their arms or if the weather is pleasant. There are alot of couples on this campus
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is a division 3 school, so none of the students are at the school on a sports scholarship. The basketball team usually isn't too bad, same with girls volleyball. All the other sports are kind of down hill. They don't always have coaches for all their sports (ex// the swim coach isn't there for swimming he was originally hired for football)

The nice thing about IC is the athletic building it is a new building with an amazing pool and hot tub."
College Junior,2,"Good Luck!! They are strict about the aid that goes out and if you have a refund check they will keep it unless you ask for it.  They don't send out notices that you have refunds either.  For three years now I've had to send them all of my father's and my tax information because they had to verify that I'm poor.  Also, because I have a part time job they make it a hassle to get aid.  You will get help, but they're going to put up a fight.  Not a good experience!"
College Senior,2,"If you want to go somewhere you either drive yourself, or have a friend drive you. There are no taxis or buses readily available. There is a train station and an airport about 40 miles away, but you need transportation to get to them. IC often provides rides during the holidays to the train station and airport if needed, but people rarely use the services."
Alum,1,"Illinois College is an institution that seems to enable systemic racism and claims to enable diversity, but clearly only when it benefits them profit-wise. The administration, as well as part of the student senate constantly target students of color for speaking out on the oppression they receive from their white counterparts, and yet defend white students who claim to have been attacked for being called white and straight. It makes white students believe they will receive little to no repercussions for their actions and make students of color targets for indirect (and overt) racism while still having them receive emails from marketing to appear on the pictures displayed on their website. Their education is mediocre at best, with the exception of a handful of professors who all happen to be either people of color or advocates for said communities, the party scene is virtually non-existent and would only benefit those from hick-ass towns, and their food is disgusting and racist."
Alum,1,"I wouldn't know, I didn't take online classes. Most professors are too old to know how to use moodle anyway."
Junior,1,This school is shit. please do not go here. Especially is you are BLACK or Person on darker color. They are frantically trying to get all students back on campus for MONEY. They don’t give a shit about your health or the Pandemic. They are lowering tuition cost or allowing online classes because of the Pandemic and the door halls are full to the brim! We might all die for greed. May peace be with you!
Senior,1,"This school capitalizes on black students to use them for photo ops, videos and interviews for marketing, the diversity here is not what it seems, the campus is only 10% black. As a gay black man, this place is not safe or comfortable for me to be in. I wish I would have known that 4 years ago."
Senior,1,I did not take any online classes. I only switched to online post covid and it was of course very unprepared as no schools had any plans to immediately switch to an all online system.
Senior,1,"Four years of misery. Every day I wish I would have transferred but liberal arts credits do not transfer to most schools. There are very few professors who actually care and aren't judgmental.  ""Rules"" are very unclear here and you'll get in trouble and fined for doing nothing wrong. Administration is very distant and you'll never know how to contact someone or who to contact for help. Everyone knows everything about you and will assume the worst in you- even the faculty. The nurses will give no other outcome for your illness other than pregnancy. People here are stuck up and no one actually cares about you- only the gossip. People act like IC is good but if you really ask a student what they truly think and to not play nice, every student I have talked to is mad at the school in some aspect and feels that administration is taking advantage of the students. I will never recommend Illinois College."
College Freshman,1,"Illinois College has hired Chartwells to cater the food for the dining halls and food eateries. The quality of the food is poor, and bland tasting. Students discuss their lack of desire to eat the food on campus daily, and will actually leave campus to find a good meal. It is exciting when they prepare a food that makes you want to go back for seconds because this rarely ever happens. The school requires students to have a meal plan through their junior year which is very unfortunate."
College Sophomore,1,The places are okay around campus it makes you miss having your home cook good meals. The food is not that bad its not just a variety of choices that you should be getting.!
College Junior,1,"Chartwells is the company that our school goes through to cater to our food needs. While I have heard from upper classmen that they have made improvements over the years, we still always joke that ""If there's a way to mess up food, Chartwells will find a way."""
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do if you are underage. That being said, bar/club scene is nothing too exciting either..."
College Junior,1,Literary Societies – They're just groups that have Greek names because they're supposed to log a certain number of community service hours. I think it's just another bad excuse to get together and drink.
College Junior,1,"Unless Mom and Dad Are Paying the Bills, Don't Even – Many apartments in Jacksonville are plain and simple crap.  The landlords are crooks who try to charge ridiculous amounts for buildings that could probably be condemned. BUT, there are just as many decent places to find an apartment.  You will pay, though, and you have to prove yourself because many of the good landlords have been burned by college kids so they're hesitant to even talk to them.  I tried to set up an apartment, but my friends don't have jobs so they couldn't afford the and I would have to work forty hour weeks on top of school just to get by.  Many of my friends at other schools use the $$ they would get for housing to get an apartment, but IC won't let you do that. So unless your mom and dad pay your bills, stick with on-campus housing.  One more thing: there is one small building of campus apartments, but they are just like res halls- you have to leave over breaks."
College Junior,1,"They really try, but there is little variety and a lot of gross food.  They try to add in ""ethnic food"" but everything tastes about half-baked and oily. There are only a handful of pleasant people working for Chartwells (the company that provides and prepares the food).  The hours are not friendly to those who have class during the morning, midday, and who work in the evenings.  There are three places on campus to get food and the selection is pretty small.  However, it is the cost that makes the mediocrity unbearable.  If you break down the meal plans (we'll talk about those next), you pay anywhere from 7-9 dollars per crappy meal.  If you have less than 88 or so many credit hours, you have to live on campus (unless you live a few blocks away from campus) and you have to have a meal plan.  Students decided this, by the way. That means you are subject to this sustenance which admittedly gives many people intestinal issues the first couple of weeks they eat it."
College Junior,1,"This is a small enough school, there should be enough parking. Although the small spaces for parking are very close to res halls, there is not enough parking for the number of students in those halls.  The parking fines are at times ridiculous, and the security officers are WAY more concerned about giving out tickets than responding to actual issues."

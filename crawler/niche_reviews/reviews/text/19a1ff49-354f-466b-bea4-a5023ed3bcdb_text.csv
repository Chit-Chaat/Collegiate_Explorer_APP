Freshman,5,Alma College has been amazing to me. They offer many different opportunities for every student and provide you so much help with deciding your path.
Junior,5,My professors did a great job at offering whatever you need to succeed online. They offered synchronous and asynchronous sessions as well as open office hours for extra help.
Junior,5,"I think this is the best place to go if you are looking for a small college that still gives you the full college experience. All the dorms and apartments on campus have recently been renovated and I enjoyed living in them. This school is full of athletes and all the teams support each other. However there’s a spot for everybody, dance, band, art, theater, etc."
Junior,5,Alma College is an open and active campus. Their opportunities and help throughout my time here was amazing and they are very dedicated to their students.
Alum,5,"My experience at Alma College was very special and very rewarding.  It gave me a quick start in learning with a faculty and staff that was caring and amazing. They were personally there to help me find my correct path and left  me more than prepared for my first job which was my goal.   The small class sizes allow for personal connections between student to student 
and student to professor.  It is a beautiful campus and Alma offers many opportunities for internships, jobs and research as well as classes for all types of majors.  Alma prepares you for graduate school and beyond.  There are many small or large interest groups that you can be involved in, enjoy, have fun and make lasting friendships.   Incredible professors, wonderful experiences and caring relationships which lead to an excellent college environment at Alma College."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior who is attending Alma College next year to pursue my dream of nursing, and also play softball. The staff there is very nice and respectful. This campus is always kept up on; it is always very clean."
Freshman,5,I think the campus is beautiful. Sports teams are so much fun to be a part of. Everyone on campus is very polite and helpful!
Sophomore,5,"The professors, administrative, and coaches all push students to become a better version of themselves by participating in more clubs/activities while maintaining a good GPA. This sets every student up for success and pushes us to  mature and strive for our goals."
Senior,5,"Alma College is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Between my team I was apart of, the amazing professors who care so much about their students, and the experiences an opportunities the college has to offer it is most definitely one of the best places you could call home."
Freshman,5,Alma has a great small town feel with enough to do on campus to fulfill a college life experience. The dorms are clean and well cared for. The athletic facilities are top notch. Alma is close enough to other cities to go if need be but everything you need is on campus that you could possibly want.
Sophomore,5,"Alma College is an amazing place for studies. Why? It's the people. Not only are the teachers and other students kind and encouraging, but the town folk are extremely welcoming to college students. Teacher prioritize students and actually care if they do well . Students work hard together to study and learn so they aren't alone. Alma College is the best choice for an undergraduate program."
Works Here,5,"Staff and faculty are wonderful.  What a great experience all around!!  So much to do, you are never bored.  I will have life long friends."
Junior,5,I am a junior here at Alma College and in just the 3 years I have been here I have experienced incredible things and have been apart of amazing opportunities. I have travelled to the U.K. for a month for my spring term. I am a part of the Alma College Theatre and I have staged managed a show. I also have been employed on campus since freshman year and that has introduced me to many alumni and taught me great skills and good work ethic that will be beneficial in future jobs once I graduate.
Junior,5,"Alma College is great! There is a small, connected campus, and class sizes are very small and the professors are awesome."
Niche User,5,Alma has such a inviting campus that makes you feel as if you are at home. You are also allowed the opportunity to meet your professors on a personal level. This stuck out to my academic interests when visiting and applying.
Freshman,5,"Very family-like. Everyone is there to help. I love my advisor and the band. We have more clubs than most all schools, even the huge universities. There's activities every weekend. Never a dull moment."
Junior,5,"The campus is a very warm and welcoming place. The community is small, but that is what makes it so great. Professors work hard to make sure that students get any extra care they might need, and love watching their students succeed. While it is a small campus, there is plenty to do, and always something going on. I’m so glad that I ended up in such a great place!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this college. Even if I had the option to choose another college, I wouldn't. They make you feel right at home and they are willing to go out of their way to help you.  It is an expensive college, but it is worth it. I would definitely recommend this college to everyone."
Niche User,5,Alma college is an amazing 4 year university. It’s a beautiful campus in a beautiful city. It may be small but it’s a very welcoming and kind campus with a happy atmosphere!
Niche User,5,"The campus is in the middle of no where, but with all the activities on campus you won't even notice. Their opportunities for travel are unbelievable, the offer so many things that you can never be bored."
Alum,5,I recently just graduated from Alma College with my Bachelors of Science in Athletic Training! I transferred to Alma my sophomore year and I could not have a made a better choice. I was able to become close to my professors who truly cared about me as a person as well as meet my best friends and love of my life. Go Scots!
Niche User,5,The professors and students at Alma really do make you feel as if Alma is your home away from home. They always seem to have a smile on their face and the sporting coaches are friendly and can easily be talked to. professors offer you many opportunities for your life and help you through anything that you have trouble in or even help you through the college process. The people there are absolutely amazing.
Senior,5,"Alma College has given me everything that I would have ever wanted in a school. The biggest thing is the amount of opportunities it has provided me. Right away, I had the chance to compete for a collegiate sports team, get involved in a variety of student organizations and take high leadership roles in many of them, travel across the world (China) with the spring term courses that are offered, as well as other on campus connection opportunities through speakers (Dr. Ben Carson came to campus my junior year), alumni engagement, real-world networking, and the chance to participate in forums that enhanced my learning. I cannot speak highly enough to my experience of being an Alma College student."
College Sophomore,5,Professors want us to succeed and will put hours in and out of the classroom to make sure you do. The classes and class load is a lot to handle but great professors make it possible.
College Sophomore,5,Being a member of a Varsity athletic team I am very happy with the training facilities as well as coaching staff. There is passion and encouragement throughout each sports athletes and coaches.
College Freshman,5,I'm confident that I will be sought after when I graduate no matter what my degree is.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing, and I love my classes."
College Freshman,5,It's very easy to get a job after graduating from Alma.
College Senior,5,"I feel very secure, protected and comfortable to ask for help if I was a victim of sexual assault."
College Senior,5,Alma College has amazing academic programs and admissions process. I just wish they were more helpful when it comes to financial aid.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is incredibly friendly, and most importantly the teachers are approachable. I enjoy my time in all of my classes, even my general education classes. The school is small and so are the majority of classes on campus, so you can personally get to know your professors. Everything here runs pretty smoothly, it's a great to see that teachers from different departments know each other, which makes things much easier when trying to figure out your schedule, among other stuff. I would tell anyone who is thinking about colleges and wondering where they should consider to continue there education to consider Alma College. Alma College surely is a place that is warm, and welcoming and a great place of study."
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love it here, small town feel with big opportunities. There's a lot of things you can do at Alma college and there are so many amazing people that will be there to help you through everything."
College Freshman,5,"Alma is a loving and beutiful school. There are so many factors that lead to a safe and fun environment.  The teachers, RAs counselors and even the students are supportive and understanding of any and all situations.  This is a small personal and comfortable school that is student driven, and thrives on support and education."
College Freshman,5,"I rarely go to parties, but the few times that I have I went to the Zeta Sigma house and I had a great time. I met some new people and had a lot of fun."
College Freshman,5,"I love the social atmosphere and how friendly everyone is! I love how understanding and willing the professors are and how they're willing to help a student if they ask for it. The only downside is the expense of the college, but Alma does offer scholarships."
College Freshman,5,"I love going out on Friday and Saturday nights to the frat houses.  Weather it is for a themed night or open mic night, the dancing and guys are always on point!"
College Sophomore,5,"This is the main reason that I chose Alma. The professors here are extremely committed to your success and they will work overtime to make sure that you get there. The curriculum and class load is definitely tough, but the staff pushes you to your limit without overdoing your schedule. Registration is a walk in the park and professors/advisors make it so simple for you to get the classes that you want with the professor that you want them with."
College Sophomore,5,"SAGA is the main eating facility at Alma. It is an open buffet with a reliable variety of options, but they don't always have 5-star quality food. Joe's is a hot spot to stop and grab a bite to eat as they are open until 12:00AM every night and have more snack options available."
College Sophomore,5,"I am a Business Major at Alma, and I enjoy their Entrepreneurs in Action Program for Business affiliated majors. Alma is great at creating clubs and activities for students who have focused majors to help them develop feelings behind their specific field of study."
College Junior,5,"This is an academic school, definately. Most professors are very involved and concerned with your success, which is great. Classes are usually rather flexible, unless there aren't a lot of professors available to teach. Registration is a race to get all the good times, but that seems to be normal. I like that we all have advisors and it's mandatory to visit them before registration to make sure that you know what you're going to sign up for. You can visit your advisor more often, but I don't. The workload changes from class to class, but many of them are soul crushing. It's just kind of how the school works, and I like it. I study in my own dorm room, but there's also the library, dorm areas, and if it's warm enough outside, then outside works too. Hands on experience is also something that's really important in almost every major."
College Senior,5,I am extremely with the music program at Alma College.  The faculty at Alma are some of the leading teachers in music as well as leading scholars in the world! I would highly recommend Alma's music program for anyone who wishes to either study or perform music!
College Sophomore,5,The town is so small that it is easy for security and local police to get involved.
College Sophomore,5,"It's a strict academic school. As long as you focus on your studies, you will be a successful student at Alma College."
College Sophomore,5,Pizza is great all the time. And it is the only
College Sophomore,5,Alma is a great school!
College Freshman,5,The education program is amazing. You get experience.
College Freshman,5,Private school with high focus on academics. The liberal arts education here is fantastic
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very personable, registration is very easy, the study options allow you to do volunteer and specific classes around the world, tutors are always available, the library is the popular study area; even if the workload is plentiful for any major."
College Freshman,5,"There are many different classes offered here. The professors are great and they really know what they are teaching. Depending on the classes you take, your workload will be greater."
College Freshman,5,Student life on campus is seriously the best. There is always stuff going on for students to be a part of. We are a school of Scottish heritage so we try to do as many Scottish traditions as we can. 
College Freshman,5,I think one thing that sets us apart from other schools is how close professors and students are. All of my professors know me by name and they care about how I'm doing in class. 
College Freshman,5,The athletics here are awesome! Our weight room is super nice and so are all of our facilities. Some of our teams might not win as much as people would like but there are always fans 
College Sophomore,5,Alma is very focused on each student's success.
College Freshman,5,We have one the most delegations in  Model UN history. Professors are also really great at networking and have assisted in getting people great jobs out of college. 
College Freshman,5,Alma has so many great things to offer. The professors are some of the smartest people I have ever met who are truly looking out for the interests of their students. Things like the writing center and free tutors are also great resources to take advantage of!
College Freshman,5,"Academic Advisors keep you on track for the numerous majors offered. If there still is not a major that is of interest, creating majors or programs of emphasis is allowed and actually encouraged. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love the Education program. If I had to do it again I would. As far as my career goals, I want to become a teacher that not only helps students achieve good grades by mastering the concepts, but also help them grow as a individual. The only concern I have about finding a job is the rocky economy ."
College Sophomore,5,The Education department is wonderful! The professors throughout the Education department are always there to help you. The work load is tough but it's manageable.
College Senior,5,Alma is an amazing community.  Everyone supports each other at events.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone at Alma College is pretty indifferent about Greek life. If you don't do it no one will hate you for it, but no one hates you for joining either."
Freshman,4,All of the teachers have been great and have been giving their best effort with making this the best experience it can be. Since Alma College is small we are able to hold some in-person classes which are super beneficial.
Junior,4,"My only online experience is because of the Covid -19 crisis. During the first couple of weeks of online were a bit crazy mainly the professors only had 4 days to figure out how they are going to run class. I took a spring term as well as a summer course which had to be online. Some courses had to change what was going to happen since no traveling to other countries and no big groups were banned for the time being. But the classes were cheaper than they normal would have been. Since I am not living in a dorm and not eating the schools food, the only thing I had to pay for was the class credits. This was helpful my family financially during this pandemic."
Junior,4,"For me, the feeling of Alma is like one big family. I am not a number and Professors remember your name.  I love the size of the student body as well as the class sizes (around 15-25). It’s easy to have one on one with a professor when I need help. The campus is small. I can get to one side of campus to the other in 5 minutes. A perk so I don’t have to leave for class as early on other people do in bigger schools. Also don’t let the price scare you. No one really pays that price. There are scholarships that help take care of a big chunk of the cost."
Junior,4,I had to take one class online and finish out my semester online. The classes were varied in difficulty and enjoyness depending on the professor.
Niche User,4,"Alma College is a very good school with close knit students and a great proffesor to student connection. It is important when choosing a school that you feel comfortable and Alma really helps with you feeling at home away from home. With newly renovated housing facilities and the friendly small atmosphere, students feel very comfortable."
Sophomore,4,"Alma has been very good the last few years for me. I am able to play sports and focus on my nursing major. The college offers a variety of clubs and organizations for students to belong to and feel welcomed. Because of the small environment and campus, the professors really get to know you as not only a student, but a person. I am definitely getting my money's worth in the liberal arts scene. The liberal arts/Presbyterian atmosphere is a huge part of the culture at the school which is another great aspect. There are a lot of opportunities to work out in the small community which is very beneficial. Plaid works. The college offers a lot for students and I absolutely love it."
Junior,4,"I love Alma College because it provides amazing travel opportunities and has absolutely amazing professors. Through the college I have been able to travel to several different states and over 10 countries within the last two years. All but one of my professors has been outstanding and very willing to help their students in any way that they can. The professors are committed to the well-being and success of their students inside and outside of the classroom. One of the downsides, however, is that the Merit Scholarships do not increase as the cost of tuition increases, making it much more difficult to afford to attend the college."
Sophomore,4,"Small class sizes and small campus, make for an experience that you can't get on a large university. Many professors are invested in you and want to help you in any way that they can."
Junior,4,I’ve met a lot of great people. Plenty of the professors are great. My only problem with Alma is how scheduling is handled
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first full year at Alma College. I love the small campus and how it is really easy to meet new and amazing people. I love the music program at Alma College, the directors are great. A downside to Alma is that the food is not good at all. Sometimes the food can be good, but mostly on the main line it can be either cold or gross, but that is just my opinion."
Sophomore,4,This is an amazing college. Great opportunities not only to travel but also do amazing research and get published. Only downside is the dorms are a little outdated.
Freshman,4,Great school amazing and nice people. fortunately I'm not one of the people who had a negative experience and I love the opportunities the school can bring.
Senior,4,"Alma college is a fantastic school with professors that truely care about their students. The college challenges students to go beyond their limits by encouraging study abroad. The only thing that needs to change at Alma is the communication amongst the students, faculty, and the administration."
Sophomore,4,"Great campus, great school. Only issue is that the entire theatre department is new. The director of Presbyterian likes to yell rather than teach. Other than that great school"
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Alma, and I have had a wonderful experience so far.  I absolutely love the small college feeling.  The class sizes are small enough so you get to know all of your professors, and they get to know you as well.  This personal atmosphere creates a healthy learning environment.  Even though the college is small, there are plenty of things to do and I am never bored."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy being able to form strong and close relationships with my professors, adviser, and classmates through Alma College.  I also really enjoy the many opportunities that I am able to be a part of though Alma and the courses I take here."
Freshman,4,"Although I've only been here a semester, I've found that Alma College is the place for me. The faculty here really do care about not only your success as a student but your success and growth as a person. I'm only into my second semester here but I cannot wait to see what more Alma has to offer for me."
Junior,4,"Alma is a great place to come to school! Although it is small in size, there is a truly unique communal energy on campus, while still getting the college experience. The administration and faculty really care about your education, and because of the small class sizes, your professors honestly notice and appreciate your hard work. There are SO many on-campus clubs and organizations to choose from, it is easy to make Alma feel like home!"
Freshman,4,"I love it! I'm having a lot of fun, and the community is great.  You get to know the people in your hall, and in your classes even if you're a bit reclusive.  There's a lot of activism, on both sides of a few issues, and it's all constructive.  I love it here."
Freshman,4,"Alma is a liberal arts private college that truly cares for its students. The campus welcomes diversity and makes the comfort of students one of it's top priorities. Dorm dimensions are bigger than a lot of other Michigan colleges. The town of Alma is a bit small but perfect for those looking for a home-town feel. The professors are well qualified (however, a bit underpaid) and every professor I have had has dropped what they were doing to help me if I ever needed it. The environment is strikingly utopian-like (for a college campus), and I will always strongly enthuse about this college."
Freshman,4,"Go Scots! I absolutely adore this college. The majority of the faculty all wonderful and extremely helpful.  They truly want to see you achieve something in life and push students into functioning and helpful members of society. The only complaint I have with Alma is that they do not offer enough majors. Other than that, I have truly enjoyed this college and all of the wonderful people I have met within it."
Freshman,4,"The students and people on campus are what make Alma so inviting. Small class sizes make it easy to make connections with peers and professors, paving the way to your future."
Freshman,4,"Alma is small school in a quiet town. The professors are typically available to help students on an individual basis and can easily be reached. The food is pretty good, there's a Starbucks, and most of the people are friendly."
Junior,4,"I like the opportunities that this small school has to offer--smaller classes, many travel opportunities, and the large amount of financial support that make going to this college comparable to public colleges and universities."
College Senior,4,"Professors are probably the best part of this school. the ones I have had classes with have always been engaged and excellent teachers. They put a lot of effort into helping their students succeed and reach their potential, whether in class or outside of it."
Recent Alumnus,4,My school was small which I enjoyed. You knew just about everyone in your class and teachers were always willing to help in any way they could. Most of my class were loyal to the school and tried hard to keep its reputation up.
College Sophomore,4,The security on campus is very effective. I constantly am running into security on campus they are everywhere.
College Sophomore,4,The school offers many internships for students in many fields and provides an education level that prepares students for the work force after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small campus and amazing opportunities. I am well prepared in my field and am confident in my future.
College Sophomore,4,Food could be better and cost is high
College Junior,4,"Since we are such a small school, greek life is very different from at larger schools. I am extremely happy I went greek, but it does not confine you to one group of friends. additionally, i believe greek life does good things for the campus."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is very interesting. The people are easy to get along with and are very nice.
College Freshman,4,I feel that there are plenty of places to go and receive help.
College Freshman,4,"It's in the middle of no where, but the students and faculty are amazing."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman, the housing is better than that of my friends who went to bigger colleges in the state."
College Freshman,4,"As a member of the wrestling team, they are building a new wrestling and weight room for the athletes to use. In doing this, they're giving the coaches new offices and the cheer team gets an actual room. I think this is one of the best things because it will help out with the gym space during the winter for the basketball teams as well as the spring sports during the late winter."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my experience and time at Alma College. It is in the middle of no where, so there isn't always a lot to do but you are with your friends who you can constantly hang out with and have a great time. The academics are fantastic and I believe they rival any other institution in the state or Midwest."
College Freshman,4,"Many students are involved, the school shows amazing support, the teams are talented and highly skilled for a division 3 school."
College Freshman,4,"I made the right choice when I decided to come to Alma. I love the small class settings and how the professors and doctors know you as a person, not just a number. I also joined the cheer team here and the athletic support at this school is amazing. It is close to home and the campus is small and easy to get around."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe because I don't party, and when I go out I'm with a group. However, I know of incidences that have occurred after parties when people were not with groups."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life isn't stereotypical here. Most students are involved, and it's very welcoming."
College Freshman,4,A majority of students entering the workforce after college will find themselves with a job in six months.
College Freshman,4,Everybody comes here to work hard and expects the same of their classmates. It builds a good atmosphere of people here for a similar purpose.
College Freshman,4,"Dorms need to be updated, but it is a work in progress."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a big part of campus life, without it the school loses a lot."
College Freshman,4,Gives opportunities to every student to pursue something passionate in their field of choice.
College Sophomore,4,"Sexual assault is not common, but the school is involved in a Title 9 violation relating to the handling of a sexual assault case."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel as though I will be able to get a job easily after college, but a male in elementary education is rare. Affirmative action is on my side."
College Sophomore,4,"Alma College administration is bad and not helpful, but the rest of the campus is great. Students and faculty are some of the best people in the world."
College Sophomore,4,"Alma's administration is not very good, but the people are amazing! The friends and professors students meet here will shape the college experience in a positive way."
College Senior,4,We have many student athletes and they all love being part of the team.
College Senior,4,"It has great academic facilities for the science students, but I wish I could see more improvement in the psychology lab."
College Sophomore,4,I like Alma. I love the small campus feel. I wish sometimes that I should have chosen Central because of the bigger campus and the college feel would be greater and I would meet more people. But I like the teachers how they want us students to succeed and will do anything to help. Also the free tutors is great. I wish we had more than two choices for food on campus because neither are that great. But it has been a good second year so far.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my time at Alma the teachers and students on campus are very friendly and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Alma is a terrific school. I love living on campus because it is a great way to meet new people and create everlasting friendships. The dorms are decently sized, and there's many different ones to chose from on North and South campus. The dorms on south campus are very quiet and make it easy to study, while north campus it's about half and half on whether the dorms are quiet or not. There is one dorm that is in the process of being remodeled, and the remodel is very nice. I really enjoy the new wing of this dorm because it's very modern and clean. It is quite costly to come here though, and sometimes it feels like it's too costly, but overall I love it. The housing process is very easy, you can just go into the Center for Student Opportunities and talk to one of the ladies there, and they give you everything you need for housing and answer any questions you may have. Lastly, the dorms are very close to all the other buildings, so it makes it easy and convenient to get wherever you may need to be."
College Freshman,4,Alma is strict on many levels. It depends on which building you live in for the level of strictness. But the RA's will let you know if you're breaking any rules.
College Student,4,It's Wonderful! Everyone is friendly and helpful.
College Freshman,4,I love the Chinese food and recently discovered that the pub is very delicious and cheap.
College Freshman,4,They are very cautious here.  The RA's hired know how to do their job and will enforce the rules as need be.
College Freshman,4,I got a great scholarship from Alma and will always support this school.
College Senior,2,"District III school. Sports are not a huge draw, especially if you're not already a sports type person."
College Junior,2,"If I could go back and do it all again, I would not choose to come back to Alma college. Don't get me wrong, I've had great experiences here. There are many organizations on campus, the people are great, and I've found life long friends. There are many problems with Alma. The food is not good quality. People tend to find disgusting things in their food. It's incredibly expensive to the point where I can't afford it (hence why I'm applying for this scholarship). The school's polices are also incredibly ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,I've only been to a few athletic events and there weren't many people there and the teams weren't that good.
College Senior,2,"Our dorms are very old, the apartments need renovations, and the houses are falling apart."
College Freshman,2,"The athletics at our school is kind of going down hill. The athletic director got fired, and our football team just went 2-8 with winning the first 2 games in the first 3 weeks of the season. I think that this school needs new coaches in mostly the mens sports not so much the woman's sports they seem to be doing just fine. This school has some pretty smart people at it, i think what is coming to the school with the athletic director being fired may be the best thing thats happen to the sports program in a long time."
College Junior,2,Most of the buildings have mold in them as much as they try to hide it and some have water heater issues from time to time. All the buildings are close to the academic buildings which is nice.
College Freshman,2,It's so expensive and still hard to find a spot.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of it, but what's available is good."
College Freshman,2,"The town and the people are really nice, but it's so remote and empty that there's nothing to do."
College Freshman,2,"I'm from Milwaukee. With that, I enjoy always being busy and experiencing different activities. The attractions are limited. For instance, Walmart trips, Mc Donald runs, and Mount Pleasant shopping days are the only exciting things that I look forward to."
College Freshman,2,"There are places to park, but I always see spots open in the closer, bigger parking lots that are never taken. It's a hassle to walk all the way to the silver lot when I know that there are open spots near the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"The process is confusing, everyone makes it seem like a piece of cake but it's not. There are so many different ways and step you have to go through, and then those things have to be accepted before you can move on, it just takes a lot of time than what the seminars suggest."
College Freshman,2,"We do not have very much transportation that is provided by the school, because the school is small and the town is close by. Many students bring cars or have friends with cars or have a bike. It would be pointless to have much more transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"i didnt have a problem at all walking by myself at night last year, but this year not so much due to the violence in the town around us. "
College Freshman,2,It is really hard to find food especially with a dietary restriction. 
College Junior,2,Off campus living is great for students it is difficult to obtain. It seems that the school punishes students for living off campus by reducing scholarship rewards by fifteen percent for students who choose to live off campus. The campus is at its maximum for students but still make sit difficult to live off campus. 
College Junior,2,I have never been one to use public transportation in Alma. There is a shuttle that goes around town but I have never looked up times to see when it is running. 
College Junior,2,Campus strictness usually deals with noisy dorms and parking permits. the fines for alcohol and parking are very minimal compared to public universities and other small schools. 
College Junior,2,Parking lots can be in close proximity to dorms and classes as long as you are willing to pay and are able to sign up for passes before they are  gone. 
College Senior,2,They have some good majors but they are the basics if you want something different you either have to create your own classes and class plans or go somewhere else. 
College Senior,2,They have some good majors but they are the basics if you want something different you either have to create your own classes and class plans or go somewhere else. 
College Senior,2,It is not hard to get drugs but if you don't use them its no big deal u will not be left out. 
College Senior,2,There are a few non fast food restaurants but that is what is basically available. 
College Senior,2,Some of the teams are good and some more need work. 
College Junior,2,"There are only 3 places to eat and only 2 of the 3 take meals. The food quality is crap! We have a brand new dining facility that is AWESOME, but we still have the same crappy food."
College Junior,2,"The permit cost is off the charts, the cheapest is $150 for a block off of campus. There isn't enough room for all the cars on campus."
College Senior,2,Parking on campus is great because everybody from seniors to freshman can have their car on campus.  Parking is also close to the dorms since Alma is such a small campus.  The major issue with the parking is that it is expensive and small housing does not get much in parking areas.
College Sophomore,2,"Alma is a great school, but it doesn't have a whole lot of diversity. The majority of the school is middle class or upper middle class white people. I'd imagine that most students there are christian because it's a christian college but there are some that are not. Even though there is little diversity, there's a whole lot of acceptance."
College Senior,2,"The school is mostly dominated by caucasian students, it is a small school and there is some diversity but not much. However, all diverse groups are accepted. It's more a judge of character then a judgement of what they look like or lifestyle choices."
College Sophomore,2,Very few if any options for nightlife. If students wish to go to a club they will have to drive at least thirty minutes to reach a club. The better options are the house and Frat parties which are free to get into and within walking distance of campus.
College Freshman,2,I think students would benefit if there were long distance transportation. But the shuttle for in town transportation is extremely useful. Although I am not sure all of the students know about it.
College Freshman,2,"Alma is a very bland place, very little variation present."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is available and usually at a reasonable price. However, it does not seem to be worth it to most students."
College Junior,2,"Process Needs Work – Alma doesn't give too many scholarships. It needs to offer more. The financial aid office is great at helping you. However the award letters are always messed up and miscalculated, and our website is always changing and honestly getting worse with every new add on and addition. If the Website is clear and simple with direct links to loan info ect. The whole process would be much easier."
College Junior,2,Lots of Car Pooling – No buses really or any other way besides car pooling. Don't really need buses though..
Recent Alumnus,2,"Almost None Available – Unless you are a commuter you have to live on campus until your senior year, and then the people who can live off campus are chosen through a lottery."
College Freshman,2,The security's main responsibility is giving parking tickets for cars parked in restricted areas. While they are supposed to patrol parties they mainly stay outside and out of sight. There have also been several complaints of security guards breaking their own rules of conduct when dealing with students and their property
College Freshman,2,"On Life Campus – The dorms are sub-par, to say the least. Yet the tuition is through the roof. There are not many washing or dryers so good luck."
College Sophomore,2,"In the Middle of Nowhere – There is not much to do off campus in Alma. In fact, the students here say we live in ""the bubble."" In a way, it's nice that students do not have to worry about wandering around late at night but it would be nice if we had a mall; or anything for that matter."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking permit prices are expensive....having said that, the college should do a better job keeping people without permits from parking."
College Freshman,1,"there is very limited options for housing off campus thats why my roommate and i may be moving to Mt Pleasant next year just because we hate the dorms that much. The only options we have is to stay in the dorms for are sophomore year, you can't move off campus until your a junior or senior and even then the housing options are pretty limited compared to other colleges."
College Junior,1,"If you want to get aid, start saving as early as possible for each term and double check with the financial office every step of the way."
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing to do in Alma. In certain situations, Alma College is so strict and small that students do not have different activities to do."
College Senior,1,If you don't have your own transportation then you are stuck at school unless you can get a ride from a friend. 
College Senior,1,"They are there but its hard to get them, they need to be more accessible to students that need them. "
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely nothing to do in Alma. Most people drive to Lansing or Grand Rapids for stuff to do.
College Sophomore,1,"There are some people here who care about sports, but for the most part? Sports aren't all that important here."
College Senior,1,"Most of the off campus dining options are fast food or chains, there are very few healthy options. Also almost all of the dining options close before midnight."
College Freshman,1,"The dining services earn the most complaints from the student body as a whole. While there are many options to vary what you eat, most of them are very unhealthy. The healthy options such as fruits and vegetables are not always fresh and the prepared cooked meals have been known to be so poor that students refuse to eat them."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Sport Centric – The athletic scene at Alma is not very popular. Some teams like the girls' volleyball team kick butt, however our football team is pretty bad. Fans usually go to the first game of the season and that's about it."
College Junior,1,"Fail fail fail fail fail. The school has outrageous policies, and is extremely unprofessional at handling problems. Drinking and drug use are growing on campus, and nobody seems to care. However, don't ever park in the wrong space or try to have a microwave in your room, you may be burned at the stake."

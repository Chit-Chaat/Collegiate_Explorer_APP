Alum,5,"I took one online class with MBU while in high school through their affordable Dual Enrollment program. I also took two online classes during my undergrad, and based on my experience looking for online graduate schools, MBU's online dual enrollment, undergrad, and grad programs are the best you will find. Their online staff respond quickly and the professors are an excellent resource in the class. If MBU had a graduate degree in Communications, I would be going there hands-down."
Alum,5,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at MBU.edu .The faculty genuinely personally care about their students. I made life-long friendships and I personally grew through these friendships.
Junior,5,"Maranatha Baptist University is an excellent establishment not only for academic growth, but also for spiritual enhancement and relational development. Staff and teachers alike are kind and helpful, as well as the student body. The college is located in the beautiful city of Watertown, with enjoyable restaurants and shops within walking distance. I would recommend Maranatha to anyone in search of a hospitable and encouraging place to extend their academic career."

Freshman,5,"Maranatha Baptist University is a wonderful college that is small enough to feel like a family, yet large enough to challenge you academically. My experience through their online learning has been incredible. The teachers care about you as an individual, and want to see you thrive. 

The on-campus experience is a mix for me. All the faculty is very sweet. However, the actual facilities are a bit old. Some of the dorms are quite old too. However, the main buildings are decorated in a fresh style, and the new additions that have been added (café and student hang-out area) definitely upgrade the campus."
Freshman,5,"I love Maranatha Baptist University because, although it is a mid-sized college and located in a small town, the campus itself is full of life and energy. The teachers are invested in the students' growth and future outside of just getting a good grade in class. The students all encourage and help each other out, and there is a spirit of camaraderie we all share. The classes are extremely helpful, and the professors push students to always give their best and not coast through college, and to be all in wherever they are. Overall, the people, academics, opportunities, and friendships I have made in just the first semester of attending Maranatha have made me certain that I made the right choice when I picked Maranatha!"
Junior,5,"Maranatha is a great college with a focus on training leaders from Christ. Even before I became a student, I noticed the maturity of the student body, as well as their good spirit, something that I have appreciated more and more as I have studied here. The professors are excellent, with fabulous life-long experience in both the workplace and ministry. The academics are high-quality, as well as the music, the preaching, and the fine arts. If you want to be pushed to do your best academically and spiritually, then Maranatha is the place for you. Most of all, I love how much faculty and other students care about you. Christ's love is obvious."
Freshman,5,"I really liked MBU because of the great atmosphere that they create. Their professors are kind and want to see you succeed even if that means staying late after school to make sure you know what you are doing. They really care about their students and love what they teach. I cannot help but be interested in a class that the professor enjoys talking about. The students understand this and can be more open about what they are not understanding. Overall, a great place to be."
Freshman,5,"My first impression of Maranatha Baptist University is the fact that the staff are very welcoming, helpful and professional. I walked into the admissions office with several questions and concerns about applying to attend for my first year of college and the admissions office worker informed me on everything that I needed to do in order to get admitted. We got started right away the same day. They also gave me a Maranatha Baptist University shirt for applying. This is definitely a college that I would recommend looking into."
Freshman,5,"Online classes have been helpful, organized, and interesting. My professors knew their subjects well and used a variety of materials to teach. They gave several types of assignments, including writing, reading, videos, and audio."
Sophomore,5,The faculty and staff at Maranatha Baptist University care about the students. They want their students to succeed and be prepared for a future career. I feel that I am getting an excellent education and will be prepared for my future career when I graduate.
Niche User,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful. As soon as you walk on campus you can tell there is something different about this place. A good different.
Freshman,5,"I have loved my time so far here at MBU - the faculty is qualified and caring, and the student body is friendly and supportive."
Freshman,5,I love the people that are involved with making MBU great! The professors here are interested in you and want to help you with anything. The people here are very open and easy to talk to. The atmosphere here is a very positive and the curriculum is very stable and educational. I would like MBU to get some artistic classes because that would give the students something fun and less stressful to take.
Sophomore,5,I'm an internarional student at Maranatha Baptist University. I really love the people here. Stuff do an amazing work interacting and helping students. It is a small community where you not feel alone.
Freshman,5,"I love the staff. They truly care about the students lives, not just their academics. I also really enjoy the challenge of the academics. There’s not something that comes to mind that specifically needs to change."
Freshman,5,"I like the open, friendly atmosphere found at Maranatha Baptist University. They state and mean that the have an open doors policy. All of the professors are more than willing to help you with any question you may have, the students are friendly, and the campus is well-laid out."
Alum,5,"My experience at Maranatha was a very delightful experience! I love the small, family like atmosphere. Everyone knows each other, the teachers know you by name. The small town for me was another plus. The facilities are wonderful. They are kept clean and up to date. I would totally recommend Maranatha to any young person who is looking for a great christian college to attend!"
College Senior,5,Athletics at the school are pretty good. We have alot of team pride and student involvement.
College Senior,5,Dorm lock is at 10 every night except for weekends. But it's nice because then you can work on homework and just kill in the dorms without getting into trouble.
College Junior,5,There are many employers who come to campus! At the beginning of the year several employers come to campus and set up in one of the large meeting rooms seeking college students who are willing to work for them.
College Junior,5,I love Marantha Baptist University! Maranatha is a small college that is very welcoming. The professors are always very helpful and are willing to take the time to help you. The food is great and it is always fun to eat in the Dinning Common with a group of friends. There are also encouraging chapel sessions every morning. My most favorite thing about Maranatha is the online duel credit courses available for high school students. I was able to complete 26 credit hours before coming to campus and arrived as a second semester freshman! This was a huge money saver for me and I highly recommend it to all college students considering any college.
College Freshman,5,My experience at Maranatha Baptist University has been amazing. My roommates and I get along great and all my classes have been fairly easy. I am completely satisfied with my choice. MBU has such a friendly atmosphere. Not once have I felt left out. The teachers have also been amazing. They are not boring and they genuinely care about my education at MBU.
College Sophomore,5,Great School! Regionally accredited with exceptional faculty. I love the class sizes and the dorm life.
College Junior,5,"Our campus is very safe. Security officers walk girls to their dorms after dark, and girls required to go out in pairs after dark if leaving campus. The rules in place help keep us all safe."
College Junior,5,"Team performance is high, and many of our teams are national champions. School spirit is high, especially for the MBU ""crazies."" Faculty, staff, and students all support our teams."
College Junior,5,I love Weeks dorm. The girls in this dorm are friends with each other and don't take themselves too seriously. They are very fun-loving.
College Junior,5,I love my major. Curriculum is relevant and projects are helpful.
College Junior,5,"Teaching ""internships"" are unpaid but many fieldwork hours are required. They're fun though!"
College Junior,5,"The academics are rigorous, and I have not learned anything that I would consider irrelevant. The profs are amazing."
College Junior,5,The professors are amazing. They genuinely care for and love every student. They want you to succeed and are willing to help you do so.
College Junior,5,"I've never felt unsafe at MBU. The security guards are awesome and apart from some theft, there is not really any crime on campus."
College Junior,5,The process was extremely easy (I just had to turn in my FAFSA) and it was accepted quickly.
College Freshman,5,The party scene is always wholesome and alcohol and drug free! Of course! ;)
College Freshman,5,There is hardly any if ever any situations or incidents with crime or violence on this campus.
College Junior,5,I enjoy my program because of the flexibility of tailoring it to the specific goals I have.
Recent Alumnus,5,"MBU is a safe environment with no sexual assaults. Our security ensures the safe of campus at all times, and the police in Watertown are very friendly towards us."
Recent Alumnus,5,"MBU has many scholarships to offer, and accepts many grants too."
Recent Alumnus,5,"MBU has the best Christian college cafeteria in the states. It is open all day, and has really good food."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We have no racial discrimination, and we do not practice sexual orientation."
Senior,4,I've loved the relationships I've been able to develop with my professors. They genuinely care about their students and are always willing to meet and get coffee and talk about anything. The only thing I would like to see change is the dress code.
Senior,4,"I took a couple classes online. They were well explained, my teachers were easy to access, and I rather enjoyed them."
Sophomore,4,"I love my teachers. They are kind, hard working people who desire to see their students succeed. They have high standards for their students but they are also willing to help the students reach those standards. I am confident if I am struggling that I can stop by their office or send them an email and they will put whatever they are working on aside to help me."
Senior,4,"I had a really good experience while at MBU. The teachers invested personally in my life and the class material has greatly impacted how I think and live today. Though I do not hold to many of MBU's conviction guidelines (such as music, entertainment, dress), I still walked away with more love and respect for others who were different from me. I have been very impressed with the support I have received having once been on campus and now an online student for 4 years. staff still know who I am and what is going on in my life. Not because I keep a relationship with them, but because that is how they are - very personable. They are worked well with m as I have moved several times, had to transfer in credits, and change my major."
Freshman,4,They are helping students in their path through life not only through knowledge but also by helping them to understand the wonders of Christ and His plan for us.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the interaction with the variety of people with a variety of interests on campus. It is fun to be with people that like life.
Junior,4,It is a great school academically and a great place to make friends. I have been going to Maranatha for a few years now and have learned a lot within my field of study. Maranatha has challenged me to extend my boundaries and put myself out there to learn and grow in my field. The professors really care and want to see you grow in the best way possible.
Junior,4,"Maranatha is a Christian University, desiring to train leaders in secular vocations and for ministry."
College Senior,4,Living on campus gives you an opportunity to make alot of new friends and to be able to meet new people.
College Senior,4,I would choose this school again because its a great atmosphere and it encourages you to grow in your walk with the Lord.
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is great, very comfortable, enough space for everyone and  a friendly atmosphere"
College Freshman,4,"The athletic and fitness areas are great, open for anyone and easy to find"
College Freshman,4,"All the proffessors are eager to help. They are passionate about their subjects, and they are more than willing just to sit down and talk whenever it is needed. The classes are aimed to teach the students effectively, and are offered in many majors and minors. There are also tracks, Master degrees, and online classes."
College Freshman,4,"Maranatha has a lot of security measures in place for its students. The dorm lock is one of the most obvious ones, along with all the registration requirements for vehicles, and the curfew for students. They have many more that I don't feel knowledgeable enough to state, but safety is one of the top priorities of the faculty and staff. I definitely feel very safe here."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are very comfortable. They provide each person with a desk, dresser, bed, and closet space, along with storage space, laundry facilities, bathroom and showers, and study areas. They are in included in the tuition cost, but do not cost much comparative to living off campus. They are full of helpful girls that help you move in and get used to the set up."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at my school are very broad. There is cross-country, track, volleyball, basketball, football, soccer and more. Students are welcome and encouraged to try out, even if they are not major athletes. Everyone rallies around the school teams to promote school spirit, and the teams work together to best represent our school. There are regular practices, and indoor fitness equipment as well."
College Freshman,4,"I have just started my college career, but everyone is so helpful and encouraging that I don't feel as nervous as I thought I would. When I arrived on campus for the first time I was so scared, but after the first weekend I knew I could get help and advice whenever I asked for it. The staff and faculty are committed to helping the students succeed, whether it be by explaining a concept, helping them find places, or just praying with them when they need comfort. I would choose it again because I know I can grow and thrive here."
College Sophomore,4,"Basically, if you want it, it's there. If you want an internship, they will help you find one. If you want a job, they'll help you find one. Maranatha won't drag you through your degree and make you successful. You have to want it and ask for it, then you'll have it."
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love living in the dorms at Maranatha (It's not like I have much of a choice). It is pretty nerve racking not knowing your room mates till the day you show up but most of the time your room mates end up being your very best friends that you can go to for anything.
College Junior,4,This school has great opportunities. I feel I will be successful in getting an internship and job.
College Junior,4,My school is very safe. I do not feel threatened or worried when I am attending school there.
College Junior,4,Campus housing provides me with all the necessities i need to live. I can sleep and shower. The facility is clean and comfortable to live in.
College Junior,4,Athletics at Maranatha are great. The sports teams are so successful. They accelerate in sports. Several teams have reached districts on many occasions. They do a great job competing.
College Freshman,4,The women's cross country team was encouraging in helping me achieve my personal goals and was caring and understanding.
College Freshman,4,They helped me grow in my walk with Christ!
College Freshman,4,Maranatha encourages school spirit throughout the week and notify the students of upcoming games.
College Freshman,4,The daily Chapel meeting were an unique experience Maranatha provided for its students.
College Junior,4,We don't have a fraternity or sorority at my school.
College Freshman,4,"The professors are extremely helpful and well-educated in their field. They help make difficult concepts easy to understand and are always willing to answer questions. The coursework is very manageable, especially if the student is well-organized."
College Freshman,4,"This college is regionally accredited, which is helpful when looking for a future job. The alumni have also been influential in the communities where they live and work."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are very clean and well-kept. There is adequate space in the rooms as well.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a great way to meet more people and socialize with them.
College Freshman,4,"The school spirit is definitely evidenced in the enthusiasm seen at soccer and basketball games, as well as the other sports, such as volleyball and cross country."
College Freshman,4,I enjoyed the special chapel that I attended that included skits and entertaining and encouraging songs. The staff is also extremely helpful and kind.
College Freshman,4,"We always have security walking around campus, checking locked doors and assuring everyone that there is no need to worry. I feel very safe. We have fire drills every once in awhile as well to make sure the detectors are still working."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone is helpful in sending emails, posting updates, or setting up meetings to assist students who are looking for career options."
College Freshman,4,"I LOVE my dorm. I am a part of Weeks Hall and it's just crazy. Everyone gets along and we have a blast. The dorm sup. is smart and loves to hang out with us or joke around. She knows how to enforce the rules and does not play favorites. The rooms are cozy, but somewhat small. It's really expensive, however. I think the cost it takes from our tuition is 2-3,000$. Honestly, I'm only in the dorm in the evening after classes and work. I will say, though, that Weeks is worth the walk."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics play a big role in MBU life. Every home game has a different theme, for example, a White out. Everyone wears white and goes to the game. We have a section for the ""crazies"" in which the majority of the students sit and cheer and make a lot of noise. We are not rude to the other team. The teams always seem like they're best friends when they're walking around school or sitting on the bench. They work hard to include everyone and seem to have high levels of team unity."
College Freshman,4,"I love going to Maranatha because the faculty all show genuine love and care for every student. The teachers are all very knowledgable in their subjects and give homework and projects that help us learn and think critically. I have a few close friends here and have even found my future husband here. The experiences I have with my friends-- whether it's roller blading on Thursday nights, getting coffee, or even having a study session, are unforgetable and make going to MBU an experience that I would definitly repeat if I had to."
College Sophomore,4,"""Be Loud. Be Proud. Be Positive."" School support is huge."
College Sophomore,4,Professors really care and invest in the students.
College Freshman,4,"I would definitely choose Maranatha Baptist University again. Even though sometimes I grow tired of the routine and the many rules, I do realize they are put in place to help us students be succesful.

Maranatha has a very ""home"" like feel. I know there are always peers, dorm leaders, staff, or faculty that I can go to for encouragement."
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is important at the school, and the athletes are very good!"
College Freshman,4,"I love Maranatha, and I know that God has led me to Maranatha for a purpose. I have loved taking my online classes, and I cannot wait to start on-campus in the fall."
College Junior,4,Campus is very safe and I feel extremely comfortable walking alone. There are always several security guards walking around campus.
College Junior,4,The dorm at Maranatha are very nice. They are very clean and spacious!
College Junior,4,The athletics are Maranatha are amazing! This year each all of the sports teams did wonderful and the women's volleyball team was able to go to Florida and they won the championship!
College Junior,4,"Overall my experience has been very good. I love how the instructors care about each student for the most part, and they want to see their students succeed. If you struggle with a subject, the school gives you the option of finding a tutor, which was helpful when I was not sure of a subject my Freshman Year. The atmosphere is small, but many activities are available on and off campus. Ministries are also available for students to participate in as they attend the college and choose a church in Wisconsin or Illinois to attend. Overall, the experience has helped me grow spiritually and in maturity. I recommend this school to others."
College Freshman,4,Everyone was welcoming and very helpful in answering any questions we had.
College Junior,4,Many people at the school find their future husband/wife here. Students dress sharp and look neat. Most of the students like to have fun. Most are highly religious and focused on making a difference for Christ in the world. I've found amazing friends here.
College Junior,4,"Students at Maranatha have fun when they get together. Events include skating, Christmas decorating, and acapella groups."
College Junior,4,"The city of Watertown has a good variety of restaurants, including most favorite option. In addition, Madison and Milwaukee are within easy driving distance, and those cities have any restaurant options you could want."
College Junior,4,The school has a number of privately funded scholarships specially designated for Maranatha students. These scholarships are ones I have had the most luck with because they are more personal and specifically geared toward different qualities and majors.
College Junior,4,"Getting into the education program is relatively easy. You need to have the required classes completed, complete 25 hours of fieldwork, and have an interview with your adviser."
College Junior,4,"ElEd majors have a ton of projects to complete, but my classmates are amazing and profs are understanding and flexible."
College Junior,4,Our campus is very beautiful
College Junior,4,Girls - be sure to choose Hilsen as your dorm. The other dorms simply do not compare.
College Junior,4,"Most ""hangout"" places on campus are generally nice and enjoyable. There are certain places which require improvement."
College Junior,4,"Because of the regional accreditation, a degree from Maranatha is highly valued by employers."
College Junior,4,The professors genuinely care about the students. I also appreciate the smaller class sizes.
Freshman,2,"The school is really small. If you’re a girl, the school is sexist especially if you’re a more curvy girl. They’re stupid strict. The classes are good. Few teachers are amazing like Mrs, Miller"
College Junior,2,I am not familiar with sorority or greek life.
College Junior,2,"There is no shortage of fan support or school spirit. Some teams are amazing while others struggle to win a single game. There is a fitness center, but it is small and not the greatest quality. Your best bet is to go for a run around town."
College Junior,2,"In order to live off-campus, you must be either married, over the age of 23, or live with your parents. If those apply to you, you can probably find a crappy apartment pretty easily."
College Sophomore,2,Could choose what to be strict about better
College Sophomore,2,Small town with not much going on
College Junior,2,You have to know someone for it to worth it.
College Junior,2,"I don't enjoy the rules, weather, or atmosphere."
College Junior,2,In my dorm the walls are paper thin and have gaps between them and the ceiling.
College Sophomore,2,I don't really get a lot.
College Sophomore,2,The school is excessively strict!
College Sophomore,2,theres 5 black kids and the rest aare all white
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't option because we can get into to trouble for doing any of those
College Sophomore,2,The college administration strongly discourages off-campus housing. They require a student to be twenty-three years of age in order to move off campus. This makes it very difficult financially for students to graduate in four years. Many have to take a year off to work.
College Freshman,2,"Out of the 14 classes I have taken this year I have only found to be learning a substantial amount in around 6 maybe. A number of the professors I have had struggle to make the class interesting or applicable to the real world. While I say that, the Bible classes are all incredibly good. I have found myself learning a great deal from them. Certain English teachers and Science teacher have to be let go for this college to succeed"
College Freshman,2,Computers are very average and there is nothing special about them.
College Freshman,2,"Many students are involved in sports and the fan support is always outstanding at every home game. However, athletes do not have any exemptions from class cuts when they have away games, making it difficult for all athletes to not overcut classes and thus face failing the course."
College Freshman,2,"Not the Best – I was ridiculed, gossiped about, ignored, and feared because I was different than the average student attending Maranatha. Even the deans ridiculed and hassled me when I asked for help. However, I did meet a few good friends, and I will be forever grateful for their friendships."
College Freshman,2,maranatha does not provide any form of transtportation for students
Graduate Student,1,God forbid you're not in church every time the doors are open... fortunately you can just sleep under your bed on Sunday mornings and no one knows you’re still in your room when they do their ridiculous room checks.
Niche User,1,"I am someone whom met/tried seeing someone from this college and I can honestly say that MBU is excessively strict. When it comes to dress code, what you do with your life outside of school - including whom you want to spend time with/date, they control it all. If you so much as get caught with someone of the opposite sex in their parking lot, even if its just to drop a person that goes there off, that person will be sent to the deans office and reprimanded if not anything worse. They sat this person down and made sure she didn't contact me on any social media outlet  (blocked) even though this person didn't want to cut off contact with me. I have heard from others that have just looked at the first page of the Student Handbook that this place sounds more like a cult than an actual Christian college. Would not recommend."
Niche User,1,"Despite windy,painfully cold,below freezing conditions,women had to walk to and from campus in skirts and were not permitted to wear leggings or pants under them even if the skirts were floor length.When it was windy,many women struggled to keep their skirts down.A stair case was grated/see through.

Only men can wear jeans.  

Women,but not men,need permission to drive longer distances from campus

Attending an unapproved church typically results in harsh disciplined or expulsion.

Women must walk before their dorm supervisor in every outfit they own to have their butts,chests,and legs inspected.

Dorm supes arrange outings to Brewers games where obvious alcohol and intoxication are pervasive.However,you risk expulsion by proximity to alcohol elsewhere.

I received a phone call from a dear friend of mine.She was suicidal.I tried to stay on the phone with her,but was badgered and threatened by a dorm supervisor until I told my sobbing friend that I had to hang up to go to church."
College Sophomore,1,I don't really think that Maranatha has any Greek
College Junior,1,"We do not have Greek Life. We do have societies, though, which is a sad attempt at something similar."
College Junior,1,"Basically, there is no party scene. What did you expect?"
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life here.
College Junior,1,They try to control every aspect of your life.
College Junior,1,Limited financial aid. Students must find own aid.
College Junior,1,Not the place to date.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"At my school it is against the rules to go to clubs, bars, or wild parties. Dorm lock is at 10:00, so the nightlife is pretty much inexistent."
College Freshman,1,"Athletics are somewhat poor at Maranatha, not a lot of pride in our school."
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife at Maranatha is relatively boring. There isn't anything to do in Watertown and curfew is at 10PM except on Friday nights when curfew is midnight. There usually isn't much going on.
College Freshman,1,"Justice Without Mercy – The school is very strict, even with their counselling.  If a student who has been involved with drugs, drinking, sex, etc. goes to a dean for help, they are usually kicked out of the school. There is no mercy. If a student needs help, they have to go to their friends instead. If a student doesn't get kicked out, they are ridiculed and given bad advice."

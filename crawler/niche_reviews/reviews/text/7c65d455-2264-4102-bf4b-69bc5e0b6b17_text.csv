Junior,5,"I transferred here from an Ivy, and I learned more in the first two weeks here than I did an entire semester at my previous school. Everyone is super nice and the professors are pretty much always available to help you. The food is amazing because you can eat at actual restaurants on your meal plan. The dorms vary, but most are really nice even if they are small. Classes here (at least in my experience) have been smaller than my Ivy classes. The athletics department is THE BEST, every administrator is there to support you and they really care about you. The location is great because the beach and the city are both so close, and LA is like a two-hour drive. The campus is beautiful and it's pretty much always sunny. People are really relaxed and there is a great balance between school and social life. I would recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn a lot and also get the full college experience."
Junior,5,"It's been pretty easy to manage. Most of my classes turned asynchronous this semester which works well for me because I can make my own schedule, but some people struggle with it. All of my professors are still available for office hours and continue to help me with grad school planning and recommendations. I think the system works pretty well right now, but I miss in-person classes. I think the biggest struggle is that the school is in between blackboard and canvas, so you have to check like seven different places to find assignments and zoom links."
Sophomore,5,"Before Covid-19, I had the opportunity to physically experienced the beautiful  campus of SDSU. I was a commuter but still felt like I experienced the college life. Every one was so welcoming and inviting to the campus and some even introduce me to their SDSU clubs and organizations. There is also many food options, my favorite spot was Panda Express and Starbucks. Overall, the campus feels welcoming and homey and everyone you meet is really nice and helpful including professors."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love SDSU! The people are all so welcoming and friendly and everyone make. you feel like you belong there. It is my home away from home and I have loved every minute. I can’t see myself at any other college. I am so glad that K chose SDSU!
Alum,5,I personally enjoyed studying at San Diego State University. Most of the professors are nice to work with.
Senior,5,"The professors have adjusted well to online learning, with SDSU Flex becoming the new normal. Many courses have been adjusted to suit the needs of transitioning to fully online."
Freshman,5,"My experience with San Diego State University thus far has been challenging and rewarding. There’s no doubt I will continue to strive while I attend this temple of knowledge and opportunity. I pledge to keep exploring all the open doors SDSU has to offer, and to not stop until I feel I’ve gained enough experience, knowledge and appreciation from its peers, educators and inhabitants."
Freshman,5,"During these times where online education is taking the lead, SDSU and its staff did a great job adapting to the needs of students still working towards their goals."
Junior,5,I enjoy the campus there is many green areas and the library is enormous which is great if you want to do your homework and concentrate. The food is great and the food stands once a week are delicious. Overall the school feels secure which is a great.
Junior,5,Most of the professor are very organize is easy to understand content and the deadlines are not crazy and if you have a question they contact you as soon as they can which is very helpful. I think schools give us enough tools to succeed in the classes.
Junior,5,I took 2 classes online over the summer and previously finished spring semester online due to the pandemic. It wasn't hard and I enjoyed it. The professors are very helpful and knowledgable when dealing with online classes and they have adapted very well.
Junior,5,"It is a very fun student experience, classes are not too difficult, there are cool professors. However, the administration is not great at communication"
Junior,5,"While taking online classes the professors have done an outstanding job adjusting themselves, and students, in the online format without affecting the overall learning experience. They have used a variety of platforms in order to ensure the students learn accordingly. Such platforms include email, power-point presentations, screen recording, and even Zoom conferences. Some have even offered calls/text for those who have any outstanding doubts. With the current circumstances, the dedication of the professors to commit to fully online classes is very much appreciated."
Junior,5,"I am just starting Fall 2020, but the help and guidance I have received from the faculty is amazing."
Sophomore,5,"As an incoming second year student at San Diego state, I am pleased by the campus community as well as the faculty."
Alum,5,My time at San Diego State was great. They have a lot of resources for students and opportunities to join different organizations. The majority of the professors employed there were awesome and really worked to help students succeed.
Junior,5,"This semester I took four online classes due to the pandemic. My overall experience was smooth but overwhelming at the same time because of the unseen transition from on campus to online. I’m very satisfied with my experience and grades for this Spring 2020 semester, not bad for my first semester as a transfer student."
Junior,5,San Diego State University has an excellent academic program that helps transfer students succeed their goals in education.
Niche User,5,This is a great school especially in the sciences. They are a leader and work with many industry companies to ensure you have the best success after graduation
Niche User,5,This is a great school especially in the business. They are a leader and work with many industry companies to ensure you have the best success after graduation
Alum,5,I loved my experience in the Dance Division. The small class sizes helped me feel connected to classmates and faculty. My experience in the School of Business was less rewarding.
Sophomore,5,My online experience went mostly smoothly. I had one professor who was unable to transition to the online space without sacrificing the integrity of his course but all of my other professors made a very timely move to the online platform.
Sophomore,5,I've been studying at SDSU for one year now and the experience is one unlike any other. The professors are very caring and informative. More academic oversight measures would be nice but would seem difficult to implement.
Alum,5,"Loved the environment, the people. Lots of on and near campus housing, many dining options. Lots of fun classes, many majors. Lots of night life and greek involvement."
Alum,5,The online experience was just like any other online learning program. The classes were only offered online if they knew you would or could learn something from it.
Alum,5,I took a lot of courses online and it was a very pleasant system to work with. The only issue is taking multiple at once because the workload is a lot more to handle than an in person class
Alum,5,I really loved going to school here the campus is so lively and everyone is super friendly. There is so much to do around the area and so many things to interact with.
Sophomore,5,"I am having a great experience overall. While some may say that the dorms are not of the best quality at SDSU, the dorm life is something I do not think I could have experienced anywhere else. I have never become so close to a group of people in only 4 months. This along with the facilities, food, and activities available made dorm life life changing. So far, the education that I have received at SDSU has been amazing and I look forward to continuing with my education."
Sophomore,5,"I took some classes online due to the current pandemic of COVID-19 and while that happened, the professors did a great job in moving the classes online. They provided us with a lot of information, office hours, help, and specific instructions on what they expect from the work needed to be done."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed how San Diego State University had many diverse clubs/activities. You were able to find something that you enjoyed doing or to better your education. Many professors are very helpful and kind; if you need help with any of the work, they will have office hours available."
Freshman,5,"Thus far, my experience has been all virtual. I am very pleased with the community of SDSU via online modality during this time of Covid-19. I am looking forward to the opportunities and being part of this community while this nation starts the healing and recovery process."
Freshman,5,"I love my visits to SDSU. I can't wait to be of this diverse community. Moving across the country and leaving my family was a really big decision for me to make. SDSU gave me the strength to leave home, I felt like I had a home to go to."
Alum,5,Easy to get around campus. Everyone is friendly and professors can be helpful when you need it. Don't be afraid to ask for help!
Alum,5,Pretty simple with all the resources readily available to you. Just follow what your professor says. Not a lot of workload.
Junior,5,"I took a few classes online and the coursework was definitely less than my in-person classes. My online professors were very accommodating and just as awesome as my professors whom I met with in person every week. Sometimes online professors are lenient with their deadlines and that can be both a blessing and a curse. As long as you stay on top of your deadlines and submit your assignments promptly, you'll do well!"
Junior,5,"I loved my experience at San Diego State. My experience with my professors was always very positive and they were always very helpful and interested in making sure I obtained the material well. They always made lectures entertaining. Not only is the campus breathtaking, SDSU is located in the best place possible. At SDSU, you're surrounded by so much to do--beaches, shopping malls, hiking, etc. Not only did I thrive academically, but my social life excelled as well. There's so many ways to get involved on campus, through Greek life and a variety of clubs. Although the transition into college may seem intimidating, SDSU is an amazing school and you''ll be sure to find your place here!"
Graduate Student,5,I loved my time at SDSU. The campus is gorgeous and there is a thriving student life. There are many food court options.
Junior,5,I love the location of the campus and the diversity of the population of students. There are so many opportunities in different departments and a really amazing job is done to advertise these events and inform people of them. There's a lot of dining options and many clubs and activities. I appreciate the great amount of effort that goes into planning the wonderful social events and guest speakers that are very unique. The professors are very knowledgeable and skilled in their specific area of study. The atmosphere amongst the students is one of support and strength. Rather than a competition everyone helps and supports each other.
Junior,5,San Diego State is an amazing school that has a place for everyone. The professors care about the well being of their students and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus.
Alum,5,"SDSU is great. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student. The campus is beautiful, people are nice, and students are diverse."
Alum,5,"SDSU is great. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a student. The campus is beautiful, people are nice, and students are diverse."
Freshman,5,"SDSU has such an amazing campus with nature and Mexican traits, various organizations and a good social life even if you are shy (the campus' population is HUGE and DIVERSE, you can choose and meet people anytime). Yet, they still lack on the way they target their students through marketing on events: the news portal and websites are not very accessible and they are poor notifications' platforms."
Sophomore,5,"I have been able to grow professionally, academically, and personally over my first couple years at San Diego State University. The professors all have a vast amount of knowledge and bring their expertise to each of their classes to improve student learning. I am looking forward to the rest of my time at San Diego State University and am excited to see how I can develop into the best person I can be at this school."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience at San Diego State University has been satisfying. I have been able to get a good education through online classes and have enjoyed some of the ways my professors have used Zoom to have guest speakers and special guest lecturers. While online learning will never be as good or as beneficial as in-person education, I still feel like my experience with online classes has been a good one."
Niche User,5,I’m a high school junior and always tour San Diego State. It’s always so beautiful every time I’m there!
Junior,5,Currently in the process of transferring to this university early via Summer 2020 summer sessions. I'm already enjoying how well things are going in just this transfer process
Freshman,5,good retty much havent gone there but I am excited for my next upcoming year. I am kind of disappointed that frats are so closed off as I have heard invite only :( But it is what it is and all it is is school so its not that big of a deal lol.
Freshman,5,A friendly environment and very helpful staff. Great with academics you have many opportunities to do research and present it. Also a great study aboard program.
Alum,5,Such a great school! Great vibes and amazing people. The staff is chill and the weather is always wonderful.
Freshman,5,Pretty solid university. Good professors and good variety of clubs to join. Great resources for students to use and many on-campus jobs are available.
Freshman,5,"So far it's been easy to figure out all my first steps of college! The people seem really nice so far too. There seems to be something for everyone, which I've enjoyed."
Senior,5,Amazing business program with lots of networking opportunities. Many of my classmates have already landed internships and jobs with great companies through SDSU's online job portal and career fairs.
Alum,5,"A wonderful experience at SDSU. Beautiful campus, amazing city, and great facilities. I had an incredible four years at this school."
Alum,5,"My 4 years at San Diego State University was an unforgettable experience! The campus is unbelievably gorgeous and there is a strong sense of school pride among the students and staff. I felt like I had the perfect balance of rigorous academics and a lively social life. In addition, the school had many different organizations and clubs on campus, which I found to be very helpful for making new friends."
Senior,5,Amazing professors and programs. My major is communication and I’m going for my MA this fall and their program is #8 nation wide and compared to a communication PhD of any other university like Harvard.
Freshman,5,"San Diego State meets all of my needs as a college student. My major program is excellent, help is easily available if I need it, and I have found amazing friends through my extracurricular activities."
Niche User,5,"I really like the school and it has a great environment. I really like this school because the education is incredible and the people are all so nice and friendly and make you feel like your involved. One reason why I choose this school is because of the amazing school spirit and there is also ways something to do and attend like football games, basketball games, and baseball games."
Niche User,5,Everything about this school is perfect the staff and students are all so respectful and very eager to help other who need it.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a second year International Business major at SDSU and I love it! This is not a very big school like a UC but it is a very social school that always has something going on which is awesome! If you are an incoming freshman I recommend to dorm, I unfortunately did not dorm and it really did affect my social life and I am a very social person. Also this school is heavily involved in greek life, so if that is an interest I highly recommend. There are a lot of opportunities for school involvement and clubs which is awesome. Also many non school related resources if in need of them. If you are a social person I highly recommend you attend SDSU! You will love it! Go Aztecs!"
Freshman,5,I really love SDSU. I love it because it provides a safe campus with loving and careing people. And there is a lot to do there
Freshman,4,The academics and professors are really good so far. There is barely any diversity. The campus itself is full of life.
Niche User,4,"Although I am not a student, I have visited several times, as well as taken a tour of the campus and met students. It is a fabulous academic institution and a goal of mine is to attend this upcoming fall. The business program is one of the best in the state and I cannot wait to hopefully experience it as a student."
Sophomore,4,Online classes has been something completely different than I would have ever expected. I feel though that SDSU has adapted to online learning very well and my teachers have adapted very well and are doing just as good a job online than they did in person. It has been a challenge not having in person classes but my teachers are making up for that with their involvement on zoom and with projects.
Sophomore,4,"So far, my online learning experience is good. You can tell professors take their time to develop the right content and information for their students to learn. It is a bit stressful and hard at times but that is part of the college process we all go through. Professors are usually quick to reply emails if you have any questions but sometimes up to 48 hours to reply. They also offer office hours if you need any more explaining which is very helpful. But overall, it's a great experience."
Sophomore,4,The professors are trying very hard to give us a good education and make it worth our while but it is way less personal and hard to connect with teachers and classmates. There is also this constant feeling that you forgot to do something or turn an assignment in. I am. it getting the same quality education but we’re doing the best with what we have right now.
Sophomore,4,Overall I have had nothing but good professors so far here at SDSU. However with going to such a large school its easy to have a very drastically different experience in a class depending on your professor. You and a friend could be taking the same class and he has zero homework and an easy A and youre swamped all the time and barely passing. Professors make or break your class
Alum,4,I took one class online at San Diego State. The professor was very helpful by posting clear assignment requirements.
Senior,4,"They offer many prestigious majors and programs, with various clubs, honor societies, and sports to join. Most of the professors are very educated, professional, and understanding. Parking is a disaster, but that is what is expected of a university in a city with tons of cars and traveling. There are tons of campus life offerings, which in turn helps students meet other students!"
Niche User,4,"SDSU is extremely diverse compared to other schools. It is not just about the campus, but it is also about what surrounds it. SDSU is both fun, academic focused, and athletic based. It has a lot to offer its students."
Sophomore,4,"Would like to see an improvement of on-campus resources, such as student health resources. Whether it is not being able to afford enough staff, or quality staff, the health center lacks the ability to treat students properly and effectively, and many concerns are dismissed by the staff."
Junior,4,"What I enjoy most about SDSU is the variety of programs and departments that exist, allowing students to have abroad selection of majors/minors while also being able to explore other fields throughout their journey. However, there could be some improvements in order to assist new or transfer students who are unfamiliar with the campus and important departments such as counseling, financial aid, or even the computer center. As a transfer student, I found it quite intimidating entering a new school, specially because I was unaware of the contrast between a university and community college. Therefore, I believe providing assistance to unfamiliar students would be highly beneficial to help them succeed and overall feel confortable in their campus."
Junior,4,I am going to start online classes August 24th. But I believe they will still be helpful if not the same as on campus.
Sophomore,4,Very easy. So far I have taken regular online classes as well as classes that became online when covid-19 became an issue. Both have been a walk in the park
Junior,4,"Although I have only taken a few online courses, every professor has done a well job of organizing materials along with always being open to help students. In addition, they give us a reassuring feeling that we can still achieve as much learning in an online environment as we do in a traditional classroom environment."
Junior,4,San Diego State University has a very welcoming atmosphere and allows you enjoy what one may consider to be the college experience.
Alum,4,My online classes at SDSU were still rigorous and required learning the material in the same way in person classes required.
Alum,4,"SDSU was an amazing school. It had many classes to choose from, but it could get hard getting into some. The college itself is a very big campus in the heart of San Diego."
Sophomore,4,"Online schooling was very different from in person classes, but the professors at San Diego State University put a lot of effort into making online class as manageable and efficient as possible."
Graduate Student,4,"I only took one online class at SDSU. I found the professors expectations were realistic. I  felt very supportive and the class moved at a pace that was fast enough for me to stay focused, and slow enough for me to understand the material."
Senior,4,"My experience at San Diego State University is a memory Ill never forget, the campus is beautiful. I joined many organizations like SAAB and even joined greek life so I was very social. San Diego State needs more African American students."
Senior,4,"My experience at San Diego State University is a memory Ill never forget, the campus is beautiful. I joined many organizations like SAAB and even joined greek life so I was very social. San Diego State needs more African American students."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are very passable, just apply your self. You are able to go at your pace, while balancing your other classes and social life."
Sophomore,4,A very SO CAL experience. Welcoming of all ethnic backgrounds. Very enjoyable University near the beach.
Junior,4,"I'm impressed at the adaptability of the professors to transition to online teaching. The teaching was still organized and structured. Nevertheless, it is nowhere near comparable to learning in person. Furthermore, it was difficult to do labs on-line since those activities truly need to be carried out in an in-person setting to be the most effective at teaching."
Niche User,4,"SDSU equipped me with the skills to continue my education as a physician assistant at UC Davis. I received an excellent education at this school, and made life long friends."
Niche User,4,"my overall experience at SDSU was great, however the online learning was interesting. I feel I learn more with in person learning, so the online classes were difficult for me"
Junior,4,It is a great University with so much diversity and opportunity available to the students. Your first two years you are required to live on campus so you meet so many new people.
Junior,4,"Since I was a freshman, I have attended online classes from SDSU. I am currently taking some online right now and I believe that professors have really enhanced their teaching techniques for their students. My professors have posted online video lectures from past semesters and have opened up online zoom conference calls for students to attend if they have any questions. During my freshmen year, professors didn’t necessarily implement that feature and instead answered students questions through emails. I believe that the zoom conference calls have helped students get their questions answered more thoroughly in comparison to just a few short sentences from an email. At SDSU however, the professors do expect students to read the material and understand it before asking questions. In essence, depending on the class and professor, others online experience is going to be different than others. Some professors have been helpful while others have not attending online classes."
Junior,4,"I love how pretty the school is and the atmosphere that comes with it. The surroundings are so pretty and everything is well kept which makes it more enjoyable to stay on campus. The resources on  campus are easily accessible and the campus isn’t too big to maneuver and get to classes on time. Plus,  professors thoroughly enjoy their job and show it through their enthusiasm during lectures and office hours. The only thing I would like to see a change in is the football stadium. Sports is a big aspect in a student’s college experience  and the football stadium at SDSU is pretty ruin down. I believe if it was updated, more students would attend the football games."
Junior,4,"Very chill atmosphere, huge campus, lots of areas to study at or hang out at, lots of things to do and people to meet if you put yourself out there, and you don't feel obligated/pressured to put yourself out there if you don't want to yet. It can be really crowded while walking sometimes and parking is pretty bad. However, you'll get used to it like any other place and figure out the best and worst times to park or areas that tend to get crowded. Professors I've had so far are very passionate about their subjects and caring about students. Relatively diverse, but not really."
Junior,4,"My particular classes transitioned from in-person to online pretty smoothly. However, some of my professors were very hesitant about it and felt unprepared for it. From hearing other classmates' experiences, the school should have prepared professors and other faculty for a time like this, if it ever were to happen (when it may be necessary to transition entirely online - I heard there was another time something like this happened, around 9/11, and the way it was handled was not going to school for a short time but then returning). Other than that, though, my online learning experience made my classes more convenient and more manageable."
Freshman,4,"nice campus, good professors and faculty, advisors are great just the pricing is outrageous! I go to a state school and I pay more than some of my friends that go to UCs..... and seems like no one ever actually wins scholarships through SDSU.."
Freshman,4,"Even though the college is very expensive, NOT ALL THE PROFESSORS ARE GOOD! However, classes CAN BE EXCELLENT if you make them be: during your registration, search how good each professor is in rating websites, look for other people that have already taken that class to hear their feedback, and then, you can have the best professors of this university! 

Right now, I have seen some changes and improvements on platforms that will help the students to develop their skills and learn via online education, such as switching the classroom platform."
Junior,4,Every class is different but overall my professors did their best to make adjustments and really care about their students.
Junior,4,"Overall a good school, very cliquey but you can make friends easily within your program. There’s lots of on campus activities whether you want to participate or not, but it makes the experience much better if you do!"
Sophomore,4,More affordable than most colleges while still providing a good education. Parking can be difficult or far from classes. It has a good student life offering many organizations and clubs but greek life can be exclusive. San Diego is an amazing city. There are a few bad professors who don't care and don't put in any effort at all but most are nice and are happy to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The community at SDSU is absolutely amazing. There are organizations on campus that will give you a community to be apart of while attending San Diego State University.

The engineering program is extremely difficult. The computer engineering program has a massive number of required electives. The classes are strenuous, making them very difficult with a job and extracurriculars and would give students a very difficult time if they did not come into college with credits."
Senior,4,"2-Year Athletic Training Program was excellent and immersive.  Intense, but provided me with opportunities to market with future employers and a solid supportive alumni.  Parking at the school is overpriced and difficult to find.  Classes are also difficult to attain and thus a 4-year degree for many turns into a 5-year or longer degree."
Alum,4,"Great school, has a lot of opportunities for growth. Beautiful campus. Maybe didn't have enough professors during my time. Had to wait a semester to take a certain class."
Junior,4,"SDSU honestly is a very fun university. It is very inviting and a fun place to be around and to experience. I highly recommend that you get involved in something, whether it be a club or job, you will find people with similar interest and career path desires who will help you. Professors can be hit or miss. In my experience, I have had excellent professors, however, like any university, there may be some not so good ones depending on you like to learn. Getting used to university life may feel overwhelming at first, especially if you are not native to the county. However, SDSU honestly has PLENTY of resources for students, so be sure to look into them and get involved!"
Freshman,4,"When I arrived at SDSU, I was skeptic as it had not been my first option for a University. However, upon being here, I have grown to admire the campus' beauty of infrastructures and the community it holds. With such a variety of individuals, you ares sure to see something new everyday. The agglomeration of business and shops really makes the campus feel like a miniature city where everything you might need is around the corner."
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience with SDSU has been pretty good! We have a decent selection of restaurants for on-campus dining, though it does lack in variety."
Niche User,4,San Diego State University is the place to be for college students who enjoy indulging in their studies while being one with nature. San Diego feels naturally relaxing which already helps with the pressure that every student feels. You could enjoy the beach within reach. The food is awesome considering you are in California whereas it is known as the melting pot of cultures. You can literally find from all cultures from around the world. Not only that but the overall feel of the university feels very warm and welcoming so that's definitely a plus.
Sophomore,4,"San Diego State is located roughly 20 minutes from Mission Beach. The environment is lively, the weather is impeccable, and the campus itself is architecturally pleasing. I would like to see SDSU implement more transportation opportunities around campus and to allow residents in the Tecs to use the new dorm."
Junior,4,"Campus is nice, a lot of resources, many opportunities to be involve. Campus is big so they SHOULD allow electric scooters."
Freshman,4,San Diego State has beautiful campus with a variety of majors and extracurriculars. SDSU is loaded with school spirit and has an abundance of resources available to their students.
Niche User,4,"In SDSU, there is a lot of school spirit and I know that the Aztecs hold up well in sports. Along with this, the professors seem to have positive overall ratings by their students."
Sophomore,4,"I have been enrolled in SDSU for two years now, I am currently a sophomore pursuing a major in Criminal Justice and a minor in Photography. My experience has been very good. The professors that I have had are kind and passionate on their subject. The campus is big and beautiful and I am honored that I was accepted."
Freshman,4,"as a freshman it is pretty expensive to go here and everything seems to cost an arm and a leg. Other than that, the teachers are really good overall and the ciriculum is good as well."
Sophomore,4,San Diego State is a home away from home! The student community is strong and there is an amazing sense of pride every where you go. Everyone is proud to be an aztec!
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've had a pretty good experience with SDSU. Most of the professors I've had were awesome and approachable, and most of the subject matter for my major is interesting. Got pretty tired of some of the options on campus though."
Junior,4,"I love being a student at SDSU. The campus is beautiful& when the day is over, you are always promised a purple& pink sunset. It is expensive to stay by campus, I pay $900/ month to share a room. I love that we have a Trader Joes which gives us access to healthy food and snacks. We also have a very diverse selection of food and restaurants on campus. The school is also mom friendly and has a private breastfeeding room and a child care center which is awesome for the students who are mothers. We have an undefeated basketball team and two gyms on campus. If you are a student, you get a huge discount in the gym. Instead of paying 30, you pay 19/month. We also have an aquatic center& access to a pool & jacuzzi! The one downfall to this school is that I don't feel 100% safe here. There are a lot of robberies that take place and bicycles are always getting stolen."
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful and the student body is really diverse. The academics are great and there are tons of resources for students and activities to get involved in. The one thing that gets to me though is the on campus housing. Freshman all pay the same pricey amount but can get the nice renovated rooms or the crappy run down ones. Its really a hit or miss when it comes to on campus  living. Safety wise its just like any other big city, I grew up on the outside of a smaller one so I am personally use to it like the safety risks and you know just using common sense. San Diego is a really beautiful place though."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the San Diego State University tour trip I had went to in September 2019. I liked how there was a wide choice of options to eat in the student cafeteria, but the lines were overwhelmingly long. I had also went to their SDSU gift shop, and I enjoyed the sweaters/shirts in stock, it could've been better if their were more options, and better prices."
Freshman,4,I like about SDSU that there is a variety of places to hangout or do homework; my favorite place is a grassy hill with nice shade.
Junior,4,"This school accepts all kinds of races; there is no discrimination. Everyone is there to help each other. When ever I had a question during my first couple of weeks, I would ask some faculty members and they would point me in the right direction and give me answers to my problems. This school really does not have any apparent or significant flaws. Everyone seems to be enjoying it."
Sophomore,4,I like how it it offers so many different areas of study as well as different courses that people can take. The study abroad options that they offer is really good as well. It's not very diverse.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, professors, and the students! They offer a wide variety of classes and you can even take surf for credit! One downside to SDSU is that you have to live on campus for two years and they charge outrageous rent and lots of fees here and there, when I could be living off campus for much cheaper."
Junior,4,"San Diego State is a great and challenging university. I have grown and learned so much as a student and individual during my time here. However, I think something that needs to be changed are the professors and their mindsets. I have seen so many professors that simply don't care if their students succeed or not. In my experience, multiple professors have said ""over 80% of students will not pass this course"". Instead of designing their course in an already-difficult subject to help students succeed, many professors purposely set up coursework and exams that most students will not pass."
Freshman,4,"San Diego State University is set in a great environment. From the many individuals I've met at the school, I always heard that it was their number one choice for the college they wanted to go to. There are so many groups and resources that students can actively be involved in and look forward to. There's also a huge variety of food one can eat inside and out of the campus, which I enjoy the most."
Freshman,2,I had to take all classes online. Some teachers were prepared and ready but not all of them. Some teachers really struggled and it greatly affected education.
Sophomore,2,SDSU has chosen to use canvas and blackboard instead of just sticking with one system. This makes learning and accessing material confusing and far more complicated than it should be. Also there is not one standard that every class is held too so figuring out how each class is run is also very confusing and again more complicated and difficult than it should be.
Freshman,2,Marginal engagement by Professors and staff. Administration seems more interested in our fees than our education.
Alum,2,"Great...I mean absolutely phenomenal party school and Greek Life scene. Decent sports scene, games/etc.

Not great academics and professors who hardly speak English. The best professors are those who work as a professional and teach part time. I had better professors for my GE classes than major classes. 

If you do go here and want to set your self up for career success, you need to start going to professional organizations early on (freshman year) to network and get an internship. You may need one, two, or 3 crappy internships before you can get one in your desired field.   Make sure you you get an internship in your desired field BEFORE you graduate....ideally summer before Senior Year. This is how the recruiting process typical works for major firms, so make sure don't screw this up.

 A good ROI, but only because the tuition is so cheap. Suck it up and pay a bit more to go to a UC at minimum."
Works Here,2,San Diego state lacks in sandwich quality. This not only effected my experience but this led to many problems in the future.
Freshman,2,"The weather and location seemed absolutely perfect, but there are many negative aspects to this college. The professors interest of student learning was poor, the learning environment was weak, people are much more concerned with the beach and parties. Also, an unfriendly community."
Freshman,2,"Greek life is immensely prominent, to the point where you are looked down upon if you have no interest in it. This obviously isn't for everyone, and as a consequence no one takes academics seriously at all. Good for a four-year party, but as a legitimate higher education opportunity stay away."
Freshman,2,"I made a profile on here just to review this school. TRUST ME when I say that if you're not in Greek Life you're not really apart of the campus. Greek Life dominates the school and you can't get into parties unless you're in a sorority or fraternity. I'm already transferring to another school. The academics are crap, the housing is crap as well, and the party scene is crap. It's not worth all the money you're about to drop. Good luck."
College Sophomore,2,"I got stuck in Chappy, WHY DO I PAY THE SAME $$$"
College Sophomore,2,Its very superficial and it also totally dominates campus life.
College Sophomore,2,Most parties are Greek parties that only allow sorority girls in or girls that look like sorority girls
College Sophomore,2,There are definitely some minorities that will thrive at this school
College Sophomore,2,A lot of students use Adderall to keep up with both the social scene and their work
College Sophomore,2,The party attitude of the school makes sexual assaults a regular occurrence and the proximity to the trolley makes crime rampant
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is VERY big on campus and a lot of students are a part of Greek life. Rush week is intense and overwhelming
College Sophomore,2,Drugs are pretty accessible. Lot of people snorting up coke and smoking weed.
College Sophomore,2,"To get into a social sorority you have to be either Asian or White. They are so stuck up and shallow. During freshman Aztec Nights they would go up to attractive freshmen and recruit them. Also, you won't be able to get into parties if you're black or darker skinned so good luck ladies. The NPHC here is kind of week and they don't give them much appreciation. They just blend with the rest of the councils. If you don't mind being a shallow, snob then this is for you!"
College Freshman,2,I think the Greek life could be a lot better. They are very cliquey and have a certain appearance standard for who gets in and who does not.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't think the security on my campus is very good. I don't feel safe walking alone on campus or around campus at night. They have security guards who can come pick you up, but often students don't want to wait for them or they need to go farther than the guard is willing to take them. There have been many crimes with theft and assault around my school and I walk with pepper spray in my hand if I ever have to walk alone. I think the security and personal safety at SDSU needs to be better."
College Freshman,2,I have heard a lot of cases on sexual assault and I am ashamed to be a part of a campus with so many incidences.
College Freshman,2,I think crime here is bad. It is not the students that are doing most of the crime. It is outsiders who come to campus and the neighborhoods and cause problems.
College Junior,2,I know many people who have take these drugs daily
College Senior,2,"I hated living in the dorms. It is WAY too expensive to live in the dorms. The dorms are also located on the outer rims of the campus which can make it inconvenient to get to class (at least a ten minute walk). The dorms are also very old. However, one dorm (Zura) was completely renovated in a $53 million renovation project making it one of the best dorms on the West Coast. However, the rest of the dorms are old, way too small (with tripled rooms!), and have a variety of issues ranging from bad odors to bug problems. Zura is the best dorm to reside in as of right now. It's a beautiful hall with plenty of amenities and a great social atmosphere. But everything else is terrible."
College Freshman,2,"I live in the worst dorm on campus. The only good thing in Chappy are the people on the floor. Rooms are tiny, it is way too far away from campus and dining, the lounge couches are dirty and disgusting, and the washing room is gross to name a few things."
College Freshman,2,People are bad. They take advantage of who they can
College Freshman,2,"Do not walk alone at night, guys and girls. Do not go to parties alone, make sure you have someone to take you home."
College Freshman,2,"Why must I go through the verification process, it's practically another FAFSA all over again"
College Freshman,2,"I was assigned the residence hall Chapultepec, which is the farthest from campus. I was in a very small room with two other roommates. We had very limited space yet were paying the same amount as people in other dorms with more spacious rooms. We were randomly assigned this dorm and would never have chosen it. It is very dirty and expensive. I ended up moving out due to the fact that I could no longer pay $1400 a month for a cramped room."
College Freshman,2,"Although the apartments are very nice, it costs just as much as dorming on-campus."
College Freshman,2,"It is quite expensive and if you want good food, you must have a car."
College Sophomore,2,"My experience with financial aid was rough.  I was constantly having to go into my financial aid office to ask questions that they said they could not answer over the phone, when indeed they were questions that could have been answered over the phone, rather than waiting an hour in line.  Also, I had to go into the financial aid office to drop off papers but I was told I was either missing a paper, signature, or I had to attach another document rather than clarifying or walking me through exactly what I needed to begin with.  This process turned out to be unnecessary because I had everything correct to begin with, they were just misinterpreting my information wrong."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very small and the common areas are extremely dirty. The bathrooms are cleaned daily; however, are never deep cleaned. They need a deep cleaning desperately and always have gross smells and weird substances around the sinks, in the showers, and around the toilets. The actual rooms are very small and we must fit three people per room. There is not enough room to put all of our belongings. The social atmosphere is very welcoming and its very easy to make and establish friendships."
College Freshman,2,i didnt get any aid
College Freshman,2,"I find it funny that SDSU has a reputation for being a ""party"" school, and yet the campus police/ administration don't know how to let anyone have fun. Also, what the hell are quiet hours?"
College Freshman,2,Yeah I didn't get anything but that's how cal state's go. The schools don't really give individual scholarships unless you play sports.
College Freshman,2,"There needs to be more options on campus. Having to eat the same food over and over again makes me want to never eat on campus again. The prices are not all reasonable and there should not be taxes on food that use a meal plan. Cuic Dining Room can do a lot better than they are now. The food is somewhat okay but is never warm unless they make it right in front of you. Juice It Up is delicious, but is insanely expensive."
College Freshman,2,"I don't consider Student Loans to be ""Financial Aid."" After everything was said and done, the financial office told me I was only eligible for a student loan, even when I qualified for FAFSA and Cal Grant A. Kind of annoying."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid is almost impossible to get and such a hassle.
College Sophomore,2,"The escort service that will take you home sometimes just doesn't show up. At all. So you're stuck waiting and waiting for someone to get you safely home that will never turn up. They also won't help you get anywhere off campus after the trolley has stopped running. We used to get Crime Alert emails every day about an assault, attempted kidnapping, or phone theft, but they seem to have stopped sending those out now."
College Junior,2,"Parking structures fill up very quickly. Hourly parking permit required at all times (if you didn't purchase a semester permit). Enforcement is very strict ... You WILL get a ticket. Off-campus parking is extremely limited, all surrounding street parking requires a city permit between 7am-7pm. You will get a ticket without permit."
College Sophomore,2,"There are two areas for Freshmen-- the main dorm area and then Chappie. The rest of the dorms are grouped together and are close to the Student Union and the rest of campus. 

Chappie is not.

Chappie is a good 15 minute walk from anything useful. Last year (2013-2014) and continuing into now, Freshmen were being thrown in 3 people to what was meant to be a double room... while keeping the same price per student as 2 people to a double. There are rumors that there are plans to do the same and worse, 4 people to a double, in Zura once it's finished being renovated from its nearly unlivable conditions."
College Sophomore,2,We are constantly getting crime alerts about sexual assults walking on and near campus and even in houseing around the school area. I will never walk around alone once it starts to get dark.
College Freshman,2,Our Greek life has gotten bad attention
College Freshman,2,"I didn't get financial aid because my parents ""make too much"" money."
College Freshman,2,"It is not healthy. Fruit is really expensive as well as fast food. The worst part is that food such as fruit comes in little mini bowls. Food in the ""Aztec Market"" don't satisfy your appetite. And everything else is really expensive except for the ""so call chicken,"" but is NOT healthy to eat everyday at the so call chicken or any other fast food restaurant."
College Freshman,2,Bicycles are stolen every day. That s really sad!
College Freshman,2,Take a look to the news about fraternities at sdsu.
College Freshman,2,Fast food restaurants :( I am sick of them
College Freshman,2,You need your parent's income taxes info.
College Freshman,2,We have had numerous sexual assaults that have gone on around campus within the first semester of this school year alone.
College Freshman,2,I don't really have enough fin axial aid to cover a lot of my income and other things which makes it very hard on my family  . They are risking a lot for me so that I can be successful. I will do anything I can to get more financial aid and money so my family and I won't have to struggle so much and I don't have to pay so much if student loans which is why I am applying for scholarships.
College Junior,2,"The only pro's are that they are definitely more affordable than college dorms, however not cheap enough. And by that I mean that most options are COMPLETELY overprices. There is limited availability, and all the options closer to campus go fast. Along with that, the closer you are to campus, the more ridiculously overpriced it gets. There aren't enough affordable apartments either. Most houses don't have air conditioning either, and living in San Diego, that is extremely inconvenient. Then parking, most parking spaces near the campus area force you to get a parking permit. Then you also need a parking permit to park on campus. The parking is just ridiculous, and those cops only do their job to give out parking tickets."
College Junior,2,"The dorms are an awful place to have to live being a freshmen. The staff is usually rude, and it seems that they look out for trouble intentionally. They have no tolerance for excessive noise, which they try to turn around and make it worse than it is. However the social atmosphere is great. You're able to make friends from people in all the dorms, and it's a great place to make friends your first year of school. As annoying as the staff is, it's the best place to live your first year of college."
College Junior,2,"The life in the residence halls is extremely awful and strict. Those working seem to intentionally look out for trouble, anything to get someone in trouble."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any outside financial aid, and it has made the experience extremely hard on myself and parents."
College Freshman,2,Some teachers aren't clear in their lectures and the notes they write down. Sometime need a tutor or someone else who has equal knowledge of professor on content.
College Freshman,2,I don't find myself wanting to go to parties anyways due to the security being somewhat low and sometime difficult to talk to people.
College Freshman,2,The fact that people are so caught up in Greek Life at SDSU creates barriers with those who aren't part of it.
College Junior,2,Almost every weekend I receive a crime alert for a crime and since I first enrolled in SDSU the amount of crime on campus has increased. I do not feel safe on campus.
College Junior,2,"Campus housing is a good experience, however for the price you are paying it is not worth it. Living in an apartment is more economically friendly."
Alum,1,SDSU used to be a great school but it is too impacted now.  Classes are very hard to get and the professors do not seem happy there.
Freshman,1,"This is school sucks, I don't know why I ever chose to go here. One of the biggest mistakes of my life. I thought it would be a good school because it was in California, I thought wrong. It really keeps its reputation as one of the biggest party schools in California.
I transferred to NYU after my freshman year because it sucked."
Freshman,1,"I did not enjoy my time at San Diego State because of the large party atmosphere. I then tried to withdraw from the university and apply to a new one and they lost my withdrawal paperwork and I had to do a retroactive withdrawal after the fact. Most do not get accepted, luckily mine was and now I am finally transferring."
Freshman,1,They need more financial aid for students because their prices are ridiculous and they're trying to ruin my dreams.
Alum,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I transferred after my first semester. If you're not in a frat or sorority good luck having a social life. You will NOT be allowed into any parties unless you are in a top house (they exclude sororities such as AGD and DZ from many parties because they are ""weird""). And good luck getting into a top frat or sorority- the rush process is shallow and, overall, a glorified a popularity contest. Not to mention the classes are ridiculously not academically stimulating and I felt as though I learned absolutely nothing during my time. The offices are all clueless and greedy. I was told to go to at least four different offices for one issue I was having and never got a straight answer from any of them. If this all wasn't bad enough the meal plan and food options suck too. This university is the perfect example of college being more about the money than the education."
Alum,1,"first of all let me start with the fact that they just take money from you and then don't have the right to refund when its a mistake on their end. Second, no one knows the correct answer to anything. I went to four different departments each telling me oh its not here it is at this location until I got fed up and said I cant be going all over campus and someone got me the right information all to find out I was being misled for 4 years about information I needed to graduate. The system is not for the benefit of the student at all and its sad since we pay the school."
College Junior,1,SDSU Imperial Valley Campus is a small campus we don't have half of the activities the main campus currently had.
College Junior,1,I don't think no one cares about sport at SDSU Imperial Valley Campus.
College Sophomore,1,This was not the place for me at all. Great if you’re looking for a good time and a decent education just be prepared for lots of partying and not much else.
College Sophomore,1,"As a black female, I hate this school. I almost wanted to drop out first semester because it was so bad. It's very unwelcoming and there's a lot of closeted racism from the students and Greek life. You won't be accepted in to any soci sororities. The black community is very exclusive as well. I hate it here. Also, theres ALOT of white people. I got huge culture shock coming here. Please find a more diverse school if you're a minority. They try to play it up as if its diverse but its not. They think diverse is having blondes and brunettes."
College Freshman,1,"Most of the people in fraternities and sororities aren't the greatest, and I've encountered rude inidividuals daily."
College Junior,1,I feel very unsafe while walking on campus alone at night. When I have night classes and don't have anyone to walk with I become very uneasy. I think I would feel more comfortable is security or police walked around campus on foot while patrolling. All of the recent robberies and assaults frighten me.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is huge at SDSU, and is a major contributing factor to my negative perception of the school. When fraternities are getting shut down due to drug ties to mafias and people are regularly dying in alcohol-related accidents or from overconsumption, something may be wrong with the system that enables, condones, and even encourages this behavior."
College Junior,1,Our facility has no athletic facilities at all
College Freshman,1,Fights break out and people do stuff they regret...
College Sophomore,1,Let's put it this way: students being able to park and get to their classes is not this school's priority. God help you if you try to drive to campus for a night class while someone's preforming in the Open Air or at Viejas. Or if there's an event. Or if there's a game. Or ever.
College Sophomore,1,They are always rude and impatient!!! it takes forever!
College Freshman,1,"There are only a limited amount of options, two are the same type of food, which are very expensive. No student discounts are offered anywhere"
College Freshman,1,Nobody in authority does anything to control what goes on on campus.
College Sophomore,1,this is one of the reasons why I feel like I shouldn't get me a car yet
College Sophomore,1,there was once a report that several students have been using drugs and several teachers were even drug dealers.
College Sophomore,1,"expensive, barely healthy. I can't even buy anything actually worth eating, i'd rather starve for five more hours and just eat when I get back home."
College Sophomore,1,"they make us take useless classes. one of the CS curriculum is a program language that's been like stone aged and there's 0.0000001% possibility that we'd even use that language in whatever career we choose. if we fail it, we'd never get a degree."
College Sophomore,1,"right when your class ends, you miss the buss and sometimes you have to wait for the next one in 15-45 minutes."
College Sophomore,1,"instead of wasting all our tuition money on athletics and renovating buildings, they should work on the tech and wireless internet some more because it just need tremendous improvement more than buildings and especially athletics."
College Sophomore,1,"almost every instructor will try to find a way to fail you in your subjects. if not, they're just too lazy to teach and don't take grading seriously. it's impossible to be fairly graded. finding the rare just and true teachers is a miracle."
College Sophomore,1,let's say it was the best decision for me not to have housing
College Sophomore,1,it's really not safe in the campus and I need to get out of it as soon as possible before the worse comes.
College Sophomore,1,the brochures were lying. the campus isn't really diverse. it's like 80% white people and the remaining are POCs.
College Sophomore,1,everyone has drugs and are drug dealers. even some teachers and it's really sad
College Sophomore,1,crime everywhere and everyday. too much walking and limited transportation
College Sophomore,1,it just diminished and diminished until I had absolutely no more money to afford college. it feels like this university is stealing my money just for their sports and buildings renovations
College Freshman,1,Theyre so strict. the campus police are just out to get you a parking ticket. I know from experience and tickets
College Sophomore,1,You pay a lot of money for parking permit and not even guaranteed a parking spot to get a good spot you have to come extra early and or extra late and the parking structure with the most space is one of the furthest away from classes.
College Junior,1,"parking is a disaster, I live 7 minutes from the  school but i have to leave an entire hour just to find parking and for the 20 minute walk to class to get there on time"
College Junior,1,"My freshmen year I was an athlete, therefore I was required to live in the dorms.  It was absolutely horrendous, I lived in one of the oldest dorm buildings on campus, it was dirty and buggy.  My dormmates were dirty which made it worse and deep cleaning everyday multiple times was a necessity.  Also it was extremely expensive $1400 a month."
College Junior,1,"Since majors are impacted across the board, everyone ends up as a pre major. It can be difficult to get classes or help in the advising offices. "
College Junior,1,"Parking is HORRIBLE. Trying to find a spot is usually worse than pulling teeth, unless you're there super early or super late. The spaces are small, and you usually have to walk pretty far to your classes. Don't drive unless you have to. "
College Sophomore,1,San Diego is a great city but our school is located near some of the most dangerous areas in San Diego. Robberies happen all the time off campus. Love the school but safety is a constant issue.
College Sophomore,1,"There is little aid and the scholarships are very difficult to get. If you fall outside federal limits, your chance of aid is minimal."
College Sophomore,1,I've gotten zero dollars total in financial aid and I have been enrolled in college since Fall 2009.
Recent Alumnus,1,Expensive and you could never find a spot.
Recent Alumnus,1,Did not see any drug scene.
College Freshman,1,Housing was extremely expensive atleast for me being an out-of-state student.
College Junior,1,I find it very difficult to gain a single scholarship from SDSU because of the vast amount of students that apply for them and very little scholarships to apply for or are available in a certain major that you are work toward a degree for.
College Junior,1,"people pay for parking permits and can still not find parking spots at times. Parking permits are ridiculously overpriced for students who already pay so much for tuition and other school costs. Off campus parking is virtually not available, residential street parking is made restricted for students between 8AM to 7PM to force students to buy parking permits. HORRIBLE!!!"
College Junior,1,It's ridiculous. Like traveling the world trying to find a spot
College Senior,1,"They are pretty strict about underage drinking, and there is a lot of crime in the immediate off campus area."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is a huge cost every semester for the students and it is extremely difficult for you to get a spot unless you know the day/time to look. The traffic in/out is really bad a lot of the time as well.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The business school and hospitality programs have a lot of teachers who don't really care about you learning. They only want to keep the curve to what the school tells them to so they make the tests easier and harder and curve more or less depending on the students...If you had a 4.0 in high school along with everyone else you get screwed but if everyone is an idiot you can coast even if you were a B-C student in high school. They look for ways to mark you down in a lot of classes and then they try and blame you for not working hard enough, they never take responsibility"
College Junior,1,"Parking is very horrible. Once a certain time hits, most parking structures would be filled up making it harder to get to class on time because of how far a person parks. Also, many people are rude and inconsiderate. My car had already been hit while I was parked. Then, parking permits are ridiculously expensive, especially for those who lives at home. They have no leniency on he first week back to school if you have no parking permit."
College Senior,1,the nightlife is bare bones. There is a movie theater called Calexico 10 and some shopping choices but for the real fun you have to head south of the border. Mexicali lies close to the school and it offers clubs bars and dancing any night of the week.
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible. Overcrowded, small spaces, and too many students and not enough spaces. Plus, the overall look of the parking structures look horrific."
College Student,1,"Hands down our campus is safe, the reason there is as much crime (which is still very little) as is claimed is due to the fact we have such a large police presence on our campus. Control incites rebellion. All we need on our campus is a security force, yet we have a federal police office... They do not protect anyone, I actually feel less safe when I see the police officers on our campus because all they do is harass us. Never have I felt any safer when I see police cars rolling by. College is supposed to be a place where people experience new things, and to find who they are, but all the police do is strike down anyone who is not conforming to what ""society"" wants. I came here expecting to have the time of my life, day and night, but at night I always watch my back not out of fear of crime, but out of the knowledge that our police force does not serve the interest of justice, but the interests of the university."
College Junior,1,Very hard to find a place to park during certain times and the permit is expensive
College Junior,1,Housing is expensive and the crime rate is high. I would not feel safe living near campus.
College Junior,1,The coaches make too much money which makes our tuition very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,Not too strict unless it involves underage drinking.
College Junior,1,"Oh its really quite terrible but simply because of the amount of students we have attending. It is much better to take public transit or live on campus. If all else fails, do try to allow yourself some leeway  when arriving to campus."
College Senior,1,There is really no night life I attend an extended campus so we are mostly students with jobs and families.

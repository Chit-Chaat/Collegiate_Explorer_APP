Freshman,5,"Boise Bible College is one of the most academically rigorous schools. Despite its small size, it is well worth the education. The professors are of the upmost quality, as well as the student body as a whole. Boise Bible College is not just a place where you can come and learn more about the Bible, but a place where you can learn to truly love Jesus. By equipping servant leaders to go out worldwide and make disciple making disciples, Boise Bible College is on a mission to spread the gospel globally."
Alum,5,"I was impressed with the academic standards at this school.  Having now attended multiple schools in the Boise area, I am absolutely convinced this institution produces the most academically-qualified graduates in the region.  Rigorous academics, heavy workloads, and strictly enforced deadlines build great character in leadership.   While student performance expectations are very high, the faculty provide generous support for students.  

BBC houses one of the largest theological libraries in the US.  I still swing by from time to time to utilize this resource for my post-graduate studies.  This institution produces Biblical scholars who  become Bible translators, Seminary professors, Christian psychologists and more.  I was looking for a school that would offer me an education in Bible which was more than just skin deep.  This school took me to the center of the Earth."
Sophomore,5,"Boise Bible College provides a great community of Christians as well as a great education to prepare all students for future ministry, whether in the church or outside of it in everyday life. Everything I have been taught as of yet I feel will be useful in some way or another in the future."
Freshman,5,"The community is amazing! The classes are tough, however you will learn the Bible from different perspectives which will help you grow and test your faith."
College Sophomore,5,This was an easy process.  I live on campus and my job works around my school schedule.  The school tries to schedule my courses on the least amount of days so I can work as much as possible.
College Sophomore,5,"Although I have not personally taken any online courses, the online tools the school uses are user friendly and easy to navigate"
College Sophomore,5,"I checked into this prior to transferring to this school and I have not had to use the services yet but I know that when I do, they are available."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are committed to each student.  I feel like they know each of us by name and that although they are friendly with us, they are also hard on us so we learn the material. The classes are small so we each get personalized time with the professors."
College Sophomore,5,I am interested in becoming a missionary and the womens studies courses prepare me for how to passionately and compassionately help women in other parts of the world.  I have not experienced the internship prospects portion of my schooling yet but I know that the school helps prepare us for jobs outside of school
College Sophomore,5,I never would have learned all I am learning from just sunday school classes
College Sophomore,5,Boise Bible College is committed to teaching their students indepth biblical principles and facts so they can go out and inturn teach others about Christ
College Senior,5,They are really good about making it so your class is mostly in the morning and early afternoon. This makes it really easy for students to go to school during the day and then work at night.
College Senior,5,I am so thankful I chose to go to BBC. I could not ask for a better college experience!
College Senior,5,"Some of the kindest, encouraging and down to earth people you will ever meet."
College Senior,5,The professors and administration work very hard to ensure that graduates and current students have a good chance at getting an internship or job!
College Senior,5,Our students are all one of a kind and the school's atmosphere really encourages everyone to just be yourself and be proud of your passions.
College Senior,5,Our financial aid woman is heaven sent. She's always so helpful and so knowledgeable. She's very passionate about helping students get through school as debt free as they can!
College Senior,5,They are very on top of making sure graduates are getting out in their fields and keeping good relationships with employers to make sure their grads have a good reputation.
College Senior,5,My freshman and sophomore year my major underwent a major overhaul to the program. It's a lot more intensive and hands on than it was a few years ago!
College Senior,5,The best resource on campus other than the library is by far the professor's. They are truly the best of the best in their profession and ministry and are very helpful and very knowledgeable.
College Senior,5,"Our teachers often either recommend students for jobs, or they will recommend jobs to students. They often get called looking to fill a position in certain places, and the teacher will often times approach students and offer them jobs."
College Senior,5,"We're like a family, because we're so small, we are just one big family and I don't think that happens at a lot of schools. I'm just blessed that we do have such a great environment. I mean, you pretty much know everyone and are friends with everyone. There isn't a lot of cliquishness, it's fantastic."
College Senior,5,"I know it is cheesy to brag on your school, but we have lots of things available. We have events every month, like broom ball, white water rafting, sock wars, and this is all put on my the student council. We have intramural sports like basketball, volleyball, and soccer, a work out room, and places where you can hang out and watch movies, and a library that has the most books on theology in the North West. It's an awesome place, where people slack line, Frisbee golf, bike, and just have an awesome experience. We also just received an anonymous donation so we get to have a BRAND NEW STUDENT CENTER!"
College Senior,5,"The fact our wireless runs non-stop and has more than 100-200 people on it daily, playing games on X-BOX and watching movies, it has to be the best wireless system on the planet. The network reliability is off the charts, sure it's slow sometimes, but it's usually never out."
College Senior,5,"I am working on two degree programs, and while both of them are very different and there are not a lot of classes that apply to both, the school has been more than flexible by putting me in classes that will suit getting both my Associates and B.S."
College Sophomore,5,This college is one of the best places to go to grow in your relationship with God and change your outlook on the world.
College Sophomore,5,"Our financial aid office makes every effort to save you money, and scholarships are very easy to acquire at the school."
College Sophomore,5,"Our school is possibly the greatest Bible college that is still ministry-oriented, as opposed to others that are more focused on other degrees."
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are very forgiving and tend to have a lot of grace if you have a good reason and are respectful to them, but if you just slept late or are lazy, they do not tolerate that."
College Sophomore,5,The school is super into making sure it's graduates have help finding and acquiring jobs wherever they want.
College Junior,5,The college discounts the amount students have to pay and offers ministry and academic scholarships.
College Junior,5,There are several ministry degrees and the professors and staff members do their best to help us out with anything we need.
College Junior,5,I love my major because of my degree professor. He does such a good job communicating and is very fair.
College Junior,5,I love my school and all the people in it. I also love the professors. It is so nice that they all know our names and connect with us and answer questions in class. We can also meet with them in their offices at any time. Campus life is very fun and very awesome :)
College Junior,5,They work well with you
College Freshman,5,"Many job opportunities, alumni stay connected."
College Freshman,5,Classes come first so scheduling is not a problem.
College Freshman,5,"Amazing classes, with a lot of homework."
College Freshman,5,"Great Christian Teaching Program, structured well."
College Freshman,5,"The tuition is well worth it, and although it is more expensive than a state school, it is a lot cheaper than comparable Christian private colleges, and the education is better focused. Financial aid is abundant, with most students paying less than 75% tuition."
Senior,4,"At Boise Bible College there is an 11 to 1 Professor  to students ratio that allows a student to have teaching and learning tailored to the individual! With that ratio in mind, it naturally follows that students are cared for more at Boise Bible College than most other State colleges and universities."
Freshman,4,"I love the students and the staff here. The staff really encourage you in the way you want to go and they challenge your thinking and going deeper. They love when you have questions and you go up to them. Here at Boise Bible College you know everyone and everyone knows you. It's like a one big happy family. They help you and encourage you, especially during midterms and finales week. If you have a passion for learning and growing your relationship with others and God and also want to do ministry then this is the school for you. You will grow more in yourself than you never thought before."
Sophomore,4,"Boise Bible College is an amazing place to live and attend school. The community is such a vibrant one, full of students from all over the Western United States who come together to learn and serve together. The faculty and staff truly care about their students and want to see them succeed."
Sophomore,4,Boise Bible College has a great campus! The community here is very welcoming and there is always something to do. There are many events happening on campus. There is a lot to learn here and a lot of friends to be made.
Freshman,4,I am a current student at Boise Bible College and i love the school and surrounding community. The academics are great and the people are awsome.
Senior,4,"I have been a part-time, non-traditional student seeking to finish a Bachelors of Science degree in the BBC Bible Program.  Through this program I was able to have my previous college credits transferred from my other college work.  I have found my time at BBC well-worth it in rounding out solid Biblical education.  There are many good emphases, from preaching, to helps professions, to missions, music ministry and education.  All the course-work from each professor complements and builds upon previous courses in a very constructive and productive way.  The professors, while accessible and approachable, also seek to challenge and stretch each student in their abilities and present the most viable options for future opportunities.  As a deacon within my church family, in my current job, and in my personal life, I have found this education extremely helpful and useful.  Boise Bible College also provides an additional educational option for the city of Boise and the Treasure Valley."
Senior,4,"My overall experience at Boise Bible College has been wonderful. The classes are relevant, the professors and staff genuinely care for the students, and the ministry training I have received has been extermely beneficial in the ministry field. While this school may not necessarily be for everyone, if you are interested in being trained, equipped, and challenged for ministry, this is the place for you!"
College Senior,4,Sometimes the amount of busy work can be frustrating as well as the depth of assignments. But they are preparing us for careers where this is normal.
College Senior,4,I put that it's great because often times the academics are so rigorous it scares people away from ministry and doing what they love.
College Sophomore,4,"My degree program is very fun and practical, and my advisors are very friendly and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"The school itself is somewhat old, but is undergoing a huge project at updating many of the buildings, and is about 3/4 done with the project, renovating everything from offices and classrooms to the dorms and student union."
College Junior,4,"For the most part, everyone is friends with everyone."
College Junior,4,The professors and classes are amazing!
College Senior,4,"The tuition is good for a private school. It is fairly easy to get financial aid. The education I am getting is well worth the money I am paying because it is not just education for a future job, but also for a better way to live life."
College Sophomore,4,"Education is totally worth it, there is definitely financial aid available, this is one (if not the) cheapest private college around and is high quality."
College Freshman,4,"The network usually works fine, no major hiccups, and a computer lab with printing is available to all students."
College Junior,4,"They are very flexible, while they do not allow late work, the teachers are always willing to stay over and help with any problem you may be having.  They are very helpful, more so than other teachers."
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of diversity at our school, even though this is a Christian College, you'd be surprised and some of the students that come here.  Some of us are more liberal than others, and some of us are poor.  As far as politics go, there are many Democrats and many Republicans, and some independent.  We are pretty diverse, even though we are in Idaho, we have a couple foreign exchange students, one from Australia and one from Mexico. We also are very diverse in the ethnic sense, my friend and I actually go to the African Church (which my Missionary Life and Skills professor encourages) which is fantastic. It really is like one big family here."
College Junior,4,"Ministry Is Hard – Boise Bible College graduate students, if they are not going to grad school, are usually looking for a job in the ministry. This is a hard process sometimes, but our school is good at making sure you, as the student, are making connections with churches throughout your junior and senior year. By the time you graduate, you already have options waiting for you. The majority of graduates receive job offers before they reach their 2nd semester of senior year."
College Sophomore,4,Why I Would Go Again – The teachers are the most caring people i have ever met. Every friend i talk to about their school it seems that this is a rarity. The professors really do everything possible to help you out.

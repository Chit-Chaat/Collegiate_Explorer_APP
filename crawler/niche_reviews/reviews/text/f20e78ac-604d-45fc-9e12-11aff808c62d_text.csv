Alum,5,"I took at least one online course each year during my time at Plymouth. Initially, I had never taken an online course before but had the option to do so my freshman year for a genal education course that I was interested in. I enjoyed m online experience so much that I had decided to repeatedly include them into my course curriculum. Benefits to online courses is pushing you outside your comfort zone and assisting you in figuring out what works best for you in the classroom -physically or virtually. Professors are just as easy to connect to as if classes were in person and the workload is bearable as well as allows you to adjust your schedule to whatever you may prefer"
Freshman,5,"Attending college here in the fall, they have been nothing but helpful with assisting me with all the steps to get me prepared as an incoming Panther!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Plymouth State University. I was searching for a campus that was its own community within another local community and you can definitely find that at Plymouth. There is plenty to do on campus and close-by off campus as well as plenty of friendly faces to bring with you!"
Alum,5,Absolutely loved PSU!! Helpful professors and staff. Smaller class sizes and lots of activities on and off campus. Perfect location in the White Mountains if you love to ski/snowboard or hike! Could not have asked for a better place to spend four years at!
Niche User,5,"From the moment I walked onto the campus, I felt like I was at home. I felt safe, comfortable; welcome. Everyone was helpful, offering help to anyone they saw who seemed to need it. It seemed perfect; it felt like home."
Sophomore,5,"fantastic school with a large variety of food in the dining hall to choose from, sports are phenomenal as well as the exercise facilities and the community as a whole is very welcoming and inclusive. overall it’s not too big and not to small and has numerous opportunities for a variety of interests that all sorts of people can enjoy. the town surrounding is a little bland but the main street and the surrounding nature areas are great for hiking and all sorts of outdoors activities"
Freshman,5,"It has a very good faculty,  the environment is extraordinary and there's so much to do...go skiing, watch a football game, or a track and field race..."
Senior,5,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Plymouth State University. I was searching for a campus that was its own community within another local community and you can definitely find that at Plymouth. There is plenty to do on campus and close-by off campus as well as plenty of friendly faces to bring with you!"
Freshman,5,"I love Plymouth State because of the community, the easy access to food on campus and off campus, and the professors and other staff communicate and interact with students to make them feel welcomed and whole."
Freshman,5,It was beautiful and everyone was so nice. The teachers made everything a lot less scary. The guides made finding classes and dorms so easy.
Freshman,5,The university is the perfect size.  All the staff are very nice and helpful as you learn to adjust to life on campus.
Freshman,5,plymouth state is great! the professors care about you and the staff is wonderful in all the departments. the school has the best music education program in New England.
Junior,5,Plymouth is absolutely amazing! Located in a charming small town with regular bus trips to Walmart and Boston what more could you ask for?! The classes are fabulous and the uni really cares for its students. We even get smores and hot choc on snow days!!!
Senior,5,"Loved all my fours years here, it was the best experience of my life! I traveled all the way from Alaska to go to school here and it has opened so many new doors for me. I've met so many new and wonderful people that I will cherish for forever, this college is truly a special one!"
Alum,5,My time at Plymouth State definitely prepared me for life post-graduation. I left with a great support system of connected alums and professors.
Niche User,5,"Plymouth is great , word can’t even explain the scenes I’ve captured . I was amazed with how everything is set ip"
Sophomore,5,"Plymouth State college is an awesome place to attend. The setting of the college is in a great location with many things to do outside of the college scene. It is close to everything that a person would require. The college itself is very nice, clean and a safe place to attend. It is a smaller college, which is something that was important. The professors are great and very approachable for questions, before, during, and after classes. The athletics program is great, there is always some activity you can join to do. You can pretty much find a major that would interest a person. I would highly recommend this college for anyone that is looking to go."
Sophomore,5,I love this school because it is an amazing place to study Performing Arts and any other kind of art as well. Not to mention the campus is a nice size and the students are very diverse. I have never met anyone who isn't interesting here.
Freshman,5,So far my Plymouth State experience has been amazing! The campus is very nice and there are many places to eat besides the cafeteria. The accessibility services are fantastic and a lot of the teachers are good too!
Freshman,5,"Having only been here a few days I don’t have too much to say; however, thus far my experience here has been incredible, surreal, and has made me more excited for my future."
Sophomore,5,I've loved this college since I've set my eyes on it my freshmen year of high school. I would never go anywhere else!
Sophomore,5,"I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, and I have been enjoying my time at Plymouth state university. I have had wonderful professors that have helped me every step of the way. I have met life long friends that I will keep in touch with, and the staff are super nice and helpful. Plymouth state university has everything that I will need to become a successful person in life."
Freshman,5,"I love Plymouth State University. It gives students the eligibility to create themselves and learn more through fun and interesting ways. With their amazing cluster program system, the student can learn from other degree programs through their own. The vast acceptance of students and others on the campus are amazing. Plymouth state makes everyone feel comfortable to be themselves, and no one judges others for it. 
One thing that I would love Plymouth State to change is their acceptance for students exceeding in certain classes. As a student who is young and completed all the intro classes, I must wait until my Sophmore year to take an upper-level course. I think that Plymouth State should allow students to take the course they desire, no matter their seniority level."
Junior,5,"Plymouth State University is a place where everyone has a place. Everyone is given every opportunity to share their thoughts, ideas, and most importantly share their voice! If I hadn't chosen to come here I would have never discovered my passion for social justice issues. Without Plymouth, I wouldn't have ever thought about standing up for so many issues that need to be talked about. Thanks to Plymouth I'll always have a school that backs me on my choice to step out and speaks up."
Junior,5,Plymouth State University has been such an amazing college. I love the program that I am in and I feel welcomed. Class sizes are small so it's much easier for one-on-one work with professors and you really get to know everyone. I highly recommend this university to high school graduates.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Plymouth because since the classes are so small, you get more one on one with each professor and the community supports all of your efforts."
Junior,5,Plymouth is a place where everyone on campus is in love with it. I have never seen the same type of love with any other university. I am personally so happy that I get to spend 4 years at this university. I love Plymouth because I think it's size is perfect. The classroom sizes are small so the professors can make a personal connection with all of their students. I have made some great connections and my professors only want me to succeed. I have made my best friends at Plymouth. If you ask anyone about Plymouth you'll hear great things.
Sophomore,5,Plymouth State is such a community oriented college. You immediately feel right at home and that this place was meant for you. Class sizes are small and intimate and you can get such a great one-on-one connection with them. There are hundreds of campus activities you can partake in and even more clubs you can join in to further your experience here. PSU allows you to make amazing connections with people and created friendships that last a life time.
Niche User,5,"I think the University is growing well.  The students are great and the campus isn't overwhelming.  It is simple, interesting, and fun."
Sophomore,5,Plymouth state is a beautiful campus that has so many different learning opportunities and different majors to explore. the teachers really care about your education and want you to succeed. its a very inviting place and you feel right at home.
Junior,5,"Plymouth State University is the definition of a D3 school with a D1 heart. We study hard and party better than any other school in the horrible state that is New Hampshire.

We aren't UNH (full of preppy frat kids with Daddys credit card) or Keene (white trash of NH) we are Plymouth State University. The best school in the State. Great community, great environment and great education."
Alum,5,"It is a small enough school that you get great one-on-one time with professors and that you have more opportunities for internships, research grants, and fellowships, but it is large enough that there is always someone knew to meet! Everyone is super down to earth and it is nice being so close to the White Mountains."
Freshman,5,"Plymouth State University is a small school with engaging and interactive classes that allow the students to think critically and have fun at the same time. When not in class, students can have fun exploring the mountains, ski and snowboard, kayak or float the Pemi River, or go to many different sporting events."
Sophomore,5,"Plymouth State is the most welcoming and excepting university I have ever been to. There's such a diverse student population, there is literally a place for everyone! Not only is it just a beautiful and fun school, the professors are so amazing. They've all been accomplished professionals in their fields and really want their students to do well and accomplish their goals."
Sophomore,5,"Overall Plymouth State University is one of the best schools to go to. There's parties Almost everyday of the week. The education is top-notch and the teachers really want to see the students learn and do well. Lastly, the food aint too bad, the dorms are being improved every year and the off campus housing is dirt cheap. 

The sports teams are some of the best in the D3. Also the view of the mountains is just beautiful. "
Senior,5,Everything on the website is clear and easy to use. I like being able to see what I am applying for and it is easy to understand all of the requirements. 
College Junior,5,I absolutely LOVE Plymouth State! I believe it is the perfect fit for me! I love the sense of community I feel every day when I walk out my door onto the beautiful campus! Plymouth is such an outdoor school that it turned me onto hiking and just enjoying nature! I also love how much of a personal relationship I have built with each one of my professors! The professors being super personable during my audition into the music department is part of the reason I decided to come to Plymouth! One last great aspect is the fact that I have the ability to take Adventure Ed classes that I will be able to combine with my Music Ed classes to create the best career path for my interests!
College Freshman,5,"I like living on campus it helped me make many friends, however the dorm room are a little small and can get messy"
College Freshman,5,students throught the campus come and support many different sporting events
College Freshman,5,Everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming into the community
College Freshman,5,I LOVE THIS SCHOOL. It's seriously so fantastic and I am so glad I go here.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love PSU. I thought I would hate it...but I don't. It's warm and small and not intimidating. I love it here, and I am so glad I ended up at Plymouth State!"
College Freshman,5,"Being in northern New Hampshire, the campus isn't all that diverse just based on location, but we definitely do have some international students which people are super chill and accepting of"
College Freshman,5,"I think the majority of people here drink in some way, whether it's in the dorms hanging out with friends or going out to parties. Drugs here aren't really a huge issue, people do some obviously, it's college, but the majority of people don't do anything hard, mostly just weed and if people are trying to do anything harder it'd probably be psychedelics or maybe coke, I haven't hear anything about heroin or meth or anything being very present here at all."
College Freshman,5,"Plymouth is a really chill little school and the people here are friendly and nice. I love going to Plym and the only thing that I would change would be the dining hall, but you can easily live in an apartment with a kitchen sophomore year so that becomes a non-issue."
College Freshman,5,Advisors help you to look for possible jobs and internships.
College Freshman,5,"Safety isn't really much of an issue at Plymouth since it is such a small town, but if you feel unsafe walking at night there is a program called ""safewalk"", where 2 students will come and walk you to wherever you are going so that you don't have to walk alone."
College Freshman,5,"Dorms here are similar to most other colleges building and cleanliness wise, but the on campus communities are great, people are really friendly and you are missing out if you commute and don't get to stay on campus because you meet a lot of really chill people that way that can become some of the people you hangout with the most."
College Freshman,5,Plym students are pretty accepting and cool
College Freshman,5,"Parties are literall everywhere at night, everyone wants to party."
College Freshman,5,"Amazing party scene, tons of parties 7 days a week every night is a party."
College Freshman,5,"Very good curriculum and professors are very dedicated. I learned a lot in y years here, workload is a lot depending on major."
College Freshman,5,"Very safe school, no issues. Constant polive troopers driving around at night, but a ton of stupid college kids. Overall safe school."
College Freshman,5,Love the school. Parties are amazing
College Junior,5,Wouldn't want to go anywhere else
College Junior,5,I'm glad I play a varsity sport at Plymouth State. My experience wouldn't have been the same
College Junior,5,I enjoy the school I go to very much. I wouldn't want to go to any other school.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are willing to help and because classes are small they get to know you. You aren't just a number, you're a student and they care about your success. There are a lot of acedemic classes to choose from and if you don't know your major, the liberal arts program is awesome"
College Freshman,5,"Not only am I getting a great education, but I've been introduced to a wide range of opportunities. I have met some of my best friends here. You have the opportunity to take advantage of the great outdoors of New Hampshire by skiing, hiking, kayaking and more. There are an abundance of clubs and organizations you can join to get involved. Sporting events are fun to go to and there's always something to do. Classes are small and you get to know your professors. It's the best decision I've ever made."
College Freshman,5,I feel that PSU is a very safe campus. Safe walk is always out on the weekends to help students if they need it and there is always cops out and close if in need to help.
Alum,4,"The university was welcoming in so many ways and had made the transition from highschool into college quite easy. They have so many opportunities to not only help you get involved whether that may be through your major, joining clubs, or participating in volunteer work on and off-campus. The university isn't the most diverse racially, but they do try and supply resources to accommodate every student's individual needs -culturally, spiritually, financially, and academically. In addition, the faculty on campus strive to meet all student's needs; they are not only mentors but friendly faces on campus ho make you feel seen/heard inside and outside the classrooms."
Sophomore,4,"Plymouth State is a great place to get away if you're from the city or urban areas. It has a lot of diversity when it comes to places to discover and see, with great  mountains to hike with beautiful views, to rivers, lakes, etc. What I'm drawn to the most are the sports, Plymouth state has great people representing them on and off the fields. The business program is well known here and many people go off starting really good jobs and a career paths graduating from here."
Sophomore,4,"Before the unprecedented virus happened I was already taking online classes. These classes are very self explanatory, the work and due dates always vary but you  will always be updated when there are any changes. Professors are easy to reach out to and respond quickly. Online classes are perfect if you want to add more credits and raise your GPA."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus located in the white mountains. Plymouth State was not my first choice but after completing freshman year there I couldn't imagine being a part of any other school community! The staff and professors are super supportive and it being a smaller school students are able to form much more personal relationships with professors to make for a more reliable, unstressful education environment."
Junior,4,That's funny to read about a transgender student having problems. All my friends who are transgender have nothing but good things to say about Plymouth State University . Everyone minds there own including myself as for the partying that's at any University. You set your lifestyle at your pace in college nobody elses. So that being said for myself and my friends we all enjoy Plymouth State! Go Panthers!
Freshman,4,"I decided to attend Plymouth State University because the school is close to home, and I have always loved living in New England. I was accepted in the nursing program, here at PSU, and I could not be happier with the program. Professors are very considerate of student needs, patient, and helpful. The students are very friendly, considering that there are only about 4,000 undergraduate students, the community is very close knit."
Sophomore,4,This school is too small. You will see every person you are avoiding. But overall its a good school with very friendly people who want you to succeed.
Senior,4,"Plymouth State University has been full of opportunities for everyone who has the opportunity to go there. The beautiful campus and the committed staff and professors make Plymouth feel like home, even if you're hundred of miles away. The community in the area is welcoming, and I wouldn't have gone anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"Plymouth State University is pretty great. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, and has a sort of “small town” feel. Every professor I’ve had so far are extremely dedicated to their students. Overall, they’re friendly and are more than willing to help with anything."
Freshman,4,I love PSU so much. It is a great  school!  I will be attending there this fall and I am super excited to call that beautiful campus my home for the next for years.  I wouldn't want to go anywhere else to college.  I like that the classes are small.  It gives students an opportunity to connect with their teachers and get one-on-one help with schoolwork!  I really recommend Plymouth State University to anyone!
Freshman,4,I was nervous to start college but Plymouth has been a great choice. The location and size are great. I'm on the swim team and I am easily able to schedule class around practice and lifts.
Freshman,4,"Plymouth is a beautiful area to spend your college years in and overall it has been a great experience for me. I transferred here and I am very happy with my decision because the people here are also great. Everyone's nice and the professors also do their job really well. The classes are a good size because they're not too small, but small enough that the professors knows who you are and will make sure you're successful."
Freshman,4,"Plymouth State is such a beautiful campus. I am so glad I chose to come here to further my education. I was scared of classes starting once I got here, but after the first month of school. I'm great than ever. Very diverse and need to include and come up with more ways to have events."
Sophomore,4,I like the medium size ofthe university.  The professors actually know your name!  It is nestled in a small town and it feels very safe and quaint.  The nursing program is developing and has a lot of support.  There is a diversified student body and and very accepting culture.
Sophomore,4,this school is pretty cliquey.  Res life is laid back and allows students to have freedom. D-hall isnt that bad just make sure you go during prime hours.
Freshman,4,Going to Plymouth was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. The campus is beautiful and there are so many cool outdoor activities minutes from campus. The people are rad and the professors truly care about your education and will help you any way they can. I would recommend learning how to ski/snowboard cause cabin fever is real in the winter. The only downside is the dining hall food but other than that Plymouth is dope.
Sophomore,4,"PSU is a great school, but as a transfer student, I found it very difficult to adapt. After being accepted, I was not assigned an advisor until midway into the semester, even after asking for one. The professors and the course work is wonderful, and other than that, I have had a very positive experience."
Freshman,4,"I’m currently a freshman and so far so good, the campus is beautiful with Mountain Views  and everyone’s really friendly, having only been here a month I feel like I know a lot of people in my class and always see a friendly face. Party scene is super good but only if you have the right ratio"
Freshman,4,"When I first came to Plymouth, it was because it was the cheapest option for a traditional four-year college with my intended major. I had no clue that the campus was sought after by out of state students because of their academic programs.  Education, music, and nursing degrees are the programs that are known to be well-rounded and meaningful courses, and I completely agree."
Sophomore,4,"Plymouth has become my home. The community is so welcoming and the location is perfect if you love hiking or snowboarding. The people are great and the parties are fun. The academics are okay, Plymouth is primarily made of Criminal Justice major and Business majors. So those students academics are excellent. But other majors like nursing or computer science are lacking a little. The professors are great, they learn every student's name so it become more personalized. Classes are typically around 20 students unless you are in the lower end science lecture classes which can get up to a 40 (sometimes 100). There are some hotel-like dorms on campus that are great and they also have on campus apartments that are nice. But the freshman dorms are just the average dorms you typically see."
Freshman,4,"Plymouth State was such a good experience! The professors, and other staff were so helpful it was unbelievable!"
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Plymouth State. During the course of my 4 years there,  PSU appointed a new president who has helped create some new initiatives on campus, including the development of clusters and changes in campus/student life. Many of these changes have helped us move towards a more collaborative climate among students and faculty of various academic backgrounds. I am really grateful to have been a part of these changes, and I look forward to seeing what other awesome stuff is to come for PSU!"
Sophomore,4,Plymouth State has been a great start to college. The campus is a perfect size for someone who isn't sure it they will enjoy college. The classes are easy to find and everyone here is so nice and welcoming! The academic life is pretty intense depending on your area of study but very easy to handle  for time management. Sports here are great as well and very accommodating to your academic life.
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere here! everyone's really nice to each other. Staff and professors are kind and helpful
Sophomore,4,So far I have loved attending Plymouth State University. All of my professors have been great so far. There are so many people here passionate about teaching. I also love the social aspect of PSU. There are so many great places to ski and hike and it is just a great place to enjoy the outdoors. The only thing I would like to see changed is the food. The dining hall is not very good and I wish we had more options.
Graduate Student,4,"Plymouth State University is a beautiful campus located in the heart of New Hampshire at the gateway to the White Mountains and Lakes Region.  Graduate programs are offered in a variety of concentrations and levels including Masters, Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS), and Doctorate (EdD and DPT), as well as formats including face-to-face, blended/hybrid, weekend intensive, and fully online.  I am currently enrolled in the Masters of Arts in Personal and Organizational Wellness with a concentration in Personal Approaches to Transformation and Healing.  The courses in my particular program are offered in a weekend intensive retreat style format which I love.  I work full time and am a mother to two school-aged children.  The course format enables me to fit pre-work and post-work into my busy schedule and also enjoy the rich interactions during the 3-day weekend course meetings."
Freshman,4,"Plymouth State University is a great college in an amazing area in New Hampshire. The atmosphere is very outdoor friendly with all students loving the winter time. Everyone who goes to this college is very nice and welcoming, with a great downtown area walking distance from campus. There is plenty to do inside of Plymouth, New Hampshire or even right outside in other towns. If you are an outdoors person this is the college for you."
Sophomore,4,The smaller community and strong academics make a great blend for a useful and fulfilling experience. I am being pushed in the right direction towards
Junior,4,"The programs and professors are really great.  I love what I learn, and I appreciate how helpful all of my professors have been.  My only criticisms is that the campus food is poor and overpriced...Nothing for people with food allergies."
Freshman,4,Great college. Staff is very friendly and teach their subjects so that everyone can fully understand that they are being taught. Building are well kept on campus. Maintenance is up to par. One down side I have found though is that there are a lot of parties. More so than other schools.
Senior,4,"As a non-traditional Information Technology major, I've found PSU to present the most challenging enviroment I had yet to face. Expect math-heavy courses and unforgiving professors who expect an extensive amount of self study"
Freshman,4,"Amazing environment. The campus is a bit smaller than most but that makes it so much easy to know your way around. The students and teachers make you feel very welcome in the classroom, and the ratio is good."
Alum,4,"When I attended Plymouth State University, my experience was positive. There is a lot to do for being a medium sized school, with diverse clubs and activities. For me the class sizes were a little too big as I came from a small high school. Overall the experience was a good one though."
Niche User,4,"I'm an accepted student, I'm a graphic design major with a minor in photography. It is said to be the 2nd safest school in New Hampshire. The food is pretty good and the professors definitely know what they are talking about. There are parties if you are looking for them and there are tons of different sports that you can play and be a part of."
Sophomore,4,"As  a sophomore in the Plymouth State University Early Childhood Studies Teacher Certification program, I honestly could not have expected the love I would have for the school and the program. I have never sat in a class where a professor didn't know my name, face, and at least one personal fact about me. Whether it's needing to go into the dining hall late because Dance Team practice ran over time, or I need help from our amazing writing center, the faculty and resources that Plymouth has to offer are not comparable. Many are drawn in by the reputation of our weekend life, they stay because PSU is more than a University, it is a home."
Sophomore,4,"This is my first semester at this University and so far it has gone great, my professors seem very friendly, and easily accessible. It is a tight community and it seems like getting to know people will be pretty easy. I am a transfer student from a local community college in my hometown of Concord, New Hampshire. All of my credits transferred over with no issue which was nice. I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and plan to enter the work field head on. This scholarship would help out a tremendous amount. Thank you."
Freshman,4,"One of the things that I love about Plymouth State is the small town feel of being in the white mountains complemented by the quality education that you receive at Plymouth State. The smaller class sizes allows for more 1 on 1 time with professors and advisers, granting the greatest chances for success. Overall it's a high quality University."
Freshman,4,"As a first semester Freshman I have found Plymouth State to be a great place to go to school. The school really goes out of its way to make sure you are successful, especially in your first semester, you have access to multiple kinds of counselors, and they are very willing to meet according to your schedule. The dining hall isn't great, but its tolerable. The people here are all great, and making friends will be the easiest thing you do here! so far Plymouth State University has been great"
College Freshman,4,It seems great even though I only went to orentation.
College Sophomore,4,Good teachers and classes that force you to think.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"I literally hate athletics and don't know a heck of a lot about them, even at school. Seems like they are everywhere."
College Freshman,4,Parties are pretty lit in Plym
College Freshman,4,"Thursday-Saturday and special events like spring fling and the pirate party are pretty lit and it is not generally all that tough to get into parties, people are pretty nice about meeting new people and letting them in."
College Freshman,4,Tons od cool little places to study on campus with gorgeous views. Teachers and advisors are helpful and nice but the course registration process is terrible and it's sometimes hard to get the classes you need if they are popular and you get a later date to pick classes.
College Freshman,4,"Varsity sports aren't all that important here, intramurals are bigger so that a bigger group of students can be included instead of a select few. Hockey is probably the most populat sport to watch in Plymouth since we just got a new ice arena and everyone really gets hyped about games."
College Freshman,4,great variety again and also very top quality
College Freshman,4,great location and very good variety to choose from
College Student,4,"The value of a degree from Plymouth definitely went up I think. It use to be seen as a huge party school, but anyone who goes here knows its really not like that anymore. I think Plymouth graduates will be taken more seriously and professionally now."
College Student,4,"Plymouth is a great school, and the only reason I want to transfer to SNHU is to be closer to home. Other than that Plymouth has a really good atmosphere, teachers have been mostly helpful, they're very easy to reach and always reply very quickly! They always are prepared for classes too, as well as using as many resources as they can!"
College Student,4,The only downfall is that my building (pemi) is very out of the way from my classes and the dining hall as well as other residential buildings.
College Student,4,"I enjoy Plymouth State University, however I am transferring to SNHU next term."
College Freshman,4,"Great amount of diversity, lots of different types of people."
College Freshman,4,"The hockey games are a huge part of the school. Lots of skaters and tons of snowboarders. If you love the mountains and hockey this is the school for you. Also the track team is really good, rugby team is amazing. Basketball team only lost like 5 games. All playoff teams."
College Freshman,4,Small town not much crime occurs
College Freshman,4,"Overall a good school. Small enough we're the professors actually know your name and you always see a familiar face walking to class. On the weekends students tend to attend hockey games, go hiking, and of course party."
College Sophomore,4,Always enjoy the games clean places.
College Sophomore,4,"I like it because it is convenient for me to commute and everyone is helpful, and"
College Freshman,4,"Our hockey team receives a lot of love and support all throughout the year. Many of the students attend every home game, and many travel with the team to their away games. Even though our football team isn't necessarily the best, a lot of students still attend to support. Our intramural teams are always fun and a pleasure to watch everyone play a sport that they find fun."
College Freshman,4,"Plymouth State is an amazing school, the professors really care about their students education and will help them whenever needed. Everyone on campus is very caring and extremely friendly. The campus is always taken care of nicely and it always feels like home."
Freshman,2,"There are both positive and negative aspects about plymouth. It's a really big party scene and also as active student life activities .Really helpful if you have a car, provides transportation for weekend activities. Downtown plymouth is within walking distance with restaurants and small shops. The dining hall isn't the best but there's good food choices in the HUB. Very pretty scenery of the mountains, especially in the fall."
Sophomore,2,"Kid you not, most of these officials and professors are so rude it is unbelievable. Especially since everything is all over the place due to the virus, no one is helpful. They expect you to do all of these things when you are by yourself. For class registration they made a mistake and made it very hard to sign up for classes. Then when you email a professor explaining the situation they basically tell you that they won't help. When in fact they can very much help. Just prepare yourself to do everything by yourself."
Freshman,2,"Do NOT go here if you identify anywhere within the LGBT community! I am constantly facing harassment and transphobia, even from administration. They keep trying to push minorities out of the way as much as they can by taking away our meeting spaces. The party life is extremely distracting and will affect you if you aren't even involved with it. And the dining hall constantly puts out food that gives students food poisoning and ignores allergy regulations. They throw in random gen-ed's disguised as a ""cluster program"" to milk you of as much money as possible. There is a reason most people transfer after their freshman year. Save yourself the money. If you want some upsides though, the professors are usually pretty good, especially the theatre department."
Niche User,2,Some of the buildings are newer than others but there isn't anything that stood out for me personally. However they offer a great teaching program!
Alum,2,"Great location, just not the right place for me.  Not a lot of welcoming activities. Great rugby and volleyball team. Lots of places to go outdoors and hike and downtown is cute.  Felt like to classes were not challenging or engaging enough."
Freshman,2,"I am a freshman at Plymouth state university currently. I go here undeclared looking to find my major. From going here I found it harder to figure out what I want my major to be. The courses that I am enrolled do not give me any interest or are helpful for me in finding what I want to pursue in the future. The social experience is much like high school, sense it is a smaller school, and it is somewhat cliquy.. The dining hall does not offer healthy things to eat for all meals."
Senior,2,"Do not go to this school if you value your education. Classes here are an absolute joke. Open note, open book, even open computer ""exams"" are the norm here. Although most of the professors obviously know their material, many of them have absolutely no idea how to teach. One of my professors constantly gives us assignments that she herself even admits that she can't do, and even goes as far as to tell us that we should find help elsewhere because she can't help us with an assignment that she created. The financial aid office is usually rude and constantly losing important documents. I can honestly say that I got a more valuable education at community college (NHTI) and even at high school than I have at PSU.  I could go on but basically the education here is horrible. Don't go here. I wish I hadn't."
College Sophomore,2,"No diversity, being the only asian in my 4 classes this semester"
College Sophomore,2,The greek life is awful
College Freshman,2,"Most of our Greek life isn't sanctioned and gets their members into trouble. There are two school sanctioned sororities on campus, and they are okay, but other than that, Greek Life here is dangerous."
College Freshman,2,There is not enough security regulating parties. Many underage people are getting access.
College Freshman,2,The teachers do not care about individual students and do not offer much help. Their office hours are very limited. They never answer emails!
College Freshman,2,The teachers and students are not very kind. Many students don't accept people for their differences. The school is also extremely behind on title 9 and helping students effectively with learning disabilities.
College Freshman,2,"They exist, but I never really see them out in the community. Some of the fraternities throw down on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not that popular on this campus.
College Freshman,2,No official fraternities on campus.
College Freshman,2,There is only one greek life group on campus. I wish there were more but students do not hear much about greek life.
College Freshman,2,There are very few recognized sororities and no recognized fraternities
College Junior,2,Frats and sororities aren't very abundant on campus and are honestly looked down upon. They throw decent parties but the majority of the parties come from other students living off campus.
College Junior,2,"If you try smoking pot or drinking in a dorm, you will very likely be caught. Professors are also anal about attendance."
College Junior,2,"I chose to live in an apartment, mainly so I wouldn't have to have a meal plan. There are very few vegetarian options."
College Junior,2,"The dorms on this campus are mostly awful. The buildings are ugly, the rooms are ugly and have poor lighting. Mary Lyon is very nice but a standalone. There is not much community at all, nor any effort to foster any."
College Freshman,2,"I can go into the dining hall with a completely empty stomach, and by the time I have had a few mouthfuls of what I had expected to be decent food, I'll return my dish to go try to scope out some other, seemingly edible food to eat. I always get a cup of water to drink before I go to get food, because I know I will not end up eating very much, and it helps to make my stomach feel more full. Sometimes the pizza is okay, other times it tastes like cardboard with mystery plastic on top. The burgers are usually a good bet, but sometimes they are so salty they are barely palatable. Salad seems like a good bet, but usually what isn't wilted is warm, and the dressings taste awful. The only option they ever have in the vegetarian/gluten free line is nachos with tofu/bean chili. EVERY. NIGHT. Avoid the main entree, unless it looks okay, and even then, be cautious. Usually the ""made to order"" line is okay, but I had a bad experience with the steak bombs - so much gristle. The sandwich line is okay, but the meats are always very salty - which isn't really Sodexo's fault themselves, I suppose, but it still isn't appealing. The Union Grille and the Cafes are alright, nothing except coffee is made at the cafes and the Union Grille is ridiculously marked-up in price, so you run out of flex cash really quick if you're trying to avoid the dining hall. One meal at the Grille is usually about $10 at least, on average for myself."
College Freshman,2,"I select bad, because the buildings are not in the best repair. Most of them are older buildings; for example, the dormitory I live in was built in the 1950s, and has been renovated, so I've heard, but in appearance, is still in disrepair. The heat in the individual rooms is ridiculously high, but the hallways and lobbies are freezing. The wifi is awful and only works for five minutes at a time (if you're lucky) before you'll have to troubleshoot and reconnect in some buildings, and the furniture (with the exception of the sofas and stuffed chairs) are in bad shape (in most residence halls). I have no issue with any of the CAs or the RD, they are wonderfully friendly, but the building itself is in awful shape. I also appreciate the people who clean the building, but since they have so much to clean in so little time, I honestly didn't know that they even touched the showers until two weeks into second semester. The showers on my floor have rusted pipes in them, with the paint peeling off, with black mold growing in the grout between the tiles, which is also growing on a pipe above the entrance to both showers. The bathroom itself also has clearly not been revamped since the 70s or 80s, as everything is teal and tan, with darker teal swirls. I have not been very impressed with anything about living on campus. The students on campus are rude and boisterous, constantly screaming outside the dorms from Thursday to Saturday night. Don't even get me started on the food. Sodexo is quite possibly some of the worst food I have eaten, depending on the day. There is a rumor that goes around every so often that they put laxatives in the food to get us to eat more, more frequently, and if you look on the app Yik Yak, there are daily complaints about the food making people sick or warnings about how the food is that day. If you go anywhere other than the dining hall, everything is preposterously marked up in price."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not popular at Plymouth, however there are many other opportunities to volunteer and give back."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many Greek fraternities/sororities recognized at Plymouth, and the ones that are not recognized are known for hazing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have always been lucky enough to know the right people at the right times when it comes to housing since I grew up around here, but everyone I know that lives off campus pays an arm and a leg to get a chincy apartment."
College Sophomore,2,It's mostly winter. If you ski or snowboard you are fine if you don't like snow or the cold don't come here.
College Sophomore,2,The UPD is very rude here at Plymouth. They make it impossible to talk to them about parking tickets and mainly just focus on getting people in trouble.
College Sophomore,2,"There are parties at night, but the transportation only lasts until eleven at night."
College Sophomore,2,"I have only heard of a couple, and I don't think they're associated with the school"
College Sophomore,2,"It's very obvious. People will just stand outside smoking weed around the dorms every night, and it's typically what you'll hear people talking about."
College Sophomore,2,There is a shuttle that stops at each designated stop at 20 minute intervals. It is rather inconvenient but the campus takes only about 15 mins to cross on foot.
College Senior,2,Not worth the cost of a parking pass. 
College Senior,2,"I feel like if you dont do it your looked at as a fool. But it didn't affect how I felt about drugs, I still will never do it. "
College Senior,2,I was sick every night I left the dining hall 
College Senior,2,I wish it was easier to get aid. I'm almost 100k in the hole
College Senior,2,Get your own computer!! There is never enough available. 
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any school spirit for the sports teams except maybe the hockey team.
College Sophomore,2,There seems to be more drinking here than drug use here.
College Sophomore,2,"There is alot of off campus, but alot of it is pricy."
College Sophomore,2,My major seems to be fine to me. Their are many different classes to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,"I am a transfer student, and this school is a lot better than my other school."
College Sophomore,2,Campus srictness seems to be average. As long as people use their heads they will be fine.
College Sophomore,2,I guess the housing at the school is ok I due not like on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"computers seem to work good, but sometimes there are not enough computers."
College Sophomore,2,Student realy seem to like school sports here.
College Sophomore,2,I guess the students here are average. People here seem to like to party.
College Sophomore,2,Diversity at plymouth seems to be limited. most of the students are white.
College Sophomore,2,Their is only one scholarship for my major and only a few at the school.
College Senior,2,The dining hall serves a variety of different foods that aren't too bad but it gets old after a while. The meal plans and prices of foods have increased over the past four years and sometimes you don't get a lot in your order with the price you pay. I like that there are on the go places where you can pick food up if you don't have time to sit down but some places that offer this are only open limited hours.
College Sophomore,2,"Although the food is better than what you get at most high schools, currently Sodexo is what caters our dining halls at PSU. They're food isn't 100% liked by all at campus but they do provide a wide variety of choices when it comes to eating."
College Junior,2,There is not really seen any diversity. People look and dress similarly.
College Junior,2,"It's average, nothing special. Houses are usually damaged and unfurnished."
College Junior,2,I transferred to PSU from another college last fall. I found that many of the professors were not nearly as friendly or personal as my last school. They do have a wide selection of classes available but there seems to be restraints on which electives you are allowed to take due to your major. Tis has been a hassle for me and others that I know.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most places close around 7. I'm not sure why on earth you want me to rate underage nightlife. There isn't public transportation other than the bus down to Concord, but most things are within walking distance."
College Freshman,2,Its pretty good. but the only thing is is if you want to have a car on campus you have to park so far away from the dorms that its either a long walk to get to your dorm or a long bus ride.
College Junior,2,"The places to eat on campus are good for food, but a lot of the time it is the same food over and over again and there isn't much variety. There are also times when, you want to eat food late night and the dining hall is no longer open so you have to use your flex dollars to purchase food somewhere else and then you tend to run out of dollars quickly."
College Freshman,2,every interaction I have had with either the campus security or administration have seemed pretty fair and reasonable.
Recent Alumnus,2,Needs Some Improvement – The parking is close but there is hardly ever any open spots and on-campus parking officials do not cooperate well with students.
Niche User,1,"I regret going to school here.  Myself and friends have been sexually assaulted while going there but, when we went to authorities at the school, nothing was done."
Junior,1,Plymouth state makes me hate life. Friends are made through parties so don’t expect to make meaningful relationships with anyone
Freshman,1,"The so called ""Cluster integrations/programs"" aren't known by any students or even faculty. Even though this is the biggest topic they talk about during freshman orientation and my first tour.

If you don't like to party, you won't make friends or get to know really anyone on campus. Almost every day there's at least three or four parties going on so if you live on campus, have fun being woken up in the middle of the night by random yelling and music. Smokers everywhere! 

The food is pretty good the first week or so but after that, it's all down hill from there. 

If you don't have a car on campus, good luck getting anywhere around the area. I thought from all the talk about how this is a such a skiing type of school there would be shuttles going to and from the ski resort to pick up people, nope. Only one bus on the weekends and weekdays at 6am and your only way back is to wait for the 4 pm bus at the ski resort. 

Very misleading. I wish I never applied to PSU."
Freshman,1,"All they cared about was partying or Adventure Ed. The faculty and staff were wonderful and obviously very passionate about their work but the student body had other priorities. Almost every night you'd hear a drunk fight between two guys, and almost half of the people on campus are either high or are planning on getting high. The people are nice on the surface but they do not intend on creating real, deep friendships with you. As long as you'll party with them or offer them party supplies then they'll stick around. Not a good experience, I will be transferring next semester."
Niche User,1,"I initially thought this would be a great school for my daughter, but I’ve discovered otherwise. Unless you want your kid to graduate with an alcohol or drug problem, consider another school. Drinking is rampant on this campus, even in broad daylight. This school does not have a reputation as a party school for nothing. There is a culture of drinking. My daughter told me that someone walked right down the hallway of her dorm smoking pot, was caught doing it, and was not even issued a warning. I think the culture of no consequences spills into other bad behavior too. Kids get drunk and do stupid things like jump out of third story windows and through doors. To make matters worse, individuals on campus stole from my daughter and despite sufficient proof were not given any consequences for their actions. This school is in a beautiful location but don’t be deceived. Think twice about sending your kid there. I am not being naïve when I say it’s over the top, and not in a good way."
College Freshman,1,"Many occur in the student apps, more are in off campus sports houses."
College Freshman,1,Teachers do not care about what they are teaching. They act as if it was a high school course. They also are not understanding of people with learning disabilities.
College Freshman,1,The campus police need to be doing a better job at party control. Many parties get out of hand and people get hurt.
College Junior,1,Greek life is pretty cool!
College Freshman,1,"Financial Aid doesn't help people at all because they only look a how much people make, not how much they spend. My brother and I both went to private high school and the college and financial aid doesn't see that so there is $10,000 a year they don't see leaving the bank account. Financial Aid is full of crook and people who need to reform how they give money to people. Not everyone has $60,000 to throw down every year. Especially not my family. They suck at being helpful. I hope they learn how to stop being a huge pain in the butt because some people can't even go to school because of them. Screw Financial Aid because they don't have any sympathy for others who need help."
College Senior,1,School is far from everything.
College Freshman,1,"I'm not going to bag the school because there are tons of students and alumni that absolutely adore this school and call it the ""best four years of my life"". I will say that this school is simply not my fit. By the fifth week of school I found myself bored with it and looking into other schools to possibly transfer to. The town of Plymouth itself is incredibly boring. There is absolutely nothing to do and with absolutely nothing to do, students resort to drinking almost everyday. I know several people that are having the time of their lives here so I'm not going to say don't apply here. Instead, you should probably visit the school a couple times before sending a deposit."
College Freshman,1,"In terms of ethnic heritage, there is virtually NO diversity in this school. The entire school is filled with middle-classed Caucasians that all act the same. Plymouth State is accepting nonetheless but if you're looking for a school with diversity you should definitely look elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,"You're either shivering in the bitter cold or under a constant cloud of rain and sleet. But then again, that's just New Hampshire."
College Freshman,1,This school is right smack dab in the middle of a tiny family-oriented town. There is absolutely nothing to do which is why a majority of the students here resort to partying or transferring. Nearby towns with actual things to do are about an hour away.
College Junior,1,"There is a strong drug and alcohol scene on this campus. We are known as a party school. I don't think I've ever experienced a weekend when I didn't smell alcohol or pot while walking back to my room. There are times when I open my dorm room to the immediate, overwhelming smell of alcohol and/or pot."
College Sophomore,1,The spring and summer here are good but winter sucks because it is really cold.
College Sophomore,1,There are not many places to go in this small town.
College Sophomore,1,Parking here is expensive and some times parking fills up and you have to pay to park at a meter.
College Junior,1,"There is a free campus shuttle bus that runs during the day and can bring you around campus easier, however it will not take you to the grocery store or the bank if you need to go. Most students at Plymouth State University bring their cars. There are no in-town taxi services that I am aware of."

Junior,5,Columbia College of Nursing has been a great experience. The instructors are practicing nurses who have an amazing passion to educating the next set of  nurses who will enter the world. I feel very lucky to be apart of the Columbia College of Nursing family.
Junior,5,Amazing student to professor ratio. Never felt like just a number in a classroom. Every professor had been a floor nurse and could relate to the nursing field just as though they were still practicing on the floor. It was great to have the professors have that connection so that they did not just give off the teacher vibes. They also are so knowledgeable about the fields they teach. They are always available when needed and that is a comforting feeling for students.
College Senior,5,It is a top of the line nursing school.
Junior,4,"After attending CCON for a year, I have noticed some disadvantages and advantages of attending. Some cons include; no food on campus and a short lunchtime, tough schedules, and limited student life on campus. Some pros include; a wonderful, clean and very safe campus, small class size (less than 35, but depending on the class), automatically enrolled in classes so it will take you just two years (if full-time) and the professors are very intelligent and are always willing to help. A lot of them are currently working as a nurse so you are able to make connections through them to shadow or perhaps land a dream job. Overall, this college is a wonderful experience and I would recommend."
College Senior,4,The school is offering online courses for the first time.
College Senior,4,The school offers advanced degree classes.
College Senior,4,The workload and curriculum is intense.
College Sophomore,4,I love attending a school that is only for nursing students.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very understandable.
College Sophomore,4,The library is all online!
College Sophomore,4,All gen ed credits are completed at a different school
College Sophomore,4,Tuition scholarships are awarded based on GPA.
College Junior,4,The fact that all the students are nursing majors we all share the same drive and motivation to finish our schooling to finally pursue our dreams of being a great nurse. Since it is such a small school the professors have your best interest at heart and truly like getting to know you and help you with anything.
College Junior,4,The school I attend is specifically focused on nursing. Every instructor and student is there for one reason and it is to become a fabulous nurse. The workload is tolerable as long as the student is willing to put in the work.
College Junior,4,"They have a MSN program in addition to their BSN/RN program. There is no career center or almuni network that I'm aware of, but job prospects are pretty good as far as I know. The pass rate for the NCLEX pass is above 90%."
College Junior,4,"Class sizes are small and most professors are approachable and knowledgeable about the various topics discussed in class. It's nice having profs who can tell you their real-life experiences as nurses. The registrar signs all students up for classes which is nice knowing you're on the right track for graduation, but you also don't get to pick your schedule or clinical placement."
College Junior,4,Nursing school is a lot of work and tests here are 90% of your semester grade for each class. Some classes you put a lot of effort in only for a pass/fail grade which sucks. 
College Senior,4,The tuition is expensive but I enjoy the small class sizes and clinical placements.
College Junior,2,There is not really an alumni network at the school. You do have the opportunity to use the electronic library and other resources once you have graduated. 
College Junior,2,"There is no library, the stduent center doubles as the cafeteria for staff and students, and there isn't an athletic center since there are no campus activities outside of SNA. The campus aesthetics aren't too bad though."
College Senior,2,This is a private school and it is expensive
College Junior,1,"The financial aid department is one person who has a lot of credentials and that's about it. She is not very helpful, timely in getting out award letters, and she has been rude and condescending to me in all my interactions with her."
College Senior,1,"This school offers 5-7 in-house scholarships in the spring semester that will apply for the fall semester. However, if you are a part-time student in the spring and will be a full-time student in the fall you are not eligible for any of the scholarships, although you will be carrying a full time load for the following semester. Their criteria is you have to be a full-time student prior to the following semester where you will carry a full-time load. That sucks and seems unfair. Some students can only afford to attend part-time. Another reason for the low grading, part-time students does not receive recongnition for Dean's list, even if the grade poing average is a 4.0. If you carry less than 12 credits you can forget the scholarships and recognition on the dean's list, part-time doesn't matter."

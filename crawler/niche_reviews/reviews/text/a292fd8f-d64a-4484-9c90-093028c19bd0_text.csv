Sophomore,5,"I like it's architectural design. I see a well maintain campus with lots of useful amenities.  The fact that it's surround by boutique and my favorite restaurants makes the experience worth it. Also, I enjoy the overall surroundings plus there is shuttle bus which is so useful in the nature of things."
Sophomore,5,"I mean the help sections get an A+. Its very understanding when it comes to guidance overall. It's Hoot loot service is remarkable being the fact you are able to use the card to load actual cash from a credit or debit. It even gives you the option to send in paper or electronics checks as well as enroll in all sorts of meal plans. I also like the fact that you have access to laundromat facilities. The library also lends out laptops when in need which I think is excellent being the fact that you can always have an unexpected emergency. The health department in fact is a good fit from what i discovered doing my research. Also, paying for private parking on its campus knowing that there's cameras, active staff, and on-site police officers is a big plus. The administrative was excellent with my enrollment. I can honestly remove them a good rating overall with the help that I recieved. The off campus housing is very exquisite being that fact that with purchase comes a gym."
Graduate Student,5,overall great school and amazing professors. campus is nice and everyone is very welcoming. great school to transfer to from community college. great experience overall

Whenever you need help outside of class, they are always available and are willing to help you the best that they could. When transitioning from high school to Southern I was very nervous , but coming to Southern other students and faculty were very welcoming. I like how close the buildings are , and easily accessible stores when I am need of resources. Also, they host a lot of events on campus, especially during the spring and summer. It is so fun because it brings students altogether, and the president comes out to interact and greet some of the students."
Freshman,5,"Southern Connecticut State University is a college that is very welcoming. This college is very diverse while it makes sure all students are recognized on campus.

Senior,5,"I really like the campus. They put a lot of time, money, and effort to make a campus that is fun and suitable for all students and staff.

Freshman,5,"Southern Conneticut state university is a great school, i felt very welcomed and wanted. The courses a super flexible to my shedule and the professors and classmates are very kind!"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Southern Connecticut State University has been a splendid one. I started off not knowing what career I wanted to invest in throughout my Freshman year which was scary but at SCSU they welcomed me with open arms to find a major that suited me best. My advisers really helped me through all of my hiccups when I had questions or for simple advice. Southern is really dedicated to making the future of their students worth it. I love my school dearly.
Freshman,5,"I'd rate SCSU as a strong, empowering university. Not only do they give each and every student equal opportunity to grow and succeed in class, they open up so many doors to enjoy your time at school, as either a commuter or resident on campus. Everyday at SCSU it's truly believed that I belong there just as much as everyone else and we'll all leave with the knowledge to make it in our chosen careers."
Alum,5,"The education I received here was exceptional, as were all of my professors. Whenever I struggled with material and reached out to my professors, I received prompt assistance and replies. Administration is also excellent and there are many resources available to assist students however they need it. The campus is gorgeous and all of the facilities are up-to-date, with numerous areas to study and use computers. It is continuing to expand facilities and add new programs. I loved every second of my time as a student, and hope to one day secure an additional teaching position there."
Senior,5,"While resources lack and are at most average due to state school funding, the staff really care for students' success and well-being. I never felt like I couldn't accomplish something, and I was always encourage to pursue my goals."
Graduate Student,5,"As a Graduate student at Southern Connecticut State University, I appreciate that I'm able to get a top notch education for a reasonable cost as an in-state student. My professors are active in their fields and invested in my success within my program."

Sophomore,5,It is an amazing school so far. Lot of help when it comes to transferring in. Definitely appreciate all the fun events on campus as well!
Freshman,5,"Southern Connecticut State University is amazing in terms of the academics and education. Professors are very attentive and are willing to help you through whatever you need. The general environment here is really friendly. Although one thing I would like to change is the lack of food variety on campus. Other than that, I love it here!"
Junior,5,"SCSU is a community in and of itself. Owl Pride is an understatement here. I enjoy being involved and how many opportunities there are to do just that. Moreover, the combination of lectures and small classes allow for the best academic growth possible. Not to mention, it's encouraging to attend a school focused on advocating for social justice."
Graduate Student,5,"SCSU offers expert faculty along with reasonable tuition prices. The various programs, (particularly the Schools of Education and Nursing) are comparable in their intensity and high standards to comparable programs offered in Yale University. The campus has become a second home to me and I will truly remember and cherish the personal and professional relationships created during my years here."
Sophomore,5,Really nice school filled with kind professors and students! Plenty of engagement all around campus and there are a lot of caring staff there to help you on your way to success!
Freshman,5,I had a great first semester at southern.I was not sure about this school at first .I wanted to go to a different university .I did not think I was going to like it .I met some great professors and I learned a lot .  I would definatley recommend this school.It is a nice little community .It doesn’t matter where you are from . I can’t wait to begin my next semester .
Freshman,5,My experience at Southern Connecticut State University so far has been nothing but welcoming. The staff and upperclassman are always so pleasant and friendly. There are many resources on campus that students can use for help with academic studies. This campus is a home.
Niche User,5,Southern Connecticut State Universities are very understanding about financial situation and school supplies.
Senior,5,"When I transferred in two years ago I was nervous I would not find my place. Southern has afforded me incredible opportunities to get involved on campus. I joined a medical charity and eventually was elected treasurer. Located close to the heart of the city of New Haven I found endless places to adventure on the weekends having access to the arts and culture there. I always felt safe and supported living on campus. Grants and donations have contributed to many of the new and updated facilities on campus. I found myself studying near the beautiful stained glass windows in the library. This educational institution is sacred to me. I love what I am studying, speech-language pathology and audiology. The major is competitive, but for a good reason. Our new president is committed to social justice and diversity. I am a proud owl and it feels good to look back and reflect on all the progress I have made in my two years at Southern."
Freshman,5,My experience prior to their warm welcoming has been very Good as an incoming freshman. The staff is very caring for their students and the campus has made it safe with the Southern police department. Over the summer semester I got sick and the health center was very attentive and made sure I was okay. their services were quick and easy to sign up for when making appointments. I also find the library really useful especially when going to study. I was able to rent study rooms where it was peaceful and quiet. while dorming in the summer the RA's were always making sure the building was safe which made me feel safe at any time of day and night.  Since I'm only an incoming freshman and everything hasn't gone bad I feel as there is no changes that should be made thus far.
Sophomore,5,"Professors and staff are very passionate about teaching. They want students to learn and be proud of their work and themselves. Beautiful, well-taken care of campus. There are clubs for just about everything, and countless ways to be involved with the school, on or off campus. Diversity is key and SCSU has lots of it!"
Freshman,4,I had 2 online classes this semester due to COVID-19 and it was actually very easy to follow along. Both professors had clear instructions of where work was and when it was due. They went over criteria perfectly and always aloud questions to be asked when confused.
Freshman,4,"Very pretty campus and super nice people. Everyone is very welcoming to new students. Classes are nice, most professors are very easy to get along with. Dorms are decently big and clean for the most part. Everyone os courteous of each other and its an overall very great place to be. The dining halls food is okay, not a big selection though. They serve the same things over and over and usually the things they say they'll have on the menu aren't actually being served. Other than that, the campus is a fun and diverse place to live and learn on!"
Junior,4,Southern Connecticut State University has a very welcoming environment. The people who attend and work there try to help new students as best as they can. The professors are friendly and will answer and explain concepts you may not understand.
Senior,4,Southern has great atmosphere and there services to you are simple and straight forward. The staff seem slightly over worked.
Sophomore,4,"The online experience for Southern was fairly easy for me. I can’t speak for others however, my professor we’re all very understanding that not everyone was in the same situation. Southern provided student who had no access to internet with access so that they would be able to continue their studies! Next semester will be online again so I’m looking forward to more understanding and patient professors."
Sophomore,4,"Southern is an overall great school. The faculty and administration are really caring and are willing to help in any way possible, everyone wants to see you succeed! Like most schools, there are some issues but, the issues are minor and can easily be solved if brought to a board."
Sophomore,4,The online courses I took were good.  It's best for me when we are on there with our teachers.  That interaction helps me to understand the material better than doing it alone.
Sophomore,4,"I love being a student at Southern.  Whenever I have a question about anything, such as my courses, school activities or employment on campus, there is always someone there to help.  Even with the COVID pandemic, they have kept us up to date with all matters."
Freshman,4,Haven't started attending yet but my experiences with student services and orientation have been great.
Freshman,4,I'm an incoming freshman and they have provided me with all the resources I've asked for.  The only reason I took off one star is because their websites are pretty confusing and difficult to use.
Junior,4,Overall SCSU is good but I would like to see some improvements in the diversity of the food providing and to have more activities during the week and weekend.
Senior,4,"I feel very supported and encouraged at Southern Connecticut State University. Professors, at least in the History and Anthropology departments, are some of the most intelligent, supportive, and encouraging people I have ever met. I entered college with a goal of what I thought I would be doing for the rest of my life. The faculty and staff at the university encouraged me to actually follow my heart and not money. It was not until I was a sophomore that I, with the assistance of my wonderful professors and friends, decided what I'd be doing for the rest of my life. My one problem with SCSU is its exclusivity. The school claims to be inclusive of all its students (regardless of race, ethnicity, sexuality, political affiliation, etc), yet often I feel that my lifestyle does not fit the narrative of the university. Often programs or assistance is available to students of all races except white, and while I understand the thought, that is a big hypocritical."
Senior,4,"I have taken two online classes before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the format is not conducive to my learning style. That being said, my professors understood that the situation was not ideal and catered to their students' individual needs. For the majority of my classes, I felt well-connected to my instructors, I felt comfortable reaching-out with questions, and I felt supported by my department. I did not put a lot of pressure on the ending of this semester because I knew that the situation was not ideal for anyone; it is unfair to expect professors to be the same online as they are in person. That being said, I hope we are able to resume in-person classes to better support all students, not just the ones who are comfortable with online classes."
Freshman,4,"I wish it was more commuter-friendly, we all come from different parts and we sometimes can;t afford housing in the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"Southern is a great school. I just wish admissions would make it easier for students to make their schedule without having to give up classes they want to take because they are all at the same time.  Also, financial aid can be a little frustrating to deal with."
Sophomore,4,"All of my professors have been wonderful! However, the Financial Aid office is a mess and I haven't had the best experience with my advisors."
Junior,4,"I just transferred to Southern this semester, and even though it has been rocky because of the outbreak of COVID19, I think Southern is a great school. The campus is huge and clean. The academic program is way different than my previous school, and it was a big adjustment. But overall I think this school has a lot of excellent resources, and staff that really care about their students."
Freshman,4,"My experience is good, the campus is really pretty. The nursing program which is my intended major is excellent."
Sophomore,4,It’s a great school if you somehow live by New Haven. I gave it a 4-star instead of 5 because the only flaw about this school if you’re a commuter like me. The traffic on the was is not the best.
Freshman,4,I think Southern Connecticut State University is a great school and I have been able to make new friends and meet good professors. The campus is diverse and has many helpful resources.
Junior,4,"Much friendlier environment, even the wannabe (middle-class) preppy kids that love to show off get called out and shunned like they should. Professors actually care and there's just a whole community vibe. Though the emergency 911 poles never work lol. Transferred as a Sophomore from the University of New Haven and don't regret it one bit."
Sophomore,4,"Southern is a very diverse school. Every semester I make several friends with various cultural backgrounds. The professors are very enthusiastic about teaching their subject, which makes classes easier to understand."
Junior,4,"SCSU is a great, affordable school with renown professors that have multiple high level degrees in their field. The campus is easy to navigate and the social environment is welcoming to new and returning students. A variety of programs are offered so there is one for anyone."
Niche User,4,"Every time that I have visited the campus, the students and staff have been so welcoming. I have been very impressed with the way that they care about their students and the community that they have."
Freshman,4,"Southern Is a very friendly institution and most students seem to be friendly. Additionally, SCSU is very diverse from students, and teachers from all kinds of backgrounds. teachers are very friendly and exponentially helpful most of the time. To be honest, SCSU professors are notably more helpful than I would ever expect. The campus is great, every athletic team is outstanding and is considerably safer than, other colleges in the area."
Freshman,4,"Being a local University for me, the commute is easy.  The classes are accommodating to my needs.  SCSU is a diverse school.  For me, the club sport, hockey, is why i choose this school.  If I had to ask that they change something, i would want easier parking to the buildings."
Niche User,4,"Nice campus, did a lot of construction to improve science section and library. The campus is small enough that it easy to get around, and it is 10 minutes from downtown New Haven."
Alum,4,"I transferred to Southern CT from UConn. The school was more local, and the prices were not horrible in comparison to other collages. The school offers a lot of different majors and classes. Class sizes are manageable. My biggest advice would be to be very involved in your education and campus clubs. Put in the extra work so you can land a good job after you graduate. All the professors I had were good and happy to help students. Have a plan when you enter the collage so you can finish in 4 years."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is from Connecticut and everyone goes home for the weekend. Most definitely a ""suitcase school"". Classes can either be terrible or amazing, it all depends on your professors and major. President Joe is amazing though and the campus has many resources. Housing and dining is very disappointing, but the safety makes up for it."
Junior,4,"I've had an amazing experience overall academically; the teachers all care so much and they treat you like a human being, not just as another student in a lecture hall. The only thing I don't love about the school is how much of a commuter school it is; many people go to class and then go home, leaving the campus pretty quiet/dead at night and on weekends."
Freshman,4,"Southern has a great diverse community. Everyone is a friendly and outgoing. There's always events to get involved and make friends. There are a lot of resources if you are having trouble adjusting, or just need help with classes."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at SCSU has been okay ,but I also could make it better .The university is what you make of it but it definitely has something for everyone and if there is nothing for you there are resources where you could form something that you would enjoy or like to participate in. Southern is a diverse campus that has people from different backgrounds which is why it is the community that it is.It not only has things for its residents ,but also for its commuters as well."
Sophomore,4,"I thought I was going to dislike SCSU, but I ended up opening up to a lot of people and enjoy the experience I have had so far. Professors care about their students and are (for the most part) open to emails and understanding. Their office hours are also useful, and if you need it, there is a tutoring center with other students explaining the subject in an easier way."
Sophomore,4,"Love their education programs that are offered, wish they had more to get the commuters involved. It’s difficult going in as a commuter and even going to any events offered"
Senior,4,"What I love most about being a student at Southern Connecticut State University is the warm and welcoming environment. Southern prides itself on inslusivity and acceptance of everyone. My experience at Southern has been nothing but positive. Getting involved in a club sport, sorority/fraternity/ or other groups on campus is a great way to stay involved and meet new people. Overall, both inside and outside of the classroom one can get the most out of a higher education experience."
Sophomore,4,I like how welcoming Southern is. The people and atmosphere really make me feel at home. I've become a lot more comfortable at Southern
Senior,4,"It is a good school overall. While it may be focused mainly on Education and Nursing majors, the school does have good stem programs, and is a cheaper, closer alternative to some of the other schools in the region."
Junior,4,"Over all, Southern is a great school to attend. It is fairly affordable and it is close to home so that is very convenient. The work is challenging so you definitely get what you pay for. With that being said, Southern offers many tutoring opportunities for their students. Southern has a strong belief that everyone one of its students should succeed. Southern offers tons of clubs so there is plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. Southern is overall a great school to attend."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, challenging courses. It is super diverse, and they are accepting of all people, ethics, background and political views. Professors (some) are really understanding with things going on in students lives and can provide accommodations for them."
Freshman,4,"SCSU has a beautiful campus and I love how the students can take the shuttle to downtown New Haven and many other places in Southern Connecticut. They have many activities to attend, especially in the spring. They do a decent job on improving their global impact. They are consideration on social issues as well. I would like to see the housing, food, and student safety a little bit better as well as the athletics because it seems like no one cares for the sports."
Freshman,4,What I like about Southern is that the school is very diverse. There are a lot of opportunities to take on in every aspect. The professor and student life is very lively. The campus is spacious but not too spacious which is nice. One thing I would like improved is the food served in the dining halls. The food sits out all day and there is very little taste to it.  Another thing that I would appreciate differently is having the clubs advertise at the beginning of the second semester so if any students transfer they have the opportunity to join and become more involved with the university.
Freshman,4,"It has a very good selection of majors, minors, and lots of internships opportunities. I like the location of the university because of how it is close to home so that I can walk to school every day and still live at home, which takes off the pressure of living in a dorm."
Senior,4,"Southern feels like a community.  Especially the social work program that I am currently enrolled in.  All the professors I have taken were very supportive of my success and wanted to see me do well.  I do think that some of the administrative staff can present themselves a tad more polite to students.  However, other than that I would not change anything about my experience at this college."
Freshman,4,I genuinely enjoy attending Southern. The campus and student life is so lively and there is always something going on around campus to get involved with. The class sizes are great and the professors I have had have all been wonderful. The location is perfect because there is also an opportunity for students to not have to travel far to be able to go somewhere or do something off campus. I really do love attending this school and would recommend it to anyone.
Senior,4,The professors have almost all been excellent in their willingness to help students and their genuine passion for the subject matter.
Niche User,4,"SCSU is a very well rounded school. They have much to offer for all their students and really put forth great effort into making sure that the campus grounds are kept up with, classrooms are up fitted with the best technology, and not to mention everything is modern and clean."
Junior,4,The diversity and programs. The professors are very caring for their students and theres a lot of academic resources that students can reach out to for help.
Alum,4,"Let's start by saying I love the campus, LOVE. I had a lot of fun a SCSU, I would probably go back for my MPH. I love the extracurricular activities, the clubs, etc. I enjoyed the Caribbean society club. I liked my science department, loved my Public Health class. But I hated living on campus."
Freshman,4,"Since the first time I visited the school, everyone has been very welcoming. Being part of an NCAA team here is very helpful at making friends."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophmore now in SCSU. My first experience was fun. Southern in my opinion is actually a good fit for people who like calm atmospheres. Not a lot of noise but when summer comes people sometimes play music in the main area which kind of hypes everything up. Overall, I do like here."
Graduate Student,4,"SCSU is a decent little state college with great professors.  The professors are what make this school worth it. You get what you pay for as far as technology in the classrooms on campus and the parking situation is terrible. There is a beautiful new library, student activities building, and science building, but the rest of the buildings on campus need updating."
Sophomore,4,"In my second year at SCSU, the academics are what stand out the most to me. Being a commuter, the professors work with you to help you succeed here. The student involvement is also something that positivly catches my attention. Majority or the student run clubs and organizations take their duties seriously to keep a fun and safe environment for Southern Connecticut State University."
Junior,4,"It's a really good school, the professors are always willing to help. There is an academic success center located on campus to help students with any problem areas they have within their courses."
Junior,4,"So far I have had a great experience. Everyone who I have spoken to has been incredibly informative, helpful and welcoming. Off to a great start!"
Junior,4,"I love how diverse the community is and how everyone is willing to give a helping hand, There are 100’s of clubs that you can join to make your college experience a whole lot more fun, and the toutering center really helps you out a lot. Southern Connecticut State University is an amazing school"
Alum,4,I loved the student involvement and parties they had. They had tutors to help students if needed. The only negative thing was the crime. Students kept getting robbed by the residents who lived in new haven.
Junior,4,I love the vibe of the school it's so welcoming and makes you feel like you can do so much. The professors for the most part are nice and the dorms are so worth it but you can also stay off campus and it'll still be fun. The parties are nice and the main yard is usually filled with activities to do and the clubs never end. There's always something to do for someone no matter what you like from step teams to anime clubs this school literally has anything and if it doesn't then you can create what you want which is great.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Southern has been indescribable but very rewarding. I have met many people and made lots of connections with my professors. The staff are very pleasant to work with and have made my time being there very pleasant.
Senior,4,"My experience at Southern Connecticut State University thus far has been a great one. The campus felt like home the second I first stepped foot on it. The students, professors, and other faculty are great people, which is a big part of the whole experience. The university offers a wide range of classes for people who are looking to learn about almost anything. Southern hosts many on-campus events and activities that really pull the student population together. It allows us to meet new people and have fun while doing so."
Junior,4,This is the third university I attended and is by far the best one! The school offers great clubs you can sign up for and luckily is affordable if you live in the state. The campus is beautiful and is considered to be a small-medium size. That means it is easier to get closer to your professors and better educate yourself. The president of the unniversity cares deeply about his students and only pushes us to do our best.
Freshman,2,"I decided to attend SCSU to save money.  When the pandemic started, I decided to commute because of the restrictions on dorms and confusing information. Classes are mostly online and my in-person class quickly was moved online because the professor found it more convenient. I know fellow students who are mainly taking async classes where you teach yourself and the professor just grades (this includes a chemistry class). There were many events on campus, but almost all of them are empty. Everyone goes home on the weekends, I have been one of 3 people left in the building on Saturdays. Overall, extremely lonely and isolating. Clubs are hard to figure out and theres no one contacting you about meeting times."
Junior,2,"I'm in the theatre department, an underfunded department with nearly exclusively white male professors in a department that is riddled with misogyny."
Alum,2,"Upon being transferred into the school, I was completely lost and no one was able to constructively guide me through the process of the transition."
Freshman,2,Online learning just overall isn't great and there's not too much the school can do but over all SCSU's response hasn't been too bad.
Senior,2,It's a pretty nice college. Peaceful at times and annoying at others. If your a parent whose expecting the University doesn't recognize you as a person and professors don't care what you may be experiencing. Stand your ground and do what it takes to graduate and let them know title 9 is no joke.  Used lactation rooms as you need.. They are not made easy for you to spot so look on a map in advance. College is annoying because the cycle of superiority is something the professors don't let you forget. So just buy pass that and you will be fine.
Junior,2,"What I would like to see change at Southern State University, is to respect students privacy, sometimes students maybe going through things. It is better to ask than to assume that outside sources are right, when the outside source may not even have the full entirety of whats going on. Dont allow outside sources to execute negative actions that other people may pray on happening to your fellow students. Respect is key!"
Junior,2,I do like all of the extracurriculars and support programs offered at Southern. I do not think that the advisors give h bst advice n trying to get you out on time in the most efficient ways.
Niche User,2,I would like to see more diversity. Many of the teachers were caring when it came to making sure that the students understood the material being taught.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at SCSU was good but it wasn't what I thought it would have been. I would have liked to connect with more students. One of the main reasons I applied to SCSU was because of their great nursing program, which is very competitive. Knowing that, the advisers here didn't really encourage you to try and get into the program. If you had one ""okay"" grade, they would basically tell you to switch your major. Although it isn't necessarily their job to ensure that we do well, it would have been nice if they at least gave us some encouragement or tips on how to do better and what we would need to do to ensure we get a shot at getting into the program. Other than that, SCSU isn't a bad school at all. Many of the professors are willing to give help if you ask for it. Overall, you just have to make the best of your experience."
Junior,2,Southerns cool lol but cmon. Pretty disappointed that we have to try so hard to make parties happen. Campus cops 👎
Niche User,2,"I spent my freshman year at Southern. Terrible experience. The dorms were dirty and run down, there was grafitti in the closets, and the bathrooms were disgusting. I was constantly getting tonsilitis and it was definitely from how unsanitary the whole place was because I haven't gotten it since I lived there. The professors and curriculum were ok. The food was ok. I would go home every weekend although I was paying to live on campus because of how badly I didn't want to be there. Also, most students don't graduate on time because you can't get the classes you need as they fill up very quickly."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is the only thing appealing here. The surrounding location is sketchy and unattractive. The teachers are average, some are unlikable and pushy. There are many useless classes. There is little freedom in the classroom. The students are unfriendly and cliquey. The dorms are less than average and have no air conditioning. The food is mainly unhealthy and gives you diarrhea. The bathrooms are disgusting, old, and smelly. The showers are of poor quality. This place is a business and us students are the customers."
College Junior,2,The halls are not in the greatest condition and they don't put a lot of effort or money into students staying in the less expensive halls. The only students who really benefit from living in the student halls are the honor students.
College Freshman,2,"Every semester I've had at least two bad professors whom either cancel class, are pushovers, or just have no idea how to teach a class or really know what they're talking about. I feel like my money is not being invested in anything worthwhile other than to learn how to party and socialize, which even then I'm struggling with."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about Greek life because No one really pays that much attention to them on campus, they are just apart of the student body."
College Senior,2,this is big and you can get lost in the shuffle quickly
College Sophomore,2,NO one cares about students. everyone just a paycheck or number
College Freshman,2,They are rude and do not know how to speak to students
College Freshman,2,Really bad and not good
College Freshman,2,There should be more student discounts giving at certain places you go.
College Freshman,2,"The food at SCSU is I would say bad because most the time when you receive the food it is never hot and the food is warm, no one wants to eat warm food. I constantly have to order food because I want to eat a hot plate and not no warm plate. I am trying to eat healthy and eating the food here does not make me want to eat healthy unless I eat a salad but how many salads can a person eat through the day, not many. I am not the only one that complains about the food everyone that I talk to complains about it. Some of the food does taste good but then you take that one bite and you are like ""What is this?"" At first I liked the food, but now i just wish they would switch the food around sometimes and we could have more options instead of the same food every day."
College Freshman,2,I do not like the dining hall food.
College Freshman,2,The food being served is very repetitive and played out.
College Freshman,2,"There are very rarely any parties on campus. Mostly every one goes home on the weekends. My roommates have not stayed a weekend once this semester. The campus is very dead on the weekends. I don't go to parties much. I always hear they are getting shut down by the police, but only because they want to keep students safe."
College Student,2,Dorm parties are nonsexist. The majority of students go downtown to party.
College Student,2,Visiting hours and the hassle of signing visitors in and out of dorms is a pain.
College Sophomore,2,Apply VERY early.  Do NOT let the secretaries tell you that it's too early to apply.  Get her manager in there and accept your applications as soon as possible.
College Freshman,2,"Barely any parties.

Clubs in New Haven are not the spot."
College Freshman,2,They don't talk about it much within the school.
College Sophomore,2,"Have scholarships available, but not for everyone!"
College Freshman,2,I hate New England weather and Southern has New England weather. 
College Freshman,2,I appreciated not having to come out of pocket that much. However i still had to take out huge loans that i feel southern should have gave me more aid to cover. I'm the first in my family to go to college and my family doesn't have any money for me to go to college. I feel that southern could have been more giving when it came to financial aid. I'm appreciative for what i received though. 
College Freshman,2,Not a safe area at all.
College Freshman,2,Don't feel very safe.. bad area.
College Senior,2,"They just made another parking garage, but parking is still outrageous and difficult to find. Especially now with the current construction.  It's best to carpool, get dropped off, or take public transit.  On the weekends parking is very easy to find and you can park anywhere.  During the week there are designated spots and times for students and faculty."
College Sophomore,2,"It's really difficult to find a spot to park unless you get there a good twenty minutes before your class, at least. The walking isn't too bad, unless you're late, then finding a spot near the main buildings is hard."
College Sophomore,2,no spots and its far
College Sophomore,2,i transfered from university of bridgeport and i wanna go back 
College Freshman,2,"Luckily the parking passes are free. However, if you are a commuter you need to get there early because the best parking garage always fills up. The newest parking garage is nowhere near any classes. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Well... campus events are sometimes entertaining. For the most part the school usually look unappealing because of it's constant and endless construction but the student center, specifically the fitness center, is decent and the library is nice. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's not good. If you want to go to school just for the Greek-life, don't come here. You can't even stay in a house on campus"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not good. I'm always cold and snow is a major factor here. 
Recent Alumnus,2,You definitely need to bring a computer. Although some of the labs have been updated it doesn't make them faster because of the SCSU network and the demand (due to amounts of commuters) is very high. 
College Sophomore,2,"school is in a bad neighborhood, and anybody can walk around our campus"
College Junior,2,Greeks think they own the school. They can be very snotty.
College Junior,2,"I don't know much about it. There are apartments that SCSU owns, but I don't know anyone who lives in them."
College Junior,2,You have to find the right people to fit in with on campus. Many people in your classes become people you can greet on the sidewalk walking to class.
College Sophomore,2,The computer labs are very scarce and almost always packed. There is wifi but it is very crappy and most of the time it isn't wireless!
College Sophomore,2,Student life on campus mostly accommodates hanging out and not so much of studies. Very little library for such a huge university although there are some extensions to the library being made. 
College Sophomore,2,Just about all the computer labs are full unless you get lucky and live in west. THEY TAKE FOREVER TO START UP! Printing is cheap. They're adding additions to the library so maybe that will help.
College Freshman,2,"Your grades will probably be high because you will have no where to go during the week. Friday is not bad, decent. Saturdays are dead because everyone goes home. This is all house party wise. However, the clubs go Thursday-Saturday but you can't even drink there and after taxi and admission fee you're looking at an easy $20 night not including alcohol. Doesn't seem bad until you do it several times a week."
College Freshman,2,"They put you in pointless classes first semester of freshman year. Examples for me are History of Western Art, and Inquiry. I am a economics major so why do I take these? Plus by doing this they extend your graduation date because you must take a certain amount of ""bulls***"" classes to graduate. They have nothing to do with your major."
College Freshman,2,I have not been exposed to greek living so I cannot answer this.
College Senior,2,"My family struggles and yet I can barely get enough aid to cover each semester. I do not make much money and my family has a lot of problems and I feel the Financial Aid services are not good enough in helping the students that are seriously in need.

 I have received help but it could be much better, such as more access to scholarships that are applicable to me, many are so vague or specific and require a lot of time and dedication. Maybe more availability for counseling would help students"
College Senior,2,"people i have seen take part in using marijuana, that is the most popular drug used on campus of what i have seen. there is other drug use but i barely notcie it because people are very secretive about using harder drugs than weed."
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus police shut down everything.  There aren't many places to go after the rugby house shut down.
College Junior,2,I think the program in my school advance the skills and thought process for our career. Learning new things that I can use in both my personal and business life gives me motivation to want to know more and enjoy doing it. Sometimes the workload can keep you busy for the rest of the week but it helps us with that push of making us feel as if we are living the life of our career. The job opportunities are wide ranged and are growing every year in the economy but we are still thought to think and do the best.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid here is a serious process. The staff is fairly unhelpful but there are a rare few who truly care. In order to get the most out of it, go for in-person help and apply early. Meet deadlines and triple check everything!"
College Sophomore,2,"SCSU is located in New Haven, so there's a lot of african americans, blacks, haitians, senegalese, and other ethnicities such as Asian americans and mexicans or spanish. Not a lot of white."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the time good, only if you go at the structured times. The times are very limited, no buses later than 8pm mon-thrus, and on Friday buses end at 5 pm. And there's only one bus that goes from the school to the train stations. other wise the buses for the other campus spots are there."
Freshman,1,"Professors were not taught how to use different programs online and each one meets on a different platform. Many of my online sync classes were moved to ""optional"" and we were sent a lecture power point to teach ourselves off of. No sense of organization or normalcy and no attempts to try to connect students."
Junior,1,"My professors don't know what they're doing online. First few weeks of class were lost to technology issues, and even still classes start late because students don't know how to access the links."
Alum,1,This school was very unorganized. Professors did not communicate effectively and left students in the dark.
Freshman,1,My online experience wasn't so good when I first started but I learned to make do with what I had and it wasn't as bad as I thought but I really would have loved if my summer classes were in person they are way more engaging in person than online.
Senior,1,It's just no the same. Twice as confusing and just feel so unmotivated. Just wish I could meet or gather or something. Learning about life around me through about with out engaging is annoying
Junior,1,"School is garbageeee. Teachers treat you like your high school. Sports team are garbage besides women's basketball. Mens soccer and football lose every game. No one bothers to go to the games. Food is God awful I wouldn't even fed to my dog from the stale bread to the highly under cooked rice. Wifi is so terrible, most people here are rude as heck. Save your money and don't waste your college years like I did here."
Sophomore,1,"Awful. I transferred to southern after my freshman year, thinking I wanted to be closer to home and commute. I have been a student there for less than a month, and so far they have lost my transcripts twice, ignored multiple emails, and just generally given me attitude multiple times. It's absolutely not worth it, the administration is a joke, the education is subpar at best, and the professors just don't really care about their students."
College Freshman,1,"The courses are horrible. There is little freedom. Freshman can't or have a difficult time choosing their classes. The professors are average, some are pushy and unlikable."
College Freshman,1,This is an average school. It's a business though. Many degrees are meaningless and the school knows this.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no order in the soccer team and the league they play is not serious.
College Freshman,1,No Greek life on my campus
College Sophomore,1,It's WAY too expensive so I chose to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,They need to learn to SALT THE PARKING LOTS. >:(
College Sophomore,1,I live several cities away.  It's impossible to get transportation!
College Sophomore,1,I do not feel that many people care about sports at my university.
College Freshman,1,Campus food at Conn sucks. But I heard it has gotten better than a couple years ago.
College Freshman,1,They dont  talk about living off campus to first year students. 
College Junior,1,"I live with my dad and we are going through a bankcruptcy at the moment, but financial aid still deems that my father makes too much, so I have to take out loans."
College Freshman,1,The pizza downtown is great. Transportation there sucks. Other than that enjoy fast food.
College Freshman,1,Hard to get. You will DEFINITELY be far from school. At least a 10 minute drive. Only two houses walkable. Rest of the houses are a hike.
College Freshman,1,"Easy to get marijuana. School is full of smokers. If wanted you could get it within the first 24 hours of being on campus. Hardcore drugs, are possible to get too. Few kids do them. I stay away from all that, but many kids do it."
College Freshman,1,"For commuters, you will be skinny. You will have to walk about a mile to class due to the lots filling up so quick so early. For on campus kids, goodluck getting a parking pass freshman year. Must have a job local, and show 2 previous paystubs just to be considered. After that, parking is mediocre for older kids."
College Freshman,1,"All frats on campus are full of.... Let's say ""not the coolest kids"". Nothing like what you would expect. Because they rarely party due to the fact that they are not allowed off campus housing because of school rules. One small frat has a house, they are fun, but you can go there friday nights to open house anyways, sausagefest however. Definitely frats are a low grade."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process has been horrible for me so far. I have received nothing and I am struggling financially to attend school in 2 weeks.
College Sophomore,1,I am not satisfied at all with Southern's curriculum in the Sciences. As a Biology major I feel like there are many classes that are completely pointless with the career many want to pursue. The lack of technology in the science buildings and professors teaching the science courses is minimal. There aren't a variety of professors to choose from and the ones that are currently teaching are extremely arrogant and unhelpful.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no such thing as ""Greek life"". Southern does have sororities but they play little to none part of the school activities."
College Senior,1,"Connecticut hall could have a better dining facility. there food is not good and it gives you diarrhea. they do not have many food options. although they have a few nice staff members, other staff members are rude to the students."
College Sophomore,1,"It's incredibly hard to find off-campus housing. The part of New Haven where the school is located is not a safe place to begin with, and most of the places around the school are not up for rent, just sale. The landlords can be hard to deal with, although the cost of rent (if you can find an apartment/house for rent) is not very expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"You have to arrive at least an hour before you class if you want to successfully find a good parking spot. Although there's no priority parking for seniors or freshmen, it doesn't matter because spots fill up super fast."
College Freshman,1,"The driver of the shuttle is very rude. The shuttle times make no sense with the class schedules. If you don't catch the shuttle, or it fills up before you get to it, you have to wait an hour for the next shuttle, they will leave you behind, regardless of exams, work schedules, trian schedules, or holidays."
College Senior,1,There is hardly any help out there for graudate students.
College Freshman,1,"There are just not enough parking spaces on campus. They're int he proccess of building a new parking garage, but it's nowhere near done yet. You need to arrive on campus by atleast 8:30am or you won't get a spot at all."
College Senior,1,New Haven – I found it really hard to find an Appartment in new haven. When I did find one and had the chance to view it the location was somewhat scary. The apartment were in locations that I wouldn't dear to live or travel. Some in the middle of the getto. Others were just old and rundown.
College Junior,1,"No One Cares Enough to Actually Help You – my friends and myself have had so many problems with financial aid office, they dont care to help, they pick up the phone and hang up, everytime we actually speak to someone we get different answers to our questions. never able to meet with our actually financial aid advisor"
College Junior,1,"Remedial Learning at Best – Students come to southern so behind that the entire first two years become remedial education.  they professors teach down to their students' level, and the classes become increasingly useless.  I had an entire class about manners and table etiquette."
College Freshman,1,Gag Me – Everyone is tacky and trashy. I only came here because I thought they had my program. everyone is rude and not attractive either
College Junior,1,To me it seems like most of the students at SCSU just goof around and many of the professors give way... not good.
College Senior,1,"Under Construction – The general campus at Southern Connecticut State University has been under construction for the years I have been currently attending. In my four years, the old library is still undergoing renovation and an old building that is soon to be the new business school has yet to be started. A freshmen dormitory has also been renovated but the school could use newer buildings with better time scheduling of when everything will be finished!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Wireless and Printing – No wireless in residence halls, it is needed!

Students should not pay to print and should be able to print in color. 

Students should have access to a copy machine"
College Freshman,1,Campus Actibities – not much to do on campus. Everyone leaves on the weekend. If your not doing a sport there is no reason for you to come here.

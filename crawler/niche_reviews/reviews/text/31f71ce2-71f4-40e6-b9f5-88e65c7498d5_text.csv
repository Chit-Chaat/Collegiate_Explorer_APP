Freshman,5,My classes are mostly good. Sometimes some professors are confusing and don't make sense. But most professors are really awesome.
Freshman,5,Took my hardest classes online. The professors made it completely manageable and I still learned a lot.
Freshman,5,"If you're looking for a college which provides a liberal arts education, Monmouth College is the best option. Located in the small town Monmouth, Illinois, this college has access to every resource which are required to become a successful student. Along with liberal arts, the STEM department of this college have faculties with high qualifications. Also, Monmouth College supports every student who wants to work on or off campus and provides with lots of support for those who participate in sports. Apart from sports, there is a choir and dance teams which have events atleast 2-3 per semester.  If you want to visit the web page, here's the link: https://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/default.aspx"
Niche User,5,I love Monmouth because it a small school which students can go around fast for help with academics and understanding more about everything
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Monmouth College has been amazing. I have learned so much about myself in and outside of the classroom. Socially, I learn new things about myself and others everyday. I overall have learned how to be a better person for myself and others while attending Monmouth College. I am very grateful to be a student of the school. I am fortunate enough to also have job and be provided with the opportunity to work with the offices that help in developing the college."
Freshman,5,I like how the professors are very involved with the students academics and outside activities. I also love their campus that makes you feel like you are home.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with the school has been amazing. They have helped me so mush in making sure I am going to the school that's right for me and helping me with all of my financial packet. Anytime I had gone to an event of the school they staff had made me feel welcome and as if I belonged at Monmouth.
Freshman,5,"It's a small campus, and it gives you a home vibe. There is not much to do outside of campus, but when you meet the right friends on campus, there is endless amounts of fun. The school always has events to help keep the students busy and have something to do. The events can range from pet zoos, to a having jumpy houses in the middle of the quad. We also have great school energy and everyone is very friendly. I feel at home when I'm on campus. The community truly is something that keeps the school going. We may not have the perfect big university but we have each other. The professor even know you by first name and they are here for us."
Alum,5,"I was allowed to grow through the several student leadership opportunities available.
And the professors walk you through anything you need help with.
You can never feel alone in Monmouth. Talk to one person and youll have a whole community to have your back.
And this is coming from an international student who thought it all unusual.
I owe MC a lot."
Freshman,5,I loved everything about monmouth! It is a very very great school. It has a very friendly atmosphere and the professors are amazing. They care about you as a student and strive for you to go far I life. One thing I would probably change about monmouth college would be not having any air in the underclassmen dorms. I would highly recommend Monmouth college!
Senior,5,"Monmouth allows you to get a great well rounded education, allowing you to be involved in multiple organizations on campus all while mainining a great GPA!"
Freshman,5,I like that Monmouth College is a clean safe campus. The only thing I would change is for them to be more helpful in finding scholarships for their students.
Niche User,5,I love this website. It has been supper helpful in finding scholarships. that has been the most difficult thing so far and i'm glad this website makes things much easier for me. especially after all those college applications i just finished submitting.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the professors and classes at Monmouth. For awhile I contemplated leaving due to personal reasons and the academics and support of my professors is a huge reason of why I decided to stay. The professors are extremely helpful and the classes are quite interesting. Registering for classes is very easy to get the hang of. At times the workload can be a lot but it is manageable.
College Sophomore,5,"I haven't really noticed many drugs on campus. I know that some students smoke pot, but that's all that I am aware of. I have never felt unsafe at school because of drugs."
College Senior,5,Monmouth is a historic campus that is rare in the fact that it is home for two of the nation's largest sororities. Being apart of Greek like has been the most unexpected and absolute best thing I have done since attending Monmouth. Greeks and Non-Greeks intermingle and there is no negative treatment by either association to one another.
College Junior,5,"The career center is great. They will help get resumes started and revised, they will help someone get an internship or job."
College Junior,5,This experience has been amazing! In my classes I have had to work hard for the grade that I want but it has been worth it.
College Junior,5,The Greek life is pretty big on campus and they are always doing community service. All of the sororities and fraternities are very PanHellenic. If you are not a Greek nobody will look down on someone.
College Junior,5,"The athletics here are awesome. The coaches are hard on the students, but it helps the students become better. There are always students at each game that we have here on campus even if it is freezing outside."
College Junior,5,"The professors are very nice, they let you cry and rant about how stressed you. They are willing to give advice on what to do next and will help get you where you need to be. The campus is just very friendly."
Recent Alumnus,5,Class size is small.  Faculty is nice and clean
Recent Alumnus,5,I felt safe on campus
Recent Alumnus,5,The housing was very nice and comforting.
Recent Alumnus,5,The students involvement is huge.  Everyone is always looking to be involved and there's plenty opportubities to do so.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love my school. Teachers care a lot.
College Junior,5,"I think Monmouth College has provided me with opportunities I could not find anywhere else. The relationships with the professors, staff, and my peers are invaluable and have allowed me to network with people who have given me new insights, perspectives, and even more chances to gain experience in and out of the classroom. The support system and community at MC is irreplaceable and I consider myself lucky to be a part of it."
College Freshman,5,The financial aid is really good and they work with you if there is any problem.
College Sophomore,5,we don't have dorms but if we did have them i think my school was be very strict
College Sophomore,5,Hey just be you and i'll be okay with you or friend with you
College Sophomore,5,The top major on campus! there are many people around to help  and point you in the right direction.
College Sophomore,5,I really like my program thanks to the psychology professors. I would do it again. I'm looking to forward to become a social worker or forensic psychologist. I want my job to somehow involve the law or the government.
College Senior,5,"Scot atheltes are very supported and respected by everyone on campus no matter what sport it is but if you are not atheltic you are still treated with respect, Its Great to be a Scot!"
College Sophomore,5,My programs are great I enjoy being a Spanish major and a Communication minor. I found my love for communications through my course on Interpersonal communication with Trudi Peterson. She is amazing and being in her class is a life changing experience.
College Sophomore,5,The only difficulty I see coming my way is if I swich my Communication minor to a major is that I will have to build a portfolio on papers revised based on therioes that I ahve to present to a board of executives to see if I can get a deggre on that.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone seems to be different and that is good because you get different cultures and different ideas.
College Sophomore,5,Monmouth College is really good at helping students make it to college. They really care about you and they will assist you with a lot of financial aid.
College Senior,5,"It is very easy to make friends and meet potential romantic partners on campus. That is the awesome thing about being on a small campus, you instantly connect with people the first week of school!"
College Senior,5,"The process was very simple, you just need to fill out the free application, no essays or letters of rec, you need a fairly good ACT score and GPA on your transcripts. I was admitted within less than a month of applying."
College Sophomore,5,I think that in academics Monmouth is the best because they have great professors and other staff that really care about out education.
College Freshman,5,I enjoy all the perks with being a college athlete here. It couldn't be any better.
College Freshman,5,"The professors on campus are actually worried about your well-being and genuinely care about you not only as a student, but as an individual. The academics here are also premier due to it being a liberal arts college."
College Junior,5,98% students receive financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and all the people in it!  The campus is beautiful and the professors are really easy to talk to. I would definitely choose Monmouth again.
College Sophomore,5,"My admissions counselor, Peter Pitts, was one of the primary reasons I chose monmouthcollege. He was quick, courteous, available almost 24/7, and if he didn't know the answer, quickly referred me to someone who did. Quick, painless,and simple, the admissions counselors are there to get you in."
College Sophomore,5,"Monmouthcollege is extremely diverse. People are here from all walks of life, and all corners of the globe. Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, American, British, Pakistani, Japanese, if your looking for something different this is the place to be."
College Sophomore,5,"Monmouthcollege has a very diverse and connected student body. This gives you opportunities to experience entire cultures and people from across the country, and across the world. The campus has certain spots that students can share these with each other. The library has books and artifacts from Japan to Persia. The theatre has plays like The Bachae, and the Symphony groups play great music for events. With free sports games year round, and cultural events all the time, sure its not state of the art, but the experiences will last a lifetime."
College Sophomore,5,Campus is extremely safe.  You can walk around campus and the town anytime of night by yourself and be fine.  One of the biggest upsides of living in a rural area is safety is never a concern.
College Junior,5,"The process was very simple actually, you just chose a major and then the faculty would guide you through the courses that you would have to take. On top of that the Monmouth College website has a four year planner that include the courses that are required for taking your major."
College Junior,5,"For my major (Business Administration) the coursework is challenging, but the instructors know what they're doing and they know how to teach a subject so that the majority of the students can comprehend the material. The instructors also take their time to talk one on one with those who cannot grasp the subject material in order to aid them in learning it. I enjoy my program very much because od this fact, and I especially enjoy it because of the fact that when I graduate I will have a good chance at getting a job with a good firm."
College Junior,5,"As a Business Administration major at Monmouth College I am very happy, Thanks to the flexibility of when you're allowed to choose your courses I have been able to fit the classes that I want to take into my schedule with minimal hassle. Not only that but the administration, faculty, and advisors are great help when it comes to choosing what courses to take next, they really work with you to help you find courses that fit into the times that you want to take them."
College Sophomore,5,Challenging classes that you will get a lot from. The professors are great!
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of major choices, pre-professional choices, good advisors, great professors. Challenging classes."
College Sophomore,5,"There is very little campus crime, security officers are available at all times and can be seen walking around campus. The school has a very safe feeling evironment"
College Freshman,5,The Chemistry professors are the best. They care about you and make sure you understand the materials.
College Freshman,5,ASAP does a pretty good job with campus activities.
College Freshman,5,"The student combo is the best, and it is very cheap."
College Junior,5,There is a shuttle bus that runs from Tues- thurs throughout the town and it hits all the main spots you want to get to. On sundays you have a shutle bus that takes you to Galseburg and goes to a few places that aren't here in Monmouth. I love wal-mart and that is one of the stops in Galesburg that the shuttle bus makes and I think it is just awesome. I never heard of a school that comes close to offering a free ride to go to places you would need to get to throughout the school year. It was a great and very considerate idea  for those college students who don't have a car or may be handicap.
College Senior,5,The Buildings Are Amazing. The athletic department is fully equipped and amazing. There is many different activities and high quality materials.
College Freshman,5,"Pizza, Pizza, Pizza! There are several pizza places around campus that all offer a ""college special' kind of deal. There are also two mexican restaurants, one grill place, and a Petey's. Then you have the usual fast food places."
Freshman,4,I love the school but when I went to the Scots market and trying to pay for my snacks the cashier gave me a big attitude just because I was paying for it. I really dont know who people think they are! 😡😠
Sophomore,4,"When COVID-19 hit I was forced to return home and proceed with remote instruction.  While it was difficult at times, it was incredibly easy. Professors were gracious and answered questions rather quickly.  The only problem was that there were too many different teaching platforms being used.  In the future, I imagine they will used a uniform platform. COVID was stressful as heck"
Sophomore,4,"Monmouth College feels like home. Professors and other students make it much easier to find your place on campus. Professors and coaches truly care about the all around well-being of everyone on campus. It can be challenging at times because expectations are high for every student. For legal reasons, this is a lie: MC Scots throws really, really solid parties in the fall."
Senior,4,"Professors would utilize Moodle to upload notes and/or answer keys. Additionally, assignments to be completed would typically be posted."
Senior,4,"My experience from an academic standpoint was great. I enjoyed my professors, they were easy to locate and open to conversations regarding both the material and my personal life. I really felt like my professors went out of their way to make sure I had all of the tools needed to be successful in my field of study. Being at a small school allowed students to get individual attention. Student tutoring was very helpful as well. However, when it came to mental health, I feel like the college dropped the ball. It was really difficult to get in to see a counselor given that they had to see so many students. Also, I felt like it was really hard to get someone to listen when it became necessary to report a student for being a harm to themselves. They may begin the process of checking up on a student, but I feel like a lot of students end up slipping through the cracks. I also found it difficult to remain in contact with multiple deans after reaching out the first time."
Freshman,4,It is a very welcoming environment and small enough where knowing people isn't a problem and finding professors is made easy.
Niche User,4,I love the number of friends that I have made while being here. I feel that I am bettering my education and that it is preparing me to join the workforce.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Monmouth College has been good. I enjoy the campus and classes and buildings were easy to find. The teachers were professional and helpful. My advisor was nice and knowledgeable about classes that I needed. I enjoy the football coaches and the workouts. There didn’t seem to be a lot of party life which I am fine with. The dorms were kinda small but clean and safe. The campus seemed safe and clean as well.
Junior,4,"Monmouth College feels like home to many. The campus is contained  Most of the professors are caring and respectful of students' time. The food is lacking at times, however, the education makes up for it. I feel like I am being prepared for the future and set up to make my own decisions on what I want to do."
Junior,4,"Monmouth College is very warm and welcoming. The sense of community is a beautiful thing. It feels as though we are all a family. The campus is quite beautiful all times of the year. However, the slippery sidewalks are a slight struggle during the winter months. If you're looking for a home away from home, this is your place."
Freshman,4,"I really like Monmouth. Its academic programs are very interesting particularly in Economics. I can say that the economics program of Monmouth is a good one for me because of my future aspirations. As a prospective student, I will be very happy to be a part of Monmouth community this Fall. Furthermore, in terms of scholarship, even if I did not receive a full scholarship from Monmouth, what they gave me is very impressive and helpful financially. I love Monmouth!"
Freshman,4,"Monmouth is a beautiful campus with amazing staff and students. It's a small town feel at many times which can be a good and bad thing. It's great for community, but sometimes sucks when you want to get away. However, the students are extremely kind and respectful to everyone. The only real complaint I have about the college is the disconnect of the college, from the city of Monmouth itself."
Alum,4,"Monmouth College allows one to find themselves through a variety of extracurricular activities. There is just about anything to get involved in. If not, it is encouraged to find yourself and to start an organization of your own. I think the professors really care about their students. I appreciate it's history and being one of the first institutions to be inclusive and not exclusive. I think the school needs to work more on retention, understanding diversity, and to recognize problematic culture."
Alum,4,I really liked Monmouth college! The atmosphere of the school really encouraged students to do their best with their academics
Alum,4,"I really did love Monmouth College. The campus was absolutely beautiful, and I loved how small it was. It made the walks to class bearable, especially in the winter, and it was a very open environment so everyone could hangout. The professors I had within my field of study were very professional and very willing to meet outside of class, especially during finals weeks. Monmouth is a small town, which means they do not have a ton of entertainment, but Galesburg and Macomb are a pretty close drive and there is more of a variety for things to do on the weekends."
Senior,4,"I'm in love with Monmouth. The small class sizes make closeness with your professors the rule and not the exception. They know and care about you as long as you make yourself worth caring about. The political science department has been an amazing home for me, and the small campus community has been the same."
Freshman,4,"The school is very good. The professors care a lot about their students and how well they do. It is a liberal arts college meaning that they focus on teaching the students the importance of learning multiple subjects rather than having expertise in only one area. The school has the Integrated Studies course that everyone is required to take. Freshmen take ""Introduction to Liberal Arts,"" sophomores take ""Global Perspectives,"" juniors take ""Reflections,"" and seniors take a course on ""Citizenship."" These courses help the students become aware of their communities and get them involved in helping to make the world a more welcoming and overall a better place. Because the school is in a very small town, it is not as diverse as other schools closer to the cities and big towns. However, everyone is welcoming and very helpful. They emphasize the importance of helping one another and the professors are excellent in helping their students achieve and reach their highest potential."
Freshman,4,"I am a currently a freshman at Monmouth College. I went to a small high school so this small college is just for me. The campus is extremely diverse and our class sizes are small which means more personal attention and help. The campus is beautiful, especially in the fall."
Sophomore,4,"I have just completed my freshman year at monmouth college and I've got to admit, it was pretty good. Being an international student, I didn't know what to expect when I got here. It was a new environment, new culture, new people and different beliefs. Fortunately, Monmouth College is a place I can think of as home because that's how I've been treated since i got here. The community is wonderful, beautiful campus and the faculty and the students are just great. There's a lot of thing to be involved in on campus, and all these groups are welcoming. The academic programs offered at the college are taught by professionals who strive to connect with their students in every way they could.
Also, the college is quite diverse, with a good number of latino and African American students, along with international students."
Niche User,4,"Monmouth College is a hidden gem in Illinois. As soon as one steps on campus, they fall in love with there surroundings. Maybe be it's the calm one feels in the campus' environment, or maybe it's the caring faculty members who makes this college so great. One can really envision themselves having an amazing time as a future student at Monmouth."
College Freshman,4,Great alumni network i hope to exploit
College Freshman,4,the campus is quite secure
College Freshman,4,The frats are really cool and not like the movies.
College Freshman,4,I have had a wonderful experience so far.
College Freshman,4,"The students and staff are so nice and are willing to assist you with anything if you ever need it.I would choose it again because I love the camaraderie and closeness of this school. Also, the teachers are very driven to make sure we succeed"
College Senior,4,"Housing is typically well done. The rule enforcement is a bit too much at times. It's a college environment - students should be allowed to party at will... like college students. If you're under 21, there's not much to enjoy. Most parents would be pleased about their party policies, students - nope. Otherwise, pretty cool."
College Senior,4,"Even though we are a D3 school, our athletics teams tend to excel in most areas. If anything, the only thing we ever lack is an adequate amount of members to participate for each event. Every now and then there is obvious favoritism from some select coaches. But for the most part it is fair.

As far as extracurricular clubs goes, there are plenty of them and many students are involved in at least one club whether it is purposefully or accidentally. They tend to be fun and beneficial to building skills."
College Senior,4,"From my experiences, Monmouth College is what you make it. It can be a great, uplifting, and nurturing experience or it can be a terrible, miserable, suffocating experience. I have encountered both ends of that spectrum. It is about the individual and whether or not they take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them.

I love Monmouth College. Looking back on my first few semesters, I wish that I would have cherished them."
College Sophomore,4,"Although sexual assault is a serious topic among all students, the topic has not come up often. Most students understand that sexual assault is a danger but I have never been adressed in a formal setting about protecting myself on campus or what to do."
College Sophomore,4,"I play on the Varsity Womens Golf team. I believe that the athletics that are offered on campus are plentyfull and the intramural sports on campus is a big way to be involved. Softball, Sand Vollyball, and Basketball intramurals are very popular on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I love the school that I attened. Personally the school can be too small at times but the overall atmosphere of the school is great. The students strive towards success and the professors openly show that they want to pass on their knowledge that they have gained to the students.
College Sophomore,4,Monmouth campus is very diverse. There are many different racial and ethnic groups on campus and I know of very few issues related to this. Monmouth has been very cooperative with the LGBTQ community as well. They are working together on various issues and members of the LGBTQ community are very accepted on campus.
College Senior,4,The success rate of graduating students from Monmouth is very high. It is common to form great relationships with faculty or visiting professors and knowing the right person or having a unique opportunity provided by Monmouth is responsible for many students landing jobs.
College Senior,4,I believe that you get out what you put in and Monmouth has given me great opportunities to find out what is right for me and help me flourish as a young adult.
College Senior,4,"I walk home late at night and I have never had an occasion where I was scared to be walking on campus. If I am nervous, Campus Security is willing to come pick you up and drive you home to assure that you are safe at night."
College Senior,4,Monmouth College gets a large number of community involvement which is great. The teams do well and are typically the place to be during a home event. Athletic events bring a majority of the campus together and are a great opportunity to show your school spirit.
College Senior,4,Monmouth College is an environment that has helped me to develop into a more well rounded person by encouraging my involvement in extra curricular activities and leadership roles while continuing to better my education.
College Junior,4,I am not aware of a lot of sexual assaults here on campus. The school does make sure that all students know the resources that are available if something does happen.
College Junior,4,"The dorms are pretty nice, even for the underclassman dorms. A really nice upperclassman dorm is Pattee hall"
College Freshman,4,"I have had a few more difficult classes in my time at school, it was a lot different from high school. The classes are interesting and not boring."
College Freshman,4,"I have had a few more difficult classes in my time at school, it was a lot different from high school. The classes are interesting and not boring."
College Freshman,4,"Everybody in my dorm seem to get along with minimal to no issues at all, which is great with a dorm full of girls. There's a kitchen in the dorm which is always accessible. The only bad part is the lack of air conditioning."
College Freshman,4,"Monmouth gets the students really involved with sports, there is almost always something going on at school."
College Freshman,4,"Overall my experience at school has been really great. I really enjoy my classes, and the teachers are willing to help you out. I love the small size of Monmouth College. I'd definitely pick it again."
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is very friendly and I feel like I belong.
College Freshman,4,Not only for athletes but non athletes too
College Freshman,4,The environment is really safe and secure.
College Freshman,4,There are a large number of courses to choose from and professors encourage you to select courses you enjoy.
College Freshman,4,There are great athletic opportunities especially the fitness complex
College Freshman,4,I enjoyed the experience so far because both the staff and students are friendly. It is my home away from home
Recent Alumnus,4,Montgomery College was the land of opportunity.
College Senior,4,"Monmouth College has the most beautiful campus I have ever encountered. Being covered with trees in the heart of the Midwest, the college goes from blossom filled spring to gloriously sunny summer to fiery autumn to a hilly winter wonderland, sometimes all in one month. The classes and campus is small enough that the professors genuinely know their students; sometimes even professors you've never had are aware of  you and your accomplishments. The band programs are run by the most dedicated and energetic man ever, Professor M. Wanken, and they wouldn't have gotten this far without him. Prof. Wanken is even taking the Winds Ensemble on a tour of Ireland next spring break. Dr. Bridget Draxler makes the Writing Center a home for both tutors and students seeking help alike. The offices of the English department, my department, are always open for advice, homework help, or just chatting about life in general. Monmouth has it's fair share of jerks and intolerance, but so does every school in every state. Some people are just not nice. Despite that, Monmouth College has been my home for the past 3 years and will continue to be so for a long time to come. It's great to be a Scot!"
College Freshman,4,It was nice and quiet. The food fits my taste and the people are compatible.
College Freshman,4,Do well in highschool and it pays off.
College Freshman,4,It's small. Everything is in walking distance. My dorm was small but It was livable.
College Freshman,4,"There is a wide variety of scholarships offered at this school. There are performing arts, scholarly, transfer, or fraternity scholarships with very generous amounts."
College Sophomore,4,"For a smaller town, Monmouth has quite a few options for food. Many of the places offer student discounts and many deliver right to campus. Most students tend to like the pizza restaurants in town but there are other options if you are willing to go out."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though the tuition is higher, financial aide is a great help at Monmouth College. Many students are able to fulfill their work study and all students are guaranteed an academic scholarship."
College Sophomore,4,"After visiting other colleges, Monmouth has much larger dorm rooms compared to many, the rooms have much larger closets and dressers. They are well kept and as usual get better as upperclassmen. The only downfall about Monmouth College dorms is that many underclassmen dorms are not air conditioned. The social atmosphere is great because everyone is required to live on campus all four years."
College Freshman,4,The school policies are pretty strict especially when it comes to academic honesty.
Alum,2,"Monmouth is small, rural, and extemely expensive for what it is. If you're an average student or an especially high achieving one, do not saddle yourself with years of debt to attend.

Overall, the professors are fine. The administration is less great, and ultimately, it is not a great environment for black students (or others of color) due to a variety of factors like location & rarely having faculty of color.

There are far more cost effective ways to earn your degree without saddling yourself with the debt you'll get from Monmouth.

I graduated from a public university three years after I left MC, immediately got a good job and worked my way through a great career. Staying at MC would have ruined me financially, and I'm glad I got away before it was too late.

There's nothing here you can't get somewhere else. Unless you are well-off, do not do this to yourself."
College Freshman,2,"The food has been undercooked, old, and lacks variety."
College Sophomore,2,"The college campus is the only attraction that the city of Monmouth has. The city is very small, and  hardly has any shops, sports/recreational activities , and events for the students."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is really bipolar there, and really hard to figure it out."
College Sophomore,2,"Hard traveling to class from class in the winter, many slip on ice."
College Sophomore,2,"There needs to be more variety. There is nothing but mashed potatoes and chicken. There needs to be more flavor in the food. Flex dollars do help, but it doesn't make up for the same food we have."
College Sophomore,2,There is not many places to go to that are walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"We have the same things everyday, we don't have as much vegetables and fruits."
College Senior,2,"We get a lot of snow and freezing weather, and rarely get classes cancelled"
College Sophomore,2,I think that we should be able to have a clinic on campus for students.
College Senior,2,"There are only a handfull of fast food options off campus, and if you are a vegetarian or a health nut, then you are out of luck!"
College Sophomore,2,"Cost is fine but finding a space is horrible, and sometimes the tickets do not make sense."
College Senior,2,"It's mostly fast food restaurants like McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"I think that the school or even the town should have shuttles working more often, since the school shuttle works particular days and doesn't work for everyone."
College Junior,2,Main fast food restaurants. A few local favorites. 
College Freshman,2,The wifi is slow and often does not work. 
College Freshman,2,"The opposite sex is nothing extraordinarily special here.  There are some good-looking girls, and I guess girls think some of the guys are good-looking.  The guys usually aren't nearly as intelligent as the girls on campus, though.  Both sexes are fun to hang around with."
College Freshman,2,"When it comes to parties, there are indeed a lot of parties, the only problem is that they are rarely enjoyable, you have people using Pandora as a DJ which is fine until you hear the commercials and kill he party vibe. Others have many people but the music choice is the same and barely change genres for everyone to enjoy. You also have just sessions of people drinking and playing beer pong and still call it a ""party"", on other weekends you just hear yelling and screaming from sororities and fraternities and plenty of drunk students who are quite rude and loud when trying to head back into their dorms."
College Senior,2,"There used to be a nightclub college and high school students could attend but it's no longer there. So, unless someone throws a party at the frat houses or in their dorm room the nighlife is pretty dull."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a free shuttle that takes students around the town to shop. But, its only available when most people are in classes, and only one shuttle runs so it gets crowded pretty quickly. There is one shuttle to Galesburg on the weekend, but its also one shuttle and gets filled up pretty quickly. If you can afford it, bring a car or buddy up with a driver."
Senior,1,"Monmouth did a terrible job with online learning during the 2020 Fall semester. Professors and higher up staff did not have any regard for student mental health  or well-being, only assignments and grades. They were trying to force students living on campus to attend in person classes rather than joining via Zoom when over half of the campus was engaging in unsafe and reckless behavior during a pandemic, putting the entire student body at risk for exposure to Covid-19. Even in the middle of a pandemic and one of the most stressful elections of all time, professors only seemed to care about submitting work on time and going to class. There are a couple good professors here that really do care about students, but sadly that number is heavily outweighed by the ones that don't."
Senior,1,"If I could give Monmouth 0 stars, I would. This campus is led by racist staff members who do not care one ounce about students of color and LGBT students. They only care about their athletes and their image. The diversity and inclusion board is only there to save face and doesn't actually do anything to help minority students. Not to mention Monmouth does absolutely nothing to combat the very prevalent sexual assault issues on campus. Even when under pressure by alums and current students, their response to these injustices is dismal, to say the least. I have wasted 4.5 years and thousands of dollars for what I can only imagine to be one of the worst college experiences possible. If you are thinking of going here, let me save you the trouble. DON'T."
Junior,1,The school has lots of students who are racist. There is not one professor of color on the whole campus. The wifi goes down every other day and hinders me from doing my work. Our coaches are the worst coaches I have ever had in my life. The water tastes weird and does not even get hot. There is no school spirit. Campus safety harasses students of color. I pay too much money. I have gotten sick from the food multiple times.
College Sophomore,1,Monmouth has next to no nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,Most students live on campus or at home in town.
College Senior,1,There is not a lot of diversity. The college needs to work on that.
College Freshman,1,Your are in the middle of no where. I mean that will all my heart.
College Junior,1,Monmouth is a college town. The majority of student here live on campus.
College Junior,1,"For students who need to use their vehicles every day either for student teaching, job, or an internship parking can be a nightmare. If you have a tight schedule and need to park close to your building prepare to receive parking tickets. If you do not use your car often than there is a large lot off campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,They overbook their parking lots.  As a senior I had to walk 3 blocks from an off campus parking lot to my dorm each day (I had an off campus job) because there weren't enough spaces.
College Freshman,1,Not like true greek life at all..each sority/fraterniy is made up on campus and do not resemble the characteeistics of true greeks at all
College Junior,1,"My mother works two full time jobs, and I work three part time jobs, and we still struggle to pay for Monmouth College. My mother got her second job to help pay for my tuition, but since she got a second job, the FAFSA said that we would afford more, which doubled how much money we have to pay out of pocket, and if I do not find enough out of school scholarships, I will not be able to attend in the fall."
College Senior,1,There is never anywhere to park. Students have three full lots to park in but these spots are always taken. It is a huge hassle to find parking.
College Freshman,1,"Very Limited – Unlike bigger campuses, we only have one cafeteria, so our dining options are very limited.  They're good quality, but it gets very repetitive if you want to eat on your meal plan all of the time."
College Freshman,1,there is not a lot of parking areas on campus. there are lots that are blocks away from campus and can be inconvenient to walk from at night and in the cold or rain.

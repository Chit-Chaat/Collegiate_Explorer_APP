Freshman,5,At the beginning my online college classes  was nightmare. But after I got help from academic support center and writing center college life became easy and fun.
Freshman,5,"I am a student of Daytona State college. English is my 2nd language. Language problem is a huge problem anyone who speak 2nd language people only understand. At the beginning  I had huge problem . I wanted to quit. Then I talk with my counselor . She advise me to get help from Writing center tutor and communicate with my professor. Life became very easy after that . I think  professors here are very nice,  kind and helpful . All tutors from writing centers are also very helpful too. Now I don't want quit anymore . just want to continue but need assistance."

Freshman,5,"I loved Daytona State online! It was so convient and I felt like I actually learned better than in person. I have extreme anxiety so I didn't want to go to in person classes, and DSC made that easy for me. The professors are always there to help, and answer pretty quickly. They aren't like your normal, lousy high school teachers, they actually care about you and make sure you succeed! I highly recommend DSC Online"
Freshman,5,"I haven't taken any online courses with Daytona State. Although, the Quanta-Honors program mainly works on electronics. The program uses laptops and tablets and also provides desktops in their classroom."
Freshman,5,What I like about Daytona State College is their honors program that they offer. Quanta-Honors offers an alternative learning environment compared to your normal college classes. Quanta gives you the opportunity to learn different corses by integrating them into one lecture. They also allow you to work in groups. Quanta also provides their own tutors and librarians to help with your assignments.
Niche User,5,I had an amazing experience with Daytona State enrollment processes and faculty and staff encounters. The Daytona State website is very informative and helpful in completing the enrollment process. Many of the faculty are quick with their emailed responses to the many questions I have had. I feel like I can ask as many questions as I deem necessary and they will always have the best and most helpful responses. I am very satisfied with my experience with Daytona State and I can't wait to finish embarking on my college journey and lifelong experiences.

Niche User,5,"I've only taken classes online so far and they have been great. I really recommend if you have a full schedule, they are easy to access and the layout is easy to understand."
Sophomore,5,I'm in dual enrollment at the Flagler campus. It's nice that I have the ability to be in college and  high school at the same time.
Sophomore,5,It is super easy to turn in assignments and communicate with teachers. There is a specific area for only college related emails which is also nice.
Sophomore,5,"I took six classes online, both were as easy to complete as non-online classes. Some classes are very slow, easy, and uncompetitive. The environment and educational style is more adapted to people who have jobs and want to pursue studies at the same time. Most professors are very qualified."
Junior,5,"They are always looking out for you no matter what. There are multiple campuses in order to fit your schedule between work and personal life. There’s online classes, night classes. The advisors are looking out for you and helping you in which direction you need to go for your future and goals."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love Daytona state!! They make this super easy and fun!! It’s affordable and convenient because they have other locations not just in Daytona.

Sophomore,5,"I really like the teachers and career programs available at the college. I have access to tutoring and financial aid, plus student discounts."

Freshman,5,"I love this school! they help you out a lot and everything about this college is great. They have a lot of awesome programs, very diverse, and their TRiO program is the best"
Junior,5,"Daytona State is super easy to have an affordable education on your own time. You have the flexible option of taking courses online, hybrid or on campus. There is a campus locally in Palm Coast I go to that makes it much easier than driving the thirty minutes to the Daytona campus. :)"
Sophomore,5,i love how this place is very clean and i love the food here. it is fun to be around the school area because it is very beautiful.
Junior,5,"Daytona State college is a phenomenal college for its size and capabilities. Personally, I was a Duel-enrolled High school student attending Daytona State receiving my AA degree. Daytona state offers tutoring, clubs, athletics, job fairs, cultural days, and much more. Great teachers and great way to teach the content..."
Sophomore,5,"I am 59 returning at I loved it. The academic center helped me so much. The campus was within 6 miles of my home, it was a small campus beautiful very safe. Daytona State does not have any dorms that is the only reason I gave it a low score."
Sophomore,5,Daytona State is a very welcoming campus and the staff is there to ensure your individual success. I had visited a few other colleges prior to Daytona State but none had an environment as friendly as here. Our professors work with us and are always available to an questions or concerns we have as well as are very flexible to meet in their offices at a different time for additional help.
Freshman,5,"What I enjoy about Daytona State College is the willingness of the instructors to go out of the way for students. Regardless of the situation, professors are willing to talk with students to accommodate to their needs."
Freshman,5,"The instructors are very professional and caring. All the students and stuff are so kind and sociable, I never felt isolated in this college. The college is so clean and amazing. Admissions are always here to help and they would provide you with the best information to understand what courses you should take, they can even assist you in your schedule for the coming semester. This college is always here to provide help to you from any kind like writing, financial aid, housing. They even provide care for men and women who study in college and do not have a place to live or clothes to wear."
Niche User,5,My professors were excellent and the campus is really nice. All the faculty I spoke to were very friendly.
Freshman,5,"My experience so far with Daytona State College has been a very positive one. Whether it came to contacting teachers for questions about assignments. Walking into the students academic center for general questions, everyone was very helpful and pleasant.  I am glad to be able to continue furthering my academic career with Daytona State College."
Senior,5,So far so good. Only thing needs to change is financial aid office. They need more staff in order to put your paperwork in a timely manner.
Sophomore,5,"I love Daytona State College. It's affordable, and my professors are amazing! I'm able to connect with people who are like me, which makes for a great social atmosphere, and classes are smaller, which makes learning much easier as there is more time to ask questions. One of the things that I would like to see improved would be the schedule flexibility for the satellite campuses. Not all of the courses are offered at the satellite campuses, which is understandable, but I'd like to see more options."
Sophomore,5,I love that Daytona State has some of the best professors. I'm not a huge fan of the Daytona area however.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed how friendly all the staff members are and how helpful they are - it shows that they really do care about everyone's education and wants the best for them and their wants for education.
Freshman,5,"The campus is close to home so for me that's essential. The staff were incredibly nice to me and my family. The campus itself has a family environment and makes others feel welcome. My experience with this school has been wonderful and I hope that others feel the same. The campus is also in a strategic location between the two high schools in the county, so there's a lot of diversity of students there."
Junior,5,I love Daytona state because of the atmosphere. Anyone of any age can attend any class which brings diversity to the school. They have great programs for veterans and great professors who have worked at big universities and can provide university style teaching. The academic advisors have all been helpful in directing me down the path I need to go to receive my RN degree to get my dream job!
Freshman,5,Daytona State college is a great college! With its smaller class sizes you are able to create a bond with your class mates and your professor  to make your college classes a better experience and a healthier learning environment! The one thing i would change is I wish they had more sports and more sports clubs at every DSC campus. Other than that DSC is a great starting point for college to get you comfortable with the new environment!
Sophomore,5,"The school has grown considerably over the years, encompassing more and more options for advanced education."
Sophomore,5,"I love the school, I have had all around good professors and have made many friends in all of my classes."
Junior,5,I like the environment and the teachers here! The campus is very nice and there is always security. Parking is a little crowded at times but overall the school is very nice.
Sophomore,5,"I think Daytona State College provides a great opportunity for those first starting college or even coming back to do more!  There are many degrees offered, and DSC has many resources easily available for every student.    DSC also has an excellent selection of electives as well as clubs."
Sophomore,5,The administrators are very helpful and make time to answer any and all questions.  The professor are not only knowledgeable but concerned about their students well being.  I like the fact that the college has a more personable atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,Daytona State College is a great place to start off at for your first 2 years! The professors are very nice and knowledgeable. They also offer to help you during their office hours if you need any extra help. The faculty and staff are very kind and welcoming.
Niche User,5,So far through the TRIO program i can see that Daytona State is a perfect fit for many. They offer many opportunities for people.
Senior,5,DSC is a great school! The faculty and administrators are Amazing! They have so many great programs and are always eager to help! I had a great experience at Daytona State College!
Niche User,5,I really like the campus and the overall atmosphere present there. It feels like I am right at home. The staff and professors there make you feel comfortable.
Sophomore,5,I have been enrolled in Daytona State College for 3 semesters and now got accepted into their nursing program. I really enjoy this school and I like how they handle all of their student accounts. They are always friendly and willing to help me whenever I have a question or concern. The teachers are great and so caring- they always go the extra mile for me and I have yet to have a bad experience with anyone. They are currently  expanding on their campus by constructing a huge building dedicated to their students and furthering their career and helping them achieve their goals. The only thing I would change is that they went directly for Bachelors as opposed to earning an associates and then continuing to a Bachelors. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!
Sophomore,5,"the college really cares about its students. there are three campus one in deltona, daytona beach is the main campus, and another in deland"
Freshman,5,The campus is small but beautiful and easy to navigate.  The resources that are offered are fantastic and very useful.
Junior,5,"This is my first semester at Daytona State.  I received my AA in 1984, so this is a big step for me.  The counselors and staff at the Deltona Campus have been helpful and encouraging."
Sophomore,5,I have been attending Daytona State College for almost a year and the staff has really helped me transition out of the Marine Corps and into student life.
Freshman,5,So far I love Daytona State College! You meet new people everyday. The professors are nice and cool. The students are fun. Campus is safe always clean and a Starbucks in one of the buildings so I’m loving that. I diversity here is good you see every race around campus. There is housing all around the city you just have to find it.
Freshman,5,"Daytona state college is a great place for opportunity for all varies of life. Where ever you come from its not a problem. We have a state of the art library that is composed of 4 single rooms for individual study for students. A upstairs and downstairs full of computers with printers to use. A writing center even with a room to study also. Daytona state college has a lot of different places where students can study  without noise. We have a lunchroom that's open to everyone.Teachers are always there to help after class.They have a wide range of extra activities you can do after school such as flag football, SGA , etc. We always have a different activity going on every Wednesday that's open to all."
Freshman,5,"They’re very helpful when it comes to being a first time college student, but I feel like the academic advisor went through things way too quickly and I wasn’t able to fully understand what classes I need."
Sophomore,4,"welcoming environment, great staff, helpful and supportive professors.  No long wait lines for help such as financial aid office or academic support."
Sophomore,4,"Awesome school, the staff is great and the professors want you succeeded. I am a mom of four an I have been working toward my AA for, going on my third year. I will be graduating this spring.  The professors really worked with me and helped me with any issues I had. I did mostly online courses. However, the few classes I did take on campus were great. The professors made it so fun to be there and the other students made it fun as well. I have multiple different campuses to chose from which really works with my schedule for the class i do have to take on campus. I have had no long wait periods when trying to see any services, such as academic support or financial aid. I did not think I would be able to get this far and do this well. Thank you Daytona State College for helping me live my dream."
Freshman,4,"Very happy with Daytona State College!
They seem to really care about their students and how they're doing. Like all schools, not every teacher is going to be amazing, I've had one bad run in with a professor at DSC but otherwise I enjoyed them and felt they helped me succeed. I chose Daytona State over a University (UF) because I wanted to be close to home, I was scared I would regret it but it was the best descion I've ever made. Small classes, close to home, and so much more affordable."
Sophomore,4,The online experience with Daytona was good. I feel like most of the professors should educate themselves on how to use technology better. Other than that it was good.
Junior,4,"Depending on the professor you get, learning online can either be an amazing or a horrible experience."
Junior,4,I started at this college when I was 15 on the Deltona campus. The people there were nice and receptive of my opinions. My favorite place to spend my time doing homework was the Academic Support Center because you could have normal conversations with other students and the staff while you worked on homework.
Niche User,4,"I'm a duel-enrolled student and I find it great. As far as I've seen the professors and advisors are great and very helpful. It's a great community college, especially with its many campus locations."
Niche User,4,Taking classes online with Daytona State was easy to use and efficient. Was able to get my assignments done and take exams without difficulty.
Freshman,4,"Daytona state is a great first college to go too. It is very relax, but its not bummy. The professors are very good, and its like going to your old highschool again the way everyone knows each other. I would like to see the camous more developed, because if we had more resources, and activities to do around campus, it would make it a more attractive school."
Sophomore,4,"Daytona State College is a very good school. The professors I have had have all been very good. I have had access to the professors whether it be office hours, after class time, or via cellphone. I would change is that I would add on campus housing."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed all of my classes! I took some classes in person and online and never had a problem. All of my teachers were great and super helpful.
Graduate Student,4,Daytona State is a great school with many resources to help you exceed.  They offer many great programs and classes for an affordable price.
Sophomore,4,My favorite thing about Daytona was the location and class schedules.  The classes were very flexible and were easy to meet.  I also like the location which was a nice safe drive down interstate 95.  The science professors were very knowledgeable and talented.  The flexible schedules allowed me to work at my current job full time and still be able to get at 4.0
Graduate Student,4,"I was able to Duel Enroll into Daytona State College in my Senior year of High School and Flagler Palm Coast High School. It has multiple campuses and one in Palm Coast which is closer to where I live. The main campus isn't too far from my home, but I do need to leave early due to traffic."
Sophomore,4,"While attending high school, I had a very pleasant experience with Daytona State trying to work towards earning my associates degree. I never faced any issues with the faculty or staff. Everyone was super helpful and there to answer all of my questions."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the small classroom sizes and I found that a majority of my professors were likable people. They were all pretty well organized and the college offers plenty of resources outside of the classroom. I attended the Flagler campus where there were never any parking issues and the campus was clean. At times, the academic advising department can get backed up, but when I registered for classes early, there was never anyone waiting in front of me."
Junior,4,the class sizes are very good. the professors take the time to teach and explain the materials very well.
Sophomore,4,Lots of diversity but needs move engagement! Needs more better active team to revamp the student life and spot team and games!
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year at Daytona State and I have seen the great opportunities and amazing benefits that they offer. Their library is amazing the available research materials is life-saving.  They just put in a student center which has been a great help for study groups and online school. However, the new updates to this year's admissions process was ridiculous! I got dropped out of my Fall semester class three times not because of lack of payment but because of the system's bugs. It took a lot of time and planning to be in my classes this semester. Not only that it is not easily accessible to students."
Freshman,4,"DSC has so much to offer for a college student including a beautiful campus, friendly teachers and students, helpful staff, etc. The campus is super safe and always manicured to look stunning. The teachers and students are super friendly which is nice especially if you're new to the area a friendly face can be rare. The college is super diverse and has a lot to offer. I would recommend Daytona State College to anyone who is having a problem choosing a school and wants an intimate yet independent school."
Freshman,4,College is very affordable and classes are very accessible to all. Love my college experience here and all the amenities. The new student center is amazing.
Graduate Student,4,My experience so far has been great with them. There have been a couple of challenges here and there but they were little things like financial aid questions or little details forgotten. The teachers I have had were all great and offered all the help they could.
Junior,4,"Daytona State College is overall a very well-rounded college. The professors are dedicated to teaching and know the material well. However the classes, especially online classes, are a bit too easy.  As I am a dual enrolled student there and I am only working towards my AA, I haven't taken many courses which go towards a career. I will say though that the Anatomy course I took there (part online, part in class lecture) I felt allowed too much slack for potential nursing students who needed that need course to be rigorous since they are working towards a specialized career field. However, DSC's classes are perfect for general education courses. DSC also offers a nursing school, which is very popular and I have heard does provide a good return on investment. The campus is beautiful and features a modern design. It is located in a lively city and is near all kinds of stores and even a shopping mall. Suburban neighborhoods are also right around the corner."
Freshman,4,"I spent my first year of college at Daytona State, and I had a great time. Most of the teachers are very good at their jobs and are dedicated in helping their students succeed. The new constructions turned out well, and Daytona State is continuing to update their campus for the better."
Freshman,4,"All staff and instructors are easy to work with. They guide me in correct directions needed to succeed, never manage to find myself struggling with communication between them as well. Campus is always clean, free meals are provided to those who need it. Long time friends are made here."
Freshman,4,My experience with Daytona State College has been a very friendly one with staff that is kind and other students that are helpful
Freshman,4,I like the teachers I’ve had and learning about different subjects. I think they could approve upon their student life and cafe food.
Graduate Student,4,I had the opportunity to dual enroll  at Daytona State College for 2 years while i was still in high school! Everybody was always so helpful and friendly at all of the locations! The staff is very welcoming and always ready to give great advice. I loved all of my professors but my favorite was definitely Professor  Whitaker when I took my World Geography class with him!
Freshman,4,I enjoy the atmosphere and how polite the people are. The employees are kind and welcoming. I am able to go up to them in confidence and get help from guidance.
Sophomore,4,Excellent school. Appropriate for all ages. Only problem is a couple specific teachers that definitely shouldn't be teaching. But the school is great and would reccomend anyone to go there.
Freshman,4,It is a public school. One of the best things that I like about is is that it is close to my house. Because it is close to my house it saves me money from dorm and travel costs. Other than that it is a baseline for finding you career and getting pre requisites for what other colleges may require. Great learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"I went to Daytona State College as a Dual Enrolled Student, and it was one of the greatest experience I had compared to high school. The professors care about you and your well being, as well as your education. The social life in and around the campus is lively with many kind individuals spread across the campus. The cost is one of the lowest in the state, allowing you to use it as a jumping off point for your potential major."
Freshman,4,Its a great school if you want to get your start in education. They offer a wide variety of classes and offer a transfer program if you want to get a more specific degree at UCF.
Sophomore,4,"The clubs are great, most of the teachers actually care about their students and there is general will to help others succeed."
Sophomore,4,Daytona State College provided me with great opportunities as a dual enrollment student. Without dual enrollment I wouldn't be graduating with my A.A. degree. This degree has allowed me to get two years ahead and a real jump start on my education.
Sophomore,4,"Student activity has grown over the years and I've been able to participate in more extracurricular activities within the college, making my experience here at the institution much more meaningful. Professors are usually very helpful and care about their students, along with other staff and faculty at the college, such as tutors, learning specialists, guidance counselors, and academic advisors."
Sophomore,4,"Daytona State College is a great school with faculty dedicated to student success. I have been a student for approximately 2 years and have had little issues when it comes to my courses and professors. However, I have had multiple issues with admissions and generally getting my student account to the appropriate status. Nonetheless, DSC is a good starting place for any academic career."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are preaty engaging and try to help the students as much as they can. The school is pretty affordable which is a plus. I can't say that it give the college experience but if its the degree tou want then its the perfect school for you.
Sophomore,4,Daytona State College is great for me so far!! I’m new to the school and the area and I have had nothing but a great experience. It is a very  big school with several campuses and a lot of programs. I have dealt with the academic advisors more than other staff up to this point and they are very helpful!!
Sophomore,4,"Daytona state needs better campus security. Pretty much anyone can drive onto campus and walk into any building they’d like. Also, the advising office needs better time management because some students have up to 3 hours wait to see advisors. The professors are great and I love paying low tuition"
Freshman,4,"Over the years this campus has started to have more of a ""University"" feel to it. They offer large amounts of clubs/activities, and they have a variety of programs."
Sophomore,4,I love the Daytona state campus because it is so close to home. The staff is very welcoming and the teachers are great. They're teaching techniques really helped me utilize the material . The courses that I have taken so far have been fun and educating. while I've attended Daytona state I've met a lot of great bright people who share the interests as I do. Im looking forward to the rest of my journey here at the Daytona state campus.
Senior,4,"I like the friendly attitude of the academic staff and their effort to help the students accomplish their goal. 
What I dislike is the lack of communication between the Financial Aid, Students Accounts, and the rest of departments."
Sophomore,4,Daytona State College was a great start to my college experience because it was close to home and fairly inexpensive. The advising staff could be improved but I enjoyed almost every professor I chose.
Freshman,4,"Started Daytona State College as dual enrolled student in high school.  I will continue for my AA and may transfer at that time.  It is a small school, good classes, very good teachers.  There is not any campus life as there are no dorms.  A lot of the classes are only offered on line which is nice, but classroom options would be better."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are very helpful and are easy to get in touch with. No one is rude in the office and everyone seems to enjoy their jobs and are determined to help you with any and all of your problems and/or concerns. There are security guards that make sure everyone is where they are supposed to be, which makes the school feel safe. There are also tutors available everyday in the morning to early night that will help you with homework; which does make it very convenient for working adults."
Niche User,4,"Not bad for a state college.... my wife went here for nursing and she loved it! She said that it was very student orentated and there was always a ton of resources to help you. Also, the professors were mostly very friendly and helpful.  Not to mention the cost of tuition here is great!"
Sophomore,4,"Daytona State is  great community college for those seeking higher education at any age or stage life. I've been back after a couple life events prevented me from finishing and the transition back into college life has always been smooth and easy. The lasses are challenging enough without being overwhelming and the facilities and services provided by the college are all very helpful. The online systems used to sign up for classes and search programs and courses could use some tweaking. I sometimes have trouble with pages or information loading or simply finding the information I need, resorting to just calling the school or showing up in person. Other than that it's a great, affordable school for people in all walks of life!"
Sophomore,4,Great school for someone who is looking to get their AA and transfer. The direct connect to UCF is a wonderful asset to have. Professors are really helpful and caring in every class I've taken.
Sophomore,4,"Very well-maintained community college with convenient smaller campuses for those who cannot reach the main campus. Very friendly and happy staff who treat you kindly if you do the same. The campus is clean and organized, and from my experience at the Flagler/Palm Coast campus, you will be well-managed so long as you keep in touch with counselors. There is also the advantage of grade forgiveness, where if you fail a course and retake it, the grade is overwritten in your transcript. Not every college offers this, especially not many universities.

Only problem I've encountered is that the website itself has some issues with consistency in its layout and is rather buggy on both desktop and mobile, and that the instruction videos for it are outdated now. And that on the smaller campuses, not all the classes on the main campus are offered, but that's kind of to be expected."
Freshman,4,"My first thoughts before starting at Daytona State where not that good. On a scale one to five, it would be a one meaning not good. The first day, I was lost but everyone was very nice, the professors are very kind and will give you everything you need to know before getting started. If I were to rate it again I would rate it a four. Plus, it has a beautiful campus very clean!"
Niche User,4,"Very involved teachers who care about your success, almost every student really is working to succeed. The range and amount of courses they offer at low prices, and free in some cases, are amazing and really help out several students."
Junior,4,"The professor are very helpful in their student success. The professor works side by side to help student understand the course and achieve their goals. If students do their best and study hard, it'll all pay off in the end."
Freshman,4,"Daytona state college is a community college. Even though it is a community college, the academics are very good. The teachers are very good at teaching and explaining topics. When you are struggling with an assignment, teachers are there to explain and help you understand. For counselors, if you have any questions they will be answered."
Sophomore,4,I like how the class sizes aren't too big. It helps me focus on the professor more and it isn't as hard to get help if I need it.
Sophomore,4,"Great campus, tons of programs and buildings for any educational needs. Very helpful staff but it's easy to get lost."
Niche User,4,"The professors are amazing, the workload is lenient for those who work daily, and I really love how there's free tutors to access to. The one minor thing I didn't like is that I'm taking Calculus 3 next semester and there is only one class which is located in Daytona Beach, so I have to drive for over half an hour to go to class everyday. Other than that, this is a very great school for those who want to earn a Bachelor's."
Sophomore,4,"I would love if the Palm Coast campus was updated. The buildings are very old and it's not very technologically advanced. Tuition is good, so I can't really complain too much."
Sophomore,4,"I been going to Daytona state for about 2 years now. I currently switched my major from Nursing to Radiology. The campus is always clean I love love love the food. Specifically their breakfast! At great prices also. The teachers and staff here are very helpful everybody wants you to succeed. Daytona State is a very friendly environment, I enjoy being here everyday!"
Freshman,4,"Daytona state college has enabled me to do a lot of things. Though dealing with financial aid can be frustrating and take awhile, I have a few professors that I feel they truly care and take the time to help you out along with being very good at teaching you the subjects they are experts in. keep in mid college is what YOU make it, so their are plenty of clubs at DSC, stay involved!"
Niche User,2,"They placed a hold on my account the entire semester which prevented me from starting my Nurse Practitioner program on time. My student loans were in place, there was no reason for it. I called 5 times during the semester and they kept telling me to give it time."
Niche User,2,"Advisors had no idea what they were doing, I was advised to sign up for course that I later found I didn’t have prereqs for, of course after the withdrawal dates which ruined my GPA, most professors didn’t seem to care at all about my needs, though there were a few exceptions. Campuses were decent, but there wasn’t a lot a student involvement focused activities. I felt like they just wanted my money and didn’t care if I got much out of it, or if I was cared for and guided in the right direction."
Alum,2,"Daytona state is cheap like a state college should be. However most the offices (Advisors, registration, etc) are not helpful. They give you the run and tell you to go to multiple places when in the long run you will end up back in the first office you started in and have to go through it all again. Most classes are online so if you need face to face interaction you are out of luck. Teachers also do not know how to teach and most teach directly from the dry textbooks."
College Sophomore,2,teachers lack communication and don't get back to you
College Sophomore,2,"The layout of the online courses is bad.  I hated taking online courses, but math was the worst.  If you are a visual learner or aren't good at math, do it in person.  The online math class don't teach you anything.  You have to teach yourself and I am not good at teaching myself math."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not happy with the quality of the education here.
College Junior,2,I can only take evening classes and I have no babysitter
College Junior,2,it wasn't made clear to me that I would be paying all of my tuition my loan
Recent Alumnus,2,"I should have been credited with more, because the other school was in a certain group/club 

it only gave me some of the credits, it was wrong......"
College Senior,2,I only give this review because I started my academic career as an out of state student and when my residency kicked in I was not able to transfer to in state so I am still having to pay out of state tuition and that gets expensive. Luckily I do receive financial aid!
College Freshman,2,"I have had bad luck with financial aid process, I have trouble understanding the ladies at my campus as well"
College Junior,2,"Our clinicals are typically 20-30 miles from campus, we never know which campus we will be at the next semester (makes housing plans hard), and financial aid has been a nightmare. I must file my FAFSA as dependent because I am not married, 24 years old, or a parent, yet I receive no financial assistance from anyone other than myself. I file my own taxes, work a full time job, and support myself 100%"
College Junior,2,"In most cases the actual resources for students are only used if they need help, and most times help is always needed."
College Senior,2,Transferring credits are a breeze however I wish there are more classroom classes than online classes.
College Freshman,2,It is a small community college in Daytona so I do not think anyone really expects much. Going to Daytona State destroys all motivation and it makes me seriously depressed. None of the students really care about learning. I plan on transferring as soon as possible
College Senior,2,"The academic advisers are okay. But my school doesn't have a high graduation rate, most of my alumni are students taking this to experience college and get their prerequisite courses finished in order to transfer to a bigger University, Or older adults refreshing their degrees for work or needing a degree to keep their job. "
College Junior,2,"The students are hoodlums at this school. They are very loud, rude, disrespectful and dumb."
College Junior,2,There are a lot of hoodlums here.
College Junior,2,Most of the professors in the gen-ed courses are HORRIBLE.
College Junior,2,It is hard to stay focused.
College Sophomore,2,I wish that my classes were offered in the mornings.
College Sophomore,2,I would like to see more available scholarships to single parents.
College Junior,2,"Supposedly there are many offerings at this school, however, nothing is advertised by teachers or counselors.  Unless you actively search through their cumbersome and messy webpage, you will not find much."
College Junior,2,I rated this school as a C because it is average at best. The courses focus on the simplest concepts of the subject matter and are focused on passing the students with or without comprehensive knowledge. The advising department is sub par in helping any student with their education path and financial aide support is not existent even through there is a department for it. It is only worth taking core classes here prior to transferring to a full scale university that has outlined what classes you need for your degree choice.
College Freshman,2,"The tuition itself is VERY well priced, but the financial aid office itself works at a snail's pace. I submitted things in June and it took them until the Friday before class started in August to get ahold of me to make me aware of an issue. There will always be a 15+ minute wait on the phone as well as an hour wait in the office. Nothing will ever be fully correct the first time, and you need to make the effort to get in touch because they will surely not be calling you. This is the worst part of the schooling process."
College Junior,2,Sometimes professors can be difficult and not explain an assignment clearly. If the instructor doesn't come across helpful this gets passed on to the students and sometimes that is not good.
College Senior,2,"I'm not really sure how I feel about the Tuition and Financial Aid at Daytona State College. When I first started going to school I thought it was great and they gave me the right amount that I needed but it seems as if the rules have changed and I don't really get the right amount that I need. It also depends what campus I go to. If I go to the Daytona campus than they are really helpful and know what they are talking about but if I go to the Palm Coast campus which is closer to me, they are not so helpful and don't really seem to know what they are doing or talking about."
College Junior,2,Its doesn't feel like there is a student body during the summer and that sucks condisering they offer fall . spring and summer courses and due to the fact that many kids start in a summer class im sad that some of hr normal things arnt there
College Freshman,2,"The professors at this school are usually very kind and know their subjects well, but I've found that there are very few of them who seek to challenge their students in useful ways. Much of the work is dull and overly easy. The class registration process is easy, with the exception of the painfully slow network and the fact that it may lie about class openings. The online classes are very simply to navigate, and most of them use a lock-down browser in a poor attempt to keep students from cheating."
College Senior,2,"The tuition is simply more than I can afford but the financial aid was able to cover it. However, the financial aid rules and regulations change every year so that the financial aid offices have trouble remembering and understanding them, let alone explain them."
College Senior,2,"The student body is pretty diverse. However, there are many rude students, students who could care less, and there is not much communication between students. There is not usually any sort of judging going on in the classrooms though."
College Sophomore,2,"I have only met a few students that even talked to me in class. At DSC, it's hard to become friends with people, they all seem to keep to themselves and don't want to communicate with others well."
College Senior,2,"The professors there seem to be there to get paid, and don't seem to care about your overall performance in the class."
College Junior,2,"Overall, this college did not help me with where I had to go academically and pretty much gave me the typical 'run around' as usual ."
College Sophomore,2,There are no concrete dates available for the current or upcoming semester so you cannot plan ahead in regards to how much funding you will get for your expenses.
College Senior,2,Most of the people are great. However since it is an open campus and anyone can get in you do tend to meet some weirdos. There are about 7:1 women to men ratio. So it's really a school in which you come to just do what you gotta do and move on. I wouldn't bury any roots.
College Freshman,2,"These two departments can use some help and organization, they seem to not enjoy communication contacting like through the phone or in person. Most people in the office are there to just get a paycheck and not really guide you in the right direction. They give you paperwork (not explaining it thoroughly) then send you on your way."
College Sophomore,2,Takes too long to process so that i am consistently worried about whether or not everything has gone through. But they are immediate with disciplinary action regardless of the outcome or even if the student has not been notifies yet.
College Student,2,"Daytona State College does not have many resources. It is hard to get on to there website to review there information and books, the book store at the main campus is nice but very slow, and the book stores at the smaller campuses do not have as many items as they should."
College Junior,2,Don't Seem to Care – A lot of the 17-20 year old students seem to be floating along and would not be in school if their parents weren't pushing them. The class participants and real go getters seem to be the working people who want to try to get an education to help them get ahead.
College Sophomore,2,I don't like how when you sign up for classes they expect you to fork up thousands of dollars within a week like money grows on trees.
College Senior,2,I'll Be Honest – Who keeps track?  Why would we need to know?  Is it so important that our very lives depend on knowing every little bit of information?  I could careless.
College Senior,2,"Dull and More Dull – The only way you're going to have any social interaction with anyone is if you join a club, get to know your classmates/teachers, or having a group of friends that go there."
College Senior,2,"Spread Very Thin – Considering how many branches of this school there are, the only way to get everything there is to offer is to be at the main campus.  There is a second library at a different location and offices for the obvious student needs, but many of those second branches are bland and dull having almost to next to nothing.  It has almost everything, only if you look for it."
College Senior,2,"They Don't Really Care – This place is very dull. There might be events happening, but very few people go to them because they aren't advertised well. There are old TVs everywhere that just sit there collecting dust, never on, and the only real commons is the cafeteria.  Other then that, this school is pretty average."
College Sophomore,2,Job Prospects – My school is mainly a two year school just to obtain your AA. They dont offer you jobs after or help you find any. It's very hard to get couselors to lead you in the right direction after graduating.
College Sophomore,2,"Class Registration Each Semester – For the first day of registration each semester, the websites to the college are always slow. By the time you get to the registration page the classes you wanted to sign up for are full. The school is over crowded."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited Diversity – Daytona State has some diversity; however, overall the college isn't a hub for students coming from all over the country or world. I would suspect that most universities have more diversity as a high amount of students are travelling to dorm or live there. However DSC is more of a college for the locals, and therefore diversity is limited."
College Junior,2,When it comes to online courses of any kind you really need to be paying attention at all times. It isn't really like a normal class and you're really removed from the  environment. I don't recommend  them.
College Sophomore,2,"Mixed Review – The adminstrative office is not friendly at all, and enrolling is a difficult and time consuming process. You will generally see several different people in different buildings before you are done. Also, they let you pick your classes etc. before financial aid is final. This seems to cause a lot of problems. Teachers, on the other hand, are very nice, and seem personally interested in seeing students succeed."
College Student,2,"Want to Be a High School Senior? It shouldn't even be a state college. It was first a community college call DBCC but now its DSC. There has been several accounts as the classes being too lenient or even easy for college base classes. It might as well be another high school if anything. Your classes will be packed with students who don't care or High school duel enrollment students. It's an easy way out of AP courses for easy college credit. Anyone can aim higher then being a ""SUPER"" senior."
College Senior,2,"It's Terrible – I wish I would've known, or lived in a better location, so I could have started off at a better school. I haven't met one student at the campus who is completely satisfied with their experience here."
College Sophomore,2,"My School Experience – This is a good school if you really want to be a photographer. I do not anymore. I have a bad photography teacher who has made it boring to me and I have not learned much in his class. My other teachers are not great either. This is still a community college, no matter what the name is. I would rather be at Brevard Community College! I am leaving first chance I get!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is great. Teachers are understanding and helpful. The main problem with this school is not enough parking spots for the students, the financial aid office there is a joke and they have no idea what they're doing. Finally, the school doesn't tell you when you're close to graduating. I found out I graduated because I signed up for two more classes, and then all of a sudden my financial aid disappeared. So I had to go to the academic adviser to ask them because the line in the financial aid office was too long."
College Senior,2,"Acceptable at Best. Wireless not available on all parts of campus; some buildings are completely disconnected. Network speed is dismal, the lab computers are dreadfully outdated. If you want to actually get anything done, bring a laptop -- just don't expect to be able to use the internet on it."
College Senior,2,"Tuition Raise – The tuition just recently raised, but i dont feel that it was worth it. My BrightFutures scholarship hasnt kicked in yet and i cant afford to pay for my tuition at the moment. The employees arent very helpful either, actually they are very rude and irritable."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was able to be apart of some of the Christian groups on campus and worked with the school paper too for a while. I hung out with some of the SGA for a little while too. But soon after starting my degree in 2003, I had to stop most of that stuff because I had to focus on the work and make volunteer ours for the practicums. I really like some of the groups that I did participate though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Computer Labs – They were kinda hard to get to. You have some for public use in the library, but there mostly computers for both students to login and working school work and then there were some some for others to us. In the Disability Office there some for some of the students to use to help them with their work as well. When you need to print or copy something, you have to have a print card where you put money on their to use those machines in the common areas."
College Sophomore,2,it is difficult for an out-of-stater to get scholarships and good financial aid unless you have financial need.
College Freshman,2,"An Okay Choice – Unlike most students at DSC, I do like the school. The teachers are good, for the most part. There are some school activities, but I have not attented any of them. I like the location too, it is right around everything that I need. I can go to school, grab some lunch, and go to work all on the same street. So gas is never an issue. The only thing that is hard on me is paying for it. I did not earn a scholarship in High School, so I am paying out of pocket. So far next semester I can only take two classes, because that is all I can afford. I have tried semester after semester to earn financial aid from DSC, but to no avail. I am not eligible to be an independant, and my parents make too much money for me to qualify for financial aid. Although the school does not understand that my parents are not paying for anything in my life; school, my car, gas, clothes, food. If I had my choice I would rather go to a different school that actually listens to its students' financial problems."
Junior,1,"I would not recommend Daytona State College, they only cater to those who are taking out student loans or those who have money to throw away. I'm a straight-A student being awarded pell grants. It's like pulling teeth to get any questions answered, they always try to beat around the bush. I missed an opportunity to get into a leadership program because they failed to release my pell grant in time. I'm unable to get awarded my Pell Grant for Summer Semester until the class has started so I won't have my book until after class has started which already puts me behind. I like to stay ahead of the curve and read at least 1 - 2 chapters prior to taking the course so I know and can prepare myself. 

Please if you are an independent student, hoping to get Pell Grants - look into a different college in the area. I'm local was born and raised. 

I would rate 0 stars if I could. I'll be going to Full Sail to obtain my Web Development degree."
Graduate Student,1,This school is a joke as well as there financial aid department. If you take your life seriously and don’t want to waste your time don’t come to this unprofessional school. Wasted 5 years of my life with them each day has been a nightmare. Get some better support staff and just do better with your financial aid
Niche User,1,Teri Deardorff is extremely unprofessional and needs to be looked into. I'm disgusted by the utter disrespect and don't know why Daytona State has such low standards.
Graduate Student,1,"Signed up for Micro for Summer B 2019, only attended one day of class and dropped the class two days after first day of class. DSC is attempting to collect over $200 from me for a class I paid for half of and only attended the first meeting when in reality I should be getting refuded."
College Senior,1,There are not really any recruiters or anything of that sort that I am aware of.
College Junior,1,"I have not tried transferring credits, but the math department refused to place me in a Calculus I course after I had taken a college level Pre-Calculus course and a high school Calculus course before coming to Daytona. This school does not take your prior accomplishments seriously and will likely hold you back in science and math subjects."
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing for interpreting at Daytona State College.  I was told that a program was going to start, but it never did.  That's the reason I had to transfer to a different school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The student that take online courses are slackers and their discussions are uneducated and annoying. The courses didn't teach me anything I didn't know, but they were extremely convenient for people that procrastinate."
College Junior,1,"I must file FAFSA as dependent because I am not married, 24 years old, or a parent. However, I receive no financial assistance from my parents. I work a full time job and file income tax as independent. I MAKE TOO MUCH FOR MY PARENTS TO EVEN CLAIM ME ON THEIR TAXES! But, because I must file under them, I receive NO financial aid (they make too much money, too bad I don't see any of it!)

So, in order to go to school,, I had to take out private loans. My grandmother cosigned for me, thankfully, and sally mae approved the loan amount that I requested. Daytona State, however, decided that I didn't need all that I had requested and they are somehow able to decide what I get. The amount I was allotted did not even begin to cover my living expenses (they have no on campus housing, so I must live off campus), much less tuition and other school-related costs. It is a nightmare and I may have to postpone schooling if I do not receive enough help through scholarships."
College Junior,1,There are no actual scholarships or aid awarded.
College Junior,1,"There is no a lot of interaction from the instructors, and most cases they just don't care."
College Junior,1,"Only so many classes to choose from, and at the same time its only based on actual majors in technical training."
College Junior,1,"Most of the teachers try to create an outgoing experience, but somewhere along the lines they fail."
College Senior,1,The online program works well for someone who does to ask a lot of questions. I like the face to face better. 
College Junior,1,I haven't heard of anything to help after graduation
College Sophomore,1,Not applicable.  This is a 2 year junior college so transferring is required.
College Junior,1,"The diversity at this school is high, which is good, however the class of people is low.  Many people disregard school rules, smoke outside classroom doors in breezeways, and are generally disrespectful to the property.  Security is available on campus, however, they are hard to find and are not proactive."
College Junior,1,This school has a terrible financial aide department.  None of the employees speak to one and other so the information on the same topic from multiple employees will be different each time.  They are not there to help you and if you do seek help you are treated as if you are a bother to them.  It is a common complaint that the department is belittling and spiteful towards students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have been a student in the Adult Education Department since January. I am working on my GED. The first semester was awesome after that all downhill. I have one class to go before moving to the GED class. The biggest issue I have is this three teachers in three semesters in math class. The first switch out was understandable the teacher sought other employment. The next two where just a joke during the summer semester they moved the reading teacher to math. At the end of the semester they moved our second teacher back to reading. Now we are on number three, the teacher brought in to teach basic math is an electrical engineer. This is such a joke like trying to get a doctor to speak plane language. One evening in class I requested a pass to the computer lab, the teacher told me I was wasting my time. I lodged a complaint with the administration no action taken against the teacher. This school is so cheap that during the summer they closed the computer lab, I have no clue what the main campus is like as I attend the Deltona campus. So if you are looking for a school that could care less about those who should matter the most, this would be the school for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Everything is effortless in a negative way.
Does not prepare you to transfer to other universities.
I feel that teachers don't take grades seriously and have no problem throwing A's all over the place just to make their class standing look good and ultimately the college.
Because of the class age range, the teachers often talk to the students as if they were still in middle school. They do not challenge the students or enforce critical thinking at all."
College Sophomore,1,I don't even think we have anyone that works with students about careers.
College Sophomore,1,"No one is involved in any kind of academic programs, the social scene is just full of a big crowd of immature teenagers and adults that haven't been to school in 20+ years and don't even understand basic elementary algebra."
College Freshman,1,"After spending almost five entire days in the financial aid office, I had to redo my FAFSA all over again, because Daytona State College had somehow lost the records of it, along with any trade of my scholarships. I had to call various people in charge of the department, but nobody bothered to return any of my phone calls. The tuition is low but still not worth the quality of education; if I wanted to redo high school, I never would have left. If you want to get financial aid, be fully prepared to do all of the work yourself with NO help!"
College Freshman,1,"I transferred here for one semester due to housing issues at my old school. I was shocked by how unqualified many of the counselors are and how difficult it is to get anything done. I spent four days in the office after the financial aid department lost my records; I finally called my adviser from the previous school, who was more helpful and willing to assist me than those at Daytona State! Registering classes takes quite some time, as it's done online and the network tends to be painfully slow, and they somehow lost the ability to see my high school transcripts (some departments can access them, but the ones that matter apparently can't). All of my credits transferred to and from Daytona State, luckily."
College Senior,1,Not flexible at all when enrolled in environmental program
College Student,1,I have taken a couple online courses and they definitely are not my favorite. I was very confused for most of my online classes. We mostly took tests and had no lectures. I definitely prefer to be in an active classroom with a professor. It is very hard to grasp concepts in an online course.
College Sophomore,1,I was looking into sonography. The first class I took was anatomy. I wish I was more prepared for this class. Two hundred terms the first day and a ton of other information was not easy to comprehend.
College Junior,1,"School tuition is low. Financial aid was easy to obtain. I give them a C because they have recently had a glitch between their system and the Department of Educations, which over funded students and now these students are responsible to pay back loans starting immediately or their accounts are put on hold which does not allow them to register for classes next term."
Recent Alumnus,1,look man it sucks kids have no idea what they are doing and no one wants to help for free
College Senior,1,"Unknown Prospects – I am sure there are many advantages of attending this college when it comes to job prospects and the alumni network. However, they should try to make it become more apparent to students even when they do not go out of their way to request information."
College Senior,1,"Instant Coffee – The worst thing I have come across at my campus was the lunchroom. Although the facility is not bad, I would consider it small and limited. Moreover, the instant coffee tasted like watery-hot chocolate. I was greatly disappointed. Therefore, I usually go to nearby restaurants to eat."
College Senior,1,"What Is Perceived as Unique? In all honesty, I could not list very many things that I would consider unique at my college. The facilities have limited activities and entertainment possibilites. However, I do not think there has to be something unique for it to have quality."
College Senior,1,"Needs Improvement – On the campus you have to purchase a printing card that costs 2 dollars and then feed money onto through a machine. Only accepts 1 dollar bills and the lab won't make change for you. Extremely inconvenient when you are in a hurry or don't have a printer. Also, there is only one printer per lab. When my card went defective on its own, they wouldn't replace it I had to pay for it again. The internet speed was alright but we were not allowed to use for personal use."
College Senior,1,Lack of Communication – I honestly have not heard of any post-grad services at my school as of yet. I am ready for graduation at the end of this current semester.
College Senior,1,"They might as well be working at the DMV. Not only are they uncaring, they are unwilling to help to the point of putting your education at risk. I'm not talking about the professors, I'm talking about the people you get on the phone to ask a question, the people in the registration offices, the bookstores, and the people that process your tuition payemnts etc...
If you do go, be prepared to be spoken to like you are an absolute moron and be treated like a 12 year old. They DO NOT let you finish your thoght and instead cut you off and give you an answer based onhalf of what you were trying to tell them. The bookstoer in the Daytona Campus is a joke, again, the rudest people and of you are luck enough to get one of them on the phone, you are in for a real treat."
College Freshman,1,"Worst FA Process EVER – It took at least 2 months for all my paperwork to be reviewed and then another 2 weeks for my financial aid to be awarded. The process is much too long and stressful. The tuition is 90$ a credit hour and the fee still applies if you choose to take a class on a different campus or different school, you just have to get it authorized by the president."
College Senior,1,"All I Want to Do Is Transfer! I haven't transferred TO this school, but I am trying to transfer out, and the academic advisement staff is beyond absurd. They absolutely refuse to help you make certain everything will transfer. What are they there for?"
College Senior,1,"Some Diamonds in the Rough, but Not Exactly a Gem. This school is bordering on being a joke. Between the impatient, impolite and disaffected staff in the ""academic advising"" and ""financial aid"" departments, I was turned off from the experience from the get-go. I only began my education here because I cannot afford to go anywhere else.

Teachers are prone to not making themselves available, and academic support staff meant to tutor and help the many that instructors neglect are few. There are a few wonderful members of faculty in a few different departments -- but they are the exception, not the rule."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid is not awarded until 5 weeks after each semester begins. While they boast low tuition, students have no access, there are no endowments, there is no campus housing & room and board is not factored in. Over 15% of student body are homeless living in shelters. There is not sufficient financial aid for major to bridge gap of costs and without a car a student is very much stranded as there is not articulation between county DOT and University. Furthermore, there is no agreement between UCF for transportation either. There is no shuttle bus to help students go from campus to campus. While they do offer very reasonable tuition rates, it is much more cost effective to go to a state university as both room and board are factored in and housing options are offered. The gaps are bridged and when the financial aid predictor is compared the student does much better financially going elsewhere. The only plus side about DSC is their excellent photography program with a BS program as opposed to simply a glorified art degree."
Recent Alumnus,1,When asking more what my future career could be in i was given a website to look up this information myself.

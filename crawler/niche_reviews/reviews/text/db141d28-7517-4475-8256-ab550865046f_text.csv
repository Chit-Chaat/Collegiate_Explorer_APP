Freshman,5,"University of the Sciences is a well-orientated school that focuses on the sciences, healthcare, research, and other related areas. The university is smaller compared to other large universities, but this allows for more interaction within classes. There is usually a 20:1 student to teacher ratio for a classroom and even large lectures (roughly 60-90 students) tend to have a very strong support system. This support system includes professors, teacher assistance, student resources, and more. Overall, USciences is a school that excels in academia with a long history in the sciences and with great success rates. Although small, the institution still brings the feeling of a world renown university and has state of the art facilities all around campus. In addition to having a large resource and support center, USciences has a lot of partnerships and networking opportunities to get students involved, engaged, and out in the field with a strong resume."
Freshman,5,"University of the Sciences is a school that understands the fundamentals of an education. Switching to an online platform has been a learning curve for not only many students but also many teachers. However, I am confident when I say that my professors are doing their best to produce a similar environment as it would be in person. Due to the current conditions, all of my classes were administered online except for my lab classes. Lab classes were split into three different cohorts to practice social distancing and maintaining a safe environment. Each cohort practiced roughly 4 labs in-person within a small controlled group in order to learn the fundamentals of the laboratory and prepare us for our future endeavors. Once those 4 labs were done, we transitioned to online labs along with the rest of our classes. Although it is far from ideal, the university worked with the circumstances and provided a solution to give students the best possible results."
Sophomore,5,"When the first conversation of online leaning was mentioned, it caused a wave of anxiety through the campus community since in-person classes were important for hands-on activities. Professors were only given a short time to come up with a plan for online learning. This also caused a panic within the staff members because they were not used to online leaning and ran into a barrier of technological issues. However, given a short notice of online leaning, all of my professors for the Spring semester handled the new difficulties with determination and care. They also took extra time out of their schedules to help students that were struggling more than others. This included extending deadlines for assignments, extending virtual office hours, and extra help with topics. My professors turned an anxious student into a relieved student. Despite in-person classes being preferred, my online leaning experience overall was a 5 out of 5 due to the extra care and love from my  professors."
Sophomore,5,"Although I have only completed my first year of college at University of the Sciences, it was one of the best years of my life. Not only am I surrounded by fellow peers and classmates who have the same love and respect for education, but every staff member I have created a connection with work very hard to help us succeed in our courses! My professors made sure to involve themselves in every way, including check-ins, offering a helping hand, and genuine conversations involving life advice. Although my academic performance is a major priority, my mental and physical health was also a huge priority and frequently evaluated. Staff members took the time to make sure that their students were not only consumed by studies. This leads to many organizations, extra curriculars, clubs, and sports being created for students to have other hobbies during free time. With the care of experienced staff members, Usciences is a fun environment, but also a great place for success in higher education!"
Alum,5,"My online experience was challenging but it taught you as a student to advance in time management. Some professors would send you reminders via email but other times you had to be responsible for submitting all your assignments on time. The class was very well organized and the professor would grade my assignments in a timely manner. Overall, I enjoyed my online course."
Niche User,5,"I just committed to the University of the Sciences as a Neuroscience major. Even though I haven't started classes. I can comment on what I know. The facilities are very clean. The direct neighborhood doesn't seem bad, it's still Philly but definitely a better part. The students seem very intelligent, they are able to talk in-depth about lab experience and be able to go in-depth even as first and second-year students. The tuition has gone down a lot and is now a constant rate and is very cheap for its programs. the food court seems to have a good selection and everyone I've asked said it's pretty good. They have some social things to join such as frats, clubs, and division 2 sports (no football), and intramural sports such as boxing, track and field, and even spinning classes. It's in close proximity to Center City (12-minute trolley ride). Also, it's nationally ranked for its return on investment and is the first pharmacy school in the nation. Hope this helps."
Freshman,5,I had trouble deciding a future career path for myself but with help from students there I received a glimpse of different types of major for me to pursue. Learn a little bit of this and that. Eggos
Niche User,5,"This is a academically challenging university however, the rigorous academics places you in a very good position post-grad. Most students who graduate from here will be very well off and will be very successful in their career of choice."
Graduate Student,5,"Overall, I love the small school feeling here the most. You know everyone in your grade. Also because you have so many classes with the people in your major, you become really close to them and have the potential to create great friendships."
Niche User,5,"It is a very inclusive and beautiful campus. From what I learned, the staff and teachers always have an open door policy, whether it's to ask questions, or just to have someone to talk to. It is a very accessible campus, and everything is within walking distance. I know I will excel in this college."
Freshman,5,I like how the school has a 6-year direct entry program for pharmacy.  The school is small. My preferred college is a small school. It may seem small but it's actually pretty big and comfy. I like how nice the campus is. there are trees and grass. Some of the buildings are nice looking and it's interactive.
Freshman,5,"Only being a freshman, I have realized that this university has a lot to offer, but also needs much work. The food quality, student life, and housing needs to improve sufficiently."
Sophomore,5,"The course load is challenging, but the school offers a lot of resources to help students. The community is friendly. The school is close to a lot of public transportation, so commuting is easy. There are a lot of networking opportunities for whatever your future career is. There are a lot of forums to make a suggestion or a complaint if you have a problem."
Niche User,5,"When I first visited University of the Sciences, the current students there were very kind. For a small school like this, I met many wonderful staff members. I was able to talk to many professors on my first day. The campus was small and what I was use to growing. The local area wasn't too bad, I liked that it was close by to cool sites like Center City. I was also a fan of the many cool foods the school offered as I am a vegetarian. I liked the many clubs and activities, like sororities and sports, USciences offered."
Freshman,5,I like the fact that is was so homey and everyone was so kind. I felt like I belong the moment I had stepped onto the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school, really great atmosphere and tight knit community.  Professors are always experts in their field of study.  They are always willing to help.   I respect every student at this school, everyone is really intelligent and driven"
Freshman,5,"My experience with the University of the Sciences has been excellent so far. All of my professors have been so great. They have all been eager to help and really having the best interest of success for all of their students. They take their time to really get to know every student and help to answer as many questions and meet to go over any material. Also, the University does an excellent job providing a lot of extra curricular activities to keep the student busy. All of the facilities are very kept up with and up to date with technology. Also, being in the city of Philadelphia people would think that it would be dangerous, but on this campus you always see security around and just feel safe all of the time."
College Student,5,It really is a nice environment and has a lot of good equipment for an athletic facility.
College Senior,5,This is a top school in the world if you are going for a science/healthcare related field. I would put a degreeholder from USciences up against any other graduate in the world.
College Senior,5,Greek life is one of the best and biggest assets to our University. It's a shame that the school didn't realize this until fairly recently.
College Freshman,5,Almost everyone has a job when they graduate or have been accepted to a higher level of education
College Freshman,5,The overall experience at this school is one I wouldn't trade for the world. I made the best friends in the world and have received an amazing education.
College Student,5,It has been known more on its academics
College Student,5,"I love this school, really a great academic school ranked 9th in the entire nation in earnings 10 years after enrollment.  It's a good size with nice buildings and a fun atmosphere.  Brand new dining hall and other universities under 10 blocks away.  Can't beat the overall college experience."
College Student,5,"When you can, there are so many options for off campus dining and it's all great food! Most places are within walking distance or a short Penn Transit ride!"
College Student,5,I am a part of greek life and I love it. I do not regret my decision to join. It is a very big part of campus activity so it is a great way to get involved.
College Freshman,5,I live off campus and it's pretty friggin great!
College Freshman,5,The Greeks Go Down and Dirty
College Senior,5,"There are tons of apartments and row houses surrounding the school. You get what you pay for in terms of quality and relative safety, but overall it saves you a lot of money if you don't live on campus (even if your rent is really high it's still cheaper than dorms)"
College Junior,5,Very organized and professional school
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is accepted here. We have all different kinds of people, most minorities, but there are so many that they are nearly majorities. Everyone treats each other equally. "
College Student,5,Faculty was very nice and helpful.
College Student,5,School is not very big so you get to know fellow students. It is a great community. Food vendors are located in the area of the school in case you don't want to eat in the cafeteria. 
College Sophomore,5,Residing in the city gives you so many night life options
College Sophomore,5,For those who love the city life
College Sophomore,5,"Receiving financial aid is as easy as applying, but like with any school I wish it were more generous "
College Sophomore,5,Wide range of classes to choose from
College Student,5,The campus is around University of Pennsylvania's campus and Penn's campus has a lot of places to go for fun also places to study. 
College Freshman,5,Not as bad as people say it is at all.
College Freshman,5,I love who I have become since I've been here.
College Freshman,5,So many food options in the city!
College Freshman,5,Public safety is on every corner to help
College Freshman,5,School is easy to get admitted; hard to stay in
College Freshman,5,Courses overprepare you for post-undergrad.
College Freshman,5,"It's ""homey."" Just enough space for everything"
College Freshman,5,Always something to do. It's almost overwhelming
College Sophomore,5,"Public transportation is great around USci. There are many options available to students. The school shares some sort of shuttle service with UPenn for nearby places.  There's easy access to buses, trolleys, and trains. We are close to 30th Street Station for septa regional rails, njtransit, and amtrak, as well as megabus or boltbus. There's also airport shuttle services that will pick you up at your door and take you to the airport for only $10."
College Freshman,5,"There is easy access to public transportation via buses, subway and trolley cars. The University also has its own transport service available to take students from housing to academic facilities."
College Sophomore,5,Computers and printers are located all over campus and it is very easy to access any one of them.
College Sophomore,5,The school takes violations very seriously to make sure students are not being dishonest and violating school codes.
College Sophomore,5,"The dining hall is usually open whenever you have a break between classes, so it is easy to stop and get something good to eat."
College Sophomore,5,"There are many ways to get around on campus, however if one is venturing outside of campus there are UPenn shuttle buses or trolleys to take you where you need to go."
College Sophomore,5,the separate gender has their values that suit in studying. they are somewhat consevatives and has moral
Recent Alumnus,5,"USP really doesn't have an in-campus transportation system because the campus is so small. But SEPTA trolleys(which is the public transportation system of  Philadelphia) run all along the streets and they connect you the center city and other stations to go to NY, NJ, and other parts of Philadelphia. I was a commuter my last year and I used different lines of Septa everyday to commute back and forth from North Philly to West Philly."
College Student,5,"Kiwi is a frozen yogurt shop near Penn's campus. It's amazing and the ""pick me up"" you need when you have a bad day. They always come up with different flavors and toppings and the place is always lively. The cost is affordable."
College Freshman,5,"No Tolerrance Campus. The drug scene at University of the Sciences is at a minimum. The campus is a no tolerance campus, no alcohol or any kind of drug. In order to smoke you have to walk outside and be away from the buildings."
College Freshman,5,"University of the Sciences must be one of the safest schools in the state, the care that they put in to keeping their students safe in unparalleled.  The school offers free transportation to get travel the surrounding areas, ensuring a safe trip. University of the Sciences' campus also features help boxes that you can go to if an issue arises, these boxes will connect you straight to security."
College Senior,5,"So Many Places! There are so many great restaurants in Philly, and most of them are delicious! However, you may have to pay a pretty penny for the best ones. The best are in center city, which you have to take the trolley to, but there are also some great choices within walking distance from campus. Fast food: Qdoba, Chipotle, Bobby's Burger Palace, Tampopo, Misu, and lots more!"
College Sophomore,5,Shuttle Cars Are Excellent – All you have to do is give them a call and they'll be there in 15 minutes or less.
College Student,5,Drugs and Alcohol – There is a no tollerance policy for drugs and alcohol
Alum,4,I liked how small the campus was to be able to make friends and create a strong relationship with the professors. The campus is located within a neighborhood which was nice to experience. The professors care about your education and want you to be successful.
Sophomore,4,"Like many schools, it's the staff who can make or break an academic year. Many of the teachers will try to provide the most detailed, and thorough responses to a question. The advisors are amazing day or night you will likely be able to contact them and they always will tell you the truth even if it's unpleasant. Many of the professors are competent however some are quite horrible in both their behavior and their teaching. The Labs are fun and entertaining and most of the lab assistants will do their best to help you in and out of their classroom."
Freshman,4,University of the Sciences was my first choice college that I decided to attend. While attending I found the staff and students to be really friendly and respectful. The classes a great since the teachers are a great help. If would to change something out my experience there would be that the college food there be better with more options.
Alum,4,"I knew immediately I wanted to attend USciences.  It's easy to get in, but difficult to stay.  If you are able to work hard and maintain grades, you'll be able to stay.  The school is difficult, but you learn a lot while attending and professors are always willing to help you out with your work if you don't understand something.  Plus they know who you are due to the small size of the school.  Also, there isn't much partying going on, but there is always the occassional fraternity or house party.  There is also always the option of going to some parties at Penn or Temple if you are really craving those wild nights out. In honesty though, you won't always have the time to do so due to the workload you recieve.  Also, you will feel safe living on campus because there are always public safety officers walking around campus 24/7."
Freshman,4,"The University of the Sciences is a true example of absolute return on investments. As a freshman, I've come to see the diverse health profession tracks the University has to offer. This includes a Doctorate of Pharmacy program as well as a OT(Occupational Therapy) and PT( Physical Therapy) program. The small class size allows students to connect one on one with the professor, and gain the most out of their time. Speaking as a Pharmacy student, I find that the University of the Sciences gives the best opportunities to all their students when it comes to internships, fellowships, residencies, etc. Due to the small student body, the school is able to maintain their prestige and quality of education, especially their pharmacy school( first pharmacy school in North America). If you want the most for your buck, I would totally recommend the University of the Sciences over a larger school like Rutgers or Temple University."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at the University of the Sciences, my experience has been good. The small campus enables students to quickly adapt to the area and the university. As the name should convey, I believe those who have a true interest in the field of science will enjoy their university journey at this school. The school wants their students to excel in their education which is why I think that academics is the main focus than athletics. Overall, I would recommend this school to those who have a true passion in academics, especially those surrounding science."
Freshman,4,"A lot to do on campus and around. The food from the dining hall is awful, I do not recommend a meal plan unless its mandatory"
Junior,4,"The people and community are wonderful, and the area feels very comfortable. It is a very welcoming place, and I don't ever feel out of place, or as if I don't belong. Teachers and faculty members are always ready to help you when you need."
Freshman,4,"University of the Sciences is overall an amazing school. They have amazing lab programs that give you hands on experience and also insight on if you would like to work in a lab one day. The faculty are very compassionate about what they do and are very willing to help you do your best in the class. It is easy to get touch with a professor with questions since there office hours are posted on a syllabus, and they are respond quickly to emails. In addition, this school also helps out with networking and building on public speaking skills by having project fairs. The fair helped improve my confidence in speaking publicly and my knowledge of the topic that was chosen. I would like to see change begin with the biology and chemistry labs be related to what is being taught in seminar classes. Some of the labs would seem unrelated to what is learned in the seminars which wouldn't really help students like me who excel at learning by being hands on."
Sophomore,4,"Very hard course work, but if you make good friends and know where the parties are then it'll make the studying worth it!"
Graduate Student,4,"I like how small the school is because it is centered around the person.  The faculty in the graduate programs really care about their students and they make us feel welcomed, especially wanting to go to class. You are treated as an equal at this school."
Junior,4,"The university offers excellent education, they expect the best out of their students. That being said, the course-load can be can be overwhelming and students are stressed out to the max. A typical semester may look like: 3 science courses (organic chem, microbiology, etc.), a math, and a humanities. Everyone moves up together so you pretty much see the same peers through out the years. There is no time for partying or socializing due to the course-loads, which didn't bother me because I am an older student. But it may be a concern for those who are looking for a ""college experience."""
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty good, but the student life is not that great. Wish there were more events on campus for the students to get involved in. Academics are great"
Graduate Student,4,"Its a great school, although challenging at times it will come with great rewards. You are pushed for your own good. It is a small school but thats what I like about it because it feels more inclusive. Overall good investment just be willing to put in the work."
Junior,4,I very much enjoy the campus community and the feel of the campus. It is a very personable environment where you get to know most of the staff and students due to the smaller size. I would like to see more campus engagement  opportunities and more club/organizations.
Freshman,4,Incredibly hard school. Honestly needs to improve housing. The teachers are either very good or completely aweful. It's a place where you need to be extremely dedicated to make it all the way.
Sophomore,4,"University of the Sciences is not an easy school. The worst aspect unrelated to course difficulty is that the school usually does not listen to younger students, but instead only the concerns of older students are addressed. Otherwise, it is an excellent school with strong academics and provides many great opportunities for students wishing to get major-related experience before graduation."
Graduate Student,4,Enjoying my time here despite personal set backs in my program. OT department gives lots of hands on opportunities despite some disorganization with professors. All professors still work in the field and give us stories about their experience.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at USciences has been great. I fell into the groove pretty quickly and I found a solid friend group. Everyone is very friendly and it's a nice community. The area is okay, there are run-down neighborhoods. But public safety is always on duty so that is reassuring. Pretty tight-knit campus, which I like. The walk between classes isn't bad at all. Food is okay, I personally got tired of it quick. Dorms are average, as Goodman is pretty old. But there's a new residence hall being built so that is a nice addition. Academics are great, the professors really want students to succeed. They really do care and are always there to help. Overall, this is an exceptional school."
Freshman,4,"I am satisfied with the location, security, and the student life. However, there were professors who did not show any interests in the students' success and could not properly teach the students on the necessary topics. For some classes I had to self-teach myself through Youtube videos, outlines, and textbooks so that I don't fall behind in class. The housing is also very poor since the building is old. There are cockroaches everywhere in the Freshman dorm building."
Freshman,4,"I chose USciences, because of how focused they are on health-care careers.  I believed that I'd get the most out of this school, being surrounded by the kinds of people I would be working with in the future.  I also really liked the campus, and the distance it was from my house.  It wasn't so far that I wouldn't be able to go home if I wanted to, but it wasn't so close where I was basically in the same town with the same people again."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming Freshman at USP. So far, my experience has been great! The school is very diverse and welcoming. The dorms are pretty standard, not shabby- the only thing you need would be lights. However, USP is building the new dorms as we speak so that rating might change. The food is a bit...lackluster. Sure, it's buffet style and there are a lot of drink options and fresh fruit. The food is pretty standard. I'm not too worried about safety since there are a lot of precautions and security about, including access cards to get into certain buildings. Student life I am giving 4 stars because THERE ARE SO MANY CLUBS."
Freshman,4,I love how small the learning community is because it really gives students a hands-on experience and more time with each professor. The only thing I would like to see change is the high cost of this university because it is very difficult for an average family to afford.
Freshman,4,Its a small school which has its ups and downs. But the best thing about the school is that you have smaller classes which makes it easier to connect with professors.
Graduate Student,4,"Since coming here in 2013 (and expecting to graduate 2017 and in 2019), the university has really made the effort to improve and does not look like what it did 4 years ago. They have renovated the dining hall, have plans to create a new freshman/sophomore living space, more educational space, and has a new marketing campaign. Even the landlords around the area have been doing new construction to modernize the living space for students once they move off campus. While I agree that greek life wasn't what it was back in 2014 when I joined, it still has a lively spirit on our campus. Going through one of their accelerated programs, it felt disjointed at first (possibly due to my impatience to ""get to the real stuff already""). It was a matter of taking further classes and seeing the material continuously integrate itself. I can say I proudly see myself growing into being as a strong, entry level practitioner."
Niche User,4,My cousin goes here and seemed to get a lot out of the pharmacy program. He's graduated a pharmacist and currently doing quite well.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the small campus feel in the big city. One trolley ride away from center city. Everyone is super nice on campus. The programs are rigorous and the majority of teachers are very helpful. Never felt unsafe on campus. Food could be better for vegetarians, but for meat lovers there is a great variety of food."
College Student,4,Lots of options but very costly.
College Student,4,There is a lot of diversity present on campus.
College Student,4,"Classes are good, it is just some teachers that could be better, especially in the Biology Department. However, it was a great first year."
College Student,4,"I have not used the Student Center yet, but hearing of the statistics that are carried with USciences, 90% of people paying off student loans and etc, it seems great."
College Student,4,Public Safety always does their best in ensuring that our college remains safe and protected.
College Student,4,It could definitely have been cleaner as well as more amenities.
College Student,4,It could be more involved and there could be more options; I wanted to get involved in Greek life but unfortunately could not find any that interested me.
College Sophomore,4,"Although not many people know the name of this school or what it is, those that two can really praise its academic excellence. A very large portion of the graduating classes are very successful and are going towards doing bigger and better things. The teacher help you with internships in your later years and you may even get the change to work with one of your professors depending on what major you choose. They have many research opportunities and even have clubs that offer help in these kinds of things."
College Senior,4,The small school environment makes it easy to meet people and get to know your professors. Class sizes are small to give individualized attention. Great quality of schools and easily accessible to the greatest city in the world.
College Senior,4,"In the three years I've been here, I have neither seen nor heard of any sexual assault instances."
College Senior,4,"The proximity to classes can't be beat. After living in dorms for two years, I can say that they are fairly standard compared to other college dorms. The no overhead lighting kind of sucks, but it is absolutely manageable. It is a great way to meet lifelong friends."
College Senior,4,"My school is one of the top academic institutions in the country. The typical student is driven and intelligent, but socially inept. Luckily for me, I excel in school and social situations."
College Sophomore,4,"Networking is very poor, but the school forces you to learn."
College Sophomore,4,Its a science school that pushes students to study hard and molds them to become professionals in their fields. I find it comforting to be surrounded by other science majors who are all passionate about healthcare and take their education seriously. I would choose this school over and over again because its truly provides a valuable education.
College Student,4,The university has a high rate of students finding jobs after graduation
College Freshman,4,"We receive the highest degree possible for my program, that is the best part"
College Freshman,4,Sometimes there are mistakes or things that are not fully thought out but for the most part my program is very well put together and very hands on. i am learning real world skills for my profession
College Freshman,4,Good hands on classes and great job offers
College Freshman,4,"Sports aren't a huge part of student life in my opinion however we do have a lot of school spirit and our teams are good, as far as I am aware. We have workout classes that are awesome and our gym is really nice."
College Freshman,4,"Usciences is a great school. You're surrounded by teachers and other students who have the same interests and capabilities as you do and everyone is extremely helpful and friendly. The workload is heavy and studying takes up most of your time at the school, but the experience is one I wouldn't trade for the world."
College Student,4,"We have a student wellness center. However some situations, they may not be ble to help. Sometimes, they just send people to the hospital."
College Student,4,It has been know that Usciences has graduates that earn a lot of money. They are often sought out by employers
College Freshman,4,Safety is not a problem on campus. Many public safety officers are always on campus. And nothing to worry about.
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are usually small with lots of assistance if needed. Professors and TAs are always helpful. Course are somewhat difficult however studying will get you through it.
College Freshman,4,After graduation jobs are easy to find because of the degree in healthcare from a respected college.
College Freshman,4,This school is perfect for someone interested in Healthcare and Science. There are many opportunities to advance and learn the skills needed for your future careers. The courses are rigorous due to the fact many of the programs are challenging. Overall the school is good.
College Student,4,The last 2 years of pharmacy are n rotations where many students actually end up working.
College Student,4,Usciences is a fun stimulating learning environment and i personally consider its home away from home.
College Student,4,The school is a great place to learn but it is brutally difficult. Also the transition into the school from high school was not easy as work loads almost triple.
College Student,4,"I am an incoming freshman so I have not had an experience in the school. However, orientation was very exciting and interesting."
College Student,4,"At University of the Sciences, I have many opportunities to obtain a well-paying job and opportunities where I can do research in my own personal time.  It is a great experience that I would never trade for.  Although it is a small school, students and professors are able to interact.  Students are able to communicate with their professors and even have the opportunity to research with professors.  The positive and negative thing about this school is that it is mostly based on your academic skills.  Although it is good to focus on your academics, the activities are rather low-key.  However, this school's campus is divine and a perfect area to be in."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of off-campus places that allow students to get food that isn't available off campus for cheap and easy.
College Student,4,"Food is always available, not always the best quality from the dining hall, but other options are plentiful."
Junior,2,"I am only writing this because I want the next person to read this to seriously consider their decision to attend. I remembered being a high school student who was very excited to attend because I had got into desirable program, the 4+4 med or dental and reading all these bad reviews and also ignoring them because the program is ""worth it"". This school is BAD, it doesn't have a great rep in the med community, you're better off paying 40k at a much better school. You will not enjoy yourself Philly makes the school bearable but it is not a college experience. I did make my program but i know plenty of smart kids with high GPA and good scores who didn't because the reputation of this school is checks and the programs are not real, they are mere associations that are fickle and can fall apart at ANY TIME. Although some faculty are amazing and they truly will help you!! If you are smart you will go to a better college, have a better experience and a higher chance at med school. AVOID SCAM"
Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, online classes are the school's kryptonite. Many teachers had extreme difficulty when it came to online classes. Whether it was a poorly formatted assignment or without exaggeration at least double the amount of work than pre-quarantine. I would not recommend this if you have to take any chem or math classes."
Freshman,2,"I liked the small class size. It kept me liable for going to class since all the teachers knew me by name and it was easier to have any questions I had answered. I wish they would have a better campus life. Campus life at the university is very small and in that environment it is very hard to be happy, comfortable and enjoy where you are. I also wish their cafeteria was open longer because there are days where I have to skip dinner since I have class and by the time I finish class, the cafeteria is closed. On top of this, I wish the food was better because I find it hard to finish my meals due to the lack of choices given as well as the poor taste. The university is very poor at aiding students in emergencies. You have to wait days or even weeks to speak to a mental health professional or a nurse."
College Freshman,2,"I am here for educational purposes only. I don't think anyone at this school comes here for the college experience. The workload is ridiculous and the course difficulty make you wonder why you have not dropped out yet. Speaking for myself, my only motivation to do my time here at USciences is that I will be financially stable in approximately four years."
College Freshman,2,"Extremely disappointed in the housing options at USciences. The housing options do not match the $40,000 price tag. They more adequately match the price of a stay at a trashy motel. Advice to anyone looking at this school: avoid the mice and roach infested Osol Hall at all costs, and go as far a selling your kidney to live in Wilson Hall, as it is the lesser of the four evils."
College Sophomore,2,The school has been suspending greek life regularly
College Sophomore,2,"Almost non-existant, but the athletic recreation center is nice."
College Student,2,Public safety is unhelpful in cases of escort services. Public Safety seems more determined to get students in trouble than to help
College Student,2,I appreciate the education I can receive at my school but I often consider leaving the university and wish I has chosen another school.
College Student,2,"I only lived on campus for one year, even though it is usually mandatory to live on campus for two years because I got better value in off campus living."
College Student,2,Sports is not important to the student body. Baseball and softball teams lack a field.
College Student,2,"My university is not my favorite. The student body is lacking, perhaps due to the lack of non-exclusive clubs. Administrators do not seem to care about the students in the slightest."
College Freshman,2,It is not bad but is not a focus at our school and not very popular.
College Senior,2,"Housing is average your first year, but as an upperclassman you will experience poor living conditions if you live in Osol. The honors dorms are the only dorms to see improvements in the last 5 years."
College Senior,2,"Greek Life is a clique. Because the school is so small, if you are asked to join a organization and you decline, they will ""blacklist"" you and cause others to look down upon you."
College Senior,2,The gym is not open late enough and does not have the space to meet the demands of the students. Varsity athletics are that of a low level high school game. Don't come here and expect to see some good athletics.
College Student,2,Nobody cares about athletics since it's a science school.
College Junior,2,"Some places are very unsafe for students, however some places that are close to campus feel somewhat safe because public safety is always there."
College Junior,2,The dining hall has lots of different variety of foods but the quality isn't presented very well.
College Senior,2,"The school and surrounding neighborhood has been cracking down on underage drinking especially at the frat houses, so most frats are too scared to throw parties"
College Senior,2,Programs here are very difficult. Workload is very high and sleep and socialization are sacrificed to maintain grades.
College Freshman,2,school is ridiculously expensive and everything costs so much
College Student,2,"Athletics are not the main focus for the university, they are more focused on academics. Some students do very well athletically, but that is not the case for all students. Since a lot of students are focused on their studies, the fan support and school spirit is lacking for athletic events. More students go out for club sports or intramurals because it requires less of a commitment, but students are still able to remain active."
College Student,2,"The specific program is a great way to directly achieve the highest degree for the career of choice. However, it doesn't give students the freedom to explore other options because of such a tightly packed schedule and mandatory classes that students must take each semester."
College Student,2,"Off campus dining choices are very limited because the location of the university is so far from the diverse community. Only certain courses are offered and even then, the prices are too expensive to be affordable for college level students."
College Student,2,"The campus is very segregated, no necessarily based on sexual orientation or religion but more on social interactions. For example, students that choose not to attend parties are looked down upon or known as ""prudes"" because of their lack of desire in the presence of alcohol. The social circle in which they can make friends are very limited, which leads to limited socializing and experience."
College Student,2,"Much of the housing off campus is very run down. Because students are desperate to finding housing off campus, much of the quality is poor. It is also very difficult to leave campus as a first or second year."
College Student,2,"Despite being in a college atmosphere, regulations of being a dry campus is very strict. Although some students cross the line, responsible ones are penalized for just being curious growing youths."
College Student,2,Gas is expensive around the area. Parking is hard to find
College Student,2,Their is not much healthy alternatives. The food is a bit expensive. Basically all food carts.
College Freshman,2,"If you go at the wrong times it is very hard to work out in the athletic facility. Same with the student center and libraries- if there are many exams, or it is finals week you are much better off just staying in your dorm, there is not much space to study."
College Freshman,2,"For a DII school, the only sport that people pay any attention to is basketball. And even that is barely acknowledged by students."
College Student,2,It consist of Koreans and Asians. Caucasian and especially African Americans are very minimal. 
College Student,2,You pay 400 dollars per year to get a spot that changes everyday. 
College Student,2,The food is the same every week and the cost is ridiculous. 
College Student,2,It's bad. The cost for it is crazy. They have the same type of food each week.
College Student,2,The most popular major is pharmacy. Any other majors aren't as important.
College Student,2,"The school itself mainly consist of Pharmacy students. The process is very selective. Do well in your classes and SATs and you'll get in and coming out with the fact that you're student loan debt will make you poor. Also, you will be depressed as this school breaks your mental state to the point where you want to kill yourself."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life plays a major part of the University of the Sciences. I did not realize this until after pledging had started, but Greek life truly dominates campus. While Greek life provides a new social group and networking opportunity for those involved, it is a pain to deal with on a daily basis if you are not involved."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing around school isn't great. The apartment my roommate and I were able to get was really great quality and close to campus with a great landlord, but also very expensive. The other apartments I've seen from friends are definitely average quality or below. You can get an apartment for cheaper, but then you're sacrificing your safety for a shady neighborhood."
Graduate Student,1,"Scam, you will not get work, half the courses donot exist, faculty are mediocre,  no big research , unrecognizable not accredited , they will lure you by promises,  and very expensive,  go to other universities and you will get the same  or better classes/courses and better degree for a fraction of the price. Zero return on your money, unemployment for sure. Poor on all aspects, wash out faculty"
Graduate Student,1,"A truly diploma mill: poor programs, poor quality faculty,  poor facilities,  saw horror stories about career, classes services. for less money you can get a better degree and better college experience and you can get work. You will not work with most of their degrees, donot believe thier advertisements"
College Student,1,Hazing was extremely bad and multiple sororities and fraternities have been kicked off campus for their actions.
College Freshman,1,no parking it sucks its really bad so don't waste money
College Freshman,1,it costs like $500 to park on campus and theres never a guarantee of a spot
College Student,1,Trying to find any assistance for financial aid was difficult because most staff members did not understand the confusion that first year college students may have regarding tuition. Students were immediately dismissed without a clear understanding of what to look for and had to be repeatedly reviewed in order to obtain a simple request.
College Freshman,1,"You eat the same things, vegetables are so oily they're probably worse for you than just not eating them, and you dread eating anything in the cafeteria."
College Student,1,The bathrooms are disgusting and there are probably STDs in the air. 
College Freshman,1,"Pharmacy program is hard as it is, but in this school it’s a cut-throat competition for every last point. Teaching faculty is not available & NOT helpful, they have fake smiles and they do not care about students. Every student is a money machine, they get as much money as they can and try to fail you in the last years of studies. I have a feeling most of the faculty here get satisfaction from seeing us struggling. They may be getting bonuses for failing students, leaving them in the same grade for the second time… they love it here, because they can collect another year of tuition. Most students and alumni hate this school, and now I know why. Whenever you ask for help, you get NO for an answer. Do NOT go to this school, unless you want to feel miserable. Pharmacy is a good profession, but do it at a different university, do yourself a favor."
College Student,1,Dangerous West Philly – West Philadelphia is known to be dangerous. You can not rely on security around the school. There are robbers at night almost every week. Sometimes there are shootings in mid day light. I have never felt safe walking back once the sun sets. Campus security never seems to be doing a very good job.
Niche User,1,Surrounding Area – This school is a couple blocks away from a horrible section of the city.  Not only were there drivebys in front of one of our buildings.  There were many students attacked and robbed at gun point.  Besides that our SGA president was beat up walking back to his house in the middle of the afternoon.  GREAT AREA!

It is necessaary for a Unviersity to have these sports avaialbe for fitness and competition. I think this will also make a better, more contemporary name for Martin University."
College Sophomore,1,Boring and Outdated – Martin is lagging in the technology area. The school is fairly young but that should mean that they are more current because they were devoloped in the time of technical advances! But they are not utilizing anything correctly and everything is very behind.
College Sophomore,1,The people in general are your average run of the mill grandparents and parents. There are a few young people (such as myself) who are just there to transfer. The older people dress either very ostentacious or old and outdated. The younger people in general just dress plainly.

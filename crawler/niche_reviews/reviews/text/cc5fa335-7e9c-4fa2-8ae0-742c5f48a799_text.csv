Sophomore,5,"Although this is my first semester, I absolutely love it at Black Hills State University so far. I enjoy my classes and working with the staff was amazing. I am looking forward to continuing my education here."
Freshman,5,"Black Hills State University is in a beautiful location (Spearfish, South Dakota). There are many activities to do located not too far from campus. The campus itself is clean, well-kept, and beautiful. The admissions are helpful and kind people that take your best interests to heart. Not to mention their athletic programs are hard-working and dedicated. They offer an excellent pool of majors and degrees to choose from. I have heard nothing but amazing things about their education system."
Freshman,5,It is an amazing school and has a great teachers. Everyone there wants to see you succeed and graduate. There are many things to do if you like being out doors.
Junior,5,"The professors are very helpful and show great interest in your success. The classes are appropriate to your major and interests as well as the levels they accompany. The homework is appropriate to the class and class load and classes are interesting and engaging. Overall, this school is very well suited for serious students who want to succeed and go on to achieve their dream career."
Senior,5,"I've been to Black Hillls State a few times for ACT testing, and for extracirricular activities, and the people there are great to work with and they are very one-on-one with each individual, and I love how they are willing to meet with students in the surrounding communities and see how they can improve their college."
Freshman,5,I like all the fun activities they have going on after school hours. The only thing I would change is better food on the buffet.
Freshman,5,I had switched schools from the University of South Dakota to Black Hills State University. I was very frustrated with the first school and after talking to one of the advisers at Black Hills State I made the switch. They helped me with all of my needs making the switch easy and effective. The staff is friendly and easy going. They make themselves very approachable.
Sophomore,5,my experience up to this point has been awesome. love the smaller classes and love the university center can save money and live at home and still get a degree.
Alum,5,Black Hills State was such a warm and welcoming school where I felt at home right away. I felt that the professors cared for not only my education but also my wellbeing which led to great relationships with them in and out of the classroom. The education prepared me for position I have had since graduation in my degree. My educators were willing to work with me and help ease the transition from college life to real life as well.
Sophomore,5,BHSU is one of the prettiest campuses in South Dakota. It is in the top 10% of business schools and is AACSB accredited. It's one of the US tree and bee campus.
Graduate Student,5,"They have been very helpful with all my transfer needs. I like the fact that they don't consider a transfer student as a ""new to college"" type of student like generally other colleges do."
Senior,5,I go to their second campus in rapid city so i can not attest to a large portion how good various aspects on main campus is. the professors i have had are all very passionate about their material but teach it in a way that is not unnecessarily complex.
Freshman,5,"Black Hills St University is located in one of the most beautiful areas in America. Not only is the location of the campus amazing, the school itself is awesome. Black Hills has a very prestigious accreditation for it's business program. Personally, this is what attracted me to this school, however Black Hills offers much more. If you chose this school, not only would you be in one of the best areas, but you would be attending a very amazing school."
Freshman,5,"A beautiful campus, set right in the Black Hills of South Dakota. All the professors I have encountered with my major have been wonderful and caring people. The cafeteria is usually good and the campus is ALWAYS clean."
Sophomore,5,"Classes are small, so you have more time with professors. Everyone is very open and friendly. And education is valued."
Freshman,5,I take courses online with Black Hills State and I have been since I was 16. I think that it is great in comparison to some of the other schools I have attended in South Dakota. The teachers actively communicate with their students and the students have all appeared to be quite friendly. Any problems that I confronted were easily solved when I talked to either a teacher or another staff member of the school. They work hard to make sure you have a good experience and a quality education.
Niche User,5,"Nothing, when I went to visit it was a place I felt comfortable, and could see me applying and going to college."
Junior,5,"I transferred to BHSU from SDSU, and it is a WAY better fit for me! The classes are manageable sizes and the professors are amazing! If I ever had a question or concern they were always willing to help me on the spot or offer a better time to work out the problem. The campus nicely laid out and classes and rooms are easy to find."
Junior,5,"Great campus and local scene hiking, fishing camping, and much more that can make campus life great and rarely dull"
Freshman,5,I like how friendly the staff is. I just registered for summer classes. I can't really tell much more since I am going to be just starting. I will say the campus is pretty for being on it for the first time.
Freshman,5,I truelly enjoyed my first semester. They had tons of activities throughout the year that were great ways to get involved and enjoy your school year. The variety of academics this school has is good to help students to figure out where they decide to go.
Junior,5,It really became my home. Everyone is so welcoming and there are so many opportunities if you put yourself out there.
Freshman,5,I am a first year currently doing my second semester. I am very impressed with the teachers here and I love the small classes. most of my classes consist of 30 students. because of the small class sizes teachers know most of their students names. the small classroom experience is like going to private college but for half the price!
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this college! Great town, community, and school. Being so far away from home ad this place makes me feel happy!"
Freshman,5,"The University is located at the base of the Black Hills.  The population of Spearfish embrace the students and are very accepting.  If it is the outdoors you enjoy, it offers a bountiful choice with year round offerings.  The campus staff in all departments across the board are very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend Black Hills State University to all."
Niche User,5,"I am going to be enrolled at BHSU next fall. I found out about the University when researching colleges in mountainous areas of the US; I am a huge fan of rocky areas with beautiful scenery. I was recruited to play basketball, and this opportunity allowed me to visit the campus a few times. I met some staff members and they all came off as wonderful people with a passion for success. The facilities are top notch, too. I visited quite a few places, and none compared to BHSU. To top it off, there is no such thing as a boring day in the Black Hills. A 5 minute walk puts you in the midst of the canyon. I love it out in Spearfish!"
Senior,5,This school is an excellent choice for students who desire to major in Education! The courses are very informative and applicable to what you will see in the field. All of the professors and staff are more than willing to answer any questions and they are very knowledgeable in education. I am completely happy with my decision to enroll here!
Niche User,5,I loved how they were small and so family like. I love how they made their visitors and their students feel like they are home. Their food is amazing.
Sophomore,5,I have been attending the Black Hills State University/Rapid City location for about 3 years now and I love it. It is a great option for people who work full-time and have to attend classes after work. It is actually known for being a huge non-traditional student location because of the hours of operation.
Freshman,5,"I'm a non traditional student, the classes that they offer online and the night classes are wonderful and it makes scheduling easier while working a full time job."
Junior,5,My professors at Black Hills State University have all helped nurture my passion for elementary education. I love going to school there and would not change my experiences there for anything. 
College Sophomore,5,Have no issue on campus
College Sophomore,5,Schoolndoes not have a problem
College Sophomore,5,I always feel I can talk to any professors or departments.....My course load is 15 to 16 hrs per semester
College Sophomore,5,I have many choices to choose from
College Senior,5,BhSu is a great school with awesome faculty. It is located in the Black Hills which makes it even more attractive. There are tons of outdoor activities. Hiking is my favorite!
College Sophomore,5,I am attending BHSU and its business program has the AACSB accredited which is top 5% accredidation in the world
College Sophomore,5,The security on campus is great! Well lit campus and two bike patrols are deployed every night.
College Sophomore,5,"Ive been a big fish in a little pond and it has been amazing to get to know the dean of my college and have her help me decide what I want to do with my degree. I have multiple jobs on campus and are a part of Student Senate, Delagates, and started the first fraternity on campus."
College Freshman,5,It's all great. There are plenty of classes and the professors are usually there for you.
College Freshman,5,I had a good experiences will all my professors.
College Student,5,The classes sizes are small enough to where if you need help you can get it very easily. The professors are extremely nice and outgoing most of the time.  The courses are easy so far and i dont think the work load is to much for someone to not be able to handle it. So far its nice. And you can also work a full time job and still have time to do other things and not feel rushed with class work because the teachers make it easily understandable work.
College Student,5,My friends that have graduated said its great....BUT i havent made it that far to know lol.
College Student,5,Its extremely convenient being able to have night classes!. Ive been in class for 2 weeks and this is my first time for college courses. Everyone is friendly. Classes are awesome And most of the teachers actually make it feel like you want to go back there. in high school it wasn't like that.
College Student,5,BH has some of the best school spirit I've ever seen. By far better than the school of mines!. I hope to compete next year with BH while attending there.
College Freshman,5,"Campus feels very safe, never have had a problem."
College Freshman,5,Professors are great and for the most part very passionate about the subjects they teach. Small class sizes.
College Freshman,5,"Whenever I walk around campus, I almost always see a campus security vehicle. I feel very safe at my school and I know everyone else does too."
College Freshman,5,I was lucky enough to get into the brand new dorm this year. We have a bathroom to every two rooms and our rooms are cozy and open. My RA does great things for our hall and we are all like a big family. The atmosphere are the dorm is great and everyone gets along just fine.
College Freshman,5,I would definitely choose the same school over again. I love the campus and everyone is welcoming and nice. The campus is surrounded by the Black Hills and it is just beautiful to walk around and see everything. I really enjoy meeting new people and I couldn't of asked for better friends to accompany me through this journey.
College Junior,5,"I feel that everyone on campus is very aware of the dangers out there, however, I've never felt even a little unsafe while on campus. It's a great community with wonderful people."
College Junior,5,I'm a transfer student at Black Hills State University and from the day I transferred I knew it was a great choice. I've been undecided for a while about my major and they really helped me figure out what I wanted to do. I absolutely love their photography program and the instructors are phenomenal.
College Senior,5,"I love the school I decided to go to, the staff is wonderful and so willing to help. They understand that students have a personal life that can interfere with studies sometimes and are willing to work with you if needed, all you have to do is communicate. The work is hard enough to challenge students but not hard enough to overwhelm them."
College Sophomore,5,Campus quality is great.  Well kept landscaping and the facilities are kept clean.  Love that there is a coffee shop inside the library.
College Sophomore,5,The town is a great size and there is so much to do out in the Black Hills
College Freshman,5,Great option of unique dining options as well as a variety of chains
College Senior,5,Everything is accessible to all students.
College Sophomore,5,"Just ask, and they are more than willing to help."
College Student,5,Attending UCRC parking is always available.
College Student,5,I've heard nothing but positive remarks about the education program I am in. Its one of the best in the nation. I'm pretty excited to move forward into it.
Sophomore,4,"All of my classes so far have been online, and they are going very well. I really appreciate the work my professors put into making my online classes enjoyable."
Niche User,4,"Black Hills State University is a pretty good school if you are majoring in education, psychology, or business. Those are the majors that it is very successful in. It is not very STEM savvy, but it does offer some courses with great professors. The town of Spearfish is gorgeous and offers many college discounts. There are many small businesses and hiking spots. Great college town with a good college."
Niche User,4,I am a dual credit student at the BHSU Campus in Rapid City. I've had good professors and an overall good dual credit experience. The transition from high school to college classes was a little difficult because I didn't get the same resources as a college student would have and I felt a little under-informed. I've also had a difficult time seeing my grades as most of my professors choose not to publicly post them. I love the easy access to this campus and and the opportunities they give students here even though it's not the main campus in Spearfish. Overall I've had a good time here and I think it was a good decision to take classes at the BHSU Campus- Rapid City.
Freshman,4,Teachers really focus on giving students the opportunity to view all sides of a topic. They try their hardest to not be extremely bias. Everyone is friendly and the opportunities here are endless.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Black Hills State. The campus is beautiful, the professors are wonderful and helpful, and there's always something fun and exciting to do."
Freshman,4,"Great school! So many options to learn from. Make as many friends and meet new people. 
Great place to live and start a new chapter. 
Weather conditions are perfect."
Sophomore,4,"Black Hills State University is a great school. It is small enough that professors know who you are, but big enough to feel different from high school. The professors are great teachers, and they really care about your education! Tuition is low, especially in-state. As with most colleges, I wish dorm and meal plan prices were lower, but overall, the school gets 4 stars."
Sophomore,4,"I would say that Black Hills State is very good academically. They have high success rates with their students and prepare them well for whatever degree one is pursuing. They do have some disorganization at the paperwork level and it can sometimes take a while to get an issue worked out, that is just a technical matter, but they do try their hardest to get someone what they need. I enjoy this university a great deal. The campus is small and community oriented. There are opportunities galore to be involved and make friends and just benefit oneself and others through volunteering and community service. Overall, a very good school."
Sophomore,4,"Black Hills State is a near-perfect crossover of a medium-scale university surrounded not only by a small and friendly community, but also a vast and adventurous landscape for those who love the outdoors. You can find a large scale of opportunity both on campus and within the community of Spearfish itself. The professors are very friendly and caring of their students' education. I love this school, as it is rich with new experiences and new opportunities."
Junior,4,"Great Scenery, Great professors, challenging courses, but overall great university. I transferred from a community college to attend Black Hills State University. I came from California to South Dakota to play football, and really enjoy the area."
Freshman,4,"A good variety of classes and degrees, and good quality education. The teaching, photography, and business degree programs especially excel. The food is good, there is quite a bit of diversity of students, and very friendly, knowledgeable staff."
Junior,4,"Overall, I like going to school here. Except that some of the advisers are terrible and no help whatsoever. You would be better off on your own then ask them for help. Same goes with some teachers, 90% of the professors I've had were amazing but the rest were awful and didn't try to help answer your questions."
Junior,4,It is a small college that has your basic programs.  It is a clean campus but has older dorm rooms.  The bookstore on campus is stocked well and there are a couple places to grab coffee on your way to class.
Sophomore,4,"I love how small this school is. All of my professors know me by name, and it's a private school education for half the cost. The facilities are newly renovated, and there's plenty of places to study on campus. I feel very safe when I'm walking by myself, and the atmosphere of this school is amazing."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful. Lots of hiking and fun things to visit close by! Small school environment. Large variety of majors, minors, and classes. Lots of clubs and student activities."
Freshman,4,"Bhsu is a small town quiet college for those looking to do the work and not a party life. crime free, outdoor adventures like hiking and biking. Football is big around here, church clubs, and the college is heavy on business, science, and education degrees. Dorms are ok, but you must leave during 3-week Christmas break and a weak long spring break"
Junior,4,"I absolutely value my College and think highly of Black Hills State University. My purpose to my existence is believed to make a difference for this world, and Black Hills State is the stepping stone for me to reach my dreams and Goals. The opportunities that is provided is absolutely amazing.
Within Black Hills State University, I do Believe that there is always room for improvement. Some of the ideas or comments I hear from others are petty improvements. I believe there is potential to make a change on the young minds of students, we need to open our eyes and see the world that surrounds us, we need to be more accepting towards the others that stand near us, we need to rise as a community as a first change to start the changes that we all need to make for the world.
 Thank you."
Freshman,4,Spearfish is a good community and location. BHSU is a nice size and offers many activities for students.
Sophomore,4,"I love BHSU, and Spearfish is such a beautiful place to live. My experience here has been good overall. The food in the cafeteria certainly isn't the greatest, but it's not the worst either. The professors are all very friendly and one-on-one. They are always willing to help whenever you need it. The campus isn't very big, which is something that I like. I came from a small high school so attending a small college made it easier to adjust. Everyone here is very friendly and I get really positive vibes from being here!"
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second year of college at BHSU and can say that I do overall like the school. The class sizes are small enough to promote conversation and real participation, while not being stiflingly small. I've liked most of my professors and love all the professors in my major. The history department, my major, is small enough that I know each history professor fairly well. My only complaint about the school is that they don't offer in-state tuition to Nebraskan people."
Sophomore,4,"I go to Black Hills State University in Rapid City, it's a much smaller campus, I like that the classes are a bit smaller and gives the teachers and students more of a one-on-one, however I don't like the 3 hour long classes. It can be difficult to pay attention for so long."
Freshman,4,"This is an excellent school, especially for the price. Because of the affordable tuition, there are a lot of diverse people that attend here from all over the world which creates a very interesting and fun environment for the students."
Niche User,4,"On July 18, 2016 I had a scheduled personal visit to Black Hills State University in Spearfish, South Dakota. My visit was amazing. This is my first choice  school. I like how small the school is. I am from a small town in South Dakota, so I like the small environment. The student showing me around told me, ""Here, you aren't just a number. You are a student. Professors will make time for you if you are struggling."" This made my decision easier. Since it's a small school, I like the fact that a professor will take time out of their day to help me."
College Sophomore,4,I like where I live it is a smaller dorm and cl9s to everything I need
College Sophomore,4,I have had very good school experience so far
College Sophomore,4,It's a very good small university. It seems relatively well known in the surrounding areas.
College Sophomore,4,The professor truly are the most enjoyable part of BHSU.
College Sophomore,4,"A small campus, seems very safe. I have never felt threatened or have been afraidz"
College Senior,4,I had a great experience with professors. They are really helpful!
College Senior,4,Majority of the people who graduate get a job within 1 year.
College Senior,4,I feel safe on campus
College Senior,4,Sports are a big part of this school. It doesn't matter if you are on a varsity sport or intramurals you'll get the same access
College Sophomore,4,"At first, I wasn't very excited about going to BHSU, but once I had gotten comfortable with everyone and the classes, I began  to think of Black Hills State University as second home for me and others."
College Sophomore,4,The school has great accredidation and a very helpful staff! The teachers want you to succeed and if you show up to class you will.
College Sophomore,4,It is mainly staight and white. That being said we have many international students and the community is a very accepting college when it comes to LGBT.
College Senior,4,"I think that the work load can be a bit much sometimes, but the professors are great! As long as you work hard and attend class, they are willing to work with you!"
College Senior,4,I have enjoyed my college experience thus far!
College Senior,4,Very attentive and aware members in the community area.
College Senior,4,"It's a teaching school, so I feel that a lot of courses are related to my degree"
College Senior,4,"I think that the cost could be a little less since the dorms are clean and nice, but very basic."
College Senior,4,What makes my school unique is that it has created an acutal University center for tradtional and not-traditional to attain their degrees through the university. It's very convenient and has a nice facility.
College Sophomore,4,It is a good school! There are somethings about it I would tweak but thats life.
College Sophomore,4,I wish there were more activities on campus that students were actually interested in going to
College Sophomore,4,"The health center is very professional, campus security is great as well!"
College Sophomore,4,"I really liked the dorms, it was spacious for a dorm room and clean. Everyone was super nice as well!"
College Sophomore,4,"The education part is amazing, but I wish there were more extra activities to take part in. And activities that students actually want to go to."
College Freshman,4,It's pretty safe around BHSU. Campus police are usually patrolling the area.
College Freshman,4,BHSU is a very nice campus. The Professors and faculty are very helpful and very knowledgeable.
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are perfect. The courses that the campus offers are great and there is a wide variety. The professors are awesome very understanding and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"All though I have not applied for any job/internships with in the school yet, I have friends who have an they absolutely love it."
College Sophomore,4,I never feel like I need to watch my back on campus while walking around alone.
College Sophomore,4,My Overall Experience with my college is great. The Professors are super nice and understanding. The school is inviting and feels like you are always in a safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,BHSU is a great school professor wise. They actually care about student development and success. Most students stick to the friend groups they have already created and do not welcome new students but the campus is a beautiful place in all the seasons.
College Freshman,4,I am opening my own business upon graduation.
College Freshman,4,I have nothing bad to say about this school other than the Financial Aid Process could be much better.
College Freshman,4,I have had no issues with feeling unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,4,BHSU has awesome school spirit.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of school spirit, and access to sports facilities all the time."
College Freshman,4,Very welcoming and friendly campus!
College Freshman,4,"At every school event, most students are there screaming and cheering their heads off for our team. Our teams may not be the best, but the school spirit that is displayed is extraordinary."
College Freshman,2,Not a very good school.
College Freshman,2,The staff are very rude
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot goes on in this town. There are some house parties but there is no greek life or anything. And the police really come down hard on house parties.
College Sophomore,2,"I started the first fraternity, Sigma Tau Gamma, on campus since the 1990's and we have received little support from the student body. We remain the only greek life on campus."
College Sophomore,2,We just moved from NAIA to D2 and its been tough. We aren't very good and the coaches are not adjusting very well. As an old prospect of this school I have little respect for both the football and men's basketball head coaching staff.
College Student,2,This place is not your typical college...The social hosting law here makes it impossible to have any sort of night life whatsoever. Everyone here is a stoner so its hard to make friends..The only good thing about this place is that the classes are easy.
College Freshman,2,"I came into my first year of on-campus living with a very positive attitude and was eager to experience dorm life. The people in my hall first semester were pretty cool, though I was placed in the dorm that was known to be home to the kids who were known to be ""trouble"". By second semester a vast majority of my friend group had either dropped out, transferred, or moved elsewhere, and they were replaced with people that I was less than interested in getting to known very well. The dorms are expensive for the cost, the RA's/night assistants are on duty until 5am EVERY night, and even falling asleep on the couch in the lobby will get you a $75 fine. Oh, and if your a girl, be prepared to deal with alarming bathroom conditions, such as unpleasant fluids on the toilet seats CONSTANTLY and hairballs which greet you from the same spot on the floor/shower wall for weeks. It could be worse, but I wish I would've known the downsides prior to moving in."
College Junior,2,Its not the worst I have seen but it has a long way to go till it is a great place to be.
College Junior,2,There are few scholarships if you are from out of state. Their office is ran basically by students so help is minimal. I often end up with large monthly payments during the school year due to Fasfa not covering everything.
College Senior,2,"The party scene is not my scene. I have honestly only been to one college party at BHSU, and it was at an off campus apartment. It was just a bunch of drunk students socializing."
College Freshman,2,I hate it here education wise.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know a lot about the off campus housing really.
College Sophomore,2,I got the financial aid I needed but it took a lot of time.
College Sophomore,2,"The internet works poorly every where on campus, it drives me crazy that I'm paying a lot of money to live in the dorms and have to leave campus to get my homework done"
College Sophomore,2,I feel like the school only offers a handful of scholarships and you have to fit in well with school politics to get one
College Senior,2,"I personally have not been to a campus that makes students pay for using a printer or copier (if they have its been in the tutition). Computer labs are used for several classes and can only be found in one building besides the library. Good luck if you need a computer during midterms or finals week, there usually is not a computer or space or quiet room to be found."
College Freshman,2,"This winter has been terrible, the blizzard we had killed us and the snow this year has been terrible. During a normal season though, the weather tends to be on the chillier side because we're in the mountains, but pleasant."
College Sophomore,2,"We have one sorority, and since they don't actually have a house, they act more like a club. They have a couple of events during the year but nothing that really attracts a lot of people on campus."
College Student,2,"students use there own cars or walk,"
College Junior,2,Our teams hardly ever win
College Freshman,2,It's something you really have to search for around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"At BHSU we only have the option for females to join a sorority. I know that they wish to expand the Greek life on campus, and personally I believe it'd be a good thing, but attempts to do so have thus far proved to be futile. "
College Freshman,2,"As an athlete, its incredibly difficult to find places that meet our high-maintainance eating needs. I also happen to be a celiac, so its very difficult when there very very VERY few restaurants that offer gluten free dishes. There are mostly fast food joints, and a few bar and grill spots. For a small town, i would have expected more local places, but there are ver few of them. It's also incredibly frustrating that there isn't a place to buy natural groceries. "
College Freshman,2,"The only thing that sets this school apart from the others is that there is awesome support from the community. The school is in a small town, so the whole town supports anything that has to do with the school, which is a nice refresher because a lot of schools don't have that. "
College Freshman,2,"The bar/club scene isn't my scene. However, there is only one night club in the town and everyone goes there on the weekends. House parties are very rare. Its difficult to know that I'll have a fun weekend. A lot of kids stay in on the weekends and don't do much. The town offers very little opportunities for fun in general, especially in the winter. In the summer it's decent, because theres a lot of outdoor things to do, but a lot of things cost money, so it's hard to go out and do things a lot when living on a strict and limited college budget. "
College Freshman,2,"Selections are generally the same, with one or two dishes changed each time. The food is very salty, and there is a severe lack of nutritional options like whole grain, vegetables, and fruit. "
College Freshman,2,"The school does not have much to offer in scholarships, and it seems that athletes get the majority of scholarships, which is quite unfair for academic students."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from an international background, I get along well with the surprisingly large amount of international students on campus. Sadly, the majority of non-international students don't care or socialize with international students. I am a special case, coming from an international background but enrolled as a domestic, American student, but find myself grouped with the international students, and insulted by the lack of understanding and open-mindedness of the domestic students."
College Junior,2,"I do not think that we have involvement of this at my school, if there is I am unaware of it and their activities. "
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is few and far between - high rents, shambled apartments and landlords and cost surprisingly high considering the rural location."
College Sophomore,2,"You can't really help the weather because it's typical unpredictable South Dakota weather. Sometimes it'll snow in May then it'll be especially warm on a random day at a random time in February. Snow isn't really a trouble, especially since most people who go to school here have lived in state for a while, or in the surrounding radius so everyone has some sort of experience with it. Most days it's either sort of gloomy, or flat out beautiful. But you can't rely on it to stay sunny five days in row."
College Freshman,2,I don't care enough about college sports to pay attention to their programs.
College Freshman,2,I have only heard of one sorority at BH. And I havent' heard much about it
College Freshman,2,I hate walking across campus in the winter. Fall and late Spring is wonderful though
College Freshman,2,"Dining within campus is okay. The food isn't overly spectacular, and only on days where high school students are coming to visit does the quality only slightly change. The food is overall average and not fantastic by any means. The desserts are usually quite hard and they'll serve the same ones over and over until someone eats them all. There isn't any breakfast on campus, only lunch and dinner, and if you miss lunch because of classes, you'll only be able to eat dinner, and if you skip both, then you're out of luck.
 For special events like sports, sometimes they will close down the main dining area and serve food at the gym, but it's usually light food that would be better served as lunch. The variety of the food served isn't vast and usually one can expect the same food cooked in different ways everyday."
College Freshman,2,"Housing is pretty average at BH, every dorm or residence hall is different in their own way. The dorms have a lot of history to them, which is usually interesting to read about it or hear from the people who watch over the halls at night. While some of the rules are a bit odd (sleeping on a couch is a fire hazard), there are plenty more things that a resident can do as opposed to what they can't do. Visitors can stay over night, as long as you sign them in, you can work out in the halls, and the gym is free for all students. The housing process isn't bad, but if you pay to live in a dorm, you have to comply to the school meal plan, or else you'll have to appeal the meal plan. You usually get your first choice of which hall to live in, and if you request to live with someone on the payment form, you usually get them every time.
 Majority of the people that live in the residence halls are fairly nice, though many of these people are still young adults that aren't completely out of their teenage years. If you don't request a special roommate, they choose one for you, and it's completely random. You may get lucky and find a good  person compatible with you, or someone that you won't get along with at all.
 It also costs more to live in a room by yourself, because you have to specially pay to live alone. If you want to go here from out of state, there is a chance you'd have to live in a dorm for two years (unless you become a resident of the state) as opposed to one year. Usually when filling out a housing form, you are contacted within 24 hours, no matter if it's the weekend or not."
College Freshman,2,Nightlife is for 21+. I don't party but a party at someone's house is what most people do.
College Freshman,2,This school was just opened in May of 2011. There are massive open fields all around the school and a much bigger chunk of that land should have been used for parking- especially since enrollments usually increase every year.
College Sophomore,2,"Overall I really do not care for the food that the BHSU cafeteria supplies. Yes, it is something to eat, but I feel for the amount that students have to pay, the food could be a lot better. I also think that if you are living in the dorms, you shouldn't have to base your mean plan off of it. Personally myself the past two years have lived in the dorms, and I am required to have the 150 meal plan. I am wasting money, because I'm not able to eat 150 meals every semester. I think these options are good to be given, but shouldn't base it off where the student lives for the year of attending the University."
College Junior,2,"Not the Greatest Instuctors – The instuctors do not teach concepts needed for their test and just the expect the students to know the material like they can pull it out of their hat because the material on the test was never in the material give or gone over before the test. However, the workload is about average."
Senior,1,This school is terrible! They make changes to your classes after what you agree to take. Then make more after the semester starts so you have to pay more for the class. The financial aid department is terrible and the VA rep is terrible about completing the requestes on time.
College Sophomore,1,Its a dry campus. It sucks trying to go to a football game (which we arent very good at) and not being able to have a buzz.
College Sophomore,1,They tried but thankfully they failed.
College Freshman,1,I would've had a better experience if i was placed in a different dorm.
College Student,1,I live in the new dorms so its good. Its very expensive and there is little to none other options here.
College Student,1,We don't have a greek life. There was a group of kids who tried to start it and got denied.
College Freshman,1,I feel that the school should not go off of what your parents make because some parents won't help their child with school.
College Freshman,1,The food is either burnt or frozen no in between
College Junior,1,There is little to no available housing and it is way over priced for a town with no income.
College Junior,1,Every where closes by 8pm during the week and 10pm on the weekend.
College Junior,1,Our food is often not cooked all the way. The company they contracted with recently charges us roughly $8 a meal and they are awful with a small time window.
College Sophomore,1,the campus is pretty strict. They seem to be too strict though.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't many off campus restaurants that are close to the school.
College Student,1,I don't go to parties usually
College Sophomore,1,It's awful and dirty and cramped. I can't stand it.
College Sophomore,1,"If we have any public  transportation in Spearfish, I haven't seen it in two years. The campus is very small, though, so as long as you don't want to go anywhere else in Spearfish you don't need a car. If you want to go to the bank, or wal-mart, or to a restaurant however, a car is necessary."
College Junior,1,They say one thing and do the opposite
College Freshman,1,"The only place that my parking permit allows me to park is horribly far from my dorm and extremely far from where all of my classes are. It's frustrating when I have to carry a lot of grocery bags for instance close to a mile from my car to my dorm. The parking pass was very reasonable, however its frustrating that it doesn't allow us to park anywhere. It's only for one specific parking lot. The campus parking enforcers also give out way too many parking passes and its difficult to park anywhere so just a few minutes because you get slapped with a ticket. There really is no need for a car ON campus, however you need one to get around town. The only supermarkets are too far to walk to, so a car is definitely necessary. "
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life at school. There might be some business related fraternities, but I'm not sure. If there is, it's very poorly advertised. I think there should be Greek life though, because aside from stereotypes, people who go Greek do great things for the community. They also teach a sense of responsibility and team work to people. I think all schools should have greek life."
College Freshman,1,"There are not nearly enough computers in the library, and there are only a few printers, which causes them to often get backed up. I don't even think that there are any computer labs on campus. I have my own laptop, and the printers have wireless compatibility, but the software does not support Mac (which is what a very big majority of the students use). The wi-fi is unbearably slow, and it often interferes with doing homework and turning it in on time. However, with that, i can connect to wi-fi anywhere on campus, which is nice. "

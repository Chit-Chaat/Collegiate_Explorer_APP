Freshman,5,The university uses Zoom classes in the replacement of didactic learning. It has been great so far. I am able to participate with everyone in my classes and collaborate in a different way.
Freshman,5,"So far, this school is wonderful. The school and professors have helped me open my eyes to Christianity. I feel welcome in all of my classes."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with AdventHealth University has been amazing. The moment I heard about the school,I wanted to attend. This university offers so much to every student and the faculty will do their very best to help you with anything you need."
Freshman,5,"Currently I am taking online classes due to COVID19 but I must say that it is going really well.  The teachers have been doing a really good job with making it feel like we are in an actual class setting.  Since it is online now, the professors make a lot of power points and lecture polls  and my favorite, panopto recordings which are really helpful and nice to listen to."
Freshman,5,"I have not begun my academic career at Adventhealth University.   Since the global pandemic has begun I have spent much time away from, work and has left my time to think about my academic career, or lack of, and my future in general. So, two months ago I made the decision to go. back to school."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love my university. If you choose to be involved and participate in university activities, you will build an amazing community in no time. The professor  are loving, caring and  kind. People care for you. Education is splendid  and clinical experience is one of a kind. There is no doubt a student won't become a successful healthcare provider in this university. Housing may not be the  best but there  are always students willing to move out with. The only downfall in this university is the lack of athletics  due to being very  academic. Other than that, the diversity and the quality is 5/5. I highly recommend this school for everyone who is serious in healthcare career."
Sophomore,5,"Adventhealth University is a great school, great environment and staff genuinely care about your education and your future career. The class sizes are a good size and the labs are updated and resemble Advent Health Hospital settings."
Sophomore,5,"Advent Health is a little bit more expensive to attend, but the professors, chaplains and staff genuinely care about your education and your future career. The class sizes are a good size and the labs are updated and resemble Advent Health Hospital settings."
Niche User,5,"My family members enjoyed their time at AHU and went on in life to do big things in the medical field. I have been to the campus and it is very pretty, gives off a very nice feel. I would love to attend this school in my the future it one of my top schools to apply for."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere at AdventHealth University is one that promotes success, through thorough professors who work towards achievement in tandem with students to extracurricular options such as tutoring that are offered. This college cultivates a mindset that is so necessary to success in the healthcare field."
Junior,5,"Students, professors, and faculty at Advent Health University are a family. Being a small campus with small class sizes really gives one the opportunity to create great friends and student partners, along with very motivational professors. Over the course of a trimester, one feels well-understood and accounted for at this school. Being a Seventh-Day Adventist school, no religious pressure is put upon their students. Although, it is encouraged, no student is forced to make any religious decision while at this school. The students and staff really demonstrate a caring atmosphere, that makes you feel welcomed."
Sophomore,5,"AdventHealth University is a school for the most determined students. Every student has one, same goal- to work in the health field. The campus and class sizes are very small, which promotes strong relationships between students, professors, faculty, and peers. AdventHealth is also a faith-based school. It will not force faith upon anyone and AdventHealth is open to all faiths. This school helps connect you to your faith, only if you would like to include your faith in your studies. I have never been to a school that cares for you as much as this one does. Everyone here truly wants you to succeed. Here, you will always have help and a bright future ahead!"
Niche User,5,I love AdventHealth University. I think its the best nursing school in Florida. They are a hands-on school and you can learn a lot from your peers and your teachers. Their class sizes are amazing and I wouldn't change anything about them.
Freshman,5,"I love that it is a smaller college, faith based, and how personable the professors are. I haven’t encountered a bad situation yet. Everyone is there to help eachother out. The technology and equipment is up to date and extremely helpful. It’s very hands on and you get the best of the best."
Alum,5,"If you are interested in attending a college that has small classes, then this is the place for you. The professors are dedicated to helping their students succeed. Anther great thing about this school is, it is a Christian college, so if are interested in expressing your faith this is a great university."
Sophomore,5,"Private, small classes, teachers are professionals and dedicated to students success, latest lab equipment, great security and transportation. Safe environment on campus and dorms."
Senior,5,I love that this college is small and christian based. The teachers are amazing and are always available to help. The teachers really care about your success in their classes. They offer tutoring services for free and your able to make appointments when you're struggling in certain classes. The only thing I would change is the parking because taking a  shuttle becomes a problem at times.
Freshman,5,"This college is a very good close nit school. Adventist university student to teacher ratios are very good due to the fact  that you can have a one on one with your teacher to further understand the lesson, not just that  there is free tutoring to help you further understand everything learned. They  want you to succeed as a person but also in the medical field."
Junior,5,I really enjoy this school. It is smaller but the education you are receiving is top of the line. You get that one on one with all of your teachers when needed. All of the clinical sites for any health science program is through Florida Hospital. Therefore you are offered exceptional education from the colleges there. All around this school is a great atmosphere that any student should be apart of.
Sophomore,5,I liked that they answered all questions I had. I liked that the advisor helped me decided what I need to do. They do give second chances.
Senior,5,"Adventist University of Health Sciences genuinely cares for their students. I started attending ADU in 2016. The online classrooms are very easy to navigate, the professors are easy to get in touch with, and the student advisors are prompt and helpful. I recommend ADU to anyone who is looking to further their education with an online degree."
Freshman,5,"I like the professional atmosphere of the college.  There is free tutoring. The school adequately prepares you for your career.  There are limited sport activities, however."
Junior,5,"As a transfer student from a large university student to this college my transition has been remarkable. They met all of my needs and made me feel right at home. All of the professors are beyond qualified to do their job and make learning an enjoyable experience. I never thought I would end up at a Adventist university obtaining a degree in health sciences, yet here I am and it feels like a perfect fit."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so incredibly nice and helpful! They make sure that you are taken care of! This is my first semester here and feel very welcomed. I am excited for all of the hands on experience that they are going to be giving us. As well as making sure everyone is always included as well. You feel welcomed right when you first get there. And all of the other students are glad to be there as well.
Niche User,5,"My experience with the Adventist University of Health Sciences was spectacular. Here on this campus, you meet new people in which you learn new perspective that can be used in overall life. The staff and administration alone create an atmosphere so welcoming that you will feel right at home."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Adventist university of health sciences is how diverse and welcoming it is. When you need help in a certain area of study, the tutoring center is more than welcome to assist and help you understand the subject."
Freshman,5,"This is by far the best University I have inquired about. They are all about the students and making sure we are comfortable and have everything that we need for a successful future.

Every trimester they make sure that there are team building and student building activities as well as making sure we are fed as well!"
Sophomore,5,"Great university! The professors and advisors are very personal and willing to help you in any way they can! The school is small so you can get a more personal connection with everybody the professors, the advisors, and the students!"
Graduate Student,5,"We all know that live and work in Afghanistan is very hard especially for girls . We can not continue our education and our study actually I really need to go another country and continue my education and save my life 
because in my country is not security that I can continue my study and I hope to accept my request ."
Senior,5,Best School I could've asked for! As someone who transferred from UCF to a smaller more healthcare focused university it was definitely a great decision and has left me with very memorable experiences
Freshman,5,ADU is a very well faith based college. The staff and teachers are friendly and caring and want the best for the students. It is well kept meaning very clean and beautiful inside and out the school.
Junior,5,What I like about ADU is the small classes and no matter what you are going through there is always someone on campus to listen to you and try to help you it may not always be your professor or adviser but with God in the picture he shows someone there that you need an ear to borrow. The students and Faculty are also friendly.
Niche User,5,"When I went to Adventist for a tour it felt so amazing. Its a small school with so many benefits. They give real life experience and help in many ways. From one on one tutoring, help in your writing and being able to have communication with your teacher and academic advisor. The staff was very kind and respectful. Out of any school I have toured, ADU caught my eyes."
Senior,5,I absolutely love this school. I've been to other universities before and none have cared about me the way that the employees here do. Everyone is very nice and helpful and they are always available
Alum,5,"I received a stellar education that prepared me to get A's at the very beginning of my Masters degree pursuit.  The instructors took the time to correct my mistakes, guide me to be a better professional writer, and pushed me to evaluate the integrity of both research studies and peer-reviewed articles."
College Senior,5,Adventist University of Health Sciences fosters positivity in every aspect. Faculty and staff genuinely care about each student's well-being and success throughout each course. I feel nurtured and successful with the school on my side. There are numerous volunteer opportunities and organizations to join in order to become more knowledgeable and well rounded.
College Sophomore,5,Guards are visibly and actively present every time I go outside
College Sophomore,5,I believe this school is perfect perfect for my future job
College Sophomore,5,Truly an incredible school with great friendly atmosphere
College Sophomore,5,This school was everything I ever wanted. Exceeded all expectations!
College Junior,5,The quality of courses and professors are excellent. The professors are very skilled and knowledgeable in their field.
College Junior,5,I feel very safe at our school. We have campus security present all the time.
College Junior,5,Adventist University of Health Sciences is a wonderful school! The professors start each class out with devotion and prayer which means a lot to me. Everyone is so friendly on campus. You feel genuinely cared about from the professors and they really take the time and effort to get to know you individually.
College Junior,5,classes and professors are amazing
College Junior,5,the school is highly respectable and the value of a degree from ADU is high as well as job prospects after graduation
College Junior,5,I absolutely love going to school there. Staff is always helpful and kind. The students are a melting pot of all cultures and religions. The classes are all interesting and easy.
College Senior,5,"In my program classes, the professors are extremely helpful. They care about people passing the class and making sure everyone is comfortable and informed about what is going on. They work with people individually if an event occurs. Classes are small about 20-25 people making it easy to grow closer with other classmates. The style of learning is great as they use ways to do group projects, fun presentations, and even go out into real life situations and work hands on with other people."
College Freshman,5,"My Overall Experience here has been nothing but amazing! Everyone is very nice and helpful. What I like most is that the teachers and the staff want you to succeed and they will help you in any possible way that they can so that you can get good grades. I love the atmosphere and how peaceful the campus looks, I also love that the teachers are there to help you and will pray for you if you have any trouble in classes or even outside of school."
Recent Alumnus,5,A lot of students live off campus
Recent Alumnus,5,Orlando you can always find something to do!
Recent Alumnus,5,It doesn't bother me. We are a private school so you can't expect to have any type of drinking allowed.
College Junior,5,"Everything is medical based from radiography, sonography, and nursing"
College Junior,5,The classes are so informative and fun to learn in
College Junior,5,"campus security is very helpful and so friendly, no complainants"
College Junior,5,"The safety is amazing, I feel completely safe while on campus"
College Junior,5,"The curriculum is varied, and seems very interesting."
College Junior,5,My academic advisor was worried I was enrolling in to many classes.
College Junior,5,"I have a distance learning advisor who has helped me throughout the application process, and will help me until I graduate."
College Junior,5,"It has a great price for a bachelors degree, and I can do it completely online!"
College Senior,5,"no drugs or alcohol, serious students"
Senior,4,The experience has been very good. I recommend this school to anyone who would like to work in the healthcare field.
Senior,4,"The professors have been very supportive and understanding during this journey of online learning. Because of that and all the motivation received, I have been able to achieve my academic goals."
Freshman,4,"Overall, AHU is a wonderful University. All of the professors are very knowledgeable and willing to help when needed. The classes are engaging and the OTA program that I am in is constructed in a professional manner. The Financial Aid office can be hard to reach but overall, AHU is an all-inclusive diverse school."
Freshman,4,"Overall, doing college online is manageable. It gives me more freedom to space things out; however, it seems like I need to do twice the amount of work because Im not on campus and I have to make sure I am up to date with all of my assignments in canvas (sometimes I miss seeing them) Professors are always willing to help and the students are very encouraging and supportive."
Sophomore,4,"Pretty costly, but very nice professors and students. The student involvement is high and it very evident in the events held. The campus is beautiful and the mission of the school is wholesome and inviting. There needs to be more scholarship opportunities."
Sophomore,4,Some professors are difficult (just as with any school). They start class with a devotion and are clear about their grading.
Sophomore,4,I believe that AdventHealth University is a great school and that is why I decided to transfer there instead of going to a different institution. I love how I am able to attend a university that shares and respects the same religious beliefs as me. I know that the education that I am receiving will help me to develop the necessary skills to become a nurse. Overall AdventHealth University has a special place in my heart and I'm proud to be a student at this school!
Freshman,4,What I most like about AdventHealth Univerity is the people in general. The professors and students are very welcoming and makes you feel like home. The campus is beautiful. It has a nice view ti a lake where it can be perfect to relax and study at times.
Senior,4,"My experience with AdventHealth University has been a great one! I feel like I have received a very good education and all of my professors have been very helpful, understanding, and prompt when replying to my emails."
Sophomore,4,I love advent health. The school’s made me want to work harder and become a better version of myself. The only thing is that I wish financial aid here worked differently. It’s complicated and the advisors think they’re helping you but no ones really helping you. The school’s expensive as it is and they don’t make it easier.
Sophomore,4,"The school has a great atmosphere for learning. The class sizes are generally under 40 students, the professors are happy to help, and the property is safe and monitored by security. One common complaint of the school is that they do not accept transfer credits well. They will make you practically start over as a freshman standing, no matter how many courses you have completed previously."
Niche User,4,So far the experience had been exhilarating. I'm excited to become a student and also complete this program so I May continue to soar
Junior,4,This school has a staff that promotes Christian values. The academics are great and they have free tutoring for the classes you need help with. There is not much of a party scene but there is a lot to do in the Orlando area. And if you are into community service there is an annual mission trip that is planned.
Freshman,4,"I am a first-year nursing student, and I am very impressed with the quality of the professors and classes offered here. In addition, almost every student here is highly dedicated to their studies, so class morale is very high. While the university is affiliated with the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, it is not cliquey at all, and there are students from just about every faith. Classes are not easy, but the tutoring center is excellent, and I am very grateful for the opportunities we students are given here."
Freshman,4,"It is a great college overall. The professors are welcoming s well as other staff and faculty. There is a spirit of unity on campus that I loved. The only thing I don't like is that they don't have many scholarships to help students pay for college, especially siblings. The financial aid office needs to actually try to help students in need."
Recent Alumnus,4,They take our safety very serious.
College Junior,4,The value of a degree from this school is very important. This school is affiliated with Florida Hospital so it is not hard to get a job at their hospital with a degree from this University.
College Junior,4,security personnel are on campus and in the student parking area almost at all times
College Junior,4,Really make you feel as though they care about your individual success and are great in setting you up for the classes you will need to graduate
College Senior,4,"We do have campus security on campus and at the student parking lot as well. Even the dorms have security 24-7. I personally feel safe on campus because ending classes at night, security makes sure that every single person is out of campus and the do room/building checks to see if anyone is still on campus."
College Senior,4,A degree is very important at our school since we are Health based. Students go through internships and clinicals while being in a program to experience hands on what to do when working. It's important for students to experience these situations as they may learn from them or come across it when working in the future.
College Senior,4,"Our college is small, so it makes it easy to connect with other students and professors. It's an Adventist School which is my religion, making it great to be apart of their church events. Professors are helpful and do their best to assist you and make it through the program. I would still choose my school because of how considerate they are, because many people attending our school do have children and our school understands how busy people are as well."
Recent Alumnus,4,Im athletic and I find the facilities very useful.
College Senior,4,"The best learning experience, just pricey."
College Freshman,4,"Hospital is on campus, religion based classes, peaceful atmosphere. There are plenty of resources on campus as well as tutoring for students. I had a little bit of a rough beginning but things turned around quite fast. Everybody is upbeat. The school is fairly small compared to other colleges but allows more one on one time. The only down fall to the college is the cost $400 per credit hour....ouch!"
College Freshman,4,definitely research scholarships and grants
College Freshman,4,you interact with your peers and get to know them on a personal level
College Junior,4,There are little towns that have very tasteful selections of good selections.
Recent Alumnus,4,There areany places to choose not a lot of student discounts though.
College Junior,4,MY financial aid advisors and directors are amazing and help me in every way they can! It's the government loan regulations that I am upset with
College Junior,4,"Love the food, its awesome. very much of a variety"
Recent Alumnus,4,I do wish they would offer more science courses and less religion
College Senior,4,very responsible people watching and enforcing school policy
College Senior,4,great security and willing to help
College Student,4,There is lots of shopping in Orlando.
College Student,4,"The campus is beautiful, when the weather is nice out the campus compliments it and has many places to be able to both study and enjoy the outside living."
College Student,4,"The off campus housing isn't that much more expensive than on campus living,in fact it can be cheaper if you have a roommate and their is more freedom just as long as you know how to handle it is really what it all depends on."
College Sophomore,4,"I do not really have a problem with school strictness. I guess more is enforced for students who live in dorm rooms. As for everything else, things seem to be in order."
College Sophomore,4,Our school strives to keep a healthy environment because it is a health university. Therefore we are always required to keep track of our health records as well as renew exams each trimester. Overall the safety is okay. Security guards monitor who steps foot on campus as long as they have their id's. Yet this is not done all the time. I'd say it happens on selective days.
Recent Alumnus,4,Nice and Conservative. A lot of Seventh Day Adventists
Recent Alumnus,4,"Even though its a private University, I always managed to get my tuition paid for. Very patient and understanding."
Recent Alumnus,4,Beautiful small campus set by a lake. Its always well groomed and a peaceful place.
Recent Alumnus,4,Hospital is a walk away and has several places to eat inside. Cheap discounted and great tasting food.
Recent Alumnus,4,Small classrooms and cozy campus.
College Junior,4,Many options due to the area where the school is located.
College Junior,4,I am currently going into the Diagnostic Medical Sonography which I am very excited and nervous. Its very expensive so I am a little worried of what I am going to do. I am very positive that the workload will be very intense.
College Junior,4,"I do not live on campus, but I have heard many complain."
College Freshman,4,safety is great....there is no health center or insurance
College Junior,4,There is a wide variety of places. We have a new Falafel Shop that opened up about a mile from the school. Then there are several different ethnic food places as well as American. Also there a variety of price ranges.
Recent Alumnus,4,"This school focuses on the sciences.  Students attending this university have different goals in the way of which healthcare field they want to go into, but they all have the same goal to work within the healthcare industry.  This type of unity is unique and can give students a sense of belonging.  The school is located right next to Florida Hospital and allows students the opportunity to shadow and gain experience at the hospital."
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus is small and therefore a good fit for those preferring small class sizes or those that are intimidated by large crowds.  It is relatively easy to make friends and join in campus extracurricular events.  The campus is located near one of many lakes in Winter Park and close to parks such as Leu Gardens.
Recent Alumnus,4,"You have to park your car in a separate parking lot about a block from the school.  A shuttle runs between the parking lot and the school every five minutes. Winter Park is generally a busy town and is close to I-4 so it is important to leave early in order to make it to the parking lot, shuttle, and school in time.  Having a car is a necessity.  There are very few options for public transportation in the area."
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is tied to Florida Hospital and thus requires students to adhere to code.  Strictness is to be expected when working and studying in the healthcare field.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The university is located in Winter Park where I completed a BA at another university, Rollins, and lived there for four years.  The weather is tropical with hot summers and somewhat cool winters."
College Student,4,"Orlando, Florida! Love it-tons to do, plenty of amusement parks closeby & the beaches are pretty close too! Love going to Orlando Solar Bear games (hockey)!"
College Junior,4,"Adventist University is a college of health sciences which is great for people that are in the medical field. Includes nursing, sonography, radiology and nuch med."
College Senior,4,"The food at NESS is amazing and its good portion for the price
but its the only place you can get food.
i'd be nice to have other options
but what they do have are always top notch, the staff is awesome and Jared is an amazing chef. You can tell when he prepared your food ^_^"
College Senior,4,"For a health sciences school there is no partying or drinking and most students spend their time in their rooms.
the most excitement comes when you order pizza
I'd be nice if there were more events, But it's understandable"
College Sophomore,4,There are many races and backgrounds in this University. This keeps the opinions and thoughts of others from both ends of the spectrum. It gives you alternate ways of learning and thinking ti solve problems and gain knowledge from one another.
College Sophomore,4,During the summer months it's very hot here in Florida and the rain is an everyday thing. Once September comes it cools down and its amazing to be outside studying not having to worry about being cold or too hot.
Sophomore,2,They have a good curriculum but there teachers and availability is poor. I am a Denver campus student and we miss so many opportunities for communication. We have to learn over broadcast and we feel cut off from the class. We need more opportunities for communication and hands on learning. The teachers in Orlando do not take us seriously and do not spend as much time to make sure we understand the materials as they do for the Orlando students.
College Senior,2,We don't have any sports related events or clubs at our University since it is Health Sciences based. We do have a basketball court and soccer field for students to go to when they have free time.
College Freshman,2,They honestly don't help you much and can take a while to reply to you in an email or answer a phone call
College Freshman,2,"Too many rules, written and not written"
College Freshman,2,"Even at small events like Valentine's Karaoke gatherings, people aren't as excited as they could be. Since it's a private university, it makes sense how they lack amazing parties."
College Senior,2,"Not much focus on athletics, more so on academics"
Recent Alumnus,2,My least favorite part of the campus... hopefully they work to make this system better.
College Student,2,"Confusing & complicated, had so many forms to fill out and things to do but most of the people in financial services were very helpful. Hope to get more financial aid next year as I am struggling this year  to pay my balance, work enough & get good grades"
College Junior,2,"While I was doing my orientation at School they did a tour around the cafeteria. The food looked delicious, but I will be packing my own lunch to college to save money."
College Junior,2,I say it is average. It takes me 45 minutes to get to school and 45 minutes to go back home. I only take one class most of the time. I live 20 miles away from the school. Once I get to the parking lot you have to take a shuttle. Sometimes the driver waits for the whole bus to get filled up which sometimes ends up making you late for school. Sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes for the bus to pick up up as well.
College Junior,2,we have a cafeteria that stay open till 7:00. thats the closets place to grab something to eat.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking lot is located off campus which means students need to arrive at least 15 earlier than normal. As more students enroll in the college, the parking becomes very difficult, often times circling for a space. Location is good because the lot is easily accessible but it needs to be bigger."
College Sophomore,2,"The shuttle system currently in place struggles in the early morning because many students take 8 AM classes, leaving long lines and students late for class. The parking lot is also becoming more cramped with the increase of students that attend the school so parking is difficult on top of waiting for shuttles to arrive and depart to campus."
College Senior,2,Shuttle Buses Are So Slow! It's required for students to park at the Calvary lot which is a few miles away from the campus. You really have to plan to be early to school since you never know when the next one will show up. It can be really aggravating!
College Sophomore,2,FHCHS Is for Some – I love my adviser and some of the people and teachers are nice but i do wish i went to another school due to the money factor and other factors as well.
College Sophomore,2,"Have to park far away – If you park on campus, they will give you a warning if you don't have e parking pass. You have to park separately from the school, 2 miles away, and take a shuttle to get to school. Sometimes the shuttle drivers will make you late even though you're telling them to go so you're not late for class."
Niche User,1,"This is a ""Christian school,” which is why I choose to come here, & I was the class chaplain for the ultrasound prog. AHU is far from mercy or grace. I made 2 C's and have been dismissed from their prog. forever.
My family and 3 children are worst off from AHU. I had to deal with major health issues (and marital) that are now reasonably stable and have one required class remaining to be registered as a sonographer. We may seek legal action against them. 
There was over a 50% fail/drop rate for the class of 2019 and I'm talking about nearly straight-A students that were hand-selected for a program with this high fail rate, which is a testament of this program. We are not dealing with students that don't know how to study or manage themselves. 
I've attended multiple colleges: ERAU, Stetson, DSC and Asbury Seminary. AHU is my worst experience by far. Mind you, I'm a middle-aged adult with a BS and a Masters with 4 classes remaining to complete my second Masters degree."
College Senior,1,"There are no sports teams affiliated with the school. However there are various items to utilize from the library (kickball, football, etc.) in the grassy areas."
College Freshman,1,When you're at your worst they don't help you
College Freshman,1,This school doesn't really party
College Freshman,1,They don't call or inform you of anything until an envelope arrives in the mail addressing the need for payments within DAYS of its due date!!! I CAN'T STAND THIS OFFICE!!!
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately, their is not a sports program at my school. It is unfortunate, but my school is very small and based on the medical field. I wish there were sports programs at my school but there are not"
College Student,1,ITS HORRIBLE! the only downfall of the school.
College Student,1,In this school nobody is really worried about others they are all there for one reason and that's to get their education and to reach their goals in life.
College Student,1,This school is by no means a party school. In fact its a well rounded focused type of school geared toward the medical field!
Recent Alumnus,1,Its a University for Health Sciences... there is no Athletics. This school is not intended for that.
College Junior,1,Do not have a greek life on campus
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing offered here for Greeks
College Sophomore,1,needs more activities on campus
College Sophomore,1,Its basically an all girls school
College Sophomore,1,No sports in my school
College Sophomore,1,The counselor didn't give me any options besides taking out a huge loan that I may not be able to pay back.
College Senior,1,Have to come at least 30 minutes before class starts and the shuttles take a while to get there.
College Senior,1,The parking is the only complaint that I have about the school and surrounding area. It is difficult to find parking in Orlando in general.
College Senior,1,"Getting in – Getting in was easy, just keep your GPA up and you'll get in, the question on if you'll stay in is a harder one to anserw. The drop out rate for all the programs is about 40-60%. The instructors don't care about the needs of each person, or anyone in fact besides them selfs. It's heart breaking"
College Senior,1,"This School Has Nothing – There are no athletics,clubs,sports health clinics. This school has nothing to offer"

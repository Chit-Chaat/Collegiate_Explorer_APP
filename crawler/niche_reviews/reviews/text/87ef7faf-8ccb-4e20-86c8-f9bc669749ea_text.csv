Junior,5,My favorite thing about immaculata university is that the campus is beautiful. The professors are nice and helpful with questions. The student life is pretty good as well.
Freshman,5,"Immaculata University is such a beautiful campus. They have so many activities and clubs to become apart of and I cannot wait! Every staff worker is extremely polite and respectful and I can't wait to get to work with them more! The campus is one hundred years old, this year and it is still in tiptop shape. It is so historical and beautiful. I would like to see the campus life to change a little bit. Upperclassman say that the campus is very ""dry"" and could get a little boring at times, but I don't mind as long as I make friends and we can do stuff together! I cannot wait for my next four years at my new home!"
Freshman,5,"I like the Nursing program, what it has to offer.  The fact that the classes are not crowded and you don't get lost in the class.  The professors are approachable and that it is a beautiful campus."
Niche User,5,When I visited Immaculata it felt right at home for me. Everyone is so kind and welcoming! I enjoyed my visit so much that I most likely will be attending Immaculata University
Freshman,5,"Immaculata is such an amazing college, I absolutely love learning here and growing as a person. At first, it may seem boring, but I am quite grateful that I chose this school to pursue my degree. Because of the quiet life on campus, I am able to stay focused!"
Sophomore,5,Immaculata University has this sense of home. I knew the moment I stepped on campus two years ago I knew this college was the one for me. I can not say enough good things about this school. They have stocked the building full of caring professors and lined up an excellent staff that want to see you succeed and thrive here. They will do anything to help you get the best experience out of Immaculata University.
Freshman,5,Immaculata University is a great school.  The professors really care about their students and want them to understand the material.  The campus is very nice and easy to navigate.
Junior,5,"Immaculata University is a great university that provides students with an environment geared towards success, learning, and flourishing after graduation."
Junior,5,"I currently go to immaculata university and will soon be starting by junior year, my overall experience with immaculata has been great. I love most of my professors I have been given and the school is very welcoming. I only 
wish there were more activities on campus and more places to eat around campus. The school is very safe and the dorms and housing there is very clean and organized."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Immaculata so far has been great.  The professors truly care about your education.  My advisors are always available to answer any questions I may have about classes or financial aid.  Everyone at the university wants to see you succeed and will help you in anyway.  I also know that because of the amazing reputation of Immaculata, my future employer will know that I have received the best education."
Senior,5,"I am an online student and the professor support was quite interactive.  They offered direction and or clarification when needed, and responded quickly to email."
Junior,5,Immaculata University has such an amazing campus filled with great people. Immaculata has built a culture where students are surrounded by those who also have a drive for education.
Junior,5,It is a perfect college to go to if you love a smaller community college where everyone feels like family
Senior,5,I love the university! The staff are great and very helpful. Professors are willing to help you by explaining the material in more detail if you do not understand.
Freshman,5,Everyone here is so friendly. This is a small school that makes you feel right at home. There is a lot of benefits when going to this school. Teachers try their best to make you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy Immaculata because it is a small school, and I am able to interact with the majority of the people on campus including the nuns.  The professors are easy to talk to, and they are able to make meaningful relationships with their students because of how small the classes are.  I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere that I feel as well as the closeness I feel with everyone.  Immaculata is a magical place, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Niche User,5,"I am currently a junior and Immaculata University was on my list of colleges to visit. I have nearly complete my college search and Immaculata University was by far the nicest. Immaculata University is very clean, organized, people friendly, and in a great area. This is for sure one of my top choice schools. I will for sure be applying here."
Graduate Student,5,Immaculata University has staff who are supportive and an environment that embraces learning and makes you want to learn more each day.  Immaculata allows each learner to explore interests and recognizes weaknesses to turn into strengths.
Freshman,5,My experience at Immaculata has been nothing but positive. Everyone's always ready to great the students with a large smile and offer assistance in this Catholic College in this beautiful community.
Sophomore,5,I love being at Immaculata! The professors go to extra lengths to make sure you do well and understand material. They set you up for success in the future.
Alum,5,I could not have asked for a better college experience for my Undergraduate education!  I came from a very small but rigorous high school and quickly assimilated into the community and the honors program.  I was academically challenged by my professors but also had great relationships with them both in and out of the classroom.  I lived on campus all four years and found the dorms to be modern and safe.  I was very involved in everything from Greek life to the theatre department.  I loved my fours years so much that I decided to return for my Master's and I am happy I did!
Junior,5,"Immaculata University is truly my home under the dome! IU is a small, Catholic University, where we have a small student body, but one big family. There are so many opportunities given to each and every student at IU, but it is up to the students to really take advantage of them. I have been involved in so much and have gotten to connect with faculty and get to learn more and more about IU. We have a developed Campus life that gets all of the students engaged and out doing something fun. The advantage of a smaller university like Immaculata is that if you cannot find something here that you like or want to be involved in, you can create it and create a long lasting legacy at Immaculata."
Sophomore,5,I love Immaculata University. My major is nursing and this is a great college to get your degree in it at. Its a private school which means its student to professor ratio is smaller which I think is good because that can be easier to learn and get help. I have no suggestions for improvements so far in my experience here!
College Junior,5,The security on this campus is awesome. I feel safe at all times. I have never had an issue where I felt unsafe.
College Sophomore,5,The classes at Immaculata University are very small and therefore personal. You could ask a teacher anything and they will not stop until your problem is resolved. Each professor dedicates 110 percent of his or her time to their student's success.
College Freshman,5,I am happy with the safety and security here. For sure is not West Chester University.
College Senior,5,"I'm an Athletic Training major and I've done six internships. None are paid but it's about the learning experience. You can go everyday or you can go three times a week, they make accommodations for students that have jobs on the side. The first few internships  are more of a sit back and watch and little hands on but as you get more experience you take on more of a leadership role"
College Freshman,5,"They were very helpful in telling you how to pay for college, scholarships etc."
College Freshman,5,Safety officers are polite and are always visible around campus.
College Freshman,5,There are lot of rules but facility are all friendly and make everything easy.
College Freshman,5,"The local atmosphere is very quiet, there are two shopping centers within easy access and Philadelphia is a short train ride away."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is so eager to help, classes are small and the professors answer and explain everything."
College Freshman,5,"The university is right in the middle of two major shopping areas, easy to get to and prices are great. There are even places that will deliver."
College Freshman,5,There is housing right across the street and there are various apartment complexes within walking or short bus ride away.
College Freshman,5,From what I have seen everyone takes a positive part and interest in all the sport activities.
College Sophomore,5,I plan on living off-campus after my sophomore year of college. But the faculty doesn't sit with you and discuss possible living arrangements when it comes to living off-campus. As the student you have to go around and basically look for a place to live.
College Sophomore,5,My favorite spot on campus is the Library. It's quite and I can get so much accomplished at anytime.
College Sophomore,5,Me and my roommate usually would order out every once a month. It's cheap and with the school discount you usually would get more than 10% taken off your bill. Plus no matter the weather your food will be delivered to you.
College Sophomore,5,If a student has been sexually assaulted there is help available.
College Sophomore,5,Campus Housing is absolutely OUTSTANDING.
College Freshman,5,"I have zero complaints about technology at Immaculata. There are many computers to choose from in the computer labs and in the library. If I would have known that there are always computers available, I would have ever even spent the money to buy my own laptop."
College Freshman,5,apartments all over for good prices
College Sophomore,5,The reason I decided to go to Immaculata was because it is a small school and knew that i would get the professors individual attention if i needed it and its exactly just that. The classes are fairly small (about 20 in in class) and the professors make time to get to know you. They really care about you as an individual and want you to succeed so they do everything the can to help you. Even though the workload is a little tough sometimes knowing that you can reach your professors anytime for help is a very good thing.
Recent Alumnus,5,"IU gives students the option to live in near by apartments. Its good because you don't have to deal with landlords, its safe, and parking is free. IU even provides a  FREE shuttle for students w/o cars!"
College Junior,5,"I do not live on campus, I am only there for classes."
College Freshman,5,I love being a Biology major. My passion has always been for studying the deeper workings of life and figuring out how exactly life forms do what they do. it's amazing and I would choose it again without a second thought.
College Junior,5,"I actually am not required to do one through my Psych major. However, I am required to do 2 Field Practicums for my Social Work Minor (which is closely related to Psych)."
College Junior,5,The most popular majors are probably Nursing and Athletic Training. Nurtition majors are common as well
College Junior,5,I went from being Undecided to Psych and the process was pretty smooth. The only thing is that you have to get two or three people from separate offices to sign a change of major form. I am not sure what the process is like for an incoming freshman who wants to pursue a major in Psychology.
College Junior,5,"Well, since I live on campus and it takes 10 minutes to walk from one side to the other (and takes 5 minutes to walk to any class) the weather situation  isn't that bad as opposed to a larger campus. They are on top of the snow removal as well and you can sign up to receive a text from the school if class is cancelled or delayed due to inclement weather."
College Junior,5,No internship is required in the Psych major but it is recommended. My workload mainly consists of papers on scholarly journal articles and presentations on material of the class.
College Junior,5,I love the Psychology Department. All of the teachers are so knowledgeable and helpful and they really do want you to succeed.
College Junior,5,There is a Septa bus stop right in front of the campus. The bus will run through Paoli and everyone will have access to go anywhere.
College Junior,5,"Everything is always constantly being cleaned. As a commuter, I spend a lot of time in the library, my favorite place on the campus. The library is HUGE and has many different features such as study rooms, computers spread all over the 3-floor building, a quite floor and a social floor, and there is a coffee cafe being built and will be ready in January 2013. I can't wait for the cafe!"
College Junior,5,You get more than enough printing pages per semester (500). I have never used them all.
College Junior,5,I think that my school is strict when necessary. Alot of people don't like the visiting policy
College Senior,5,"Everything Is on Campus – Immaculata is a very quiet place and ideal because every building can be accessed on foot. There is no need to have a car; everything, including the dorms and food places, is accessible. Although it is difficult to get off of campus without a car, there are more than enough activities to keep any student busy all throughout the week."
College Junior,5,there are ton and great computer labs around the campus with a really great gym for students.
College Junior,5,"Why My School I Great – there are tons of tutors available, more than enough computers on campus and also nice size class rooms."
College Sophomore,5,"Not a Problem for Commuters – Immaculata's campus is well organized with sufficient parking for students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Finding a parking space close to class is never an issue."
Alum,4,"Immaculata has so many opportunities to get involved with clubs, student leadership, work study, and athletics to name a few. The professors truly care about you as a student and person, so you make important connections with them and when you leave you know they will truly be future colleagues in whatever field you are studying. While off-campus life may not be as lively as larger schools, students still enjoy having social gatherings off campus."
Alum,4,"Professors utilize Zoom, Google Meet, voice-over PowerPoints, Kahoot, and other free, fun apps to keep students engaged virtually. They also offered a lot of internet resources like supplemental Youtube videos or readings which I enjoyed."
Junior,4,I love the online experience. I can take classes anywhere i want to. The classes are similar to what I would learn in class.
Graduate Student,4,"I am in grad school at Immaculata University and I have been very impressed by their willingness to help their students. Any time I have a question, it is immediately answered and I feel supported."
Senior,4,"The area is not very good for a college. The social scene is very difficult. But, as far as the academics go, it is a great place to attend. The professors are always kind and helpful."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Immaculata I find the college to be very fun if you get into the things that interest you.  The only complaint I really have is it is so expensive for me to be there, I find it a constant struggle financially due to my personal situation. Overall this college has given me a lot of opportunities and I know that I will succeeed of I continue to stay here."
Graduate Student,4,I just enrolled in the Graduate program for Management and Leadership.  So far everyone has been very helpful and it seems that I would enjoy the group that is in the program.
Junior,4,I like the CAP program which help working people achieve a degree while working. Immaculata make in very convenient for me to attend a 4 hour class every Thursday to get closer to my goal to graduate with my degree next year which can allow me to make more money. Also classes are held close to my place of employment
Junior,4,The nursing program is excellent. The professors really engage & are active in your learning. They really want you to excel in your career path.
Freshman,4,Immaculata University is great. Professors know you on a first name basis and even though it is a Catholic college the nuns on campus are amazing. It really is a great community here.
Freshman,4,"The campus is very beautiful, especially around the holidays. The professors are very helpful, and everyone wants to see you succeed. Teachers and nuns make an effort to become familiar with you. The campus is also very safe. The dining hall closes at 7 pm on the weekends, so the only places on campus to get food on the weekends is at the Immaculatté."
Freshman,4,Immaculata University is a wonderful place to be. The faculty is wonderful and really cares about their students. They take the time to get to know with you and help you with anything they can. All the students know each other and interact with one an other. The campus is beautiful especially in the fall. The overall environment is very peaceful  and inviting. I am really enjoying my time there and cannot wait to make more memories there.
Sophomore,4,"Immaculata University is a  very small private catholic school. There are not many parties, there are strict rules on visitors in the dorms, and the food is not diverse. There is not a wide range of academics but if they have what you're looking for, you will be taught by amazing teachers and sisters. We do not have as much as large schools, but the things we do have are amazing. The small campus is beautiful and safe, renovations and updates are constantly being made. "
College Freshman,4,"What makes my school unique and different from others is the students. Every student is friendly and open to conversation. If you need help with a class, you get a student tutor who helps you through the class and makes sure you understand the topic no matter how long it takes. My fellow students are always willing to help out others."
College Freshman,4,A lot of students play sports.
College Freshman,4,Very welcoming and it's easy to get involved
Recent Alumnus,4,Immaculata is a school that really cares about their students and helps them succeed
College Freshman,4,I like the smaller class sizes.
College Freshman,4,Chris Baeza is a great mentor and advisor.
College Freshman,4,I love the small campus and the great people I have met.
College Junior,4,I like everything about this school.Everyone is really helpful and cares a lot about your education.
College Junior,4,On campus housing is great. There are a lot of changes being made. There is a lot of security which is nice.
College Junior,4,It is a D3 school so there are a lot of athletes on campus. They are fun and competitive.
College Junior,4,I like it a lot. It is a small school but that is what I was looking for so I enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus. It's kind of out in the middle of no where so not too many people would be going to try to get onto campus. Security is great. They are always driving around campus and do checks.
Recent Alumnus,4,I like Immaculata university. It is a small school and you get a lot of support if you need it.
College Sophomore,4,"Immaculata University is a pretty widespread campus, but it does an excellent job of keeping the campus same. Security guards constantly drive around on patrol and they guard every dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not used the career center at all because I already know my degree and concentration, but I hear it is fantastic. Like any other faculty on campus they will not stop until their students are fully satisfied."
College Sophomore,4,"I would not know what it is like living on campus because I commute. However, I have slept over several times at friend's dorms and it is much newer-looking than other college campus dorms I have been in. The security guards are also very friendly and nice."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience at Immaculata University has been better than I dreamed it would be. I joined the school's Cross Country and Track teams and have enjoyed them thoroughly even though running is generally a rather discomforting, disliked pastime. I have connected greatly to my teammates as well as many others at the school. My teachers have been nothing, but helpful. They devote every ounce of their energy to the success of their students. In addition I have found their way of teaching to be entertaining and educating. The coursework has not brought any problems to me over the first semester and I pray it will remain the same for the next two years. I plan on attending graduate school at Jefferson University and receive my master's in Occupational Therapy over the course of five years."
College Junior,4,"I am a working professional and full time mother. iU  program meets my professional needs. The faculty have been very supportive with student requests,  guiding me in my professional interests and future research."
College Sophomore,4,My college experience was completely different from high school. I was always busy doing things from going to the library doing work to hanging out with friends to going to dance at night and making time for work between classes. What makes my school unique is that the campus is beautiful and always kept looking that way. The campus is pretty small and the people are very friendly.
College Freshman,4,"I was happy with the financial package that I got and they give me the opportunity to do the appeal because my dad is disabled and my mom was not able to take higher loan. My appeal was approved and honestly I am happy at Immaculata - academic is very good, social life is not that great or the food but I came here to study and go further for medical school. That's my goal."
College Sophomore,4,I generally do feel safe but I always like to have friends with me.
College Sophomore,4,We are near West Chester and they have many restaurants.
College Sophomore,4,It was very enjoyable. I liked touring the differnt schools and meeting new people.
Recent Alumnus,4,Being part of a team is great
College Sophomore,4,"My mission when I started my freshman year was to be involved in the Nursing program. I am still working on my admission at this time because this is something i really want to do. Your GPA must be a 3.0 or higher, and you need to have two letters of recommendation from anyone of your choice. But now it's harder because in order to get into the Nursing program now you  will have to perform a test."
College Sophomore,4,"I do work study where we provide students help with any academic possible. Including tutoring, workshops, or counseling. And I love it!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors there are easy to contact since the classes are no bigger than 30 to a class. And it's hard to get the classes that you actually want as the upperclassmen get first pick of their classes first. Also the best place to study would have to be our library.
College Sophomore,4,Carol Night.  I love Carol Night. It's a night for everyone to come together in the rotunda and sing Christmas carols and enjoy being together and the evening and the Christmas season.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere.  If I had to move here for work, I would not be disappointed."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my program.  It is very hard coursework-wise but it is worth it.  I want to work with children with disabilities, and there are places in my home state.  I just have to get an internship and graduate first."
College Sophomore,4,"I plan to have one because I have to complete a 6 month internship after all of my course work to graduate.  The only concern I have about finding an internship is finding one near home.  The internship has to be on the National Roster of the American Music Therapy Association, otherwise the school has to pay a lot of money, and there isn't much luck around my home state."
College Sophomore,4,"I didn't have much variety to choose from to begin with, majoring in Music Therapy, but Immaculata definitely is where I am supposed to be.  The atmosphere is good, the people are good, the classes are good, and the professors are good.  The only things I don't like about the school are the tech support people, because they screwed up my computer, and the fact that since it is a Catholic institution, at Mass, since I am Lutheran, I am not allowed to take Communion, which is actually very important to me.  There are other places of worship I can go around the community, but due to my busy schedule, I don't get much time to journey off campus that much a week."
College Sophomore,4,"While IU is a Catholic school and therefore there are people who aren't necessarily as accepting as others, for the most part, everyone is treated fairly equal."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are good. Most of them you can really tell they know what they are talking about.  Registration works well, though there are always a few problems.  Workload, with music, you are always going to have a very heavy one so there's no getting out of that. There is tutoring offered for free and a Writing and Math Center."
College Sophomore,4,Good variety of off-campus dining. The only problem is that you have to have a car to get anywhere.
College Freshman,4,"I like having attendance be mandatory, you are paying for this education, so coming to class should be what a student does every single day. Academic integrity is a big part in Immaculata and every student takes pride in their own work that they hand in to professors."
College Freshman,4,"Its only $50 for the year, there are plenty of spots. However with construction of new dorms, they cut off lots of spots and now it is a race to Immaculata each morning."
College Freshman,4,"I love being apart of the business field in Immaculata. Because you get to know all of the business department very well there are only a few teachers, you can build bonds with them over the years. It is also cool that we are required to do internships, however it can be a hassle if you have a full time job after classes like I do."
College Freshman,4,"I don't live on campus, however I do take part in going to the dorms and using what campus has to offer. There are so many different amenities offered such as academic centers to help with my studies and the Immaculatte is a great addition to the Gabrielle Library."
College Freshman,4,"I have not experienced a bad experience with weather, I am a commuter so I get to leave as soon as classes are over. My campus is also very small, so walking from one building to the next is not a difficult task in any weather situation."
College Student,4,On campus if drugs are visible to campus security they will act upon it. but its so easy to just not get caught. or just go off campus
College Sophomore,4,I really like my school because since it is a small school many students commute and they are really made to feel like they are part of the school. They are not left out. Also they have so many resources to help students that are just open whenever you need them. There are also many events that the school holds that are to make all the students bond over having fun.
College Sophomore,4,"For Immaculata being an old college it has really good facilities. They have started to do many remodels and it really makes a difference. The library is very modern, it has a cafe in it and many computers for easy access. The gym is also newly renovated and it has great new facilities. They just finished building new parking lots which makes parking a lot easier. All of the hangout spots (lounges) are super comfortable and almost all the classrooms have smartboards. Over all once you see this campus its really pretty and breathtaking because it has great views for being in a good location."
College Sophomore,4,You can pretty much find all kinds of people at Immaculata. The boys are really into sports but not in a snobby kind of way. They are nice and easy to hang out with. Girls are the same way except while some girls are really into sports some are really into academics. Overall everyone is awesome to hang out with.
College Senior,4,"Safety has certain things that they are strict about, but lenient about others. Very strict about visitation and alcohol."
College Senior,4,"The campus safety officers are very good. They are on top of things, and are always a call away. They even drive you from a far-away parking spot to a more central location if you feel uncomfortable walking at night."
College Senior,4,The graduate program offers licensure which is important and not many schools work with the students to offer this.  The Sisters in the program are very friendly and helpful in working with students.  There is also a wide variety of professors who provide many different backgrounds to help educate students.
Junior,2,"The atmosphere at the school seems great at first. The reason I chose Immaculata was for the people: everywhere I went on my tour, there were people saying hi to each other. I thought it would be my home for the next four years, so I committed. I am now half way through my junior year, and I sometimes regret my decision. I am a biology major with a chemistry minor; both departments are small, underfunded, and can only run a limited number of classes, especially higher level classes. In addition, the school is having financial issues, so they recently laid off a large number of staff members and facilities workers. The next cuts will be to the teachers. If my degree wasn't almost complete, I would transfer."
College Freshman,2,There is a large alumni network.. Don't know of any employers recruiting though.
College Senior,2,I have attended 3 colleges and this is the worst by far.
College Sophomore,2,The food selections are not good.
College Sophomore,2,It's pretty bad... there's nothing else really to say about it.
College Senior,2,"I give my school a C because some of the rules are too strict. As students, we spend all day in class, working, practicing/playing sports, club meetings studying, completing homework assignments & projects, and having a social life and sometimes feel like it's not enough hours in the day to do everything. So why is there strict rules about visitation? Sometimes we don't have time during the day to meet up with our friends because of our schedules. I think our times (as a Catholic school) are too early and unfair."
College Junior,2,The city is relatively close to the campus but who wants to always walk everywhere and the cabs are ridiculous in how much they cost.
College Freshman,2,"I want to become a vet, so I worked in the animal husbandry department as work study. The pay is good for what you are doing. It's $7.75 an hour and all you have to do is play with the animals, clean cages and make sure everyone has water. Sadly, it isn't very demanding or close to what I imagined. Our animals die frequently because we can't take them to see a vet and we don't have the proper food for them. Hamsters eat guinea pig food, finches eat parakeet food, no one has the proper diet."
College Junior,2,The only off campus housing at Immaculata are at Marchwood Apartments which are 15 minutes away from the school and aren't in the greatest area. The apartments themselves are not that nice and the commute isn't worth it. It would be better to just continue living on campus.
College Junior,2,"There is not much variety of food in the cafeteria. The food that is served is not very healthy and students are very limited when it comes to healthy options. There aren't many other options for eating on campus, other than the Pod and the new coffee shop, but all of those items are overpriced. I would not buy a huge meal plan after freshmen year because you most likely won't use all the meals and will just be wasting money."
College Junior,2,"Truely Not Worth It – First of all when I came to the apartments a million things were wrong. The tub, dishwasher, sink, and garbage disposal were all broke and it was 2 weeks before someone came to fix them. I had to make 6 calls to remind them. One of the provided desk drawer has been broken... for 3 years now. No one will fix it. The school stopped providing shuttle buses from the apartments to the school so if one has no car they have limited ways to get to campus because it is 15 minutes up the road by car. On the plus side air, heating, water, and electricity are all included in the bill. The neighbors keep to themselves. It's a quiet area and we have a pool and tennis courts."
College Sophomore,2,Here at IU im not so certain of the housing selection due to that im new but I kno the help at the school is always there when needed. the problem I have or concern is just cost and paying. Everything else Im just learning
College Junior,2,There really isnt too much additional transportation offered by the school.
College Student,2,"Good School but Not for Me – If you're a music major, education major, or nursing major, this is the school for you. However, if you're in my boat with your major not existing here, it's not the school for you. Also, if you desire an escape from suburbia and a vivacious campus, don't even consider here. I'm happy I got over 30 credits here but I'm glad to be transferring next year."
College Sophomore,2,Off campus dining has very few options unless you drive!
Senior,1,"Awful experience so far, they get you with every penny and the teachers go by an old rigid method which lacks creativity. I have to listen to homophobic ideas in the religion classes and have even heard homophobic remarks by some of the faculty, really just awful."
College Senior,1,There is no diversity on campus. Everyone is white. Most people are Christian. Most people are heterosexual.
College Senior,1,I haven't noticed much diversity on campus. Everyone is white. Most people grew up in the area. It's a Catholic school and most people are Christian.
College Freshman,1,"No parties at Immaculata, Friday evening the campus is empty, almost all students go home or to other colleges to party"
College Freshman,1,"Sorry but I had to reduce the plan meal because I cannot eat on campus and my parents waste the money paying the school. I only one cafe and its no choice to get good food besides pizza, pancakes and eggs in the morning. That's all.

Thanks go is WAWA there and we go and spend the money over there not in school."
College Freshman,1,To me mostly everyone is big on academics.
College Freshman,1,nothing to do when sports aren't being played
College Freshman,1,there is nothing to do
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is not that big of a thing on campus. There are many sororities and some fraternities but not in the normal way. They are mostly clubs to promote  volunteering and being active in the community along with the school.
College Senior,1,We don't have a shuttle bus and the public transportation runs hourly (doesn't run on sundays) and stops running after 8pm.
College Senior,1,"Greek life is terrible. As a member of Greek Life, I know that greek life members are treated as second-rate citizens by both other students and the administration. There is no Greek housing, and the administration makes it so difficult for the organizations to do anything or get any funding that it almost isn't worth it."
College Senior,1,The campus is isolated so there is not much to do around unless you have a car - then you can easily drive to places that are 10 - 15 minutes away.  There is a train station that is within walking distance that can take you home or to Philly.
College Senior,1,ACCEL program is the only connection I have had with Immaculata and it is not run properly.
College Senior,1,"I am in the ACCEL program and since I started September 2011 it has been chaos, misinformation, lack of communication and total frustration. The actual adjunct Professors we have had have all but 2 been phenomenol."
College Junior,1,"Worst school. Came here because it is beautiful and they make it seem great but its all an act. I regret going here. Super expensive...(tutitons actually more like 45,000) and Im a junior and have learned NOTHING. WARNING! DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
College Sophomore,1,As a commuter I have gotten a fine even though I was parked in the commuter's lot.
College Freshman,1,The food is gross here unless you get the grill or cereal.  We have an extra grill option but I believe it is closing soon which is not good because that food is good.
College Freshman,1,Need a Car – Basically you need to know someone with a car or have a car of your own at school to be able to do anything.  There is no school transportation.

Alum,5,SNC is a great community and lots of fun. Business professors are fun and care a lot about their students.
Freshman,5,"Going to college can be very stressful, specially when there are so many to choose from. Finding the correct college/university takes patience and dedication. Saint Norbert College is exceptionally perfect for those who like to have small class ratios, beautiful changing seasonal weather and amazing food. Not only does Saint Norbert College offer amazing classes but extra-curricular activities as well."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online, but I have heard other's enjoyable experiences with online learning. During this pandemic, many professors have been using in-class materials as well as online materials and lessons. Professors, have great patience with students and are always to help them grow academically."
Alum,5,"The community of SNC is welcoming and the campus is beautiful. The class sizes are small and students have the opportunity to truly learn from their professors. Building relationships is an important aspect of college, and SNC provides students with the opportunity to do so!"
Freshman,5,I have not yet taken any online work from St Norbert. But the students that I know that have taken it have had nothing but positive words about the online learning program. I have heard that all the work was punctually and appropriately given.
Freshman,5,"When I took my visit up to SNC, I was amazed at the advancement  the schooling was. It has lot of state-of-the-art facilities and many professors that are dedicated to set you up with the most success possible. The students are all very fun, loving, friendly and intelligent people. Many offered me help on work that I may struggle with or have a hard time understanding. I am very proud of my future school in its entirety."
Sophomore,5,"COVID-19 forced me to finish my classes online this semester, but my professors made the transition pretty seamless. They were always available to answer questions and their methods of alternative instructions were engaging."
Sophomore,5,"St. Norbert College is an amazing school. The professors are great. The class sizes are really nice, especially if you like smaller class sizes. I don’t think I’ve ever had a class with more than 30 students, which really helps me get the personalized instruction I learn best with."
Freshman,5,I absolutely have enjoyed my time at St. Norbert College. It is a beautiful campus with warm and inviting faculty and staff that make you feel like home. Beyond that the academic rigor has certainly challenged me and allowed me to grow in my studies. I certainly hope to bring my experiences and knowledge that I have acquired after my four years of study into the rest of my life.
Freshman,5,I like how small the classes are which also makes the teachers more personable. The teachers are caring and understanding when I have obligations because of my sport. I love the swim team we are family. Everybody cheers for each other and there isn't any tension on the men's team.
Freshman,5,"St. Norbert College has outstanding professors who care about each student individually. Class sizes are small, which provides 1-on-1 guidance for students. Every experience that I have had in my first semester at St. Norbert is a great one."
Freshman,5,The professors are wonderful and the size of the college is perfect for me. There are plenty of opportunities to get help with anything you need through the plethora of programs offered by the college or the professors themselves. My experience has been better than I expected.
Niche User,5,I loved the smaller size and the campus was beautiful.  I also loved the feeling of being away from the city and actually on a campus.
Alum,5,"Went there in the late 1980s. I had a great time, studied hard, and graduated in four years with two majors. It wasn't very diverse then, but hopefully that's getting better. Professors were very nice, and funny, and caring. I was lucky enough to have earned enough scholarships to pay for the whole thing. I don't envy today's students who face incredible fees to attend a good college."
Senior,5,"Amazing faculty that are passionate about their field of teaching & have a genuine love for what they teach their students. Ratio of faculty to students is low, which allows for a higher level of education. Class size is small and allows better learning in a collaborative environment. Academic work is manageable, yet challenges the student to really put thought and real world experience into work."
Freshman,5,"My son is coming in as a freshman in 2020 and we have had very positive experiences with the admissions personnel, coaching staff and overall friendliness of staff."
Sophomore,5,"St. Norbert is a great college for many reasons- personal relationships with professors, good on-campus jobs, a beautiful campus, great school spirit, and the small town feel."
Sophomore,5,Everyone on campus cares about the students! Professors take a lot of time to help their students succeed. It’s expensive but I feel that it’s worth it
Freshman,5,"My first time walking on campus I knew that this would be the college I would spend the next 4 years of my life at. And as I continue that intuition of feeling like a second home grew even stronger. Due to the students and staff that were so welcoming and I didn't feel like just another number to them, I felt like that I was a human about to take the biggest adventure of my life and they were ready to help, guide, and assist me in the right direction."
Alum,5,"I love St. Norbert College. The community and family that are all around you at SNC is truly one-of-a-kind. Whatever you put into college, you definitely get out of it. Make as many connections as you can during your time at SNC and you will not regret it!"
Sophomore,5,I love it. The professors are extremely helpful and the people are extremely nice. I feel at home when I am there. I feel like I belong and that this is the place that will help me to create the best life for myself.
Freshman,5,St.Norbert is a great college that brings the ideal of community into one area. They provide help for all people in St.Norbert and it brings the best experience of college ever.
Alum,5,"One of the best things about my college experience at St. Norbert was how many activities I could be involved in on campus. I didn't have to choose between being an NCAA athlete, doing service, studying abroad, being a student government representative, or competing in mock trial; I was able to do it all. With scholarships, the cost was very near a public university and the four year graduation guarantee made SNC a great financial choice."
Alum,5,"Simply put, the best four years of my life! SNC is a welcoming community, they guarantee four years, and the food and facilities are so much better than the more than dozen schools I visited. De Pere is a great town to walk around, everything you need is less than 3 blocks from campus. Athletics win all the time, especially the 5-time national championship hockey team. SNC really pushes getting off campus and into the community for internships and as far as the flourishing study abroad experience. While one of the few colleges left than requires students to live on campus all four years, there are so many unique options for housing including houses and apartments with vaulted ceilings, fireplaces and underground parking."
Junior,5,"I love the campus life. Being a smaller school, you become familiar with more people and develop strong, long lasting relationships. St. Norbert is a giant family and I couldn't imagine being somewhere else."
Junior,5,"I think this college is amazing. Everyone at the college is extremely nice, and the resources are endless! Not the mention the food is amazing! So many ways to get involved as well."
Alum,5,"I wanted to go to Marquette University all throughout high school and didn't want to compete athletically in college. My parents convinced me to apply and visit St. Norbert after I got recruitment letters for volleyball and track just to please them. Once I got on campus, I was blown away by its beauty and welcoming feel. I felt at home and decided, very shortly after my visit, to deposit.

I just recently graduated from St. Norbert and I can confidently say that my parents did the right thing by pushing me to check out this college. I was able to study abroad, play sports, and get a top-notch liberal arts degree with very little trouble! This college has really shaped me into the person I am today. The faculty and staff are wonderful and genuinely interested in you as a person. SNC preaches about being a welcoming community and they definitely deliver! I don't regret making the choice I did for my undergrad."
Sophomore,5,Saint Norbert has a great atmosphere. They students and faculty make you feel welcomed and part of the community as soon as you step foot on campus. There are many help resources both academic and personal.
Freshman,5,St. Norbert College is a great campus that is full of welcoming people. We are all about communio and if you ever need help with anything everyone is always willing to help. The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly. They have so many resources open for students if they ever find themselves in need of any kind of help. They are very supporting and open to anything. I have grown not only as a student but also a person. I feel like this college is my home and I will miss it deeply when I graduate in a few years.
Freshman,5,In love with this school. Everything from the campus to the academics is outstanding. Community is emphasized here and I’ve definitely felt included the moment I stepped on campus. Food is almost too good and the people are lively.
Junior,5,St. Norbert is such a welcoming place that is perfect for those looking for a small town feel. The little campus is so comfortable to be on. The seasons are absolutely beautiful here on campus. St. Norbert's also offers many clubs and organizations for everyone to get involved and make the most out of their short four years here. It truly feels like home.
Niche User,5,I really like Saint Norbert and I am so excited to go there and contineu my studies. The campus is beautiful and it is amazing to know taht only professors work in the college.
Freshman,5,"Made the absolute BEST choice to attend St. Norbert College. I had my heart set on attending Madison but then I visited the school and fell in love. The campus is gorgeous year-round, the people are so warm and welcoming, and the FOOD!! Wow. You’ll never get tired of eating at the caf. Lots of options and places to eat. Also teachers and classes are amazing, you’re able to ask questions and feel included in discussions. Surprisingly, there is a great party scene! Many students from UW-GB come to Norbs to party and there’s always something going on either in the dorms or a house."
Freshman,5,"I grew up in the area and fell in love with the school during my senior year of high school. I think that the atmosphere is what makes St Norbert's stand out from other colleges, the students and staff are really friendly and there's a great sense of community!"
Sophomore,5,St. Norbert is a great college. It is a smaller school that has a great family feel to it. Sports are amazing. The sports teams are all very close and always support one another. The Education program at St. Norbert is sublime.
Sophomore,5,"Since the first time that I visited, the campus felt like home. In general St. Norbert met all of my needs. It's small, close to home, and it is a great liberal arts college! The students, professors, and staff members are all supportive and helpful. The only thing I'd like to see is diversity in the student body."
Niche User,5,A very good school in a very safe neighborhood.Great professors and a great campus. One of the best liberal arts colleges around.
Sophomore,5,Campus is beautiful! Holds great events and campus is extremely welcoming. Very inclusive with their commitment to communio/community. Food is great!
Junior,5,"I've loved every minute at Saint Norbert College. The theatre and english programs are excellent, as is the study abroad program. However, There's very little diversity here. If you are part of a minority group, there are resources available to you. The campus is beautiful, the classes are engaging. The dorms aren't terrible, but they could have more of them and better parking spaces."
Sophomore,5,"The most beautiful and inspiring place to be. I was terrified of being on my own but have never experienced a more welcoming community. I think of this college as home and long to be there. Everyone is inviting and there is always a smile on someones face, plus the chicken tenders are amazing!"
Niche User,5,"At Saint Norbert, there are so many diverse opportunities to take a hold of. Whether it be the academics , sports, extracurricular activities, staff, or even students, there is a sense of calm that hangs around the campus. The friendly feeling of being at home settles in when on the campus.The food has always been divine, many different choices to choose from.  It's a wonderful college to attend and great things to be discovered by going here."
Freshman,5,"St. Norbert College has been the fairy tale college for me. I feel like a big fish in a small pond, but I don't feel constricted. The sense of community that St. Norbert strives to provide is not a joke. You really become close with everyone you live and interact with. The professors are always willing to help. The only thing that can occasionally be challenging is balancing the work and community involvement load. Some weeks you wonder how you will survive. But there really is no better place to be if you want to feel like you're part of the family."
Freshman,5,"I'm a college basketball player at St. Norbert College. I love the atmosphere at the games even though we did not get to play in our own gym this year because it was under construction. There are plenty of clubs to join, and there is always something to do on campus. Although there are not a lot of activities or places to go around campus, we like to take about a twenty minute drive to the Green Bay area to find some fun to do. The student life is great, and it is really easy to meet new people even though there are not too many that go to school here. The small classes give us the opportunity to go in and talk to the teachers if needed, and that makes this college a great return on investment."
Freshman,5,"Saint Norbert College has already provided me with a wonderful learning experience. Because it is such a small community, it is very easy to get to know you professors and they are always willing to help. The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting."
Freshman,5,"Honestly, I love it here. It's a very white campus, which is the only downside. I wish there were more racial and cultural backgrounds, but other than that it's amazing. I've learned so much in my first year, and I feel like the professors and advisers really care about you. There are tutors available upon request free of charge, which is amazing. It's pricey, but there are sooooooo many benefits!!! I've never felt unsafe here either. My mom bought me pepper spray before I came, and I can't recall a time that I've even thought about it. I'm proud to be a Norbertine Knight :)"
Freshman,5,St. Norbert is such a wonderful college. It has the most beautiful campus- I feel like I'm in a movie everything I walk to class! St. Norbert makes you feel like you belong there and very welcome. They want you to succeed and will help you to succeed. Their 4 year graduation guarantee is a plus as well!!
Freshman,5,"My year so far at St. Norbert has been nothing but excellent! All the people I have meet are always nice to me and act like we've known each other for a long time even though we would have just met. The professors there know you all by name in every single class and the best part is that they are willing to work with you and even give you extra time to do assignments . The greek life, social groups, and clubs on campus is also amazingly awesome we all do so much for the community and the school it always is a fun time to meet and talk to new and different people and that is what the school is all about!"
Freshman,5,"School is amazing, I am loving my experience here so far. Classes are good and campus life is amazing. "
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere here and the theatre shows are great. The people here are very kind and familiar. The campus is a decent size and beautiful in every season. 
Freshman,5,"Move in day is well organized and there are many helping hands.  We didn't need to carry anything in...we just pulled up, got our key, and by the time we got to the room, everything was waiting for us!!"
College Senior,5,St. Norbert College was the best decision I ever made. It is a small school built on community and partnership. It has allowed me to grow as an adult in a friendly and exciting environment. I highly recommend going to St. Norbert.
College Sophomore,5,I love being at St. Norbert and I couldn't imagine myself going anywhere else. This school is the perfect fit for me because the people are so welcoming and their academic programming is top of the line.
College Freshman,5,Everything I've heard about all professors had been nothing but good! The professors want to help you succeed in anyways possible that they can. The tutoring facilities and academic advisors that are on campus to help you makes the academi life so much easier in all students.
College Freshman,5,All the centers and recruiting on campus is excellent. Everton on campus is driving for such a wonderful reason and wants to help everyone as much as they can to show that this college is worth the Dream you want to live!
College Freshman,5,"Our safety on campus is outstanding, there is safety poles everyone on campus and security carts always around campus patrolling to make sure all students and employees on campus are secure and safe! I've never felt scared while being on campus."
College Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful and so welcoming! It is well taken care of by not only the stuff but the students as well! Life on campus is like a second home to everyone, it's spacious and has wonderful communication upon anywhere you are in location while being on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Our sports programs are all wonderful! You become part of a team that is always willing to give you a hand when needed, they become some of your best friends and are a big part of your family. The coaches are such an inspiration as they push all of their athletes to become the best they know their athletes can be!"
College Freshman,5,This school is such a wonderful atmosphere and every individual that walks on that campus is so welcoming to everyone. The outlook of the whole campus is so clean and so well taken care of. The professors and all other employees care for their students and the success they work at during classroom and out of classroom time.
College Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience and can't wait to see whats still in store.
College Sophomore,5,Always have career fairs and are helping you with every step in the process.
Sophomore,4,"I cannot express how much I love SNC! The professors are personal and want to see their students succeed, the campus is absolutely gorgeous, and there are so many ways to get involved and stay busy. Saint Norbert College is also located near several attractions which include parks, trails, coffee shops, stores, and restaurants."
Alum,4,Professors worked with students to make sure that the material was able to be understood as if the class was taking place in person. The only downfall would be the lack of structure that online courses give in comparison to campus classes.
Junior,4,"I took 4 classes online due to the coronavirus. Although the business related classes I took were challenging, my professors were very helpful with always being there on zoom or google meet. I also noticed how quickly my professors responded to emails as well. They were more lenient with grades and were very concerned with our mental health because of being at home for an extended period of time. They were so understanding and were willing to move deadlines if we were feeling overwhelmed or not ourselves. I was worried about how online classes would be but my professors made it a smooth process."
Junior,4,"After attending my first year of college at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, I quickly realized it was not where I belonged. I wanted to be at a college where it felt like it was a close knit community and more one on one time with professors. That is exactly what I got when I transferred to St. Norbert College. I felt so welcomed and like a valued part of the community. The friendships I have made thus far will last a lifetime and the professors will forever leave a positive impact on my life as a student. Loving the college I go to has significantly made me a happier person. I no longer wake up and wonder what it's like to experience going to a school that makes you excited to be there. I wake up now and cannot wait to see my friends and go to social events. St. Norbert College took me out of a really dark time and reminded me that there is always light at the end of the tunnel."
Sophomore,4,"St. Norbert College is an incredible place to learn and grow. I have found in this place a home and a place to grow into a successful adult and teacher. This campus is very small, but I find this an advantage; the professors truly know and care about their students. I am honored to be learning from such hardworking and devoted professors. I am so glad I chose this college because it cultivates a lifestyle that encourages opportunity and trying new things in a safe and supportive environment."
Freshman,4,"My experience at St. Norbert College has been incredibly good over the past few months. It is an incredible school when it comes to academics, class sizes, and over all getting to know your professors and class mates very well."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are generally outstanding. They know their material and can teach it well, and they are understanding of students' needs. Also, the classroom size is small enough where you can ask questions and talk to the professors. One downside is cost, which is partly to be expected due to it being a private college but is nonetheless something worth considering. Another would be the faith aspect. I found it to be lacking where it matters most: the leadership. If you care about going to a college that is Catholic in identity and not just in name, then that's another weight to take into account."
Sophomore,4,When I started at SNC I wasn't sure it was the school for me but after first semester I knew I chose the right school. Everyone is very welcoming and kind. The small class sizes allows for students to get to know their teachers and learn as much as possible.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful. Would not regret going to this college for undergraduate studies. The lecture rooms are very big and the seating is very nice, it wouldn't hurt to sit in the chairs for an hour or two."
Senior,4,"I haven't started classes as of this review, but from the various times I've visited or participated at an event on campus, I can say that St. Norbert College is among the top colleges in the state of Wisconsin. The sense of community I felt amongst the students in my first visits was unavoidable, along with the beauty of the campus.  The dorms aren't the greatest at first glance, although once students get to decorate their rooms, they look a lot nicer. All the buildings are within a quick walking distance from each other, and they are all kept well maintained, especially with the newly renovated science building and gym! One of my favorite parts about any campus, the cafeteria, is also a home run at SNC. The food is amazing, and I'm not ashamed to admit that it was one of the deciding factors for me when choosing colleges."
Niche User,4,"Everyone is very kind and friendly. Their facilities are  great, education programs are  well planned, and they offer one of the best study abroad programs I have seen."
Freshman,4,"One of the top ranked schools for food and has strong STEM, education, and business programs. Very focused on making kids feel like they belong. Communio is key."
Freshman,4,"Great sense of community and support.  Majority of professors really care about you, great cafeteria.  Expensive, but there's a reason why it costs so much.  THEy automatically give at least a $40,000 scholarship to everyone."
Sophomore,4,"The food quality in the dinning hall is outstanding. Always warm and plenty of variety to pick from. The class sizes are small, usually around 20-25 students per class. This allows you to get to know your professors fairly well. A downside to the college is the housing. The college is a 4 year on campus living school. The amount of housing  available to students is not much. There is not enough housing for student to live comfortably. Also many of the dorms do not have A/C or are still community shower/bathrooms. Something that many other college have gone away from in today’s world."
Junior,4,"The attitude and feel of community at Saint Norbert College is unlike any other. All faculty and staff live and breathe communio and truly go above and beyond for the students from the professors, the cafeteria workers, to the garbage men! Unfortunately this college is lacking when it comes to costs. SNC is incomparably over-priced. Not only that, as tuition continues to increase for students, their scholarship awards do not reflect the increase leaving students, especially those who pay their own way, suffering heavily."
Senior,4,Overall great experience. It's obviously expensive but worth it IMO. Freshman and sophomore living situations are pretty rough but get better after. Food is great for campus food.
Alum,4,I loved my time at St. Norbert. My professors really cared me as a person and helped me to reach my career goals.
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at SNC. It is such an amazing community with so many opportunities. The campus is gorgeous and the surrounding area is filled with things for a college student to engage in. One of the most amazing things I have noted is the accessibility of professors here on campus and the opportunity to get involved not only on campus but with service outside of the campus community. SNC encourages it's students to become active citizens and community participants and works to give students a well rounded and rigorous education founded on strong principles of togetherness, dedication and hard work."
Sophomore,4,"St. Norbert is a very close community. Most of the students are friendly, they're still your normal college students though. Their program for Education majors is really nice because you get in the field early. Some of the counselors tell you that you do not need to take a language course but they neglect to inform you that you have to test out of the language in order to not need to take any language courses."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see more diversity on campus, with ethnicities, socio-economic groups and politically. I think there’s a lot to learn by accepting different views."
Freshman,4,"I adore Wisconsin and can’t imagine living anywhere else! The campus is quiet and peaceful, the students and administrators are very friendly. I can’t wait to start classes!"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore here and so far my experience has been great! I live close to campus so I commute rather than on campus. My only complaint about the school is the diversity. Students at the school are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, and straight. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in general but as a minority student, it does make social life at the school slightly harder and more intimidating."
Senior,4,"St norbert's motto is ""Communio"" which comes from the latin word of community. St Norbert goes above and beyond to make every student feel welcome. Whether you are a religious studies major or a electrical engineer minor, St Norbert has a place for you!"
Junior,4,"I love St. Norbert.  As a Music Ed student, I feel that with this major, corners are cut to meet the four year plan they have for their students.  The work-load can be overbearing, but ultimately possible."
Senior,4,"The only downside to SNC is the price. The food is the best in the state, the exercise facilities are brand new, and the professors truly care about their students. They all make an effort to learn your name and your story, and it’s not too hard for them with class sizes capped at 35 (though usually they aren’t bigger than 20)."
Freshman,4,"The staff and coaches have been very welcoming, considerate and professional. The campus and facilities are well cared for and very efficient. The educational opportunities and feel of belonging are stellar."
Freshman,4,"I love the beautiful atmosphere at SNC, but there are not many school led events for students to participate in, and the party scene is bad."
Sophomore,4,"It is really small school, so that enables to build a bond with professors easily. Professors are enthusiastic for teaching and their own research."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus; it is small and beautiful, situated on the Fox River. In the fall and spring it is especially beautiful. The class sizes are perfect because you get to know your classmates. Also, the professors truly care about you. While the tuition is expensive, there are a lot of scholarships. It would be better if this college had a more diverse population."
Senior,4,St. Norbert College is a great place for anyone. It is a school that allows the teachers to be involved and they show their interest. Professors are always there to help and want every student to pass.
Sophomore,4,I love St. Norbert for it's academics and the community it creates. It has great food and great professors but dorm life and diversity has definite room for improvement.
Senior,4,St. Norbert has great professors. They are always willing to meet with their students. They really want them to succeed. The college also has a great Educational program.
Senior,4,"Very personal, have your best interest at heart. great class debates and discussions. Campus is beautiful."
Freshman,4,"I love how small the campus is. Most of the professors are willing to work with you when you need accommodations. 
The food is wonderful and the staff works hard to make everyone feel like they are  home."
Freshman,4,"I really love SNC!  The campus is beautiful and so clean.  The people are all wonderful and unbelievably polite.  The academics are great and very diverse, with the teachers being very involved, even if they sometimes forget office hours.  I do not go to parties, but I have heard from friends the sober parties are very fun and they have a great time there!  I am no athlete, but my friends seem to really enjoy the athletic program here.  The teachers are amazing and they really add to the overall experience.  I feel very safe here, there have been a few reports of ""attacks"" on campus, but each time, people are physically injured.  The food here is delicious and I have definitely gained my freshman 15, but no worries, the new fitness center is almost complete, so I won't have to worry about gaining any more weight!  Overall, I really love the school and everything that involves it!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the vibe of the campus, not just how it looks, but the people as well.  I'm treated like person instead of a number, and my professors care about my well-being.  It is hard as a music education triple cert, to fit classes in my schedule and some professors aren't very understanding.  My schedule isn't easy to figure out because I have required classes that are only at one time, and people don't understand that."
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed all of my professors and the class sizes are perfect. It is one of the biggest thing I considered while applying for schools.
College Sophomore,4,Almost 90% of the education majors from St. Norbert get jobs after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,Every student is very aware of the options and facilities they have available to them
College Senior,4,Housing is a bit pricey but it's good. I have always gotten into the housing I have wanted.
College Senior,4,The sports center at St. Norbert is currently being re-done and it is going to be an excellent addition to the school.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe being on campus here. They have campus safety cars driving around and other modes of security on campus. I have never felt unsafe walking by myself late at night or anytime since I have been here.
College Sophomore,4,"I like living on campus, living close to my classes and with my friends is really fun. There are many dorm options to choose from and they are spread out across campus so you can decide what works best for you."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic department at St. Norbert is really good. Many people turn out to go to football and basketball games, which shows a lot of fan support for the players. They are currently rebuilding the athletic facilities on  campus, so very soon they will be top of the line!"
College Junior,4,Some classes are harder than they need to be but there are many great classes and opportunities
College Senior,4,the campus is very private and it helps that most students know each other and look out for each other.
College Senior,4,"St. Norbert were willing to discuss the acceptance process, Financial Aid, and the learning resources that are available."
College Sophomore,4,Security and services are there for anyone who needs it.
College Sophomore,4,Didn't have any problems getting the housing I wanted.
College Sophomore,4,Not involved but from word of mouth I have only heard good things.
College Sophomore,4,"As a member of the cross country and track team, we have some nice facilities."
College Freshman,4,"Like I said it's great, everyone on campus is very friendly and caring. The professors are pretty nice and they do care about their students! It's a great campus"
Recent Alumnus,4,"the parties are fun if you know people who are throwing the parties you attend, if you dont know them dont go to them.  the bars are fun you see so many of your class mates. parties get busted a lot so if your underage be careful."
Recent Alumnus,4,parties are fun if you know people otherwise dont go.
Recent Alumnus,4,very high standards for learning and performance in classes
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love SNC and think its a great school to attend, I've had many unique and wonderful experiences with faculty, friends and community members."
Recent Alumnus,4,Career and Professional development puts on career and internship fairs that are very helpful to go to
Recent Alumnus,4,"Greek houses are not allowed in DePere, however the majority of house parties take place in houses that are primarily made up of greek students sports teams also host many house parties, the volunteering and other philanthropy often goes unnoticed by the student body not involved because their members don't advertise it well."
College Freshman,4,They are really a big thing on campus.
College Freshman,4,My school is HUGE into hockey.
Freshman,2,"The food was great and the people were always kind. However, the professors were more focused on teaching their own thesis' and not the material for the tests they gave. The campus was beautiful and was located in a very beautiful part of Wisconsin, but there was not much to do there, and the campus was poor at giving students opportunities on the weekends. The tuition is far to high for attending this college."
Recent Alumnus,2,if you are not commuting you are required in 2016-2017 to live on campus as a senior the options are open however my roommates and i wanted to live in a house not an apartment and we could not because all of the houses were taken 30 mins into the selection process for the entire school.
College Freshman,2,"I live in Burke and the other week there was an incident in the girls restroom and a male intruder. I felt pretty safe up until that point. There should be measures taken to prevent something like this from happening again, more cameras, another swipe in or SOMETHING. I am scared to go back and use the showers again and that shouldn't be a problem."
College Freshman,2,"Burke is terrible. Its probably not the actual housing that's the issue, boys need to learn how to shower.

Also the doubles could be larger. very tight compared to other dorms on campus"
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus housing is very rare on our campus.  Only a select number of seniors are allowed to live off campus, and the houses that are available are basically the same as the ones provided by the school as campus housing."
College Freshman,2,"St. Norbert wants to create a completely residential college, meaning EVERYONE will live on campus. Completely ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,I feel like this college asks for way more money than is necessary. This is the main reason I want to transfer.
College Junior,2,"The wi-fi is not good. There are a good amount of computers in the library and there is never a time where all computers are being used. Printing is pretty good, I have never used all my printing money but I also had my own printer and printed some things using that."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a small school, there is not a lot of diversity."
College Freshman,2,it next to a river so it super cold in the winter but in the summer it great
College Freshman,2,There none that very close...the closest is 5 min. walk
College Senior,2,"We don't have any transportation options on campus.  The bus system doesn't cover the De Pere area, but rather Green Bay."
College Senior,2,"Student involvement in sports on campus is sad.  We have some great teams, but many students don't attend the events.  We don't have a pep band, there is limited school spirit, and our facilities are awful!  Our gym is bad, our baseball fields are bad, and the weight room is awful."
College Sophomore,2,"We pay a very high price for our parking permit, but that is nothing compared to the amount of parking tickets we are sure to receive. As I previously stated, the nearest residential lot to any North campus living is a good 10-20 minute walk. At night or in the winter, that is unreasonable considering there is a commuter lot directly adjacent to two of the residential dorms. Parking was eliminated due to the expansion of the science building, and no alternative plans have been explained to the student body regarding the shortage. Many students need a car for a job or for driving home. Even the nightly shuttle that was implemented is difficult to catch and it only comes every half hour."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Safety worries more about busting a few harmless parties than they do about actually protecting the student body. Blue-light call boxes are in disrepair. It takes Campus Safety at least 20 minutes to show up when you call them on your cell phone asking for help. They spend more time and energy leaving parking tickets than they do investigating reports of assault. 
There are two ways of thinking when it comes to security on campus: defending the student body or incriminating it. Our campus tends to prefer the latter of the two."
College Freshman,2,Students don't need a car on campus but if you have a car expect to park pretty far away. 
College Sophomore,2,I am a biology major. The workload as well as curriculum is extremely difficult according to myself and a large majority of students that are biology majors at my school.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very easy for students to access alcohol and drug substances. We are considered a ""party school"" and a large majority of the students indulge in these behaviors. "
College Freshman,2,I'd like to see more scholarship opportunities at SNC.
College Freshman,2,I think parking is average here. As a freshman you have to park in the freshman lot which people complain about but it's not that far...only like two blocks.
Alum,1,"the scheduling for classes is a debacle.  Wait lists at a small private expensive liberal arts college is unacceptable !  First priority is to make space for  students to take classes.  The days of ""wait listing"" are over , you don't get alumni by limiting classes....the environment should be to encourage learning , not waitlist it."
College Sophomore,1,"Getting around without your own car, is nearly impossible. Things are far away, so walking is out of the question. The bus system exists, but the bus doesn't run that often and doesn't go to the places I need. Biking can be done, but during the winter and into the fall, campus safety asks for you to take your bike home. I need to go places just as often in the winter as the spring, so that is frustrating. Needless to say, it is very convenient to make friends with those who have cars."
College Sophomore,1,"SNC requires you to live on campus all 4 years, and this is a terrible rule!!"
College Senior,1,Decent Money Sucky Service – The financial aid office offers a number of scholarships but when you have a question about it or need more they are of no help whatsoever
College Junior,1,"They ticket for every possible thing they can! Drinking, parking, noise... everything."
College Junior,1,"Campus Safety – our campus safety consists of scrawny men and tiny women that as a small female I could fend off myself... I would feel safer running from whatever trouble was occuring. Also, there is a a prison a few miles away which is a bit scary."
College Junior,1,There is almost no nightlife outside from parties in small college house basements.
College Sophomore,1,"Drinking Is Everywhere – Tons of people smoke weed and come to class baked. Sometimes I'd walk down my hall and it would completely smell of marajuana, and tons of people smoke down by the river. Campus police does next to nothing. There's a huge drinking problem on campus, and the school just lets it happen with the idea that we're in Wisconsin so it's going to happen anyways."

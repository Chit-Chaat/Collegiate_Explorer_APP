Sophomore,5,"Many of the professors were understanding of the circumstances. They had trouble moving classes online but never blamed students for being confused and/or lost during the transition/coursework.  
Still provided tutors online along with hosting many 'zoom' (different online videocall) meetings to ensure students understood coursework or needed extra help."
Freshman,5,I struggled heavily with the transition from high school to college and failed pretty much all my classes. Cedar crest was there for me to help me get back on track. The staff really took the time to set me up for success and became great allies. I do not think I would have been able to do it without them especially the student success coach. I am so fortunate to have a community who truly cares for my well being and success. They really made me feel like a part of the campus even though I am a commuter and there is a sense of distance that comes with it.
Freshman,5,"I am Freshman at Cedar Crest College. It's a pretty campus and I am liking it so far. The professors and staffs are really helpful, however the college food is not one of the best things at the College."
Sophomore,5,"A beautiful environment is created for all the students who attend, you feel welcomed every day. Meeting new people, a diverse and culturally advanced environment, where everyone is equal. The staff and faculty are all ready to help any time of the day via email, phone, or person. this college's goal is to focus on the whole student, and i believe they do, do that."
Freshman,5,"The school is honestly such a close knit community, and networking opportunities are great. You'd be crazy to not come here!"
Sophomore,5,I love how helpful the professors are. The students are very friendly. I love how they have tutors if you're struggling in any of the classes.
Niche User,5,"Cedar Crest College is unlike any other college I have visited. All the faculty works their hardest to be there for their students. Not only are they there academically, but they are there personally. They make sure you're comfortable and that you have no problems. The campus in general is beautiful. There is a new breed of tree everywhere you look. Right behind the school is a park. The school gives you the feeling of being at home. Cedar Crest is also one of the most diverse campuses I have ever been on. They also have every major known just about. To be honest, there is nothing I would really change except for a bit of renovation."
Freshman,5,The best experience I could ever have. Professors are willing to help you succeed and excel. There are countless opportunities to build relationships and further your education.
Freshman,5,"I like the academic level, the way in which the teachers teach, the high level of learning in the students and the support of the tuyores for academic support."
Niche User,5,It is really nice and friendly there. I have made a lot of friends. The staff is great! I have expanded my knowledge here.
Sophomore,5,"Cedar Crest College has so many things to offer everyone.  With a beautiful campus, awesome activities and wonderful professors and staff, Cedar Crest makes me feel at home."
Junior,5,I love how small Cedar Crest College is. The professors are already a there for you! You will receive a great education no matter what major you are trying to achieve.
Senior,5,"Honestly, Cedar Crest was the right decision for me. I know a lot of high school seniors have a very difficult choice to make when it comes time to figuring out what college program to go to into, etc. but Cedar Crest truly was the right decision. I have learned so much about myself and about how to become a better person by getting to learn from our amazing staff in the Communications and Dance departments."
Senior,5,"What I like about Cedar Crest College is their commitment to diversity and the population of the school. It is a small school, around 1,600 at last check; rather than feeling like a number, the smaller class sizes have helped me to develop personal and student relationships with the professors. The campus is very diverse, with international students and students coming from all over the United States. I have been a part of the literary club, the improv group FADED, America Reads as a student tutor, and am secretary for Disciple Makers Christian Fellowship at Cedar Crest College, a weekly Bible study. I also love the variety of clubs the school offers for all majors and interests. I am proud to be a Cedar Crest falcon!"
Junior,5,"The campus is gorgeous when all the trees and flowers are fully bloomed, so many colors and the smell of it all when you walk by the trees is amazing.  All the professors are really friendly and very helpful, they all want to see you graduate. The students are really friendly and always have smiles on their faces. Everyone has goals to be successful in their career and graduating. The performing arts department is amazing, the shows they put on are always astonishing the dancers and actors work really hard to really make it happen. The celebrations on campus are really fun. The clubs are great to be in and are very involved with the community. It's a great school to go to and it's an all girl school which represents leadership. I wouldn't know where I would be without Cedar Crest!"
Niche User,5,I have not started but the process of getting enrolled and selecting classes has been a breeze so far.
Freshman,5,I have a great group of friends I made here. My professors are very helpful when you have a question. The atmosphere is very good.
Freshman,5,"I personally like this college and I like the communication between teachers and students. The one thing that sucks about this school is the food, the high pricing and the dorms."
Alum,5,"I have an amazing time at Cedar Crest College and would recommend it to women or young women who are interested in pursing a high quality degree with easy access to high quality professors and peers. I gained very useful experience that took me to a great job and I know it's because of my CCC education, excellent recommendations, and the work study/volunteer/other opportunities I took advantage of during school. Since I've graduated, they have started something called the Sophomore Experience during which ALL sophomore students study abroad. I will continue to donate regularly to further CCC's mission."
Freshman,5,"If you are looking for a place to further your education, look no further than Cedar Crest! Cedar Crest has wonderful professors, as well as small class sizes. The various different departments get along really well with one another, which is not always the case with major universities."
Freshman,5,"Cedar Crest is a fantastic school! Initially I was apprehensive about the size but it is not a problem, in fact it helps getting to know your teachers and classmates to promote academic success. I was able to easily get an on-campus job my first semester, and joined three different clubs including a sports team. The faculty is very willing to work with students and the food isn't bad either."
Niche User,5,"Cedar Crest is a great family atmosphere. Every time I go to the college everyone is warm, funny, and welcoming. I feel at home and safe there. It is very easy to make friends there too. The college seems like a  great place to learn. I hope next year I will have as much fun there as everyone else seems like they are having."
Freshman,5,"I love Cedar Crest. I am a current freshman. I had never visited the college before move in day. I will never forget my first few moments on campus. They forever won my heart. the campus is quiet, small, beautiful, clean, and very safe. We have security right here on campus 24/7. I never been afraid to walk to me dorm by myself after dark. The professors, faulty and staff are amazing. Some of them are more like friend's then professors. They all want to see you succeed and try to do everything they can to help you. They're aren't any parties on campus which is nice if you aren't about that life. However, if you are, there's other colleges within the area that you can visit to party. Cedar Crest has become my home away from home."
Freshman,5,Cedar crest is a small college that wants you to succeed. They go out of their way to help you adjust.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy the environment. As well as the student to teacher ratio. The classroom setting is very intimate, which enhances my learning."
Junior,5,"This is such a wonderful college. The small campus allows for students to get more involved than on a bigger campus. There are many opportunities for students to be involved and to hold leadership positions.The school is a community that looks out for one another and always supports each other. The professors genuinely love teaching and want every student to succeed, providing an engaging classroom setting. There is always a warm and welcoming atmosphere, not to mention the campus is absolutely beautiful all year. The grounds of the college are a registered arboretum, so there are a wide variety of trees and plants that make the campus a wonderful place to study or to spend time outside."
Junior,5,I love the cultural diversity and the multiple opportunities to get together with people with the same interests.
Freshman,5,"It is a small campus that is very safe. All the faculty, staff, and students are friendly. There are many varieties of clubs and organizations to join. Academics are very important to the school. They want you to be prepared for life after college and that is why they have courses such as College Life."
Niche User,5,"Through my multiple visits to Cedar Crest College, they were welcoming and made sure to inform me of what I would be learning if I go there. I also like the small classes they have there."
Junior,5,Beautiful campus with excellent professors. Has various outlets for students to prepare for life after graduation and events to participate in.
College Sophomore,5,I love it! They are so one on one with you.
College Sophomore,5,It is very safe. The police are always driving around watching and there are plenty of cameras too.
College Sophomore,5,"The school I am in is an amazing school. The professors know what they are talking about and they genuinely care about our success as a student. They are great to work one on on with and they understand that we are not experts like they are. They are much better than my high school. I look forward to going to classes knowing that if I have a question, they are someone I can rely on."
College Sophomore,5,Cedar Crest nursing is stellar. A BSN from CCC is extremely valuable and holders of this degree are recruited by outstanding hospitals.
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about Cedar Crest. It is truly a beautiful place. It is where I belong.
College Sophomore,5,"Cedar Crest is phenomenal! If I could go back in time and redo the college selection process, I would choose Cedar Crest College all over again. Professors go out of their way to help the students succeed. You are really not just a number."
College Sophomore,5,"The gym and pool are almost always open, and I think they are the best thing about the campus. They hold a lot of fitness challenges and events for everyone to continue to stay active."
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe to live on and few crimes.
College Junior,5,"- A VERY SAFE CAMPUS.

- The student body is responsible and safe, which is the most important thing.

- Campus police are always out and about. There is an ""e2campus"" alert system to your phone.

- Campus police are attentive and email precautions if there is suspicious activity right away.

- Campus police will drive you to a place on campus if you don't feel safe.

- The security takes precautions and there are fire and shooter drills."
College Junior,5,"- There are a variety of courses to take and are all interesting. 

- There is a good balance between classes offered during the day and classes offered at night, as well as in-class and online. 

- The class sizes are smaller and professors are approachable and will work with you. They want you to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"I love the the professors here. They really understand what it is like to be in our shoes and are able to give helpful advice. The workload is manageable, because campus is not too active on the weekends and that leaves time to get work done. The curriculum in my classes is very diverse, but manageable and easy to understand."
College Freshman,5,The professors are very helpful and I love classes.
College Freshman,5,It is a highly reviewed women's leadership college.
College Freshman,5,I love Cedar Crest! I love campus life and classes.
College Sophomore,5,They were very strict with drug and alcohol safety.
College Sophomore,5,I love the gym and the pool area for getting in shape.
College Sophomore,5,I cannot even go into how much I love Cedar Crest College.  It truly is the best fit for me.
College Junior,5,"Professors at Cedar Crest are always more than willing to help you if you put forth effort. This school is for those who are serious about their education and future. The science and nursing programs are the best in the region. And for that reason, only the best teachers will do! Class sizes range from small nightly classes to 50-70 students for a class everyone needs to take. Just spends on your major."
College Senior,5,"A LOT of diversity on campus including race, religion, sexual preference, socioeconomical."
College Senior,5,We have a great disability office that I take advantage of for additional test time for ADHD. They help with study skills and offer tutoring. Professors are always willing to give additional help. The registration process is very easy and advisors always have extra time to meet before course registration begins for each semester. You are encouraged to do independent research.
College Senior,5,One of my primary reasons for choosing cedar crest was the class sizes. The classes are very small. Even the required courses that the majority of students need to take are rarely over 30 students. Most of my classes have 10 or less students. The courses are great and very interesting. A wide diversity in courses and the professors are all knowledgeable in their fields.
College Senior,5,"Our career services office will help with career choices, application, resume and interview skills. They also help with internships or graduate school. They offer practice GRE or MCAT tests. If you need professional attire for an interview or job, they also hold clothes drives on campus and give it to students in need. All of the services are available to any student or alumni. Internships can be found through career services or departmental chairs of your chosen major. As a neuroscience major, we are required to take a capstone course that prepares us for a job or graduate school. We need to make a resume and cover letter, research proposal or practice thesis, mock interview, job and/or internship choices, etc.  The school and each department holds career fairs and speakers from different colleges. Cedar Crest alum also come to speak about their personal experiences and give helpful advice."
College Senior,5,"Cedar Crest is mostly an all female college with some exceptions. Males can attend if they're foreign exchange students, graduate students, or returning adult students (attending only evening classes). Due to this, there are hardly any men on campus. Even so, campus police is very active and communicates any issue on campus. They work very hard to make us feel safe. They also offer self defense classes."
College Senior,5,I am a returning adult student.  The school held information sessions for adults at reasonable times. We received info about the school in general and then major specific info. I received follow up calls and emails to serif I was interested in attending and if I needed any help with the admission process.
College Junior,5,As an adult learner Cedar Crest is an excellent choice. We are surrounded by other adults experiencing the same things. It makes the transition much smoother.
College Sophomore,5,"Cedar Crest College is by far the best choice I have ever made. For the courses to the food, Cedar Crest makes sure that its students gets the best experience on its campus. Its top notch security makes students feel safe on campus and its professor make sure we get the most out of course both in and out to of the classroom. Most importantly, encourage young women to become strong independent leaders in society and not to compromise who we are because of gender discrimination. The college teaches it students that women can be successful with the need for male support, but also that both genders need to work together to create a better world."
College Sophomore,5,There are many fast food restaurants and sit down restaurants near the college that many students are able to walk to.
College Sophomore,5,"The strictness is at a good level where it is not too strict but when administration needs the be strict, they can be."
College Sophomore,5,"Amazing, especially with the new dining hall, worth the money."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of different places right up the road from the school. Also, there is chinese food with value meals (is no longer free delivery though) There aren't really many student discounts."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the faculty. Everyone is very welcoming and helpful. The classes are tough but they provide a lot of tutoring to ensure students get the help they need. They provide student and professional tutors.
The campus is very small and majority of the student body is focused on their studies.  The campus provides many events on campus free to students to lessen the stress during midterm and finals as well as to have fun during the school year."
Freshman,4,Like most colleges and universities cedar crest uses canvas. Nothing against the college as the professors try the best they can but canvas is difficult to use and has screwed me over with assignments before.
Sophomore,4,I do love my school! I am a sophomore this incoming semester. I feel as though my faculty in the Education Department is there for me. They always have my back! I would love if Cedar Crest renovated their dorms rooms and bathrooms in the buildings that haven’t been done. I would also love if they changed their food services because it’s absolutely disgusting. I ended up lowering my meal plan to the very lowest so I can cook instead next semester. Also as a black student I wish their was a little more diversity on campus because their is only a limited amount of us.
Sophomore,4,I’ve taken two hybrid classes and a full online classes so far. I feel like my hybrid classes were great because I still got my face to face time. The full online was fine as well. I took a very hard class so I passed by the skin of my teeth since I didn’t get that face to face time.
Freshman,4,"I have been to many college visits, but this college had everything I wanted and more. It is a small college, yet something is always going on. The college makes sure that you get passed your first year in college, because it is definitely the most challenging part. Everyone is so nice and inviting, and that is what initially drew me to the college. They also have an amazing nursing facility that just got a 100% pass rate this past year. I recommend this school to anyone that wants a small school, to go into nursing, and wants a really diverse environment."
Senior,4,"Cedar Crest College is really a great place to attend. They offer a wide range of majors which makes the college picking process easier for students like it did for me. Cedar Crest holds great activities for their students during the holidays and otherwise as well. I would love to see a more wide variety of activities held throughout the campus so there is a little something for everyone to participate in and  have a better, more enriched college experience."
Senior,4,"I love this college. I started off as a traditional student back in 2010. I took a leave of absence and returned last year. I could have gone to any other school closer to home to finish getting my undergraduate degrees but I felt that I had to become a Cedar Crest alumni. They have a great sage (life-long learners or non-traditional students) program. The professors and staff are just incredible and since campus is small they really get to know you and they really care. It has a very welcoming feeling and even though I don’t live on campus, it’s still has a feeling of home."
Junior,4,"I would really like to see the community grow and get better as a whole. I would love to see all of us get along.

There is a bit of a disconnect between certain professors and the reality of the current student population's actual capabilities"
Junior,4,"What I like about Cedar Crest College is their commitment to diversity and the population of the school. It is a small school, around 1,600 at last check; rather than feeling like a number, the smaller class sizes have helped me to develop personal and student relationships with the professors. The campus is very diverse, with international students and students coming from all over the United States and a few students from other countries. I have been a part of the Asian society of Asian Animation club, Treasure and PR for Psychology club, and club Member of Out There. I love how involved the Professor in the Psychology department is with the students and how dedicated everyone is dedicated to reaching their goals. I have made friendships that will last a lifetime"
Freshman,4,"Cedar Crest College is a very diverse school that gives lots of different opportunities to their students.  Not only are the professors great, but the college as a whole work on educating the entire student. In their sophomore year, students have the opportunity to go to another country through the Sophomore Expedition program free of charge."
Junior,4,I like that professors are caring and want to see you succeed. And it has a welcoming atmosphere. I would like to see an affordable tuition. Especially for thpse who struggle to pay tuition out of pocket.
Freshman,4,"I am currently in my first year at Cedar Crest College and I have enjoyed it. I have met so many wonderful new people and made quite a few new friends. I enjoy the hospitality of the campus and how I always feel like I am at home. They always have lots of campus events going on as well, so there's never a time to be bored! They have something for everyone. The college truly does care for their students as a whole. I believe I made the right choice of coming to this school for my nursing degree and look forward to the next 3 years!"
Junior,4,"I love the campus, students, and professors, but since it is such a small campus, sometimes it is rough to get all the classes you need in a timely fashion. Certain classes are only offered every other year in a specific semester and there are hardly any summer or winter courses. But it is a beautiful campus filled with people who want to help you achieve your dreams!"
Sophomore,4,I love the variety of cultures at the school and also how we all are brought in together as a community. Not many schools are involved with their community but with Cedar Crest College there are opportunities to do volunteer work through the school in the community. The one thing I believe should be changed are with the dining services. Students have classes from 6-930 or even later and the dinning halls close at 9 so therefore some people are unable to eat when they get out of class.
Junior,4,"I like that they commit to adult learning, and that they have night classes for working adults.  I also like that most of the professors work with you on your projects and paper.  The writing center hours could be more catered to the sage students and not traditional students."
Freshman,4,I love the school but if you love to eat and go out you need to find another school. You need a car to get everywhere and the campus food is only good SOMETIMES.
Niche User,4,On my visit to Cedar Crest all the faculty are very nice and welcoming. I committed on my first official tour of the school. The basketball games are fun to attend. The food is great and there is a decent variety to choose from.
Junior,4,"Faculty are invested in my success. The students quickly become family.  Leadership is encouraged. I am never told no, rather ""are you sure you have time"" or ""come see me if you need to help"""
Sophomore,4,I like that the professors at Cedar Crest College are helpful to the students. I like that Cedar Crest has a part-time nursing program for working adults with a family.
Niche User,4,Cedar Crest College is a small school that helps build women into leaders. There are several amazing teachers that really excel in their fields. The  required liberal studies credits can be limiting.
Junior,4,"The nursing program is extremely challenging.  It is literally a life commitment.  Its extremely challenging to be an adult student and balance life, children, family, work, paying bills and being an adult and being in school/clinical and paying tuition. Yikes!"
Junior,4,Cedar Crest is a really great college to attend. The atmosphere is peaceful and if you are determined to pass your classes with no distraction this is the school for you. The students and staff at this school is nice and always willing to help. The school at the moment is ranked #2 for their nursing program pass rate for the NCLEX. I definitely would put this college on the top of my list to apply to.
Junior,4,"I love Cedar Crest. The only complaint I have is that I wish there were more financial support for SAGE, students of adult and graduate education. Traditional students have many financial cuts coming in from other schools, transfer students. I feel adult students have more responsibilities than traditional students by the way of families, jobs, paying bills for homes etc. Many traditional students live on campus or with parents who pay their tuition. I have to pay for all my tuition as an adult student other than a $2000 transfer scholarship for having a 3.9 GPA when I transferred. Tuition for me is over $15,000 a semester. Professors are great and very approachable. Beautiful campus and if is a women's college."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed attending Cedar Crest, the campus is beautiful and the history behind the school. The only  thing that I did have issue with was the financial aid office. The last year of my major is at an affiliate school and there were many issues with that. I believe that if there is going to be affiliate schools then all of those bugs should be fixed before you have students making plans."
College Senior,4,"This school is an amazing place to reach your goals and create a stable pathway to success! The professors do a great job at ensuring student success, and they are very reliable."
College Sophomore,4,The sports are a big part of school life.
College Senior,4,"The reason i haven't left is because i have amazing professors that actually care about my education and well-being. they are so accommodating and actually want you to succeed. Not all faculty is like this, but i've had very good experiences so far."
College Senior,4,"I'm not a part of the frat myself, but they are always recruiting. It's a frat centered around community service, and i'd join, but you have to pay a fee to get in. Otherwise, it's pretty awesome. They always travel during spring break and work with habitat for humanity to build housing."
College Senior,4,"I think that the teachers are amazing, but the higher-ups like the dean, the office of student financial aid and the such make it a less enjoyable experience. I will be a senior next year and the only reason i haven't chosen to transfer to another cheaper school, is because i know how much it actually matters to my professors that i get good grades and find a good job in my field. I know that they will keep caring about me even after i graduate and it's so amazing to have supportive people like that rooting for you and pushing you to do your best."
College Sophomore,4,I have always felt safe walking around campus
College Sophomore,4,I have no problems with the campus housing. I have lived in Steinbright and Moore. Moore is by far my favorite. I love it!
College Sophomore,4,APO seems like such a fun and rewarding fraternity to be a part of! The group of students involved in it thoroughly care about giving back to their community.
College Sophomore,4,The fitness is currently being redone. Cedar Crest ensures that the students and athletes are happy at their home away from home.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the college is a beautiful place to focus on one's studies. There's not much party life that goes on, which allows for students to study. The park right next to the campus is the best thing because it's a great place to study and relax."
College Sophomore,4,"The college sends students to internships, and those students do such a good job that the places look for students from this college in the future. Cedar Crest girls have made such a good name for the school."
College Sophomore,4,Everything gets handled in the best possible way. The campus police are always patrolling and looking out for everyone on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"There's a lot of work that comes with each class, but the work helps me understand the topics in class. I only have trouble with balancing the time for each class."
College Junior,4,"- The most popular majors at CCC are nursing and forensic science, which are both great programs.

- There are a lot of ways to pursue interests on campus through clubs.

- The experience is what you make it: you can be a leader on campus and make connections.

- A degree from CCC is valued, and you get the best recommendations because you have the opportunity to really know your professors. 

- The downside is opportunities can be very localized. It may be difficult to find things out of the area or state because the college isn't as well-known. But good news: it's getting there!"
College Freshman,4,Most people are very accepting to the fact that I am a Christian and abide to my own set of morals. There are some people who are not a fan of me because I'm a Christian and the fact that I am not always a talker and more of a listener.
College Freshman,4,Campus is safe at all times of the day and very secure.
College Freshman,4,I love how the doors were painted and TV's added.
College Freshman,4,We are very supportive and they get very involved.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of school spirit both on and off campus.
College Sophomore,4,Cedar Crest College was very accepting of those who were diverse.
College Sophomore,4,Safety and security was good at Cedar Crest College.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors that I had were great, and I feel that I have learned a lot from them.  There were a wide range of courses available to take.  Class sizes were small with an average 15 - 1 student to teacher ratio."
College Junior,4,"Students who attend CCC need to understand that the workload will be heavy and hard. Having a great education at a great college comes with a cost. That doesn't mean you can't have fun or join clubs. Those things keep you going and relieve stress. It's extremely important to have an advisor that you like and can talk to comfortably. Usually freshman year, students are still figuring out their career goals and that's fine. Don't waste it on crap classes. You'll have time for the extra curricular classes later."
College Sophomore,4,"Teachers make sure we get the most out of everything we do in the course, offering one-on-one discussions with students and extra material to increase our interest in the class."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus has a  pretty diverse student body because of the student exchange programs. Many of the students have different religious backgrounds, but the college has a great tolerance for all of them."
College Sophomore,4,"It was high school. I got in, studied, good grades, stayed out of trouble, and graduated with honors. Nothing really bad or good  happen to me."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't heard of any students that were cited for anything other than smoking to close to faulty buildings. Cases that did have issues other than smoking were immediately written down with a report and were kicked out of the college if caught a second time. It's nice living on a campus that has zero tolerance of illegal drugs and drinking on campus.
College Junior,4,"CCC is a great school for the sciences. I know in getting an intense education while attending this school. My advisor is knowledgeable, my tutors for the classes I take are also my friends, and it's easy to make friends. Although it's an all girls school, there may be some cliques on campus but overall, just be yourself because you are there to get good grades and attend graduate school or something larger after that."
College Sophomore,4,This school is everything i imagined
College Senior,4,"It requires extremely hard work and dedication, but it is FAR worth it in the end when you look back and realize how much you have learned and that you are truly prepared to take on your new job title! (Nursing School)"
College Sophomore,4,Student advisers are very fast with responding and scheduling appointments.
College Sophomore,4,"I like my school because you really get to know your professors. They will mostly go out of their way to help you, and they understand that everyone is human and makes mistakes. During all of freshman year as a science major i was able to do research. Normally that isn't allowed until junior year, but Cedar Crest prepares you very well for the real world! I don't know much about other majors, but if you're a considering science major, it is a great school."
College Senior,4,"The research opportunities that are available between professor and student are simply amazing. That has been the best part about my experience, thus far."
College Junior,4,"I attend Cedar Crest College, which is a small all women's college in Allentown, PA. I love the small tight knit campus and I love that the professors get to know you. I am a Junior Art Therapy major and my major is the main reason I picked this college. However, I love that it is a D3 school and I still get to play the sports I love. I have found that I fit in pretty well at Cedar Crest. I love that we are taught to have a voice and that out opinion matters in the world. By going to an all women's college it allowed me to learn more about women's empowerment and leadership. Women's colleges are starting to dwindle away but I am proud that I attend one. Cedar Crest prepares you for much more than your major but for your life in the real world. I am a proud student of Cedar Crest and I wouldn't want to do it all over again because I am happy with my college. I love how nice and caring the professors are and I also love my beautiful campus. Cedar Crest is a beautiful arboretum,which consists of many trees. It is like my home away from home.  I wouldn't want it any other way."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small, all girls school that inspires young females to do anything they want with the low student to staff ratio."
College Junior,4,"From the day I arrived at Cedar Crest College, the school's atmosphere was positive and reassuring. Both the faculty members and the upperclassmen were knowledgeable about the activities and student life on campus. The alumni came and discussed what they had got out of Cedar Crest since graduating."
Junior,2,"The nursing program is a joke. The nursing department has many tools, yet they are very disorganized with them. I was stressed while in the program, not because of academics, but because I had no idea what was going on 80% of the time. They make students participate in a “nursing boot camp” before starting the semester, yet they didn’t teach us anything about the various recording/simulation resources. They offer ONE optional seminar per resource. If we miss that, we have to make an appointment with Fructl who is VERY busy. Why didn’t they teach us these things in boot camp??"
Freshman,2,"Besides Academics, cedar crest has nothing else to offer. (1)the food is always cold and it tastes horrible.(2) My friend once found a bug in her food. (3)They have no variety for the food choices.(4) if you're party student, don't even step foot on the campus because you will be DISAPPOINTED(and that is an understatement). (5)if you're an incoming freshman and you want a suite style dorm, good luck getting it because the seniors get it first(there are only 4 suites in the whole school)."
Niche User,2,"I enjoyed getting to know the professors at Cedar Crest. The professors genuinely care, and they want to see you succeed.  Overall, the academics are excellent. The professors will go out of there way to accommodate you and make sure you understand the material in class.

 However, the social aspect is lacking. I did not have a pleasant experience with  with my fellow classmates. Some were not friendly and had bad attitudes, while others were nice. Most students transfer after their second year. The dorms are not the best. If you are looking for a college with vibrant social life, this is not the college you want to attend."
Sophomore,2,"I felt that they were very welcoming when I first went through the application process and I felt that I would have a great time here but after the first couple months, I realized that I was not happy. I am currently in the nursing program and I feel like I am being set up to fail. I am actually transferring next semester because I feel like I cannot succeed here and also for other logistical reasons."
Niche User,2,"Overall, Cedar Crest is a great school. The opportunities are great. I had a few problems there with racism and discrimination from a few of the science department professors. There are some great professors in many of the other departments that truly care and show you that they care about the future of their students. The tutors on campus are great, when they feel like doing their jobs. There are many opportunities for the traditional students, but not many for those who are over 21. The school is a bit expensive, but that is to be expected with private colleges."
College Senior,2,The head of the athletics' department decides what sports she want at Cedar Crest.  She cancelled the Equestrian Club which is a club in high demand and now refuses to allow funding for it. During the all campus events the items at the athletics department are always subpar to the items at other departments. I do not know one single student who attends athletic functions at our school.  I will never attend one because she is not a nice person.  She refused to allow one student to participate even though the organization who is in charge of that sport would make an exception for her the athletic director said no.  All she had to do was write a letter saying that this person's program was half time.  Then se cut the sport all together at the end of the semester.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of students attended the athletic events on campus, and we didn't win many games.  The facilities were average.  School spirit was average."
College Sophomore,2,I do not think there is off-campus housing through the school
College Sophomore,2,"Offer more scholarships to apply for, there are only 5ish and they are very limited to those who can apply"
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of affordable places in area of school
College Freshman,2,I don't really know the facts about off-campus housing. It is not really discussed.
College Freshman,2,Cedar Crest is not known for parties. Many of the students go to other schools or locations around the town to party and have a good time.
College Freshman,2,My opinion is shaped by my lack of transportation (no car) and my past experiences in off-campus college cuisine (i'm a spoiled Californian with a deep love for UC Irvine's off-campus options). I feel that the surrounding restaurants that are within walking distance leave much room for improvement in the way of healthy and fresh options.
College Freshman,2,"I do not like my major because I am not receiving enough help when needed. My grades are suffering and I feel like a failure as a student. I know I would do better If i was receiving help, there is no tutor for my major."
College Freshman,2,There is no party scene at this school. Most students decide to go somewhere else for a party.
College Freshman,2,just getting help grades are suffering because theres not much help
College Freshman,2,no tutors for my subject really
College Freshman,2,some faculty are rude but some are nice as well
College Freshman,2,don't really know any alumni pretty sad
College Freshman,2,"not enough tutors, don't receive enough help, teachers are mostly always busy"
College Freshman,2,"The food tastes alright on the weekdays but on the weekend, it is disgusting. It looks like dog food half of the time, how many times am I going to have to order Domino's on the weekends? I'm a college student, I should not have to spend money on food on the weekends just because this school fails to make food that is edible."
College Junior,2,"It's considered an all-women college, so there's very few guys. The men who are here are either part of the nursing program or are adult learners (aka married). This is not the school to come to if you're looking for a male relationship."
College Junior,2,"There are 3 places to eat: Canova Commons dining hall, Falcon's Nest, and Cyber Cafe (coffee shop). The vegetarian options are limited at all of them and vegan options are non-existent. Everything is greasy, even pre-made salads! (If you make your own at the salad bar, of course, it's up to you to put oil or dressing on it.) 

The food is usually not labelled, but you can ask what it is."
College Junior,2,Most dorm rooms are old and in need of maintenance.
College Junior,2,"Very few parties, especially because it's mostly a commuter campus"
College Junior,2,It's division III. No one goes to the games and they rarely win.
College Junior,2,Greek life at school is pretty non-existent. The only greek I have ever heard was from like honor socities amongst different academic departments in the school. So I am really not sure or have information regarding this topic.
College Junior,2,"I personally have never been to a party at my school. It's predominately an all girls school so parties usually never happen, not that I know. If there are parties I feel like they would have a good impact on the students at the school beacuse it's a good way to take ones mind off of the usual study/homework habits. Not having to worry about an assignment for a class and just enjoy your night is needed occasionally. The school itself is not big at all, its truly a small campus and the dorms are little as well."
College Junior,2,One of the dorm buildings is literally 100 years old and has not been fully renovated. Many of the windows in the building do not open and we are only allowed to use one set of doors. Some of the rooms are very small (literally only enough room for a bed and desk).
College Junior,2,"We are a division III school. So, athletics is not important. We rarely win any games."
College Freshman,2,The girls clothes barely covered them
College Sophomore,2,Not many people care enough
College Sophomore,2,"All you do is hang in your room, or go out into Allentown or Bethlemhem"
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live on campus, however I do know that it is extremely high to live on campus. A student may as well just get an apartment near by and commute."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not own a car, currently. I walk to school, but I am not far away at all. I would recommend that anyone going to this school either pay the big ticket of living on campus or have a car, because there are not many sidewalks near the school unless you walk through the large unlit park behind the school...which is what I do. Walking around is just overall dangerous."
College Junior,2,You practically need a car to live on campus. They recently about 2 years ago implemented shuttles to go on shopping trips and clubs but overall that doesn't occur often. Not having a car sucks on this campus you either need a car or learn how to take the local bus.
College Sophomore,2,I do really go out to many bar scenes. I have a few favorites though.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't get out much, but I do know that there are lots of things to do in the surrounding areas."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics aren't really that big of a deal at Cedar Crest just because of the division we're in, and the fact that we're an all girl school; so naturally we don't have a football team, or baseball team etc."
College Freshman,2,"Most undergrads live on campus or commute from home. There aren't any off- campus housing selection, that I am aware of."
Freshman,1,"I transferred, ran screaming into the night, after only one semester here. It's all smoke and mirrors, they promise you one thing and deliver the opposite. They claim that there are many things to do on campus during the weekends, fact, it's a ghost town. The security at the dorms is downright scary, anyone can gain access to the dorms if another student gets them in the front door. The campus is across the street from private homes, so there are numerous people, who are not associated with the college walking around the campus. There are cliques, if you are a loner, or just shy, this is not the place for you."
Works Here,1,"2 words....

BED BUGS!!!!!!!!

This is what happens when you lower your standards of acceptance..  Trust me anyone with a valid checking account can get accepted.  Just know that your loans will be well into the 6 figures before you graduate and you will unlikely be able to pay them back."
Junior,1,"Run away from the nursing program! I had a great experience while taking my pre-nursing classes but once I got accepted into the nursing program everything changed.  From 70 students that started the program only 20 made it to senior year. They don't care about the students and don't provide enough resources for students to succeed in their classes. Their NCLEX passing rate is misleading, not everyone's allow to take it."
Senior,1,"I am a current senior in the Part-Time Evening Weekend BSN program Class of 2017.  Started with a group of 56 out of 60 seats.  Final semester only 14 out of 32 students moving on to practicuum at the end of senior year.  30 out of 32 students had to repeat skills-taping this semester.  Cedar Crest's 96% NCLEX pass rate is MISLEADING.  The NCLEX pass rate only factors in approximately 25% of students who originally entered the BSN program and make it to the end. Cedar Crest's retention rate for the BSN program is abysmal.  50% students make it to senior year, 25% make it to graduation.   I have never been through something so hard in my life and this is my 2nd degree.  Look elsewhere for a BSN.  Cedar Crest College is not the hardest nursing program to get into but now I can clearly see why!!!  They only care about the numbers, not helping students.  You will get no help from your instructor, advisor, department chairman or provost."
Senior,1,"If you are thinking about the nursing program, RUN! It will tear you down and distroy you! Many people do not make it through the program and they are out all the money they put in. The compassion from the program head is lacking as well. Do yourself a favor and go to dsales"
College Sophomore,1,"My overall experience with Cedar Crest College was not a great one.  Although I feel that I have learned a lot from the professors that I have had, I was dissatisfied with almost every other aspect of the school.  The food was horrible.  Most of the buildings, classrooms, and dorms were very old.  It was  a suitcase college, so everyone packed up and left on the weekends, leaving it a ghost town for the resident students.  If you didn't have a car on campus you were stranded there with nothing to do every single weekend.  It was an all-girls school which was super weird, and most of the people that went there were either super weird or super fake.  I was a member of one of the sports teams - not naming the sport - and I hated it.  All of my teammates were super cliquey and annoying.  They would constantly backstab and talk sh** on each other.  It was like they were there just to start drama between team members.  Long story short that made it a long season.  It also seems like the athletics department as a whole did not have a very stable base of coaches.  Coaches were in and out of there all of the time.  I was only there for three semesters and I had three different head coaches and three different assistant coaches.  Also while I was there they hired a new AD, a new swim coach, a new field hockey coach, and a new lacrosse coach.  It was crazy.  And to top it all off none of our teams were very good, as our school rarely won any games; I think only one team went into the post season.  But moving on from athletics, some of the office staff were not helpful in any way, shape, or form.  When I first considered transferring out of this institution I e-mailed multiple people in the financial aid department with questions regarding loans, etc.  I never received a response from any of them.  Like I said before, I didn't really have a good experience here.  If I could do it all over I definitely would not have chose to go to this institution."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no parties on campus, since it is all dorms and has a small populaion"
College Sophomore,1,no social life outside of studying
College Sophomore,1,They didnt offer enough scholarships for transfer students
College Freshman,1,my family farm in the middle of nowhere is more exciting then this school
College Freshman,1,sometimes it is good.  But on weekends they forget people live here and eat the food.  Pretty much every thing is very greasy and  not very healthy.  Next to 0 vegetarian  options
College Freshman,1,All of housing is on campus because 70% of students commute.
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties at Cedar Crest, ever. Everyone pretty much goes to other colleges."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not much of a party girl, but if I were, I'd be greatly disappointed."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek anything. We are an all-girls college with no sororities.
College Freshman,1,its the worst because I have not had any
College Freshman,1,its horrible I have no favorite experiences nothing makes this school unique and its boring no social life
College Freshman,1,"no help with my major I feel as if they don't care about my major, very poor quality to help only one tutor for my major how horrible is that"
College Freshman,1,food has bad quality not always good put mushrooms in everything horrible have to do better
College Freshman,1,long story short its horrible especially a math teacher very biased
College Freshman,1,its the worst because there is none
College Freshman,1,nothing around accept for restaurants
College Freshman,1,"very boring, dorms are old can hear everything people say walls have to be very cheap"
College Freshman,1,"no guys, very boring no social life at all, need to do better teachers need to stop being biased"
College Sophomore,1,no Greeks live on campus
College Sophomore,1,If you already have a degree forget it even if you don;t have a job.  if your program is part time you are out of luck no help work study or aid for you.
College Freshman,1,"At first the food was great, but it gets tired very quick. It's all of the same food every single day. There is a dining hall which is buffet style, but they mostly serve past, meat and cheese all in one which is disgusting. The Falcon's nest is more of a grill and deli style. Everything here is the same everyday and way overpriced. Flex goes by pretty fast since we only get $50"
College Freshman,1,"This is an all girls school. There are no guys, except for nursing commuters or adults. There are a lot of lesbians and unusual students here."
College Freshman,1,"We don't really put much emphasis on athletics or sports here, mostly because we are a D3 school"
College Freshman,1,"This school have very little knowledge about conflicts and how to handle them. The school is very dull with no social events outside of the campus. The staff is very unhelpful and seem like they don't know anything. And there are little Mickey Mouses running around the dinning areas. There are ghosts in a specific dorm that messes with your life, and i wish i rethought the school."
College Freshman,1,There is very few social things going on here. Its a beautiful campus but ver dull
College Freshman,1,I attend an all women's college so there are absolutely no boys. The grade I put is based on personality and the way the girls dress here at Cedar Crest. Everyone is very dull there is not much personality to go around except a select few like myself and a couple other. :( I started to question my decision in coming the first 2 weeks
College Senior,1,"Parking can be horrible, especially if your a commuter like i am. I get there early just so i can make sure im close to the building i need to be at. I've noticed it doesn't matter what year your in parking is horrible regardless especially if you commute its the worst."
College Senior,1,"Printers Are a Nightmare – There are several computer labs in the school and most of the time they work, however some times the computers freeze or they are missing certain programs needed or wont even open them. I think the worst is how the printers charge you but never print. I bought my own printer for that reason. I could not stand that."
College Sophomore,1,"The teachers do not teach they just read off a slideshow or hand out papers, it is not helpful to students at all. the work load is ridiculous, they make you write papers after papers, and not short ones."
College Sophomore,1,"TOO MANY GIRLS – I do not live on campus, nor would i want to, too many girls all squished together. An extra ten grand to live on campus in a small room, bathrooms are not even located in half the rooms."
College Freshman,1,"We're in Collge, Aren't We? I do not like being on a campus that campus security watch our every move.  I understand that they are looking out for our safety, but sometimes Cedar Crest is over the top.  We're in college and finally away from our parents, we do not want to be watched by our campus police and professors during our every move.  Let us make a mistake and learn!"
College Senior,1,"To my knowledge, there is no assistance. The school makes more money if we're here so they ""encourage"" us to stay on campus. I've never heard of any info sessions being offered on any off campus housing information."
College Freshman,1,"There is not alot of involment in sports on behalf of the campus students(attending games, supporting them through and with fundraisers. Most of our teams are having promblems recruiting team members, even the Immaturals. I think it has to do with all the beef that sports teams are bound to have and also that this is an all womens' college. When guys are around it seems that it is only natural for us to become the competive people that many guys like. I personally enjoy sports and their intensity and the sacrifice really dedicate players bring to the games."
College Sophomore,1,"I Swear There's More Cars on Campus Than Students – It's true; there are probably more cars on this campus than students.  Commuters park wherever they want even though they have allotted parking.  Freshmen can have cars on campus....if they can find a place in a little lot on the edge of campus to park them.  No one gets ticketed unless they park on the lawn.  It can take me twenty minutes to find a parking spot after I make a run to the grocery store after my classes are over.  Not to mention Cedar Crest students can't park or drive, so many times they take up two parking spots and are too lazy to straighten out.  A word of advice?  Get really great insurance before driving anywhere near this campus."

Senior,5,The University of Rio Grande is a great college. It is like a home away from home. All the staff members are beyond helpful and supporting.
Freshman,5,I really liked the rural setting and the professors care about every student. The faculty is very friendly and I’m really glad I chose Rio.
Senior,5,"I love the university of Rio Grande ! From the amazing professors provided, to the history that surrounds the campus. I’m currently a student at the university and it has been the best decision I have ever made ! Thank you for everything Rio Grande ! Much love !!!"
Freshman,5,I liked the beauty of the campus. I liked that it isn’t so big that you get lost easily. The athletics there are great. The dorms are clean.
Freshman,5,I like that the Professors will help you if you are having problems and they are more laid back and joke around with the students. The dorm rooms are very nice and neat. I would recommend coming to Rio.
Freshman,5,I love rio it’s an amazing place just sucks I have to quit attending after this semester because of me oweing them money it’s a great college and I felt like I learned everything I needed to and more
Freshman,5,"Rio grande has many places to hang out with friends when you are not in class, and a friendly environment!"
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my time at The University of Riogrande the people are nice and the professors are always around to help you academically and help with scheduling. If you have any problems with academics the people around you and tutoring centers help greatly.
College Freshman,5,"Crimes will happen anywhere you go, we have a few here and there but our Campus Police are on top of everything and always there for you when you need them!"
College Freshman,5,"I have the best classes, great friends, and a love for the college."
College Freshman,5,"You get a lot of hands on and on the site learning experiences, which get you a foot in the door way when you apply for jobs."
College Freshman,5,"Our athletes are very hardworking and put in the time and effort. The teams, coaches, and facilities are well maintained and bring in very nice crowds."
College Freshman,5,My school is small but it is great! Easy to get in contact with professors and easy to meet people. This school is the perfect school for me.
College Freshman,5,The academics offered at my school is the best. There is a wide range of classes and courses to choose from so you don't have to miss out in any class if a class or course isn't opened up at the time you want.
College Student,5,I feel very protected when I walk around campus. I always see a campus police officer. I feel like if I had an emergency I could easily find or contact campus police and I feel like that would be there immediately.
College Senior,5,Joining my sorority was an awesome decision.  These girls are my sisters and we are extremely close.  Greek life was starting to down slope but we are definitely picking it back up
College Senior,5,Never find friendlier or nicer people
College Senior,5,I love small town America. I was raised in a small town and I will always live in a small town. I am not a social butterfly so I am fine with the way it is here. No hustle and bustle is perfectly fine for me.
College Sophomore,5,Rio has amazing career choices. I like their education degree because thati what I want for my future career. They off home health and engineering too.
College Junior,5,"The weather situation is not that awful. When it snows we may have a delay, but normally classes are not canceled. For the summer heat we have air conditioning in the buildings an rooms. When it rains we have some road detours due to minor flooding. Other than that our weather is not that bad."
Senior,4,It took a lot of getting use to the online classes. It was also difficult for being such a rural area getting access to the internet to finish requirements
Senior,4,"As long as you are able to email the school with questions they get back quickly. Always check with your advisor before doing classes, paying bills and school ranking. Professors are very easy to talk to and get along with. The University of Rio Grande does not have many organizations on campus for students to be apart of and it would be super nice and helpful when looking for jobs to have that experience."
Freshman,4,I like how all of the professors and staff go above and beyond to assist you in anything you may need.
Sophomore,4,I do like the University I just wish the housing was better and that the advisors were a bit more helpful for students to pay for their tuition.
Freshman,4,"At Rio Grande, the majority of professors are very good at their job and are always willing to help when needed. When scheduling classes, student advisors are great with scheduling around your athletic schedule or work schedule. The environment on campus is a very friendly one and easy to make new friends. If you are looking for a good education from a smaller school, take a look at Rio Grande."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere on campus. Rio is a small campus and has a low teacher/ student ratio. I love that most of the teachers know my name.
Sophomore,4,The staff are nice and easy to get along with.Most professors are understanding and willing to help. The thing I would want to change would be more choices of classes they offer and better prices.
Freshman,4,Its a overall good school there are times where its boring that's why most students go home for weekend the professor are well other not so well. we are a dry campus so all that extra stuff is cut out no parties no drugs or alcohol. rio is great school but it has it times were people will leave and transfer because it doesn't really life up
Alum,4,Great small rural University. Not much on campus or surrounding town but athletics occupied most of my time so it was manageable
Senior,4,"The University of Rio Grande is a community college for a student who is attending for an associates degree. It is a community college the first two years, then a private college for someone who is getting a bachelors degree or higher. This school is a small town school surrounded by farms and beautiful nature. It is a very easy-going school that is very laid back. It is know for its wonderful teaching program. Overall, this school is a good school to attend. The downfall is that when you attend the private university the semester rates increase tremendously, however plenty of scholarships will help save you money."
College Sophomore,4,It is great because you get to study when ever you want when you actually want to.
College Sophomore,4,I know of many people that are involved in  this and are having some great college experience. I am really thinking about joining.
College Sophomore,4,I've never been to a game but I know they go all out.
College Student,4,Campus security is pretty well I don't see many guards but when I do they are working.
College Freshman,4,I love where I live and that all the other dorms are close to go to for studying or just to hang out with friends!
College Freshman,4,We have very nice Greek life and they always are hosting activities or anyone to join in on.
College Freshman,4,The campus is widely diverse in many things.
College Freshman,4,"The safety on campus is pretty great. everything is within reach if you need to go to the dorms and or to class. Only reason why I didn't rate it higher is because I live outside of campus, within walking distance. So as for me it's a bit dangerous to cross the streets alone, late at night. luckily, if you do ever feel you are in danger, there are campus police poles that yiou can use to call for help."
College Freshman,4,"The professors in my courses are pretty understanding. They help you if the help is needed, and even if it's not needed, they will ask if you need any help."
College Freshman,4,"I believe it's great. I haven't seen them for myself, but judging from what I heard from my friend who is an athletic player, they work really hard to achieve their goal."
College Junior,4,I chose this school because it was close to home. The Education Dept. is helpful and the professors prepare you for when you are placed into the schools. They make sure that you know what you're doing and feel comfortable.
College Junior,4,My school is unique because it has many events and activities for students to take part in during their free time. Sometimes there are days when I have nothing to do and if I just go to campus I can find something to do.
College Student,4,"I really like my school because of the friendly environment. The teachers there are fair, and a lot of them make us go out and do community service. This benifits both the University and the students. I would choose my school if i could do all over again because it is affordable and has a great environment. The University is always doing events for the students to have fun at, or events that give us information. I also got the help I needed in my classes and there is always a place to go to for tutoring"
College Student,4,I believe that safety and security is very important to our campus. I do feel safe on campus but there has been some incidents where I felt in trouble.
College Student,4,My dormitory is actually very spacious considering the size of our campus. The rooms a very nice compared to the other universities out there. The only thing I think really needs work on would be the bathroom. There is actually visual mold on the corners of the stalls for the shower. It's actually very gross but I still take a shower because I am forced to take one here. Besides that it is very nice compared to others.
College Senior,4,Living on Rio's campus was one of the best decisions I made.  I met a lot more people this way and enjoyed my overall experience more.
College Junior,4,"I don't consider alcohol a drug, but there is hardly any other activity except for some occasional activity."
College Junior,4,Plenty of updated nice computers.  Very rarely are all of the computers in one location taken.
College Junior,4,You can walk down the side walk and know everyone you passed.  Everyone is friendly and nice.
College Junior,4,They get you out in the field your first year to get your feet wet and out in the classrooms.
College Junior,4,"Our school wins some and loses some, but are always doing their best.  The students do their best to support our athletes and sports teams.  Organizations try and help support by having events at half time and give aways."
College Junior,4,I mean we do have a lot of athletes on campus but it doesnt run how we are.
College Junior,4,I mean the crime rate is pretty low around here. I do hate tho that they dont bust up parties that are just off campus. But they are very helpful.
College Junior,4,Well all of our parking is on campus so theres no need to park anywhere off campus. A parking pass for a semester is around $150.00 so its not that bad. There are multiple parking lots and usually its pretty easy to park some where or find open spots.
College Junior,4,Well it is the only college that is both a community college and a University in one. Its small so you know most everyone and people get along fairly well. There's lots of diversity student wise. Also you know most of the staff and they are very nice people. While yes it is in the middle of no where and there really isnt much to do there its still a good place to be.
College Junior,4,the only bad thing is that its very small in size so things arent always open and you are limited as to what you can do over the weekends
College Senior,4,I don't have the opportunity ot have internships in my field of study. We live in a rural area where there not much progress or places where a history major can go. 
College Sophomore,4,"I would say that the weather isn't bad at all really. When it rains alot, you just get alittle wet"
College Sophomore,4,"I don't play sports at school, so I'm not sure how they are. I have herd that the sports are pretty good."
College Sophomore,4,The Rio branch I attend does not have off campus housing. However the off housing at the main branch is great. The main campus is in the back yard.
College Junior,4,"It is very secure. They have a program for people to sign up for allowing us to receive a text message or email letting us know if something is stolen, if a amber alert is out, if a bad person is on campus, an weather warnings. It is a very good campus they also teach us how to protect ourselves if a gunman would take over."
College Sophomore,4,The great thing is that the first two years have only Community college tuition which is a faction of University tuition. But the last two years the tuition cost does make a big leap.
College Senior,4,there are two convenient places in which to use on-site computers and printers and the staff are always ready and willing to help. They are also making sure that the entire college is wireless accessable.
College Senior,4,"The students at Rio seem to be typically dressed and good-looking for children that age. Social relationships seem to vary by groups and interests. from Pajamas to very well dressed, anyone can fit in at anytime."
College Sophomore,4,I have only been in the Ultrasound Tech program about a month and so far I am very pleased with the way things are going. I am learning so much already.
College Sophomore,4,The process of getting into the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program was average. Once you were accepted into the college you then have to fill out am application for the program its self. After the advisors have time to review all the applications submitted they call you back for an interview if you amoung the choosen ones. After that its all about waiting for the letter to come in the mail.
College Senior,4,I chose Rio Grande because it is small and personal and well known for their excellent education program.
College Senior,4,"My area is special education.  The instructors are wonderful - very knowledgeable and caring.  They are concerned with providing students with the curriculum and in-class experience that will prepare them for success in their own classroom.  The classes are small and personal.  Students are encouraged to collaborate and work together, which is an essential part of teaching."
College Junior,4,"Everything has flaws.  The campus is beautiful, security watches out for the students and they do the best they can, lawn work and landscaping is maintained."
College Student,4,They have computer at Rio but a first it was hard to get on them if you don't know how. They do help you a lot
College Student,4,Everyone in Rio are very nice. A lot of people go to the sporting events.
College Junior,4,The workload is sometimes overwhelming but I can always get everything done before it is due. The program I am trying to get into is very challenging because they only choose 20 students.
College Junior,4,"The athletics are okay, nothing is known at Rio Grande.  Our soccer team did very well this past year.  We have great training facilities and workout rooms."
College Junior,4,"I came to the University of Rio Grande because they offer Sonography, which is a dream that I have always wanted to fulfill.  The campus is small, which is a positive for me. The professors and students are helpful and friendly."
College Student,4,"comutting is probally the best thing to do if you choose Rio Grande. you have all day to use the computure lab, you can print off any papers you may have while your there. a commuter has access to everything a resident has they just dont live there."
College Junior,4,Rio Grandes athletic sports give the school a positive look. The schools sports teams are continuously go have victories and end up in the play offs for state chanpionships and even nationals. The only down fall is the limit of the number of sports options
College Junior,4,"Greek life is on campus to help with school events, fundraisers and community service projects. Rio Grande is a small school with a small Greek life, however they have a big heart"
College Junior,4,"Here for You – From day one in every class, you are provided with an email address and phone number for professors. The make sure that they are there to ensure our success. And myself being a non-traditional student of 40 years old, that makes a huge difference in confidence levels. Class sizes are smaller, so professors have to time and make the time to answer questions. Which is wonderful."
College Junior,4,"There for You – In the Social Work program you can always count on the professors to answer questions with knowledgable answers. They are understanding to lifes challenges. Require 100% to ensure that we are prepared to do our job to the best of our ability. I was told once (not word for word) I care about you and how you do but I care more for the people who are eithor disadvantaged, or in need of help more. They need you to know what your doing, and thats why I am here. Its as plane as the nose on your face that they want a respectable social worker to complete the program."
College Freshman,4,"Dorm Life – Dorm life is a crazy, fun experience that offers the chance to make life long friends."
College Student,2,There are parties almost every night and they usually get out of hand. There is a lot of underage drinking that takes place.
College Sophomore,2,"Once a semester a club in Point Pleasant, WV allows Rio students to come and acts as a night club. Other than that, the closest night clubs are in Athens."
College Junior,2,"You have your car, friends car, or occasional University transportation."
College Junior,2,"I received some financial aid but it wasnt enough to cover my expenses. I've have to purchase many tools and lumber along with my tuition bill just so i can go to college. This semester alone I had purchased over $500.00 of lumber, $400.00+ in hand tools, and over $100.00 worth of finishing supplies easily. And paying for all of this out of pocket really doesnt help. I on aver age only receive about $2000.00 worth of student loans each semester and i have to pay  another $6000.00+ along with the numbers stated above. Also not having a job doesnt help either. And I was denied a campus job to help pay off some of my tuition."
College Junior,2,We are home to the RIO RUN AROUND! they sent you in circles from one building to another without ever really giving you any answers. This was not my first college so I know the difference between what it should be and how Rio treated it.
College Junior,2,There really aren't many options. There are a few apartment complexes within a few miles but they are typically full and are not student housing. They also aren't the safest and I've heard there's a lot of drug problems.
College Freshman,2,Punishments Are Kind of Severe – The police in force the rules and the punishments make you never want to brake a rule again.
College Sophomore,2,"Dont Bother Unless Youre Off Campus! Head out of town to party or the cops will get you! The campus is dry, but its still possible to have a little fun, just dont invite drunkin' Bob or he will get you all in trouble."
College Sophomore,2,There are only two close options. The first is McDonalds. There isnt a person in America who doesn't know McDonalds and the other is subway. Both establishments offer affordable options as well as healthy alternatives.
College Sophomore,1,"The off-campus dining is terrible. The only restaurants are Bob Evans, Subway, and McDonalds. These three options get old very quickly."
College Student,1,"nightlife at rio grande, would be like rain during a drought, there is no night life other then the everynight drama of the bored residents."
College Senior,1,"Process Was Rocky – Every semester I have to walk in ready to bite someones head off. it always turns out, but you have to stick up for yourself."
College Freshman,1,F Ans S – THe greek population is alot smaller than otheer campuses and is harder for them to live the life of a frat brothere or sa soriety siter because of te dry campus. i am an tathlete and not aloud to be in one thats just as i here
College Freshman,1,THe campus needs more to do for the students there is nothing around. THe sports facilitys could be nicer but they are not to bad. all around the school needs more activites and stores for the students. and the food is horrible
College Sophomore,1,"Were in the Boondocks – There are not that many convienient places to walk to while on campus. There is a McDonalds, subway, a pizza shop, and a gas station. For anything else your have to drive about 30 min and there is no bus lines"

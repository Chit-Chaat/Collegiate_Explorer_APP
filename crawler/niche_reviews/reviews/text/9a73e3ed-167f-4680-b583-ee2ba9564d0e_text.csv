Freshman,5,Great campus overall! It’s small so it makes it easier to get the extra help you might need. It also gives you the opportunity to get to know your professors on a deeper level. They are always willing to help you! It’s also a beautiful small campus.
Freshman,5,"The community at Penn State Shenango is small, which allows me more time to communicate directly with my professors and get to know as many students personally as I can. It's a very warm and welcoming environment to be in."
College Junior,5,I haven't had a professor I didn't like and haven't had a course I didn't feel was useful. Class size is small and makes for a great learning environment.
College Junior,5,"I was very surprised when I was able to transfer classes that I took several years ago and that they would apply to my current degree program. I still had to add several classes to meet financial aid requirements, but I had enjoyed all of them thus far. The academic advisors are polite and knowledgeable when it comes to getting a first time student or an adult learner on the right track."
College Sophomore,5,"Plenty of computers to use. There are currently two computer labs, and computers in the library to use. Wireless access is also great, fast speed."
College Sophomore,5,"I think the price is fair for the great education I'm getting. The financial process is pretty easy, and for those who have difficulty applying, there is staff on campus that can help you."
College Sophomore,5,The student body is the best! Everyone is friendly right of the bat. Since there aren't to many people you really get time to talk to everybody. There are people from every religion and even sexual orientation. I made two very good friends who are Muslim and it was great learning about their religion.
College Sophomore,5,"The computer labs are great. They are always open and are usually relatively quiet, its a great place to get some work done. The IT department is fantastic they can fix a problem as soon as you encounter it."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a place on campus for everything. If you need food, academic help, or even help in your everyday life there is always at least one person on campus that can help you."
College Sophomore,5,The teachers all give you a syllabus the first day of class and are constantly reminding you when deadlines are approaching. If you ever have a problem the teachers are more than happy to help you work it out.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is a great place to me. There is a on site police force to help you if anything bad were to ever happen. The student center is fantastic there are always people there that are willing to help you!
College Junior,5,"Everything is ""right there"". Library, main classrooms, student eating, fitness and learning center all with 35 feet of the parking lot. Which also increases safety."
College Junior,5,"I love the students here at Penn Shenango.  There are many students that have many different roles in their life, such as parenting and full-time jobs.  There are also many students like me, fresh out of High School."
College Junior,5,Very Convienient – Close to home and easy to handle. Wonderful for both adult students and traditional students.
College Senior,5,Very Diverse Group – Very diverse in age groups. Mainly non-traditional student body.
College Senior,5,Excellent Schooling Staff – Every staff member is highly involved and trained well to educate.
Sophomore,4,"Penn state Shenango is a pretty good campus for how small it is. It is easy to make friends and most of the teachers are pretty friendly and helpful! If you don’t like a huge campus, then Penn State Shenango is the one for you. It’s easy to get from class to class, and there’s not to many people. The only thing that isn’t great is the choice of minors and majors, there isn’t a whole lot to choose from."
College Junior,4,I really enjoy my time at Penn State Shenango.  The teachers are very willing to help.  The other students are friendly and motivated.
College Junior,4,There are quite a few night classes and also most professors are understanding if you have other things going on in your life such as young kids or a job.
College Junior,4,"Some of the student activities are enjoyable. Have made great friends and gotten to know professors. If Youngstown State University had my major I might have chosen to go there because the campus is a lot nicer and more modern. However, I do not regret my choice to come to Penn State Shenango."
College Junior,4,"My major, occupational therapist assistant, has a high job outlook so I am hopeful that I will get a degree right after graduating."
College Junior,4,"So far my major has peaked my interest, however I would like to get more hands on experience rather than lecturing. Our OT building has just been finished but the bathrooms have backed up and many of the other buildings are in poor shape. I like the professors at Penn State Shenango. They are all willing to help and friendly."
College Junior,4,"Being a branch campus, you have the opportunity to mingle and meet with peopeople you don't always have a chance to meet and get to understand a little bit about their backgrounds and some of their life experiences. In fact, one of the nicest people I have met in my time here is a pastor's wife. Another gentleman who has practically become my best friend, participates in local theater and works a midnight shift at a local factory."
College Junior,4,I am a workout fanatic so the fitness center on campus is VERY helpful in unloading some post test stress. The library is comfortable and peaceful.
College Junior,4,"I have not been able to participate much in job/internships due to being a working adult learner. However, I can say that there is always some type of job shadowing or postings for internships and the staff is always willing and ready to help a student to look for a place to perform their job shadowing. Another thing about my school is the recognition. Once a person mentions the name, instantly employers think high quality education."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my major. The professors in my program are awesome, and I have so much fun. The workload is pretty good, and I enjoy the curriculum. There are a good amount of internships available in the community for my major as well."
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had any issues with any of my classes or professors. Classes are easy to register. Study options are available.
College Sophomore,4,"I work a lot, but I was still able to schedule classes around my jobs. If I couldn't find a class on campus, I just added an online class. Simple."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not used the career center so much, but I hear it's great."
College Sophomore,4,The workload is a little heavier. But online classes are always described and guided in great detail.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus life is pretty enjoyable. All students commute, but there is a sense of togetherness. There are many opportunities for all students."
College Sophomore,4,I've enjoyed spending three years at Shenango campus so far. Every class that I have taken has been extremely enjoyable and I have taken a lot from all of my classes.
College Junior,4,"I have no complaints about Shenangos resources.  For a small school they offer so much,  I spent my first semester in three places, the classroom, the library, and the gym. All of their facilities are up to date and ready for use by any student.  I love the library because of all the things they offer besides just books.  I got so much work done in there, it was a perfect study place."
College Junior,4,"Though Shenango is a small school and the academics don't range super wide, I believe there is a whole lot to learn here.  It was so easy for me to start at Penn State and there was always an adviser helping me the entire way.  From scheduling my classes and figuring out what would be best for me, Penn State made it easy to attend classes here.  I am so thankful for the professors here as well because they are so hands on and so well informed that I feel as if i'm gaining so much knowledge from them."
College Junior,4,"I can honestly say I think Penn State Shenango might be the most diverse school around.  We have individuals of all ethnicity's, from all around the world and it's awesome to say we can all come together with no problem.  From sitting in the cafeteria listening to today's local comedian, or musician, it doesn't matter, the people here make it so everyone is welcomed and treated with respect."
College Junior,4,"Deciding to be a business major came easy to me, and once i started at Penn State I was sure about it. All my classes have to deal with my major and my professors always are interested in the students and the subject which makes me more interested in it as well. Even though I am at a small school,  Shenango still has so much to offer, from their awesome library and media room, to the gym that is so handily next to the cafeteria."
College Junior,2,The tuition is not that much compared to other schools. However this campus is super small and the buildings are falling apart which is disappointing when tuition still costs a decent amount and I could go to a much nicer campus with more majors for only a slightly higher tuition. The financial aid office often seems like they are too busy to answer any questions and could be a bit more friendly.

Senior,5,The best and most quality that you can receive from higher education in the area. I feel that the university is a fit for everyone.
Senior,5,I feel that this has been a great way for me to get a 4-year degree while working full time each and every day of the workweek.
Graduate Student,5,"The instructors are there to ensure that you are having a quality experience. It appears that they are truly there for students to learn and then after they can assure that has happened, they assign a grade. It is a trend in other educational platforms that a grade is the only indicator of learning, however at Viterbo that is not the case. You can walk away with intangible learning that will last past the test."
Freshman,5,I like how Viterbo University has a wonderful community within the university. This university makes me feel like I am at home because everyone is welcoming. I like living on campus because Viterbo offers excellent services to those who are off or on campus. I would not change a thing at Viterbo University.
Alum,5,"Honestly could not recommend Viterbo more highly -- an extremely rigorous program in a small artistic town. The professors care a lot and will push you when you need it, and also encourage you to take care of your mental health and general wellness. I emerged from this school with a degree and skillset, but also a developed sense of how to care for myself and others through stressful circumstances."
Niche User,5,I love the environment Viterbo has to offer very small and friendly! You really feel at home and make a lot of friends. There is always so much to do!
Sophomore,5,I love this University as it is a small private school. Class size are small which makes learning easy. I have advisers that keep track of me and on top of everything I need to do to be successful. I also play baseball at the University and that has been a great experience. Coaches make sure academics come before sports which is great as well. Overall the staff and coaches are looking out for you and want you to succeed in every aspect of your life.
Alum,5,"If you are looking to major in Nursing, Dietetics or theatre this is the place for you. Anything else, go to a different school."
Sophomore,5,I like Viterbo University because they are very welcoming of all people and are very caring. Viterbo University also has very energetic professors who care about your learning.
Junior,5,Viterbo is a school founded on Franciscan values. This is a place that opens up your mind and the small classroom sizes means your professors know your name and are always looking for new opportunities for you.
Alum,5,"Viterbo University's greatest assets are the people - students, professors, staff, alumni. The people who leave Viterbo are fantastic people looking to make a difference in the world no matter how big or small. The campus is small, but absolutely beautiful. It is a place an incoming freshman will quickly call ""home."""
Niche User,5,"always available to answer questions, staff and students on campus kind and helpful, had a great campus visit experience"
Alum,5,"Coming from a small high school in a little rural town, Viterbo was the perfect fit. I knew my professors personally, whether they were in the nursing program or not. The professors cared about my learning and were accommodating to unexpected life events. The coursework was rigorous but prepared me to be an excellent, compassionate nurse. I met amazing friends and was able to be very active in a variety of clubs on campus. Doing my nursing synthesis in Alaska was the icing on the cake!"
Alum,5,"I attended Viterbo from 2008-2013. Viterbo opened the door to many fantastic opportunities in and out of the classroom. My academic program was challenging, but fair. I was a student athlete and got involved in a few clubs and committees across campus. Viterbo is a beautiful campus and you don't have to look far to find something to do in La Crosse."
Alum,5,"I really value my Viterbo experience.  Small class sizes, rigorous, and  variety of clinical nursing experiences prepared me to become a competent nurse."
Sophomore,5,"I love how welcoming Viterbo University is! You can sense the hospitality when you are on campus, and everyone here wants you to succeed. It is a small and home-like feel that makes everyone feel welcome."
Freshman,5,Viterbo is an amazing campus. All of the people are amazing and supportive of ones goals. I t is a great environment to further your education.
Junior,5,Viterbo is in a community that values service and morals. Viterbo doesn't allow you to feel alone. The support given through Viterbo is outstanding.
Freshman,5,I was able to connect with many students that had similar interests and backgrounds as I do. The faculty pushes you to be the best you can be and genuinely cares for you.
Freshman,5,"Viterbo University is a great college. It's a smaller campus and that is just one of the reasons why I chose to come here. From the first day I toured the campus, I felt like everyone was welcoming me into their ""school"" home. I have made many friends and I like all my teachers so far. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me for the next several years."
Sophomore,5,"I am a Social Work major at Viterbo. They are the most amazing four year school a single mother/worker could ever ask for. They provide the flexibility for people to go to school in person or online. They also provide amazing academic advisors that a person could ask for as well. My academic advisor has hugged me, consoled me and also has been there for me every step of the way during my college career are Viterbo."
Alum,5,"I LOVED Viterbo! My high school didn't help prepare me for college one bit, but Viterbo professors were always willing to meet with me and assist me. The professors at Viterbo all seem to genuinely care about their students' success."
Freshman,5,"Viterbo University is home to me. On campus everyone is so welcoming and kind, and people go out of their way to say ""hello"" to you. The professors work hard to make sure that you pass your classes, and if you're struggling they help you and give you tips on how you can better succeed. There are so many opportunities available on campus between volunteering and having the chance to study abroad."
Sophomore,5,I love that Viterbo University is small. All of my professors know me on a personal level and I can feel comfortable going to them about any problem that I may have--inside or outside of the classroom.
Junior,5,As a student at Viterbo University I can honestly say that I feel like a person who matters and not just a number.  Viterbo staff and educators truly care about all students and their success!
College Junior,5,Viterbo has links with all of the nearby hospitals.  They do clinicals there.  They are also one of the most well known nursing programs in the state and have a large network.
College Junior,5,I am happy that this is the school I am transferring to.  So far I am very impressed with the facilities and their general helpful attitude.  Throughout the admission process and registration process I have been recognized as an individual.  It's all very refreshing.
College Freshman,5,"While I have not started yet, my experience thus far has been absolutely amazing. The teachers are increadable, at least those I have met. Every person is inviting and sweet in everyway. They act as though they have known you your entire life and genuinly care about your future. Viterbo University is an amazing school with an exceptional support system."
College Freshman,5,The teaching styles suit the types of courses being taught and the professors are very knowledgeable.
College Freshman,5,"Despite the price, I really enjoy my school and the courses I am taking. All the professors and other advisers are readily available and willing to help."
College Freshman,5,"I do believe that Viterbo has a wonderful education program. They offer a wide variety of majors and minors. The professional staff does a wonderful job and building relations with their students. The warming sense of family radiates from people on campus. Registration was easy and I had my advisor there to help with any questions I had. The workload has been strenuous but it's because I'm a science major and managed to get half way finished so far. The Academic Resource Center does wonderful things by providing tutors, group study sessions, and writing specialists. Viterbo University is truly an academic institution."
College Sophomore,5,This school is extremely safe. I have never heard of a sexual assault case even happening. Everyone looks out for everyone around here.
College Sophomore,5,They have plenty of internships available for you from around the country. A lot of these professors have connections with plenty f people from around the area and are eager to get students out there.
College Sophomore,5,"All the professors are great and they love teaching. That's the great thing about Viterbo, that even the professors make an effort to get to know you. The class sizes are small and make it possible for conversations other your professor."
College Sophomore,5,I like my school in the fact that everyone I have met here is extremely friendly. What I don't like is the lack of athletics and lack of equipment for athletes. I also am not fond of the cafeterias lack of choices when it comes to food. Not enough healthy options that could actually sustain you apart from salad and sandwiches you make
College Sophomore,5,"My school is unique in that it is truly a home away from home.  One of the core values is hospitality and it can be felt everywhere on campus.  Everyone is friendly and there is a strong connection and community-based relationship present. Professors are kind and always willing to help students, whether it's homework or personal issues."
College Student,5,I really love the college choice to go to Viterbo University. It has been my dream school since I decided on what I wanted to be for the rest of my life.
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of places off campus to grab something to eat! If you want a nice sit down restaurant you can have it, otherwise there is always fast food available. It is great and able to fit any cravings I have!"
College Sophomore,5,FACULTY AND ADMIN VISIBLE IN COMMUNITY PRESS AND MEDIA HIGH ETHICAL LEVEL
College Sophomore,5,CLEAN PRETTY SAFE GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR HEALTH CARE JOBS I WANT 2 HOURS FROM MINNEAPOLIS  BEAUTIFUL SCENERY RIVER FRIENDLY PEOPLE
College Sophomore,5,HELPFUL AND EVERY STUDENT GETS SOME GRANT HELP BASED ON ACADEMIA IT SEEMS.  INCENTIVE TO HAVE INCREASED  AID IF GRADES GO UP
College Sophomore,5,HIGHLY REGARDED NURSING SCHOOL WITH HIGH JOB PLACEMENT AND LICENSING BOARD SCORES.
College Senior,5,"There are many attractions locally, beautiful scenery, fun things to do locally."
College Senior,5,I did not see or hear about drug use at the campus
College Student,5,"VERY FRIENDLY STAFF, HARDWORKING, EXTREMELY FAST FOOD OUT AFTER ORDERING, LOVEEEEE THE STAFF and the atmosphere. :)"
College Student,5,"I wouldn't mind staying here after graduating, since I have practically lived in the La Crosse my whole life. :) It'd be great to live somewhere else though."
College Freshman,5,AMAZING bluffs many local activities fun life
College Freshman,5,"professors personable, tutors great, classes good"
College Freshman,5,I love nursing rigorous but informative program
College Junior,5,I am lucky enough that I am from the area so living off campus is great for me since I dont have to pay any rent living with my parents!
College Sophomore,5,LaCrosse has lots to offer if you look for it. The bars are always open :)
College Freshman,5,"Fantastic program. The professors are all very kind and helpful with whatever you need. The workload is high, but you have to be dedicated to go into the performance field. there are many opportunities to travel abroad for a summer to learn more."
College Freshman,5,"The process of getting into the Nursing Program is very competitive. You must maintain good grades, which is enforced by requiring a C in all nursing related classes to be accepted into the program."
College Freshman,5,"I have not had an internship yet, but in the upcoming year, I am going to be participating in clinicals for nursing, which is similar to an internship."
College Junior,5,"La Crosse has beautiful weather. The summer and fall are absolutely gorgeous. The snow does tend to be a problem in the winter, but we're in Wisconsin so it's expected."
College Freshman,5,"Pass the Classes – Viterbo does not have a waiting list for Nursing students. Passing A&P with a C or better and passing Chemistry with a C or better and you are almost guarenteed in. However, they do only take around 80 students with the highest GPA's each year. So I suggest to everyone to study hard and pass the required classes with flying colors!"
College Freshman,5,"I believe that Viterbo University has an excellent program. It is gruling and the professors expect a lot from each student. However, this prepares each student for the real world. I do not believe that I will have any problems finding a job after graduating from Viterbo. They prepare us well and are concerned about our futures."
College Freshman,5,"One Place for Everything – Right off of campus is a small family restaurant called Houghton's. It's a small Irish based Pub and Restaurant. It's perfect for date nights, with the cosy atmosphere, a great place to bring parents, with quality food and choices, as well as a nice place to get to meet locals and hang out with friends, with the Irish music every Wednesday night."
College Freshman,5,It Is Awesome – i really enjoy going to viterbo. We have a good christian life and they hold their students to a higher standard than most universities.  We have social activities available to us. We are looking forward to the new dorms to open
College Junior,5,"General Campus Aesthetics – This is one of the most beautiful campuses in the area. During the winter months, there are Christmas lights lighting the main campus sidewalk, which is brick, in tall trees. Then during the spring, plants start to grow, flowers start to be planted, and the many trees around campus are in full bloom with pink and white flowers. Summer time is amazing because there are all different colors of flowers everywhere, everything is green, and all the grass is freshly mowed. Our groundskeepers are amazing because there is never any trash on the ground and they keep everything trimmed, weeded, and pruned. On some campuses, after a night of partying, there are little, in some cases not so little, piles of bile on the sidewalks. At Viterbo there are never any of these piles anywhere. The campus itself is on a closed off street, so there is never any traffic going through campus. The buildings are all well cared for and help bring the feeling of home, home to students."
Freshman,4,"I am a soccer player at Viterbo University and from what I've seen, everyone including myself loves it here. It is very welcoming for incoming freshman and gives many opportunities to expand your campus life and hang out with friends. The only complaint I have is that the dorms are very dry and I get sick constantly."
Sophomore,4,Viterbo University is school with amazing hospitality and want to see the best in their students. The staff is always wanting to help in area they can and are willing to go out of their way to do it. When you walk on the Viterbo University campus you will be guaranteed a smile.
Junior,4,"I enjoy going to Viterbo, I have always felt welcomed in every classroom or building. I enjoy having small classes and in some classes getting that one on one what is needed sometimes."
Alum,4,It was a lot of hard work. I learned a lot. I was prepared to be a good nurse. The education supported the work that I had to do everyday. Theory and clinical was relevant to real life workflow.
Sophomore,4,"Viterbo is a University that excels in providing a culture that allows students to  achieve his and her own academic success, while incorporating important Franciscan values in everything that they do."
Freshman,4,Viterbo is a very welcoming college. Everyone on campus is super welcoming and they all want to see you exceed.
Freshman,4,"I love Viterbo due to the positive atmosphere it has. It has great values and principles like service, hospitality, stewardship, integrity, and contemplation. The staff really do care about each individual student and they strive to make a positive difference in students' lives. Everyone is very friendly and accepting of everyone. It's also a safe environment. They have good security. The campus strongly encourages service Saturdays and other service-type mission work. It's a Catholic school and it really lives up to it's religious mission statement."
Graduate Student,4,"Viterbo is a great place to attend for graduate school. The classes are scheduled in a way that allows people to work full time and take classes. 

The one thing I would change would be making scholarships available for grad students."
Junior,4,"This is a great school, where it's like a family.   I did not want to get lost in a large university.  I did research and they have a excellent nursing program which was one of the reason I chose Viterbo."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the smaller campus. As a student, you seek a lot of help in various parts of your life. Here at Viterbo, I have people I can go to for almost anything. My professors really get to know me, which makes for great connections and opportunity! 
Even for a small campus, they work really hard to give you stuff to do on the weekends. I wouldn't say I get bored living here."
Junior,4,A good school with a strong history. This school was founded by a group of sisters that are still here. 
College Junior,4,We do not have the traditional large football team as our main sport.  Volleyball and basketball are more important.
College Freshman,4,"I have only visited, but when I did it was the safest of those I viewed. One has access to the city, but is still increadibly safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I have not began living there yet, but everything has gone smooth so far. I have single living, which I requested."
College Freshman,4,We do not have a Greek Life at Viterbo University.
College Freshman,4,"I am not involed with Varsity athletics, but I do hope to be involved with intermurals."
College Sophomore,4,"A degree from Viterbo University stands out in the work field. Since it is a private college, it is recognized by many companies and businesses as a great accomplishment for academics. I hope to work for the VA Medical Center one day. Viterbo is working with me to obtain an internship for my dream job as a psychologist for our veterans. My advisers are very helpful and provide the guidance I need to meet my educational requirements."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are challenging and effective when it comes to learning. The class sizes are small, which provides a more personal relationship and understanding between the professors and students. Viterbo University is a religious school, so some of the required classes relate to helping and serving others in our community. The courses I take are directly related to my field of study, which is psychology. My professors are very knowledgeable about the material they teach and work with students inside and outside of the classroom to help them succeed. My advisers are also very helpful and knowlegable about my field of study. They work with me and my schedule to ensure that I will be able to find a job in my career field after college."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a big part of life for students and staff at Viterbo University. The facilities are clean, welcoming, and very well maintained. A large portion of the Viterbo University students are involved in athletics, whether they are an athlete or non-athlete. The athletes are supported by their fellow students through their attendence at games and matches. Everyone is very encouraging and believes in eachother and the success of our school. Facilities, such as a workout center, are provided for both athletes and non-athletes. This is a great asset to the health of Viterbo University's students and staff."
College Sophomore,4,"Viterbo University is a small, private college with staff and students that are dedicated to education. The overall campus environment is very welcoming. My freshman year was difficult due to medical issues and surgery near the end of the school year. Even so, the staff and students encouraged me and helped me succeed. The smaller campus provides more time and a more personal relationship between the staff and students. Without the understanding and helpful staff at Viterbo University, my grades could have potentially suffered due to the time I missed because of surgery. I am very thankful for all of those who helped me and believed in me."
College Freshman,4,"Being a student athlete, I believe that athletics are an important part of the college experience. Many students at Viterbo are involved in athletics, and it allows them to succeed in all areas of life. Students who are not athletes are still supporters of the programs here, and there are always fans at the games."
College Freshman,4,"Viterbo University is a very student-friendly campus. The nursing program here is very comprehensive and well-known. There are great professors that work one-on-one with students in small classes. Besides academics, other students and staff work to ensure that every student feels welcome and accepted. Since Viterbo is such a small campus, everybody knows everybody, and it has a very home-like feeling. If I had to go through the college application process again, I would still choose Viterbo."
College Sophomore,4,"I plan on graduating early, in only 3 years, before going on to Marquette for dental school. Viterbo has been very willing to work with me on either doing research or internships to get into dental school. There is a whole office focused on internships and counseling, and there are lots of opportunities that talk about local jobs and places that are hiring Viterbo students. Overall, the school is great at working with students not only at Viterbo, but also after Viterbo."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Viterbo more every day. During the winter, it gets very cold, but with such a small campus the walks are not bad at all. I love having small classes and getting to know my professors. Being a Biology major, I got to know most of the teachers in the sciences by joining clubs and stuff. There are lots of opportunities to be social, but it takes effort to meet people right away. Some of my best friends were people I met during registration/orientation weekend!"
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, I love Viterbo! The only hard part is the cost, but there are a lot of scholarships and grants given that balances out the costs of a private school. The small classrooms are awesome, and I really know all of my professors. I love how things are done at Viterbo and I am glad I chose this school."
Recent Alumnus,4,I appreciate that Viterbo offers summer courses online. It makes it possible for educators like me to continue their education.
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe walking on campus at night.
College Sophomore,4,"Nursing is a major degree and 100% of grads have found jobs, so I am not worried.   They produce some of the most qualified nurses in the state."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm on the volleyball team and its hard sometime with the traveling, but the professors are willing to work with you it you ask."
College Sophomore,4,"I think that the students support the sports as much as they can, and when they do, it's a great atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,"It a small, private family like group, where the professors know you name and are willing to help you along the way."
College Freshman,4,Campus security is always on alert here and there are multiple options that are available to students at night or whenever in case of an emergency on campus. I feel very safe when I am walking alone and living here on campus.
College Freshman,4,I think Viterbo's success rate is very high for those in the dietetics field and nursing. We are able to intern while still at school and Viterbo assists in the process of ensuring a job once students graduate.
College Freshman,4,Nursing majors are almost always guaranteed a job straight out of college.
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy campus life. I hope its easy to switch roommates though, but otherwise I am pleased."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't been at a game yet, but it's because I haven't made it a priority. The athletic facility is a very nice building."
College Freshman,4,We have a program called safe walk where a campus security guard can escort you within a 2 mile radius of the school. It's really cool I think to have the accessibility to a program like this if you're not feeling to safe at night. La Crosse has a very small crime rate so I feel perfectly safe and sound. Although there have been thefts on campus no serious harm has come upon the student body recently.
College Freshman,4,"I genuinely felt that every professor I had the first semester of my freshman year have really been interested in me as a person and not just a student. I really had strong connections with many of professors this past semester. A few of them I would definitely go to for advice in the future. I feel that the quality of the courses was excellent. I learned so much from my professors, and they really seemed to be experts.  I haven't really explored too heavily the variety of courses because it is my first year, but looking at the catalog, there is a wide variety that's offered. Once again I do feel that the smaller class sizes build a better connection between student and professor as well."
College Freshman,4,"This school is very small, around 2,000 students. This small size has been a blessing and a curse. It has allowed me easy access to my professors and to the help that I needed when I needed it, but it has also limited my dreams that reach farther than their programs they have to offer. Although I have had a wonderful time at Viterbo, it just is not a college for a city girl. Through the campus ministries and religious leaders I have access to, I have discovered that Viterbo was just a stepping stone in my college experience. Viterbo has been a huge blessing to my financially and educationally, but my journey to pursue higher education will not end here."
College Freshman,4,"Everything about Viterbo is great, there are just money concerns and that religious courses are required that don't give it a 5/5 rating."
College Junior,4,"Viterbo is a great college, with great core values.  The school has a small and helpful environment which encourages students to succeed.  Being a working mother, I need a school that is going to be flexible with me, while I work full-time; Viterbo offers students the best of both worlds."
College Sophomore,4,i really like my school
College Sophomore,4,I love how Viterbo is a tight-knit community.
College Junior,4,I love it hear at viterbo. The small class sizes are very beneficial and let you get close with classmates and establish good relationships with professors.
College Freshman,4,I enjoyed living on campus close to my classes.
College Student,4,You meet many new people and can find new close friends. You see them at their worse so from there on it is easier to be friends with them.
College Student,4,Usually the best place to go is Half off Apps at Applebee's.
College Student,4,"For a first year it was great! You were able to meet many new people and do multiple activites within the University. On my floor I met many girls and boys. That floor became another home to me. The social atmosphere is different than high school. You are at that university because you want to be. Viterbo is a little more pricey but with hopes of many scholarships, the price can be brought down to a UW school cost."
College Freshman,4,"I think we have very good fans and support for the teams! Athletic facilities are nice, the only problem is that the soccer, baseball, and softball fields are so far from campus. I think they could have more support if it were closer."
College Freshman,4,"I have never lived on campus/ in the dorms, so I cannot say anything good or bad about that. I do know that everyone here is just looking out for your best interest, so although it may be strict at times, it is worth it."
College Freshman,4,"My experience has gone very well with financial aid. Although, I had some issues at first with transferring and such, but we were able to take care of them and now it is easy. I get very good financial aid so it helps a ton!"
College Freshman,4,Most housing is pretty nice.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the school, but there could be some changes."
College Sophomore,4,Various internship opportunities and career services.
College Sophomore,4,The school is just big enough to provide students with help needed to graduate. Professors and faculty really care about students' success.
College Sophomore,4,It depends on what sport you partake in and what passion you have towards that sport.
College Sophomore,4,"Ability to choose who you want to room with, and moving flexibility."
College Freshman,4,To be in my major it takes a lot of dedication and time management. There is a lot of material to cover. The facilities are great and the job internship are also great.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are available at different times, but most of the time are willing to compromise with students. Certain classes require that you learn a lot of material while others are average. registration is fairly easy and if any student have any problems they can always talk to an adviser. the best place to study is the library."
College Freshman,4,I have not heard of any campus crimes. There is always a security guard around just in case there is any problem. personally I feel safe on campus.
Junior,2,The campus is small and not very diverse. The education program is good. I like the professors. The softball program is not very strong either. I was looking for a great university to transfer and Viterbo just isn't a good fit for me.
College Freshman,2,Diversity is something that is hard to come by at this school just because of its size and religious affiliation. There are way more girls than guys. There are practically no ethnic people. Intertribal students cling to each other because they don't know anyone else.
College Sophomore,2,The athletics equipment is sub par to even high school gyms. There is a lack of actual strength conditioning equipment. And also a lack of knowledge from most coaches on how to actually lift.
College Junior,2,Viterbo University is an ok place to go to school.
College Sophomore,2,It's difficult to find an off-campus place.
College Student,2,"The student body (not majority) is kind of ""disgusted"" when he or she see's another person of race or ethnicity.  From what I have seen, at least."
College Junior,2,What scholarships? If there are any they do a very poor job at advertising it
College Freshman,2,not open long enough and not amazing
College Freshman,2,not to much attention is put on it
College Freshman,2,big difference in number of women compared to men
College Sophomore,2,"The parking can be a nightmare, off campus prices for parking tags are reasonable but on campus are extremely high."
College Senior,2,"Some diversity, however it feels very divided on campus. you know who you know and avoid the rest"
College Freshman,2,"There is only one dining hall, a fast food/convenience area, and a small coffee shop. The food is very average and there are very few healthy options unless you want to eat a salad everyday."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited parking permits and streets close to campus are available but crowded, plus be aware of two hour parking and getting ticketed."
College Freshman,2,"There are too many rules for being in college. I understand that we are attending a catholic school, but we don't need such strict rules on when we can and can't have the opposite gender in our rooms."
College Sophomore,2,Parking on Viterbo is terrible. It is even more worse in the winter seasons where everyone is trying very hard to get a good spot. Alternate side parking does not help students at which severely limits students to bring cars during winter. Here's a good tip volunteering at the hospital near the school will get you a better parking spot. Even of a student had a parking pass they are limited and the number of parking passes do not equal all parking spots on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Weather early in the fall semester and late spring semester is usually the best days in La Crosse, WI. Once winter starts, parking around campus is terrible especially since you have to remember which day every student needs to park their car on which side of the street."
College Sophomore,2,"I came to Viterbo University as a double major in theatre and psychology and then switched to solely a psychology major. I am not happy with the program I am in, and do not feel that the professors are as qualified as we are being led to believe."
College Sophomore,2,"Alcohol is used pretty regularly, as we are in La Crosse, WI.  People here love their beer.  There are tons of bars all over the city, and downtown is a popular attraction for young people of age.  Alcohol on campus is relatively common, but there are usually parties happening every weekend off campus, but within walking distance.  

Drugs are not as visible of a problem at Viterbo.  Weed is pretty common, especially at parties, but I don't really hear about much else."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Viterbo is abysmal.  If you live on campus and want a parking spot, you must purchase a parking permit (there are a limited number), but there are no guarantees you'll get a spot near your apartment building.  Our newest building, Clare Apartments, has an underground parking garage with limited parking spots.  Permits for those spots are more expensive, but trust me, they're totally worth it.  Imagine not having to scrape off your car or warm it up in the winter time; it's wonderful.  You must have a commuter permit to park anywhere else on campus if you live off-campus.  Most of the time, the lots are full, so you'll have to park on the street.  They are total sticklers about tickets, so my advice is to just NEVER park anywhere on campus if you don't have a permit."
College Sophomore,1,Don't know about the greek life
College Freshman,1,"I chose the worst because as a private college, they do not offer the chance to be apart of Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at Viterbo. I do not know whether or not you can start a fraternity here
College Freshman,1,I don't partake in it so I wouldn't know
College Sophomore,1,There are no fraternities or sororities at Viterbo.
College Junior,1,"There isn't much school spirit when it comes to sports. We don't have a football team, so our homecoming is in the fall with the basketball team. Many students don't go to games."
College Sophomore,1,There is no local transportation or busing available by the campus.
College Freshman,1,"Dorms--A Free for All – The dorms are clean and nice, but there is virtually no supervision most of the time.  The RA's either look the other way, participate in the partying, or are gone most of the time."
College Freshman,1,"Viterbo is a pretty strict school on the social level.  Of course no drugs or alcohol are allowed in the dorms, but they are even strict about boys and girls together.  All the males and females are on separate floors, and I've heard that if anyone of the opposite gender is in your room past midnight, you get into trouble!"
College Freshman,1,"Exclusivity in the Theatre Department – If you plan on coming to Viterbo to major in theatre, I encourage you to reconsider.  While they claim to have an excellent technical program, the professors are the ones who design everything (not letting the students have a chance), so of course it would be excellent.  If you confide in a professor, they will tell not only the entire theatre faculty, but all of the students as well.  So if you ever have a problem, consider keeping it to yourself.  It's hard to feel included in this program because everything is based on seniority.  Basically, if you've been here long enough, you'll get a higher up position in a show (even if your skills are mediocre).  They also claim to have a conservatory-style program, but this is far from true.  If it were a conservatory or even just conservatory-style, actors would not be required to enroll in technical and design classes and techies would not be required to enroll in acting classes."
College Freshman,1,"Not for Everyone – La Crosse is definitely not for everyone.  It's a pretty small town and with small towns comes not many things.  Unless you're athletic, LOVE the outdoors, and love drinking everyday of the week, this is not the town for you.  Viterbo is near downtown, which is nice, but it's infested with bars.  There have been many students mugged on campus and I'm sure almost everyone in the country knows of the Mississippi River drownings."

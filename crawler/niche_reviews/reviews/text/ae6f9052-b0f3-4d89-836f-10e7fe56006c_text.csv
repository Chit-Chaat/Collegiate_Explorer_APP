Alum,5,I've transferred twice and ended up at Wesleyan was probably the best thing that could have happened to me.
Alum,5,I did not take classes online and might take a gap year if that's the only option. Hanging out with other students was the true value of the place.
Freshman,5,"Like any school, there are ups and downs. However, Wesleyan was constantly a good time. Favorite part is the sports and dining hall."
Freshman,5,"As a rising sophomore, I really enjoyed my first year at Wesleyan -- even though it's disrupted by this pandemic."
Alum,5,Had a positive experience with academics as well as social life. The school has a wealth of resources and a community of students that care about learning. Lots of fun classes I recommend the sociology department <3
Freshman,5,I love going to school here at Wesleyan. It's such a great learning environment. I love to learn and it's a lot of fun getting to go to class with other students who truly enjoy expanding their horizons as well.
Sophomore,5,"I love Wes, and I really couldn't imagine being anywhere else. It's full of the most passionate, intelligent, and genuinely curious people I've ever met."
Senior,5,I strongly believe my experience at Wesleyan University has made me a better person. I have developed immense skills in my chosen field of economics and hope to continue on with what I learned in a related profession. The campus is diverse and welcoming. There is something for everyone!
Sophomore,5,Wesleyan has a strong community of talented individuals with incredible passion in whatever they pursue. There are good resources available to students and the professors are great.
Junior,5,"I LOVE this school! Couldn't be happier with my choice to come here. The students are incredible - everyone is interested in such a wide range of subjects and activities and they're all so passionate about what they're doing! I have friends who are chem majors who also star in plays, film majors who are also varsity athletes, bio majors who are in mock trial, etc. Everyone feels free to be themselves and do what they love and it's such an awesome environment to be a part of."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Wesleyan so far has been great! There's a really great student life at the university, and because it is such a small school you feel more at home since everyone knows you, even your professors. However, some dorms do not have AC and the bill is pretty expensive."
Alum,5,"Wesleyan is the perfect school to attend for anyone looking for the preparation for the rest of their life. You will learn from some of the most brilliant minds in every field and although you will work extremely hard, the reputation and experience will prime you for the real world."
Niche User,5,I love the welcoming and supportive environment that Wesleyan provides for its students when you first arrive on campus.
Alum,5,Amazing place. Intellectually alive and engaging.  Biggest of the “little three” and has more resources and activities than the other two combined. The diversity is real not just tokenized and students genuinely care about each other.  There are so many great programs but the work is hard and the expectations are high so you have to put in the hours. English majors often have a book a week to read while science majors are engaged in research with their professors that routinely get published in peer reviewed journals.
Alum,5,"Wesleyan is recognized for it's thorough academic achievement, but more so by the drive and ingenuity displayed by the students there. Best described as ""not what you know, but how you use it""."
Alum,5,Beautiful and suburban. Great faculty and academics. The student body is not very diverse but there is a lot to choose from and you will definitely find friends. Party scene is really fun and the food options if you're veg or kosher or whatever abound.
Alum,5,"Wesleyan University is known for being a weird place, but in the best way possible. It is full of original people who are able to be fully themselves and still find their niche. The campus is beautiful and the students are deeply engaged in extracurriculars. There is not night life around campus, so our campus is the night life -- filled with house parties! Also the food is actually really good."
Freshman,5,"One of the top schools in terms of academics.  Great financial aid if you are very low income or know how to work the system, but not for the average person.  Cost high relative to benefits"
Niche User,5,Great school. Love it and I really hope I get in. I love the area and the theatre programs there. Everyone is very nice and knows what they are talking about. The professors seem very helpful and connected.
Graduate Student,5,I attended as a graduate student and my son is there now. I have never met professors who were more passionate about their profession. I loved every one of my classes and was so inspired. My son is having an even better experience than I did. He has loved every moment of his college career.
Freshman,5,"Thoroughly outstanding university - dynamic student body, far more diverse, international and interesting student body than any of the other NESCACs, which are pretty conformist and traditional. Great arts and sciences in particular, which a strong connection to the film-making and theatre communities (Mad Men, Perfect Storm, Hamilton musical, Bourne Identity, etc. all created by Wesleyan alumni...."
Alum,5,Wesleyan is full of bright and interesting students and professors who care deeply about leading a meaningful life and having a positive social impact.
Graduate Student,5,"The university has done a super job in the faculty they have on staff. Faculty are very supportive, and brilliant.  I learned so much from the classes I have taken.  The school"
Alum,5,"One of the best decisions I ever made!

Wesleyan is like a giant sandbox where passionate people get to test drive all their crazy ideas. We plant gardens, run food co-ops, volunteer at prisons and schools, build art installations on campus, write plays, print sex-themed magazines, lead protests....it is a great place to discover how your personal interests intersect with participating in and supporting local communities. If you have a cool concept, there are the resources and people who will encourage you to make it a reality. 

The academics are stellar because of the professors. Besides being knowledgable, they are incredibly accessible: you can always stop by their office to ask for help on a problem set, discuss a topic, or just chat about life. They are there to help you learn and succeed. 

If you are an open-minded, curious person looking for an intimate, quirky, intellectual college, I encourage you to come to Wes :)"
Junior,5,"It’s an amazing place to be! It is a small school, so the community is very small but I personally prefer that.  School spirit is great, athletics are great.  I play on the women’s basketball team and I’ve loved every second of it so far.  The food gets a little repetitive but I think that’s true for any school.  I’ve made relationships with professors that have completely shaped my education and had such a positive impact, the staff is amazing and caring and small class size really lends itself to these kinds of relationships!  Overall, and incredible school and well worth it."
Alum,5,"Wesleyan is a place where anyone can find community and feel welcome. Students at Wesleyan are incredibly passionate as a whole and invested in almost all of the things they do. My academic and work experience was definitely amazing, but what made me who I am today was the people I met there. I've never been in an environment since with the quality of people you find at Wesleyan. Highly recommended."
Alum,5,Love it. Would highly recommend. The sense of community is really what makes it special. So lucky that I got in.
Freshman,5,"Classes are great, athletics are great, professors are great. But the students are what make the school amazing."
Niche User,5,Love it. Best place on earth. Highly recommend to those who are driven to make the world a better place.
Freshman,5,Wesleyan is truthfully one of the best places on Earth. Those who want to spend four years completely inspired to do good in the world should apply. I think its the best school in the world. Would not want to go anywhere else. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.
Sophomore,5,"I can quite honestly say that coming to Wesleyan is the best decision I've made in my life, as of yet. Wesleyan's vibrant and eccentric culture, its rigorous academics, and the multitude of opportunities it offers to its students makes Wesleyan a great university to attend. Its small campus size (and generally small class size, depending on the level of the course) makes for a good environment in which to create lasting bonds with peers and professors alike. Wesleyan offers need-based financial aid, and will do what it can to prevent you from taking on a loan to attend. I personally feel that it is a very nurturing campus, because of its emphasis on inclusiveness through its financial aid practices, psychological services such as CAPS, and campus-wide dedication to teaching each other about diversity and how to fix social ills we may have found ourselves unknowingly assimilated into."
Freshman,5,I really love Wesleyan because you can basically find any resources you need on campus. Professors are helpful and courses are interesting. Totally worth it.
Sophomore,5,"Not only have I become less judgmental of others after being here for two years, but I have become less judgmental of myself. I have learned more about who I am, and have learned to like who I am. I am able to do what I like here, which has helped me figure out what makes me happy- which is what I feel like is what college should be. It's a great place."
Freshman,5,"I love how I am encouraged to try a variety of things here in respect to classes, clubs, and even what I wear. Very knowledgable professors and intelligent students. I don't think I would have gotten as great of an experience elsewhere."
Alum,5,"Wesleyan is the best!!!! I loved it here, I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is considering attending!"
Freshman,5,"I love Wesleyan, I feel so lucky to be here. The student body is very diverse, a lot of people are also into arts, and everyone's nice and respectful. People know how to have fun, but also how to work hard."
College Junior,5,"I like wesleyan because the professors genuinely care about the students, they go out of their way to try and help the student understand the material and succeed after college. I like the class sizes because I can learn everyone's name and can study together."
College Junior,5,"I was worried that in college I wouldn't be able to fit in because I'm socially awkward and a huge nerd, but I find myself fitting in fine. I love the professors, classes and I love the community."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Wesleyan. Courses are challenging but rewarding, the people are incredible, and the school environment has helped me become the best version of myself."
College Sophomore,5,"Wesleyan has a huge alumni network in many fields, and I feel very confident that I will be employed or in grad school post-college."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Wes. There is a hugely diverse student population, with people from all over with varying interests. It is very easy to find your niche at this school."
College Sophomore,5,"I love it. I like that we don't need frats to be a central part of the party culture here. They are visible, but they are on par with house parties, program house parties, bar night, etc. And a senior house party will NEVER turn freshman away!"
College Sophomore,5,This school is SO diverse. I can't get over how diverse it is. Everyone is so different and that's what makes Wes amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"It's a top university with amazing teachers and an open curriculum. I've met some of the smartest kids in the nation at this school. My high school was filled with students who ended up at Ivies, but a majority of the students here are much more interested in what they are doing and much more intelligent in what they are interested in."
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small, professors are accessible, students are collaborative, and there is an abundance of courses. I've not taken a course here that I haven't enjoyed here."
College Sophomore,5,"Wesleyan is a VERY well-known school, but some departments do better with career placement than others. Econ and Film are very good programs, but I can't imagine an Art History major has as easy a time getting a job. The career center is great, however, and they even have an ironing board if you need your clothes to look nice for an on-campus interview!"
College Sophomore,5,"I've just finished my freshman year and cannot imagine going to school anywhere else. Wesleyan's open curriculum and vast number of opportunities in and outside of the classroom have made this past year so memorable. It's the perfect size and the night life is amazing (despite the frats no longer being as visible on campus). There are some weird stereotypes about Wes, but it's one of the most rigorous and prestigious schools in the nation, nonetheless."
College Sophomore,5,Students are notified of any suspicious behavior on and around campus but generally the area surrounding Wesleyan is not dangerous
College Sophomore,5,"Wesleyan has so many options for all kinds of people including religion, hobbies/interests, greek life etc"
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to have a professor I didn't like. Yes, classes can be difficult and I may not like a particular assignment but I still like and respect the professors and on the whole I would recommend their classes. Classes are relatively small unless you take a lot of intro level science."
College Junior,5,"The academics are the highlight of the school. The film program in particular. Also, there are many amazing professors at the school."
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan is a top-tier education. As someone who has studied at Harvard and Vanderbilt before, I prefer Wes. More personalized, and quite honestly, who wouldn't want that?"
College Freshman,5,"All sorts of people from all over the world. Diverse ethnicities, personalities, and beliefs."
College Freshman,5,The school takes personal safety very seriously. Peers are understanding and supportive.
College Freshman,5,"As the years go by, it just seems like so many more alumni are doing big things. Whether it's being the genius behind the spectacular broadway show, Hamilton, to coaching to win super bowls on a consistent basis. Wesleyan's name does carry weight and the alumni network is very helpful and supportive. The school has several connections and will get you what you need."
College Freshman,5,"CAn't describe how well the professors teach! They are more than helpful! for example, I was struggling so much with Calculus and dropped in on my professor almost every day to get extra help. They are also very flexible with your schedule. They really want you to succeed. Class size is perfect. Personal. Several different interesting courses offered."
College Freshman,5,"My dorm is considered average, yet I have a 2 room double, which is basically a single for me and my roommate with a door in between us. People envy this because it's basically the best of both worlds. Compared to dorms at other LAC's I've visited, (don't get me started with state schools), rooms are very spacious. Our bathroom is large and even has it's own bathtub. Also, we have a balcony that connect all the rooms on one side of the building."
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan is an interesting liberal arts college, not necessarily for the hippie reputation that it may have, although it can be found. I consider it more of a state school for liberal arts colleges. I say this because it is bigger than most, a good size of 3,200. It is also very laid back. After visiting friends nearby at other top LAC's I realized that Wesleyan has a less stressful atmosphere, which is refreshing. Courses are just as challenging of course, but helpful resources are more than available. There is a way to enjoy your life while also managing your courses, and I think most people at Wes do that well. You can get an ""IVY""caliber education, yet, still have a personal relationship with peers and professors that isn't competitive."
College Freshman,5,"Wesleyan is an amazing place where people from all walks of life convene. I love the diversity of the school and the liberal vibe to it. Academics are challenging but in no way cut-throat. Students are willing to help each other and often study in groups. People at Wes are not just ""smart"" but intellectual. Because of the open curriculum, students study what they love and that atmosphere fosters intellectual growth and passion. Overall, my first semester at Wesleyan was amazing. I can't wait for the spring semester!"
College Sophomore,5,"PSafe, Wesleyan's police, understand the students overall and don't want to get them in trouble. If you're caught doing illegal things (aka drugs, alcohol) you don't get a criminal offense, you just go to the SJB and are saved a spot on your permanent record. I overall feel safe on campus."
Freshman,4,"It was a great learning experience. The professors really cared about students and subject matter, and there was always a variety of different topics and classes to choose from."
Freshman,4,"Wesleyan is a great place with some good people, and while I truly believe I am getting a good education, and have had access to resources such as free textbooks for few hour loans at the library, it’s still a high price tag and I can’t give it five stars. Some people can also be overly bougie but you can ignore it."
Freshman,4,Slow learning curve for students and faculty. Should get better. Overall I liked it because it was easy and the professors were very understanding.
Freshman,4,"pros: a liberal liberal arts college. ie one that has an extremely flexible system that encourages exploration and academic inquiry. promotes diversity even amongst its domestic student population (ie racially, religiously and socio-economically diverse as opposed to just a white upper-class demographic). fosters dialogue as opposed to argument allowing people to learn the importance of agreeing to disagree.
cons: somewhat lack of directional guidance (too much emphasis on passion, not enough practical information). still an elite institution that is predominantly white so despite its diversity, minority groups still need to actively make space for themselves."
Freshman,4,"I think Wesleyan is definitely worth its while when it comes to academics and being able to learn and discuss various different topics. All of the courses I've taken during my freshman year all dealt with subjects I had a personal interest in (post-WWII Japan, African-American literature & history, French language, etc), and the professors I've had for all of those courses all, at the very least, demonstrated immense interest and knowledge of what they were teaching.

With that being said, I will say that Wesleyan could do a lot better when it comes to supporting low-income students and students who belong to marginalized groups (race, sexuality, etc.) when it comes to issues on campus (the process of paying tuition with scholarships, for example)."
Niche User,4,"A very good and diverse school, beautiful campus, and great walking distance from Main Street. Lots of history to go around here as well, very liberal school and I would recommend anyone interested in Fine Arts to go here."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Wesleyan because it is a small liberal arts school but has a lot of opportunities for science research. I’ve been able to work in a lab for 3 years, with fully funded summers. The party scene is touch and go, and improves markedly as upperclassmen."
Junior,4,Awesome academics and community atmosphere. I feel safe on campus but you can't ignore the substance abuse issues. I wish administrators would address it and promote awareness.
Alum,4,"Wesleyan's professors make the school. These instructors are passionate, knowledgeable and more than happy to interact outside of class or school hours. Take advantage of the opportunity to work with these experts!"
Niche User,4,Wesleyan was a very welcoming campus with a good tour. Connecticut is a beautiful four state. The school has a decent diversity especially considering the majority of students are wealthy.
Niche User,4,"Visiting Wesleyan I felt, extremely welcomed into their community. There is not one person on that campus that is unwilling to help another student. Students on the campus are generally satisfied about their campus life."
Senior,4,"There is a strong alumni network from Wesleyan University. Although there have been ups and downs to the school's publicity and reputation throughout my career here, Wesleyan seems to prioritize its students and alumni to the highest regard."
Sophomore,4,"Very good school only thing is White students can be very judgey and of course political correctness is shoved down people's throats rather than discussing the basis of beliefs and how people's circumstances can affect them. For example, it is hard for students from conservative cultures to wear revealing clothes. Certain groups of students don't understand this. At the same time it is possible to find people who do understand and appreciate your morals and values. Just be prepared to look further than the first group of friends you make."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Wesleyan and all it has to offer. The campus is small but not so small that you'll keep seeing the same people over and over, unless you take the same classes with them. The classes offered are super interesting, and there is usually activities to do on the weekends."
Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan is the most intellectually and socially stimulating place I've ever been in my life. It's truly the most amazing education you could possibly imagine. Wesleyan is 100% worth the education. However, in a lot of ways, because of Wesleyan's sort of incubator environment where cool, passionate, and intelligent people all get together in the middle of nowhere and try to think of whatever ideas they possibly can, there's potential to be overwhelmed and sometimes feel trapped in a bubble. This is not necessarily a bad thing depending on who you are. But if you want a small liberal arts experience with amazing people and great education, there's really no other place you'd go."
Sophomore,4,"Every day I spent on campus I felt intellectually stimulated. The courses I've taken so far have been so enlightening and I'm taking classes in disciplines I thought I never would again. Everyone is very accepting of others you can feel it. Even though it has a bit of a run down campus, the academics make up for it."
Senior,4,"The students' commitment to social justice was enlightening and empowering. The small size of the school allowed me to make connections with many different people, including staff and faculty."
Junior,4,"Great academics, extremely challenging, however this is a huge disconnect between students and staff "
College Junior,4,"I like that Wesleyan has WesConnect where students can connect with alumni, and I also love the professors give students information on summer and yearly internships. I also haven't had a problem with my work study boss. However, the reason why the rating is great and not the best is because the career center essentially generalizes opportunities and is more helpful for a student in the arts, businesses and natural sciences."
College Junior,4,"I don't worry about the people on campus, but the residents of middletown is a different story. I worry about them a little, but I haven't had to fear them. Nothing bad has happened to anyone I know or myself."
College Sophomore,4,most of my professors were very helpful and great to talk to outside of class.
College Sophomore,4,The career is good place to start but they could be more helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I love being there. You get to choose what classes you want to take and experience the breath of Wesleyan, if you want. You'll meet a lot of people that come from different places that you'll be able to spend four years with and have a great time."
College Sophomore,4,Loving the school. Professors are great. Variety of classes is amazing! Classmates are friendly. Great environment.
College Sophomore,4,"Having only one year of experience so far, I'd say that my experience has been great! Everyone is so outgoing and friendly, which was weird for a shy little one like me at first. But then, you learn to just let yourself go and to be outgoing and break out of your little bubble. The professors have been great and clearly want to help their students, offering multiple office hours, study sessions and looking out for students that seem to be having a bit more of a struggle than others. 

The food was great at first, but then you realize the menu is about the same every week/month so that gets boring. But that's only at Usdan and Summies. There are other excellent food establishments on campus though, just that freshies are limited to certain meal plans that only encourage us to go to those two above named places."
College Senior,4,People criticize the school a lot but overall I've grown so much as a person here and I am so grateful for my experience.
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty much everything is safe. The frat parties sometimes created issues, but not anymore"
College Sophomore,4,"I was one of the few freshman living in a triple this past year and was so happy with my living situation. I wasn't in one of the ""nicer"" dorms, but made so many great friends in my dorm and had a great room with air conditioning and lots of space."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics here are fantastic, but I'm not involved very heavily in them. We've had a few recently drafted baseball players and our basketball team won the little three title!"
College Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan is a prestigious school whose name carries heft in the job market, many alums go on to amazing careers"
College Sophomore,4,Wesleyan University isn't known for its athletics and is a D3 school but it constantly places in the top 5 of the NESCAC and is thrilling to watch without the colossal stadiums you find at large State Schools
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had any experiences where I felt unsafe on campus, and neither have my friends (that I know about). However I heard about a break in in the town near campus and someone got mugged nearby as well."
College Freshman,4,I like my current dorm a lot in terms of location and the people I live with. I'm not too excited about the housing options for sophomores though. The one problem with the dorm I currently live in is that people constantly puke in the bathrooms and it takes a while for it to be cleaned up.
College Freshman,4,I think Wesleyan has a good balance between showing support for athletes but making it clear that scholarship comes first. Sporting events are well-attended and fun but varsity athletes don't have the cache that they might at a Division I school.
College Freshman,4,I have met some really cool people and the classes are interesting for the most part. I like the culture because I think it is very accepting and there is something for everyone. The one thing that I would like to improve is I wish the teachers and/ or career advisors would reach out to me more in terms of pointing me towards internship and job opportunities in my area.
College Junior,4,The concert scene at Wes is unparalled and dominates that party scene. House parties can also be fantastic.
College Junior,4,Great for LGBT and people of nonconventional sexuality or gender identity. Minority issues are progressing and many students are highly active in this area.
College Junior,4,Film department is excellent. Physics department is a mixed bag.
College Junior,4,For film the alumni network is invaluable. People also seem to tend to do well in the sciences.
College Junior,4,"Pretty standard, but generally nice rooms, though the process can be difficult."
College Junior,4,"Wesleyan is a really unique school full of artists, activists, and academics."
College Sophomore,4,This school has such great school spirit and pride.
College Sophomore,4,It has been a great experience. So many people want to see you succeed.
College Senior,4,"Wes really emphasizes connecting their new graduates with alumni for opportunities, and in general they do a great job! There are multiple online portals that help you search for WesAlums in your field, and you can receive exclusive job offers that WesAlums post looking for Wes undergrads/grads. Also, once I got into my major I receive almost a superfluous amount of internship/job opportunities forwarded to me from people who contact our department looking for our undergrads. Opportunities abound! Nobody ever really GOES to the Career Center, and from my experience they're great at proofreading your resume but unhelpful in any kind of career soul-searching. Job recruiters are almost exclusively consulting firms and/or education, but most people don't get jobs through the recruiters."
College Senior,4,"Academics vary by department, but generally I find myself in small enough classes where I get enough attention. Many are seminar based with lots of reading, which put a great emphasis on conversation. You can study ANY subject under the sun, and picking classes from all the exciting options is really hard! Professors are honestly hit or miss. Some (a slight majority?) are the most brilliant, passionate, helpful educators I've ever had, and are great resources for whatever we are studying. But I've had some professors that are incredibly disorganized and terrible at imparting knowledge onto others. Definitely weigh in upperclassmen opinions of faculty when picking classes (RateMyProfessor is v outdated)."
College Senior,4,"You're required to live on campus all 4 years, so housing really differs year to year. Frosh dorms are generally nice and kept updated. Sophomore year, living in a program house is DEFINITELY your best option (super great communities, and you live in a HOUSE, which means nicer amenities, common spaces, and bedrooms). Junior year apartments are really small and the community is sub-par, but generally preferred over a program house because of having your own space. And senior woodframe houses are THE BOMB--after graduating I know I will not live in a house this spacious and nice for probably a few years. In terms of cost, you're paying a f***ton of money but there's no way out of it sooooo. Everything is relatively close to the center of campus, except people groan about Washington Street, Pearl, and Cross/Knowles."
College Senior,4,"I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. I've grown into SUCH a better person and learned so much about the world, not only through my classes but through the close friends and inspirational acquaintances I've made. The only thing that could have made my experience better is taking better care of my mental health, which could have prevented some miserable semesters. ***Take care of yourself*** and really explore every nook of what this place has to offer."
College Freshman,4,"Parties are enjoyable, but don't consume campus life."
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life over the past years has been pretty non-existent with the shutting down of several societies. There are a few still remaining. This has to do with inclusiveness. The President wants frats to be coed. Wes is very aware of making students feel included, and as a result, Greek life is very weak. However, there are several other parties through the program houses or sports teams that are more than sufficient and inclusive."
College Freshman,4,"We don't have tens of thousands of people at football games, or any sport for that matter. It's a small college, but people do show out for certain sports, mostly football, basketball, and soccer. It's enjoyable and you can go support the dirty birds with several other enthusiastic students. Our basketball team won our division last year, our football team is consistently a top tier team, and our soccer team made it to the conference final this year. There is a lot to be excited about, but sports do not dominate campus life."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Bennet, the most newly renovated freshman dorm. The facilities are updated and kept pretty clean. The rooms are all doubles and are fairly spacious."
College Sophomore,4,"The career center sends out emails weekly with information about new internships etc. I have also heard that if you do well in certain departments, the more senior people can help you secure jobs with their own connections."
College Sophomore,4,"Some dorms are more recent and others and tend to have better amenities, but most dorms don't have air conditioning, which is frustrating during the couple months it's really needed to get good sleep. Older dorms are badly in need of an upgrade."
College Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience at Wesleyan and if I had to reapply I would!
College Sophomore,4,Some good qualities. Overall I've made great friends. Facilities could be better. Professors are amazing.
College Sophomore,4,Very challenging and I feel that I am being pushed to my potential.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. Like any institution, it has it's flaws, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I've had fabulous luck in attaining the courses necessary for my major as well as for my personal enjoyment. The courses are hard and require a lot of work but they are worth it in the end. The school is expensive. As a student on scholarship, it's much more difficult financially to deal with certain aspects of the school, such as the meal plan, than it seems it should be. However, disregarding the financial situation, I think the school is wonderful in what it has to offer. I've become involved in numerous extracurricular activities (although, unfortunately, there is not enough time in the day to really conquer the rule of 7 things). I've found friends in every environment-- a cappella, work, classes, the gym, the student center. The students are passionate and strong-willed. It's hard to have a meaningless conversation on campus because the students so stimulated. I would most definitely choose Wesleyan again if I were given the chance to rewind."
College Freshman,4,My school is a military school.
College Freshman,4,The community atmosphere is great and welcoming
College Sophomore,4,"My school is very fun and unique. The people come from all walks of life and are generally very liberal people. I enjoy the school, but most of all I enjoy meeting the new and unique students."
Graduate Student,2,"I've been terribly disappointed by the GLS program. Rude, primadonna professors out of touch with adult learners' needs. Entire office staff are bafflingly incompetent, not to mention cold, and strangely jaded. It's reminded me of everything I disliked about academia in the first place and why I avoided grad school for so long. It's accessible though as far as MA programs go so I can see why it stays alive."
College Senior,2,I'm not really into Greek life. Most people don't care one way or another.
College Sophomore,2,"Currently, Wes doesn't have any frats or sororities with houses. We currently only have 4 frats: DKE, AEPi, Psi U, and Chi Psi, but only the first three really have any sort of presence. Psi U is coming back to Wes in the fall, which should change things, but currently none of the frats have any relevance to anyone else other than the members. We have one sorority, Rho Ep, but it isn't nationally recognized and is more in place so girls who would normally have a hard time finding a girl group can have a solid friend group of girls."
College Senior,2,The school has dismantled greek life over the past two years. It is almost nonexistent now.
College Sophomore,2,"My particular experience so far has been pretty bad, when I walked on campus I didn't really know what I was getting into. Wesleyan is extremely liberal so you have to watch what you say at all times and many students will get offended very easily with a call-out culture very prevalent. At the same time I feel as if I could have made better decisions because most people I know here seem very happy."
College Junior,2,People aren't a big fan of greek life on campus. Lots of controversy.
College Senior,2,"Unless you are a student-athlete, varsity sports are at the bottom of your priority list (a significant number of athletes that I know end up quitting towards the end of their college career, for what it's worth). No one attends the games. Though, friends I have who play club sports (especially Ultimate Frisbee) get very into it and form wonderful communities."
Recent Alumnus,2,"You aren't truly a Wesleyan student if you haven't hated the administration in some capacity during your four years here. Whether they're expelling students to improve their PR image or letting perpetrators of sexual assault off scot-free, they know how to royally mess up the lives of students."
College Sophomore,2,Financial Aid is very low as an international student.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the campus dislikes Greek Life. The administration is trying to slowly shut it down.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is going downhill and fast, making it SAT optional was to offset the drop in applicants, the University has so small an endowment they cant afford anything, no new buildings, no better faculty and financial aid is getting worse by the year, dont come unless you can pay full pay.  So few alums support its getting tougher to get internships, so few give $$$ its getting embarassing, so few $$$ to do anything.  Ranking is falling so rapid, I fear getting a job the school is becoming a laughing stock."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Pres Roth wants them gone, so i time they will be gone, most of the bad things that happen on campus wither happens in the frats or the dorms, so really bad thing happen everywhere"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Its tolerable, but really if you like food, consider your options and town is not so close"
College Sophomore,2,"The administration is pretty unfriendly in North College, and P-Safe is really only interested in busting parties. Supposed ""Fire Safety"" examinations of our rooms are really just a guise to find our booze and alcohol, and to impose fines on students."
College Freshman,2,"I've only been to one football game, when my parents were visiting and wanted to see it."
College Freshman,2,"Here's the thing: Greek life at Wes is complicated. It doesn't exactly jive with the activist community with all the sexual assault accusations that have happened in the last few years. That being said, they're well-known for the parties they throw; in particular, the co-ed societies (Eclectic and Alpha Delt) are very popular on weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"They're not meeting my needs at all. They're asking for more than my family can pay. I've had to appeal every year so far. It's an anxiety-inducing headache every time. Plus, they just repealed need-blind admissions."
College Sophomore,2,"The houses aren't bad, but everyone hears horror stories about the people and sexual assault at their parties. We have one brand-new sorority, but they aren't allowed their own house. The administration has been cracking down on all the fraternities recently."
College Senior,2,"ResLife is probably the campus administrative office that impacts students the most. They are asinine. Without them, the university would probably be a much better place to live."
College Senior,2,"If you care about travel and don't have a care, don't go to Wesleyan."
College Sophomore,2,There is a standard view on all of these that remains constant throughout the majority of the campus
College Junior,2,"I came to Wesleyan because their website talked about how proud they were of their collaborative environment. As a student with no access to the Internet before I started my undergrad, I thought this would prove exceptionally helpful, especially since I wanted to pursue computer science. I guess my expectations were too high for Wesleyan to meet, because most of my learning is independent and unrelated to the university. Discouraging, but you can't win them all."
College Freshman,2,"Parking lots are scarce and fairly far from dorms, but it's easy for anyone (freshman included) to get parking permits."
College Junior,2,"Parking permits and any fines are not cheap, and finding a convenient spot can be a hassle, but there is no need for a car on campus unless you intend to leave every weekend."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking on campus is not the easiest to find. Permits are expensive and fines are worse and given out fairly often. You don's need a car on campus for the purposes of getting to and from classes however, I found it to be helpful when I needed groceries, medicine etc. Street parking was hard to come by and you were often blocked in to your own driveway by people illegally or inconsiderately parked."
College Sophomore,2,"Confusing to Say the Least – There is a lot of confusion about how parking works and no one, except Public Safety, seems to know what lot you can get in any given year."
College Junior,2,"No Sorority House – There is no great option for women interested in joining a sorority, but the frats are great. Different options for different types of people and host many fun parties."
College Freshman,2,P-Safe Is Your Only Worry – Public safety can be pretty strict. They are known to bust up parties but usually if there are too many people inside of one building. They take their job seriously and you probably will get caught if you are really obvious about smoking / drinking.
College Freshman,2,"Generally strictness at the school is very lenient, however there are some instances where campus policies and law will take immediate effect depending on the severity of the situation."
College Sophomore,2,Middletown has nice dining downtown.  City and campus atmosphere is sub par with rival NESCAC schools.  Kinda has a depressing dark vibe about it.
College Freshman,2,"Not So Hot – Financial aid is extremely difficult. I have a much greater need than forms can show, and making ends meet to come to school is a burden on my family. The financial aid office is not too helpful in awarding money or finding alternate means of paying for school."
College Freshman,2,"STAY ON CAMPUS – Outside of Bar Nights on Wednesdays, off-campus nightlife is sadly non-existent.  This is made up for with a variety of things to do on-campus so don't worry about finding something to do on a weekend night."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from California, it's a drastic change. I usually have to look for snow, but here it finds me. cold as balls."
College Sophomore,2,"Small Town & Good Restaurants – Main street is really the only thing that Middletown has to offer other than the Connecticut River which is a beautiful place to explore. Main street has a good selection of cuisine - nothing spectacular but a good variety. The area around the school has a lot of good hiking and nature activities if you are into that. The local attitude towards Wesleyan students varies but as with most college cities, the students are perceived to be much more privileged than the locals."
College Sophomore,2,Fan support is not much. Not really an athlethic sort of place. We have a nice gym though.
College Freshman,2,"There is very minimal to no off campus housing for undergraduate students at Wesleyan. Whether it be in General Residence houses, Program houses, or Wooden Frame houses, students almost never have to/nor choose to live on campus. In fact it proves to be only a small handful of people. But what is available still remains relatively close to campus but in a slightly rough neighborhood."
College Junior,2,"Not a Hubub of Activity – Middletown isn't exactly the most happening place.  In fact, it's safe to say that there is almost nothing happening there at all.  If you're not super involved in campus activities, you might want to shoot yourself on the weekends if you're from a large city.  Fortunately there are Zipcars on campus you can rent by the hour if you've had a license for at least a year."
College Junior,2,"Walk With a Buddy – Middletown has been the site of a few shootings in recent years, and I wouldn't go there alone at night -- girls are also at risk of being catcalled. On campus, two students were beaten up this past year by nonstudents, but generally I feel safe walking around alone, even at night. You can always (24/7) call for a campus-safety escort, or often a student escort if you prefer, and ""the Ride"" is a van you can hop on that travels campus in circuits after 7pm."
College Sophomore,2,"I Don't Really Know – not everyone goes to sports stuff, but i know our football team sucks"
College Freshman,2,"Not Varied – The Greek Life at Wesleyan is very limited.  There are few Greek organizations on campus who have buildings: ADP, DKE, Beta, Psi U, and the Eclectic Society.  Psi U is the one that actually throws decent parties, but there parties can become redundant.  Beta is more of a ""bro"" fraternity as is DKE to a lesser degree.  The fraternities at Wesleyan pale in comparison to those of other schools; they are merely houses for athletes.  There are no sorority houses on campus.  ADP (the literary society) and Eclectic are both co-ed.  Members of Greek life are integrated into the community and membership is neither a good nor bad factor to your reputation."
College Sophomore,1,"it's all gone, give up on hope of ever being apart of greek life.................."
College Sophomore,1,Wesleyan's Greek life is in the process of being overthrown to co-educated societies
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is virtually no off-campus housing. Every student is required to live on campus all four years; housing is guaranteed.
College Sophomore,1,There is no off campus housing!
College Sophomore,1,Nurses and doctors in the health center are judgmental and it is impossible to get in to see the doctor.
College Senior,1,"We can't use it mostly, we've already payed an arm and a leg for the meal plan and other food options are either far away or terrible/overpriced. Food carts are OK, but they're only around on certain nights and they're overpriced. No  one wants to spend real money here."
College Senior,1,"Funny how they can be getting higher and higher salaries, raising tuition, and still taking funding away from everything which once made this school great. Life at Wesleyan feels like a constant battle between the administration and the students."
College Senior,1,"At Wesleyan you have to buy their meal plan to enroll. It's expensive, way too expensive. You will run out of food three weeks before the end of the semester and if you don't have a car you'll probably end up having to pay for more overpriced food. The school grocery store has limited options in the way of healthy affordable food, but if you need a 20$ chocolate bar, they got you covered. Most students I know end up sneaking into the dining hall by the end of the semester because they've run out of 'points'. The dining hall is poorly stocked, they run out of most foods by the end of the year. The vegan section is great when it's great, they have an amazing chef, but he isn't there all the time. All in all, it's like going to school in a factory town."
College Senior,1,"Wesleyan maintains the minimum number of hours necessary to maintain their status as an accredited university. Many good professors, but they baby you and you end up learning most of what you actually need to know on your own."
College Senior,1,"DO NOT GO TO WESLEYAN. It's my biggest regret in life so far, I couldn't have possibly had a worse experience with college and many people here feel the same."
College Senior,1,"I struggled every semester to try to live off campus, the university rarely ever allows it. There are great, affordable options in the area, but the university wants you to lease their overpriced cement boxes. When I finally got it, my living costs reduced to about a quarter of what they were while I lived on campus and my quality of life shot up immeasurably. However, don't consider this an option; they almost never allow students to live off campus."
College Senior,1,"The Office of Residential life will screw you for every penny. They act like it's downtown Manhattan real estate when they cram you like sardines into dysfunctional facilities.  Even when the school gives you houses, most of them have broken down heating and plumbing. The University rushes you to pack your life into boxes immediately after finals, giving you no time to say goodbyes or rest. They will slap you with egregious fines for staying late, for having dust on the floor, for having minor aesthetic flaws (a pen mark, a frayed screen) that were present before you moved in.

Somehow Wesleyan is simultaneously the worst place I've ever lived and the most expensive. Oh, and they forbid you to live off campus. It's in the fine print when you enroll in the college. They monopolize your life here to exploit your wallet."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Could not get an internship this year, not many alums help"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its been rad, no really its been much much worse than I expected, I am so dissappointed in my choice, I should have listened to my parents and gone somewhere much much better, I could have, my choice, my mistake"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its becoming bad, the school has such a poor rep, now just know as expensive and full of druggies, all its known for is drug use.  falling out of the top 25 schools this year, applications dropping, no endowment $$$, so sorry"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Upperclassmen get to stay in University owned housing, most of which is falling down, you wont get anything repaired until the end of the semester, its the worst"
College Senior,1,I have had a lot of trouble with financial aid due to my family's unique and precipitous decline in income over the past sever years. Wesleyan has good financial aid for people of specific documentable income brackets.
College Junior,1,"I'm a computer science major. I find the workload is bearable, but too theory-oriented and not practical enough. Not everyone will become a professor, but the university seems to believe they will. I don't agree with the curriculum either. There are too many holes. The university doesn't even offer a databases course!

 

The facilities are mediocre and there is little assistance available for comp sci majors. There are some fantastic professors and there are some atrocious ones. Fortunately, the worst one didn't get tenure this year so he's headed off to Vassar. 

The only saving grace is that there is an email list that you can subscribe to and receive 10-50 internship offers per year. However, you won't be told about this list, so you have to ask."
College Freshman,1,"Wesleyan is, well, Wesleyan.  Drugs are everywhere.  I can't step out of my dorm without smelling marijuana.  On Saturday and Sunday morning, you can easily walk through campus and see red Solo cups and beer cans strewn about.  In spite of this, Wesleyan does a relatively good job on drug safety with presentations...only your freshman year though."

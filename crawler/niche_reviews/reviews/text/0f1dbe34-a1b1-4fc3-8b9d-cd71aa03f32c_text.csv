Junior,5,It's a good college. It's in a small town but the professors are great. They offer a variety of different programs to chose from.
Junior,5,I take only online courses. I enjoy them and the professors are awesome. We use Blackboard and it's easy to work with.
Junior,5,I have been at Northern New Mexico College for 4 years now about to receive my associates degree in elementary education. My experience at northern has been one of the greatest experiences I have ever had as far as schooling. Being a student that is disabled it has been really great to see and experience that there is a great amount of accessibility on campus I have no complaints whatsoever. As far as what I would like to see change is the education department. I bring this up because being in the education program I have had my fair share of classes and I will tell you the truth when I say that the classes haven’t always been my favorite due to the fact that most of my education classes are fully online or the are hybrid. In my opinion I think that if someone is going into the education field classes should be fully in the classroom because I feel that there are a lot of individuals who learn better being face to face in a classroom.
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing experience at Northern just from the start of my freshman year. All of the students and staff are amazing as well! Being a disabled student the campus is fully accessible for me I am able to get around the campus without any issues. As far as what I would like to see change,I would like to see that there are more classes that are being taught in the classroom rather than them being taught online or have it only be taught in the classroom once a month. In my opinion I really don’t like having online classes because if you’re going into education then I feel it is best to go to the classes that you’ve signed up for and actually go to them in person. I am in the education program and about to get my associates degree in elementary education"
Junior,5,"Northern New Mexico College is a beautiful campus. They offer degrees to satisfy just about every dream and they have a decent variety of class schedules available. I would like to see them continue adding online options for working adults, but they are off to a great start."

Freshman,5,Everyone needs a hand at times and I feel like they give second chances and make you feel at home. The financial aide office has helped me get through the process and I loved every minute on campus. The professors so far have been good to me very understandable and they help with whatever they can. They have helped me get through the rough part and put me through the hard times i wish I can get help finacially because like I said times are rough these days and everyone needs a hand at times. I am taking a First Year Expierence class and i feel like my professor is taking his time really getting students to apply for help so they dont struggle like me

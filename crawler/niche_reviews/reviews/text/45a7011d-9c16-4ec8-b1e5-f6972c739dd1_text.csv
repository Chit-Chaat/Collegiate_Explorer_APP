College Senior,5,The financial aid staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. They explained everything in great detail. No surprises! I like that!
College Junior,5,I am extremely happy with my choice of National College- Salem.  It is a smaller campus so we receive personalized attention.  The teacher to student ratio is low which makes it easier to get the attention from the instructor that each of us needs.
Freshman,4,"I thought about giving up, but this school wouldn't have that. They worked with me and I'm doing amazing. I only thing I wish would change would be more in seat classes instead of online."
College Freshman,4,the school offers great programs and it got the right professors who enjoys nothing but mentoring its students
College Freshman,4,"It feels like you are at your local school in your origin country, professors are very friendly and helpful. Small sized classes which gives an opportunity to ask professor to offer extra attention to where you don't understand. I would recommend this college to anyone willing to study in America."
College Senior,4,"With our terms being only 10 weeks long, I have to devote a lot of time to school. I have at least 4-6 hours of homework per class per week."
College Senior,4,Finantial Aid is easy to get and is thouroughly explained.
College Junior,4,"The professors they have at National College where great. They were knowledgeable in their field of study and passionate about what they do because they have jobs in that field. Curriculum is very straight forward, and registration is super easy because they have your main classes picked out for you already when it comes time to register. Workload is very manageable, especially if you are an adult with a job and family."
College Junior,4,You always get the change to go out in the field and work in a real life work setting. That always puts things into perspective when your outside the classroom. You get good hands on training and you feel prepared in whatever you want to do.
College Sophomore,4,Have not started classes yet so can not provide sufficient answer. 
College Senior,4,"They have a lot of availability of the resources they do have, since it is a fast tract college most of the resources are aimed at finding you a career as soon as you graduate."
College Junior,4,The main reason that I chose National College was the flexibility of the classes. Three classes a term gives me the time to work full time and enjoy my family. The convenience of National College fit into my daily life.
College Junior,4,I chose this school because it was convienent and the faculty works great with working with your schedule. Also the classrooms are small and the instructers are very good at instructing the classes.
College Senior,4,They are helpful as long as you know what you need before you get there
College Sophomore,4,"I Love It. I'm a business major, and my classes are so interesting to me. Everything that I have taken applies to my degree program. It also helps me at my job where i currently am working in a position of management. The workload does increase as you get further in your degree program, but that should be expected."
College Sophomore,4,They Really Work With You. Your advisors are right there with you involving themselves with helping you register for classes. whatever can work for you they will help.
College Junior,4,"What Makes National Unique? For me, I cherish the small classes with the respect that I can talk to the professor before, during and after classes. As previously acknowledged, this degree is NOT an option but a SURVIVORIAL endeavor. I appreciate ALL the help I can get! Be it from the receptionist, counselors or my professor. I am excited each time I come thru those doors!"
College Junior,4,"The Financial Aid process was a hassel at first. I was selected for Verification and had to dig up my 2010 tax return,but that is expected as is with any process that includes alot of paperwork. I had to make several trip to student services at the school. All of this didn't matter once i started my first class on October 3,2011. I absolutely love it. It was well worth the wait. I can see light at the end of the tunnel. Im learning a lot and I will be receiving an Associate degree in less than 2 years, Yay me!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Day and Night Classes for Flexable Schedules â€“ Mostly, my school consists of working-class people with full-time jobs or families. They often juggle many different roles in addition to being students. While they are happy to socialize and make friends, this is not a priority. They are getting an education so they can seek a different life or career."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Don't Get the Maintenance Loans! The school is great, the classes are small, the instructors are very educated and experienced in the subjects the teach, and the work they assign is chaellenging. I loved it, BUT, they do cost a little more than a community college and they allow you to get what they call ""maintenance loans"" which is the left over money from the student loans. This is a good thing and a bad thing. If you aren't careful you will get yourself in MAJOR DEPT. Plus Not all the credits transfer. I looked into transferring into a community college for my bachelor's and they told me I'd basicly have to start over. But the school is widely excepted by employers and is worth it if you don't mind paying a little more. By the way, get your school books USED from elsewhere!!!"
College Junior,4,There are alot of different cultures at National and I believe it is a great learning expiernce for the students and the teachers.  You get to interact with so many different races and religons
College Junior,4,"Great resources with student tutors that are paid!  One on one time with teachers, the director is always avaiable and interested in whats going on"
Freshman,2,"Some classes where fun but the overall experience is not worth it.Once I was approved and they got my student loan, they instantly stopped contacting me. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here. First of all, once they get all of their tuition out of your loans, the remaining amount they keep. Makes no sense , and that is legally stealing because those funds aren't returned to the government or you. But you still have to pay it back with interest. This school is highly unethical and shouldn't even be open. I wish I would have did more research but I am $11,000 worth of debt because of it. Please don't go to this college."
Senior,2,"After finishing classes in April and even before graduation I have been told countless times by employers that they do not recognize the credits from this school. The city of Tulsa which is where I moved to try to find work even went as far as to say that I would not qualify for any city jobs. 

The actual teachers were good and knew their subjects though often times they would have to do last minute reading to make sure they knew what they were teaching. 

My issue is with administration though I am sure they will pass the blame on the students just like the previous one.

In general You would be better off spending the money on a house for a better return on investment. There is a high probability that you will end up in a low wage position after graduating. I obtained 2 different degrees from this school. It will likely not exist in a few years due to its dependence on national accreditation over regional"
College Sophomore,2,I am a single mom with 3 children I just feel like I should get more financial aid then what am getting
Freshman,1,"Once I was approved and they got my student loan, they instantly stopped contacting me. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here. First of all, once they get all of their tuition out of your loans, the remaining amount they keep.

This school is highly unethical and shouldn't even be open. I wish I would have did more research but I am $11,000 worth of debt because of it. Please don't go to this college."
Sophomore,1,"I am three years into a two year degree and over $30,000 in debt in student loans and they refuse to give me a teacher for my very last class I need to graduate after I've already tried their online class twice and failed it. So it's obvious I don't ""want"" the teacher but I actually, literally ""NEED"" that teacher to graduate and be done, so that I can continue on with my life and not have to worry everyday how I'm going to pay off $30,000 without any degree because I didn't have that kind of money before I signed up and I sure don't have it now, despite what these corporate people think. And also while I attended I was harassed by a computer teacher there because I was the only male student in the class, so bad to the point that I had to leave the classroom and my grade suffered in that class because of it. I got news for you ANU, my rights don't deminish just because I'm on your campus, I came there to learn, not be bullied by someone who has authority over me and my grade."

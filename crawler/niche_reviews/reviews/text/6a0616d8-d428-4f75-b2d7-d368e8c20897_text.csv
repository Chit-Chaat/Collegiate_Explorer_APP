Freshman,5,"The online experience was well planned and well put together. I was able to learn stuff and focus normally like I would in an in-person class setting. We used different platforms to host our grades, assignments, classes, events, and meetings. This was a 10/10 experience."
Freshman,5,"At Benedict College, you can meet individuals from all walks of life. It is an HBCU community that feels like you're with family. It is fun interactive and safe.  BC YOU KNOW!"
Freshman,5,what I liked about benedict is all the staff and professor are always their when you need to ask question or you need to know information on certain assignments or activities on campus. Benedict also make sure that we are safe do to the pandemic that is happening. I would want nothing to change Benedict is make sure everyone is staying safe
Freshman,5,going to Benedict some of the on campus students like so be in class or some would be on zoom. Our professor make she that our learning is not affected by online classes. they are really concerning
Alum,5,Teachers worked with me and showed that they cared.  They would have office hours that they would work one on one with you if you needed help.
Junior,5,Yes I took online class the professors have great communication skills when it came down to emails and video chats. They always ask if we need help understanding something.
Junior,5,Amazing love this college to death I’m a junior and I wouldn’t change my decision on going to any other college but my favorite HBCU BENEDICT. Go tigers !!!

Niche User,5,"I am currently attending benedict college for the fall 2020 term. I haven't been to the school yet but from other students who are there, they said everything is great and they recommend anybody to the school. The only thing I want them to change is the admissions office. They move very slow."
Sophomore,5,Benedict College is a good college they have some cons but overall it’s still a good school to me. This is my second year attending Benedict and it is going pretty good. I am a Biology major and my class ca be a little challenging but I manage to make it through them. Once I graduate in 2022 I plan on finding a job that I’m qualified for. I want to be a physical therapist assistant because I always had the comfort to help make someone feel much better then they did before. This is a career where I can connect with patients and help them make a change in their life. It is so important for me to graduate and become a Physical Therapist Assistant so all my plans and goals can be achieved.
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that Benedict is a small school, it has a family  like  atmospher. The staff genuinely care about the students and take a vested interest  in our success.
The only thing I would change is the curfew hours and the rules about male/female door visitations"
Senior,5,I went to Benedict during the college tour and the campus is beautiful. They even have the program that can benefit you on what career and internships you desire to follow. I like it very quiet and not noise in the city.

Junior,5,"My overall experience at Benedict College has been nothing but great. The learning environment is amazing and the professors are extremely helpful. Going back to school I was able to conquer a lot of what I feared in the past. My educational concerns I don't doubt anymore, thanks to the professors and the staff at Benedict. I always wondered how it would feel to be able to go to school and love it instead of dreading each day, and here at Benedict, I'm experiencing the joys of being in school and loving it."
Freshman,5,I love being at Benedict. The campus is amazing. Reminds me very much of living at the high school I graduated from.

Since the day I applied, I've been getting nothing but great assistance from the admissions office to the financial office. It has been very welcoming going to Benedict. I wouldn't choose any other school! I'm a proud HBCU student and soon to be alumni, if it's in Gods Will."
College Sophomore,5,It wasn't much of a change from high school but either way I felt like I was home. I had a lot of support when it came down to getting through my classes and helping others maintain theirs.
College Sophomore,5,As long as you do everything early your will not have any issues when it come down to your finicial
College Sophomore,5,Benedict has added a new cafe. There is great variety now.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a student with my own laptop and iPad so everything is good, but the wifi here on campus here is horrible."
College Sophomore,5,"Financial Aid at my school is the worse to most students, but since I applied early and all of my documents were in before I enroll for the semester everything goes perfect."

College Freshman,5,no student is treated differently we are all a part of the Benedict Family
College Freshman,5,Safety is a must here
College Freshman,5,"Benedict is located around many restaurants and fast food establishments. We have 2 Chinese food places, Church's Chicken, KFC, Subway, and a grill post within walking distance! If you're feeling fancy, you can go down to Five Points, where there are like 10 million bars, clubs, and restaurants for endless food and fun."
College Freshman,5,"I'm from Ohio, so the South Carolina weather is the best! It's always warm, and sunny. The only bad thing is that when it rains, it rains for more than one day at a time. The summer that just passed, it rained for 19 days straight!"
College Sophomore,5,"Resturants& clothing stores are in walking distance from the school, as well as grocery stores as well as stores such as office depot and radio shack."
College Senior,5,"I'm in Accounting, the communication skills has exceptional work ethnics that I will need in this field are awesome, it help me with organized and how to .managed my work"
College Freshman,5,The process of getting into my Psychology major was very easy. I didn't have to do anything extra such as essays or a difficult application.
College Freshman,5,They are here to help with whatever you need no matter how sick you are and what cold you might have they have the cure for you
College Freshman,5,"As a psychology major, I would love to work with kids who have been abused or come from abandon homes. Even though interns are unpaid i look at it as a blessing because I am helping someone else with their problems.My goal is to touch at least one child then I will know my job is done"
College Sophomore,5,"Freshman Institute – Last year was the first year for Benedict College to have the Freshman Institute Academy. My class was the first class to experience the Freshman Institute Academy. The freshman institute Academy shows  The ""college-appropriate"" behaviors that the Benedict College Freshman Institute identifies are associated with effort, which is a major component in the College's Success Equals Effort Grading Policy."
College Senior,5,Education Teacher – the teacher work with you one on one to help you to understand the work. they wont let you fail unless you choose to fail and dont take there offer. they would remain helping you from freshmen year to senior years
College Senior,5,Bc Police – bc people dont play when it come to drugs. they are very strict with it. they have student police. those are police officer who walk around campus and ack like they are a student
College Senior,5,"Five Point – i gave it a+ because it is walking distince from the school. it have lot of bar, and club that college student would like. different college student  come down there a mingle, meet new people. they are food places that student can go to and enjoy a nice meal after the are done partying"
College Sophomore,5,Parties at Beneditc are really amazing. Everytime I go out with my friends we always have a good time.
Sophomore,4,Benedict college was a very supportive and professional environment to learn in. I would like to see more variety of food choices other than that I think everything was great.
Sophomore,4,"I loved my first year experience at Benedict. This college has a family environment, the professors are most of the time kind and easy to talk to and want to see you succeed. Also, the class sizes aren't so big, so learning is easier. The down side of Benedict is the cafe. Some days the food is really good, other days its really terrible. Also, the dorms could really use enhancements. Other than that I highly recommend this college. I wouldn't trade my experience here for the world."
Alum,4,"My experience at Benedict college was a great teaching factor for the real world.  I honestly can say going to college helped me grow up gradually with like a push in the back to grow. I am grateful for Benedict college because I was able to leave what was familiar to me and Benedict was my new home and I had to figure it out on my own. Campus life, in my opinion, can make or break someone. If one does not put the effort into making flawless actions and decisions, then problems will always arise because every corner was not checked, every ""T"" was not crossed, and every ""I"" was not marked with its dot."
Freshman,4,"Benedict College is a home away from home. I feel accepted here at this campus. The only let down for me is there is not a lot of activities on campus, so you have to come out-of-pocket for a lot of activities."
Junior,4,I like that it's very diverse and the programs you get in are very helpful. I would change the food plan and wifi plan.
Niche User,4,"As a parent whose son went there for 4 years  and is graduating ON TIME  I can say my overall experience has been satisfactory. Still, there are are some underlining problems that BC needs to improve... hopefully they’ll work on it.  I did noticed that they started doing a better job communicating with parents  thru social media this last school year and they seem to welcome parents  advice. 🤫  Management and staff are excellent and they address parents concerns immediately... Dealing with parents can be difficult and they prefer the students handle their business but they will help you respectfully 😬.  Thx Benedict College  for showing my child the way❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.  He did we did and HE IS DONE 🙏🏾 💂🏾‍♀️👨🏾‍🎓🥳😁."
Junior,4,My experience at Benedict College is very different from what I thought it would be. My freshman year was my first time out of the state I live in more than 2 weeks and away from my parents I thought my experience would be bad and I would want to move back home but I have had a great time. There are no changes I want to see at Benedict College that they are not already making on their own.
Freshman,4,Its a small campus and vert family oriented. I've met some great people here. The professors and staff help you when you need it. There are always opportunities to get involved with the campus and within the community.
Niche User,4,"My experience has been good! I have 2 sons who attended Benedict College. My oldest son graduated a few years ago after graduation he move back to Atlanta in currently working a great job! My other son transferred from Alabama A&M which was a bad experience after coming to Benedict his college experience has been a positive one. Staff support is great, dorm life could improve but I think that’s all college dorms. The police department has been very visible as a parent my two sons have had a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Benedict so far is good but i would change many things to make it better. The dorms are livable but for someone who is used to having there own room it would be an adjustment and that comes with college, however when you share a room with one person and a bathroom with a whole hallway its different. There should be more then one bathroom on the hall for each floor and it should be clean. The school also has classrooms that sometimes have no desks or not enough chairs for students, some of the professors have to bring there own markers and computers to class and that makes starting class hard for them and takes away from our learning. The school is good overall but it could be better if they just do a little work to improve it"
Junior,4,"I've had, overall a fairly good experience at Benedict College. Nothing is perfect and with that respect in mind. I have no complaints. Particularly with respect to professor, some good, a maybe one or two not so good. Housing is the same, but in the respect of my actual boarding experience; it's a pretty old school some issues have been resolve but for the most part, and as a whole; this would be one of my only complaints. They need to renovate and that's the bottom line. As far as the Cafe, much upgrades are needed as far as the different or lack of steady choice to choose from need to exist and on a daily consistent basis."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Benedict College is overall pleasing to me in my opinion. i met a lot of people, and enjoyed their vibe. I'm apart of an organization called the Benedict College Band of Distinction. I'm a dancer of Sweet Sensation, and without my band brothers and sisters my experience in college wouldn't be as relaxing at it is right now."
Freshman,4,"I love my Benedict experience so far. As a freshman, I’ve learned that’s everyone puts their work before partying! It’s great . Everyone comes together when and help who ever in need of something ."
Junior,4,I transferred here from Francis Marion University and I personally think the professors here care more about their students. Which makes me love it here.
Junior,4,"Benedict College has been very challenging but an overall great college. It has a lot of activities that you can get involve with. I like the peace and quiet, they serve good food. One thing I would like to change is getting our refund checks on time and use their money wisely when it comes to our refunds."
Senior,4,Benedict College has improved and will continue to do that with the new president we've received. Don't be ready to ignore an HBCU like BC because of past experiences from others or rumors. Benedict has potential.
Freshman,4,One thing about Benedict College that I like is that they have such an amazing educational department .
Sophomore,4,"Applying to Benedict College is definitely one of the best decisions that I have made in my life. It is a place that I hold dear to my heart. There is so much that Benedict has to offer and it is almost impossible for anyone to not find their own niche there. The professors are all about the success of the students and would stop at nothing to get them where they need to be and where they want to go. If you are looking for a diverse, exquisite, phenomenal campus then this is your stop."
Sophomore,4,"Benedict College has theirs flaws that has to be worked out but that is any college no college is perfect. The professors care about the students very much to the point where they will work overtime to ensure that the student mastered the content and is on certain rigor on that subject. The food is not the best and the people can get out of hand. But this a HBCU(historically black college and university) and people of all race are welcomed to this historic place. What can change is the food condition's, living conditions, and the  way staff handles such situations."
Junior,4,"After three years of attending Benedict College, what I love most about it is, the small class sizes. That gives students more hands on learning and, more one on one time with the professors. What I would like to see change, more varieties of majors, and more things to be involved in and with on campus."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see a change in choices of food and dorms. Also, Benedict College is an experience it's self because going to college is a big responsibility for yourself especially being a freshman and living on campus."
Freshman,4,I like that is all majority black school and that it's always someone helping and events going on to keep the students focus from all the distractions in the world 
Niche User,4,"I haven't been there yet, but come next fall I will be, but so far from what others haven been telling me its a pretty good college. Its a HBCU and i love HBCU's. "
College Sophomore,4,It will be easy to make your career after leaving here
College Senior,4,they work with you to get you to where you need to be
College Sophomore,4,They really support their college and recruit as many students at their best.
College Sophomore,4,I feel we have the best security. They are always there when you need them.
College Sophomore,4,I am really enjoying the campus life. Met friends and the rooms had a lot space. It does seem like the cost of tuition is going up.
College Sophomore,4,Since I have been attending Benedict College it rally have been challenging. I have learned how to be independent and responsibility. Also they will make provisions for you to be able to afford their college. If I had to choose any school this college would actually be my first choice. I really enjoy attending this college.
College Sophomore,4,I LOVE MY hBCu !!!!!!!
College Sophomore,4,A lot of different opportunities !
College Sophomore,4,"Love the officers , except for a few ..."
College Sophomore,4,"Benedict is the kind of school where, it may not be perfect, but if you find the right people to hang with it will make your experience a lot better. The classes are easy, and the professors are amazing also. Always surround yourself with positive. When you first get to Benedict you may not like it, but once classes start and all the activities start, you're going to learn to fall in love with it. I know for a fact that I love my hBCu !! BC ! BC ! YOU KNOW ! YOU KNOW ! #BC18"
College Freshman,4,Police are always on time and riding around.
College Sophomore,4,"My University can get very challenging at times. There are some teahers that would be happy to help you succeed and pass, while some wouldn't mind seeing you fail. Overall, I learned how to manage my time wisely,improve my study habits, and overcome a lot of obstacles that got in my way."
College Senior,4,I respect the academics at this school.
College Senior,4,The classes are small and some of the teachers are great.
College Freshman,4,The career there is great.
College Freshman,4,They look out for their own.
College Sophomore,4,its what i expected it really feels like  high school all over again just in a different state and you dont have to go home
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy seeing them around campus doing there steps and dances and there outfits always catch my attention
College Sophomore,4,I like it cause it's where are the students can get to know each other and they also have a shuttle to get you there
College Freshman,4,The athletes have a lot of support.
College Freshman,4,The dorm staff are very strict they all Abide by the rules.
College Freshman,4,We have an excellent variety of food and the cafe area is very nice and clean.
College Junior,4,"Benedict is very diverse and continues to grow each year. There are many organizations that help connect to ethnic, religious, and other backgrounds."
College Junior,4,"On campus there are many opportunities for students to get involved. However, it is truly up to the students to be active and make a difference on campus."
College Sophomore,4,It is good to have rules.
College Sophomore,4,Any environment can have issues with drugs. But you have to choose to not allow that to be apart of your life.
College Sophomore,4,Program I was interested in was available.
College Freshman,4,I am an athlete here and I believe that the athletic programs here are great. There is also a lot of school pride and support from students and falculty.
College Freshman,4,"As far as my major, my biology teacher has taught us plenty of things that can benefit us in the long run. He incorporates a lot of hands ons things."
College Freshman,4,We have school spirit gathering but nothing out of control
College Freshman,4,leaving trash laying about the campus is strict. We try to keep a clean enviroment
College Freshman,4,our football and basketball teams are great
College Freshman,4,I'm looking forward to playing sports. 
College Freshman,4,My college experience here has been great other than the girls looking at you every where you go but I still love it .
College Junior,4,The transportation is great here. Everything that you need access to it either on the bus line or within walking distance. The bus fair is very reasonable
College Sophomore,4,Safety is great so is health 
College Sophomore,4,It's really fun! You just have to know the right places to go to!
Junior,2,"Benedict is an okay college however, the dorm and food needs to improve honestly. I feel like some people there act like they’re still in high school and wanna act immature. The professors are understanding and will work with you."
College Sophomore,2,We should have more options and we should have been able to use our flex dollars all year and should be able to use it at near by restaurants
College Freshman,2,I got very little financial aid help so my mom took out a parent plus loan of 9000 dollars for me to attend school.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have the best facilities. They are decent, but I'm sure they will be improved soon. I would love to see green houses on and around campus, but our Environmental Health/Science program needs to be expanded in growth and advancement towards being effective. We need a student center and more student hangout spots along with more five diverse cultural settings and activities."
College Freshman,2,We were undergoing renovations therefore we didn't have a variety of options. We are given the same things and unhealthy food choices. This results in students gaining weight and sicknesses.
College Sophomore,2,The classes is not satisfying me and I am honestly just expecting more.The classes do not really match up with my major. If i could go back i would want to have $50 to send off my application to get into the college i wanted to go to instead of being somewhere I do not enjoy spending my college time at. I just hope and pray I have the money to pay off my balances to send my transcripts so i can get accepted into the college in the spring semester I've always wanted to go to.
College Sophomore,2,i do not recall becuase i have not done an internship
College Sophomore,2,People on campus often abuse drugs in just about everywhere on campus. Their is no telling when you'll walk into a group of people smoking and people on campus are scared to speak up about the drugs being abused commonly.
College Sophomore,2,"The food services at Benedict College is horrible,  they may have good days but overall I don't like it, however, the campus living areas are like any other college, the freshman dorms suck, but as you matriculate it gets better!"
College Sophomore,2,There are only two or three options. The prices are okay.
College Senior,2,average in some buildings and extremely hot in others.
College Sophomore,2,"You never know. sometimes it says Hot den it rains. But when its HOT , ITS HOT . You Do Have Nice Days. You Could just go out and enjoy the green grass. But don't count on it to look like that all the time. It Gets Really cold in the winter and it always rains."
College Freshman,2,Benedict doesn't have Greek life that i am aware of
College Freshman,2,"On campus house can be nuetral depending on which dorm you stay in. However, there are 4 freshmen dorms on campus and 3 upperclassmen dorms. On campus honor dorms and athletic dorms are the best as a freshmen. Off campus dorms are even better."
College Freshman,2,"This is a private school. This school is very religious but has a lot of homosexuals, which some would believe goes against god. A lot of people are actually out here trying their all to get what they need but most of the people here are here to party,impress, and meet new people. People dress different being they are from different parts of the world but if you do not dress some way type of the same they will judge you."
College Freshman,2,The school is good for getting a basic understanding of education and college. The school cafeteria food is the same everyday and usually not fully cooked. Also They never have enough room or do they have appropriate drinks. The teachers are hard to understand but the try their best. The school is unorganized.
College Freshman,2,they give great scholarships but the food is horrible and theres not much to do unless you have a car to go somewhere else
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall receives this grade because you have to wait in line an hour and half during dinner time just to get something to eat and it isn't quite tasty. There's no order when it comes to lines and people just cut people and there's not always proper sanitation with the employees serving the food.
College Sophomore,2,The computer use is very limited due to off campus students being in the computer labs a lot to kill time in between classes. I advise students to have their own computers.
College Freshman,2,"There are only two computer labs available to everyone.    Some dorms have their own computer labs.  The one in the library fills up quickly and the printer never works.  The other computer have a little more computers but not all of them work.  Printing on campus is free, but on a regular there is only one printer that works consistently.  The speed pf the internet is not bad when you are connected.  The WiFi is off and on.  It connectivity is not to well.  When trying to watch videos or video chat, the internet is quick to go out.  Need for a personal lap top and printer is highly recommended."
Alum,1,I did not attend any online courses. They do need more online options. They did not offer any while I was a student.
Sophomore,1,"The campus, dorms, and food could be so much better. The new president is currently working on these changes."
College Freshman,1,This the main thing I am very displeased about.The rooms are too small.Bathrooms are always nasty.AC doesn't work and its very hot.And it just needs a overall remodel.And i dnt feel that we should be forced to room with anybody if don't want to personally.
College Senior,1,There is no party scene everyone has curfew
College Freshman,1,Its so bad I can't explain
College Junior,1,We pay all this money for housing but can't even have stoves
College Junior,1,Benedict College is very selfish we pay so much money and can't see where the money is going to.
College Senior,1,One of the highest rated schools in South Carolina with HIV.
College Senior,1,The housing is very poorly maintained.
College Sophomore,1,"Its a big city, but nothing to really offer if your under age"
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police is beyond horrible, its not way they are always driving around crimes happen right there by their station. Also, there isn't opposite sex visitation not even in the co-ed dorms."
College Freshman,1,"I swear everything that you do at Benedict will get you a fine! We have a freaking dress code, it's like high school all over again. Tuition is too high for them to be telling us what to wear! We can't have people of the opposite sex visit our rooms, if they're caught, they each have to pay 75 dollars. "
College Sophomore,1,it was expecting a little more for my major
College Sophomore,1,Ok I Guess – i didnt really see much to choose from
College Senior,1,"I think it is a bit cliche that just because we go to an HBCU that we all like chicken. The only stores around Benedict College are; Kfc, churches chicken, two Chinese stores and subway! I prefer more variety. However the cost is very good so I think that is the reason we do not receive student discounts."
College Senior,1,Drugs on any campus is a major issue at any college.  I believe that's something we could definitely change with enough students that gets involved
College Sophomore,1,"The computers at Benedict College aren't up to date, software is out if date. There is only one available printer in the library that is open to students; there is always an ""out of order sign on the printer because it is old, therefore students miss deadlines often. The wireless access strength is very poor in the dorms and from time to time it is out of order. Therefore the need for a personal computer and printer is definitely necessary!"
College Senior,1,"The food sucks, not very good, nor nutristionst for the students.  Not at food safety standards."
College Sophomore,1,Drugs dealers and users are everywhere. One probably will be your roommate.
College Sophomore,1,It is very unsafe on campus and off campus. The school is full of drug dealers. The area surrounding the school contains nothing but gangs and violence.
College Senior,1,the shuttles are very old they suppose to arrive every hour but they arrive when they want and stop at random places on the way to our destination.
College Senior,1,all the sports suck except basketball and softball/baseball.
College Freshman,1,"I would give the Greek life at Benedict an F mainly because they do not promote much Greek life on campus. As i walk around I hardly notice any, and as policy here you may not pledge as a freshman. With this rule it really made me not want to pledge any more."
College Sophomore,1,"The environment at Benedict is very urban and there's not much to do around the campus. In order to really have clean and proper fun you have to go to Augusta, GA or Charlotte, NC."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in the words of students at Benedict, is bipolar. It can be raining one minute, and hot the next. And Winter does not get that cold. I believe South Carolina weather is the same everywhere, not just Columbia where Benedict is located."
College Freshman,1,"The bathrooms/showers get cleaned everyday, and theres no opposite sex visitation unless u want a $75 fine, and the room to microwave things closes at midnight. Cant have microwaves or refrigerators in rooms"
College Freshman,1,"We was on the news for health code violations, they reheat the same food, and they been building us a new cafe for forever"
College Sophomore,1,My school is located in a high crime rate neighbor hood. Oak street dorm is located across the street from the projects apartments. That is very dangerous because students have to walk back and forth to their dorm and drug users hang around in the area. Benedict also have off campus apartments that are located in high crime rate areas.
College Sophomore,1,"Do Better – To be honest the dining at Benedict college sucks, maybe its because their building a new cafe and so we can only eat the food that the cooks make which means no Chick Fil A, Burger King, Starbucks, etc or maybe its because they serve the same thing almost everyday so theres really no variety but on the bright side there are plenty of fast food places down the street from the school to eat at."
College Freshman,1,There is not alot of different ethnic people. I really want to experience that in college because its new and interesting to meet new people and explore while you are attending college.
College Sophomore,1,Out dated – The campus here needs to be updated. The only part of the campus that is kept nice is the front entrance and the walkway threw the yad to the cafe.... THAT'S ALL (the students there ruin every peice of property they can get their hands on) Not to mention the library windows.
College Junior,1,"Dinning Service – It is below average due to the service we received, and the choices of foods. Also the environment inside is average without proper cleaning. Attitude of the service ladies is horrible."
College Freshman,1,Too Much Change – The weather changes completely too much. One minutes it's freezing than the next it's sunny and warm. The change in weather makes alot of people on campus sick.
College Sophomore,1,We Have the Same Thing Everyday – we have the same thing everyday to eat and thats not good at all.
College Freshman,1,"My School – The college campus is horrible to be honest, the athletic center is very small, we do not even have a student center. Our library is average i have to say but it could be better. The last thing is student activities our student activities are fun but most of time we do not have them because people fight i would give this college an overall 45"
College Junior,1,THE CAMPUS FOOD AT BENEDICT COLLEGE IS NASTY. THERE IS ONLY ONE CAFE AND THEY SERVE THE SAME FOOD MOST OF THE TIME. THE ONLY TIME U CAN CATCH A REALLY GOOD MEAL IS ON A HOLIDAY OR AT THE BEGIN OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.
College Senior,1,"The computers, are horrible. There is not enough computer labs, and it is long lines to try and get to print. Then the printer does not work most of the time. So you have to go around school and find a printer, and they all don't work. if you do not have a printer in your dorm room, you cannot print!"
College Junior,1,Registration Process – The registration process is not only hectic but a stressful experience.Every year it's the same thing long line and a lot of disorganization. Every year I dread registration and at times that i have to mentally prepare myself for the headache that I know is coming

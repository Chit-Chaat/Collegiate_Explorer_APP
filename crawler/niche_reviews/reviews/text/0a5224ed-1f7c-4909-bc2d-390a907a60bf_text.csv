Sophomore,5,"I started at Northwest Indian College a year after high school just for a transfer degree but was unable to complete that degree due to extenuating life circumstances, so when I decided to return last summer the teachers and advisers made the transition very easy. I love that Northwest Indian College is on my home reservation and it gives me the opportunity to meet people from other tribes around the U.S, since returning I've been getting involved in many clubs and organizations and it's given me numerous opportunities to travel to different conferences and learn more life skills. I love the place based curricula they have in place and the online and V.C.H classes make it easy to still go to class while working and taking care of a family. I would recommend Northwest Indian College to all my friends and who ever is interested in a Tribal College, to network with other Native Americans."
Freshman,5,"It was a nice experience, although I only attended for a quarter. During my quarter there it was really nice to be able to ease my way into my classes. I met other Native students, and I was able to connect with other people who have heard about our local tribes and it was just overall an amazing experience."
Junior,5,"I have attended Northwest Indian College since 2016 and have had great experiences with the classrooms, teachers, and staff.  This college is great for online classes and offers Video Conference courses where you can use your  phone, laptop, or device with a camera to connect to the classroom.  Having the ability to be at home, work, or a coffee shop and also be in class is an amazing utilization of technology and the future of school.  I have been studying Tribal Governance and Business Management, which is a Bachelor's Degree, and I will graduate in 2020.  The TGBM program is unique and geared towards individuals interested in doing business with or inside tribal governments.  I would definitely recommend Northwest Indian College as each class also involves culturally relevant materials geared towards the Native American communities and individual students tribal affiliations."

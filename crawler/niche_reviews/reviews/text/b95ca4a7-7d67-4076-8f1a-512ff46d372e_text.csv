Niche User,5,I liked how the school reached out to me through various emails and letters in the mail. I also appreciated how encouraging they were and it truly felt like they wanted me on campus for sure.
Sophomore,5,Very strong Architecture Department with amazing professors and opportunities. Very small class sizes and lots of individual attention from professors. Dorms are terrible and its much cheaper to live off campus.
Niche User,5,"As soon as I stepped on CCA's campus my junior year of high school, I knew that I belonged there. The beautiful campus was breathetaking, and my mind went wild with all the creative opportunities that I could achieve. The classrooms and work stations were an artist's dream come true. It was like everything I was looking for in a school in my mind had come to life right here in San Francisco. I loved the great location, and the campus has great security so I felt like I woyld always be safe."
Freshman,5,"I love it so far. Some really cool people and professors. Right now, I'm living in oakland at Clifton Hall, which is kinda nice and convenient. There's no excuse to miss class since it's right next to the campus. What's sad though is that the oakland campus is moving it all to SF in 2 years & housing will all be in SF by next year. I hear the new dorms they're building are really nice, but it will bump up the cost for housing so make sure you can afford it."
Graduate Student,5,"CCA has been great- I highly recommend the MFA in Comics program! It's a low residency program where students are on campus in San Francisco for the month of July and can complete their other coursework online throughout the year. We are working on storytelling, drawing and inking skills, digital coloring, and comics history. Additionally, every student has a faculty mentor who works with them on their thesis assignments."
Senior,5,"Very fun, very diverse, very DIY social scene. A mix of very driven profession-minded students and those that integrate fun and play into their work."
Junior,5,"I would not like to see anything change with California College of the Arts. This college has helped me with my technical skills, diversity in information and knowledge, and I love the teachers and people willing to help me in case I ever feel lost or stuck."
Sophomore,5,amazing people from all over the world. everyone is creative in their own way. the biggest downside about this school is that it doesnt have any athletics whatsoever. a gym should be the least i'd ask for.
Niche User,5,"I attended for the CCA Pre-college program and would highly recommend it to other young people who are looking to find out if art school is right for them. The program was costly but I came out with a scholarship and invaluable knowledge gained. CCA is also a non-profit, so that makes it easier to pay the huge fee for an art education. Overall, highly recommend this school."
College Junior,5,"Graphic design at CCA is a great community of teachers, students, and alumni. I will be looking for internships for next summer this year, and I am not too worried about finding one."
College Junior,5,We don't have any athletics because we are an art school and I am totally happy with that.
College Senior,5,"I think the future prospects from the degree are amazing, they are the light at the end of my financial struggle that keeps me fighting, no matter how many sacrifices I have to make or my zombie life of living in a constant state of pure exhaustion."
College Freshman,5,No one uses drugs on campus without getting caught and reprimanded.
College Freshman,5,"As an art college, it brings together students of a vast variety of cultural and ethnical backgrounds, which is great because I've met so many people from so many different places, which has broadened my mind."
College Freshman,5,"The first year program has a variety of classes students can take to decide on their majors, including teaching them skills in drawing, model making and CAD. The two main highlights I've had of the first year program was acquiring new skills in drawing and video editing, which are two areas am now interested in exploring further."
College Freshman,5,"There are lots of career opportunities for Interaction Designers, especially in San Francisco. In fact, as a part of our degree we are required to take an internship in the 3rd year, which will give students practical experience, and the projects help students build a portfolio. Adding on the open ended nature of Interaction Design, I would say my career prospects look pretty good at this point."
College Senior,5,We have great professors from famous design firms. We also work with real clients sometimes. I really like the industrial design program here.
College Senior,5,I enjoy it a lot. It's not a big community but we can learn a lot from various sources.
College Senior,5,We seriously have a very big diversity. People don't judge. LGBT is super accepted.
College Sophomore,5,"Nearly everyone gets some form of financial aid, and their financial aid staff are all friendly and helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"Highly trained professors who are working in their field with lots of experience and loads of creativity. The curriculum is structured in ascending order of difficulty, with the fundamentals stressed heavily in the beginning, before allowing a lot more free rein. Its a good system for the creative mind."
College Sophomore,5,"Its really a mixed bunch of folks. Everyone is welcome here, and if someone is racist or bigoted or discriminatory in any way, they will not find a home here. Its very open minded, free spririted, and highly diverse, with people from all over the world, all over the country, all races. Its pretty great. The gay population is also highly welcome and integrated into the school's diversity studies programs."
College Sophomore,5,"Its actually really good weather if you like the mildly cool type. 60s, with play between cloud coverage and sunshine. If you prefer warm weather, you will need to invest in warmer clothes, but it actually makes for good study environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Art school in general is very diverse, but combined with the fact that CCA is in San Francisco, this is one of the most diverse and accepting schools I have seen."
College Sophomore,5,"San Francisco weather generally stays in the 50's-60's year-round. It is amazing, but make sure to bring layers."
College Sophomore,5,"Academics are not only challenging, they're also extremely interesting. CCA provides classes such as Re-reading Harry Potter and Bad Science in the Movies, two of which I can't wait to take."
College Sophomore,5,"Applying to CCA was very easy for me. The biggest challenge I encountered was deciding which pieces of artwork to include in my portfolio, but that worked out extremely well. One benefit of applying here was that every student is automatically considered for a merit scholarship based on their work, and most usually receive additional aid."
College Sophomore,5,My favorite aspect about the Graphic Design program at CCA is the fact that we are designing real products such as books and record packaging that give us an idea of what designing in the real world will be like.
College Sophomore,5,"San Francisco is a vibrant city that I love to get lost in. CCA is very close to the Mission and Dolores Park along with many amazing restaurants and local sites. Cultural events are always going on whether you find them in the Mission or Chinatown, and shopping is top notch at Union Square. One of the largest demographics in San Francisco is twenty-soemthings who work and/or are in school, so the attitude toward students couldn't be better."
College Freshman,5,"The campus is a 20 minute walk away from Berkeley campus and theres always something to do there. Also, the campus is a 10 minute walk from the BART station and from there is a 20 min ride to the Powel Bart station that's right next to the mall."
College Freshman,5,"There are so many people from all over the world with different religions, beliefs, cultures and personal backgrounds. There are no two alike people at this school. Everyone is very unique and different in their own way and everyone is very accepting for other's life choices."
College Junior,5,The workload relates to the workload that may be used in the professional realm. Teachers try to teach students to work in the industry.
College Junior,5,Workload is helpful. The teachers have experience and teach very well.
College Junior,5,"So far, I love my program. The teachers are very kind and very helpful."
College Senior,5,Attending CCA has been a life changing experience for me and I would not choose any other school to finish my undergrad at.
College Sophomore,5,"Being an animation major at cca is AMAZING. The faculty that you work with are artist who still work in the industry or have a lot of experience working in it.  You meet these great teachers that come from Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks, and Warner Brothers, so it's good that you make some connections with the teachers as well as fellow students. Being only minutes away from Pixar headquarters, there are always internships available to us. The equipment that we use is that same hardware and software used by professionals in the field. The program is built to create not just an animator, but character designers,sound techs, gaming animators, riggers, and all parts of animation into one person. It allows to you tests your strengths and weaknesses so you know what to build in your portfolio later on. Our stop motion lab is pretty great as well as our own sound booth."
College Sophomore,5,"The facilities at cca are AWESOME! It's like a giant playground for artists. There's all sorts of equipment you can play with and they're genuinely state of the art machines and computers. The computer labs are pretty awesome too, with duo boot systems and great display. What's even more awesome is that you have access to all department equipment as long as you take a class that pertains to it or know someone who can give you access to it. The dorms are alright at cca,for the space that we pay for, it's pretty steep."
College Junior,5,"California College of the Arts is located in beautiful San Francisco!  The local atmosphere is out of this world!  Many tourist attractions to visit and museums.  Lots of festivals, street fairs, farmers markets, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and parks located in the city. There are many great restaurants in the surrounding cities like Berkley and Oakland.  So much to do and see!"
College Freshman,5,"Living in Oakland is AWESOME! It is surrounded by other fun cities. It is beautiful and there is so much to do. The public transportation is really easy and convenient. San Francisco is so close! There are places to hike, parks to go to, great food, tons of events (such as Art Murmur which happens in Downtown Oakland on the first friday of every month,). Local music, poetry slams, festivals,chinatown/japan town/ little India/ little Italy, the beach, amazing hiking trails, and fun secret spots to explore (like the Albuny Bulb, a place where people go and make renegade art, graffiti  and explore. Someone made a castle!) You can see the Cal Campus clock tower from the school. Overall, the local atmosphere is very diverse. Its hard to run out of things to do."
College Freshman,5,"All of the computers at CCA are constantly being updated with the latest programs, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe Premiere, Microsoft Word, etc. They also have the option of using the Windows screen browser. The print labs are open very late (Lab A is open until 2am) and there are usually computers open even during crunch time. Most people have their own computers and having your own printer is nice but not necessary. The school puts $15 in your print account each semester and printing regular pages are pretty cheap. However, the wifi in the dorms are not very good."
College Freshman,5,i am pretty picky but we have a lot of options around and since everything is so popular its always safe to go out to eat alone cuz theirs tons of people around.
College Junior,5,"weather is very good, usually not to hot or to cold"
College Freshman,5,"I have met and befriended many people from many different countries and cultural backgrounds, including my roommate who is from South Korea. It is wonderful getting to know so many different people and cultures. I also have a very good friend who is gay, and who is comfortable at this school to show who he is. Its Wonderful!"
College Freshman,5,"I haven't even started my classes in my major yet, but I already know all of the faculty and what curriculum and classes I will be studying."
College Freshman,5,"I chose this school because it was the best for my major and the academics. The classes, and the majors, are small, so there is more one on one time with the teachers. Before starting my major, I have met all of the Fashion Design faculty, and they have helped me out with a lot."
College Junior,5,"San Francisco is amazing. There is so much to experience, you're immersed in so many different cultures and the art scene is really great, perfect for art students. I find the locals to be really friendly, its really refreshing to see that in a big city. There are many museums to go and theres always activities happening in the city. If anyone is a fan of unique cuisines theres so many different types of food you can find in SF. Downtown has all kinds of shops, many larger stores have a flagship shops so they have even more items in stock. The locals get really into sports here as well. If you're into baseball, hockey or football there's plenty of others here to share that passion with."
College Freshman,5,"You Get What You Put Into Them – The courses are very self determining.  If you want to learn the bare minimum that is possible, if you want to strive and push yourself way beyond the expectation, your professors will help you achieve your goals."
College Junior,5,There are restaurants for every kind of food you could want within 15 minutes walking.
College Sophomore,5,"High-Quality Studio Spaces and Galleries – The ceramics studio includes 30+ kilns, plus specialized equipment. Seniors are given their own private studio workspaces."
College Sophomore,5,"Love My Classes – I love all my classes! I thought I would hate a ton of them because I had never tried certain things before, but i ended up loving those classes the most! The teachers really try to figure out how to get you to think but have a fun at the same time."
College Sophomore,5,Amazing Faculty – The faculty is world renowned and incredibly specialized in what they do. Their level of expertise and ability to communicate that expertise to their students on a one on one basis is exceptional.
College Sophomore,5,A2 Cafe Is TASTY! The A2 Cafe offers a wide variety of organic meets as well as vegetarian and vegan options. It is a tasty and flavorful French inspired menu with several Vietnamese and Thai dishes as well. DELISCIOUS and GREAT PRICES!
College Sophomore,5,"Located in the design district of San Francisco, students are walking distance to major design hubs, funky restaurants and stores. Students are also about a 15 minute walk to San Francisco's Civic Center which houses the city's Ballet, Asian Art Museum and the Orchestra."
College Freshman,5,"Hard to See Them – the school only allows student and other staffs to smoke in certain area, and they have alcohol policies too, so they are good in this part."
College Junior,5,Easy to Stay Away from Drugs – I do know of students using drugs. But design students do not care as much for drugs as it seems art students do. I do not find it a problem at all to stay away from them. We hardly have people in our class that smokes.
Recent Alumnus,5,"When I transferred, I submitted a portfolio mostly of figure drawing focused towards my interests. I received a scholarship of 15,000."
College Sophomore,5,There currently aren't any Greek organizations on campus
College Senior,5,"Stellar Faculty – But the most important thing here is the faculty, which is among the best in the industry. From the practicing professionals, to the academics, these people have a strong passion for design and deep expertise."
College Student,5,There's Great People Everywhere! I love this school! There are so many people to meet and get know. It's awesome-I would highly recommend making the effort to get to know these people!
College Freshman,5,"What makes CCA unique is the fact that the college is committed to the students by giving back $13 million in college-funded scholarships and more than $34 million in combined scholarships, grants, loans, and employment. These gestures really show where the students stand in the culture of the college."
Sophomore,4,"California College of the Arts has been an amazing place to study art thus far. I have done things for art that I never imagined I would do. They will push you beyond what you know and do but it is for the best. The students are amazing and kind. It is great to be surrounded by fellow artists and to be able to bounce ideas off of one another. The professors push you and are there for you, they care about each student. The professors work in the profession that they are teaching. Overall it has been a great experience thus far. The only issue I had was with the finacial aid department they are very difficult to work with and will mess up your aid multiple times."
Niche User,4,This college is very good if you want to start an advance career in an artistic field. Here you find nice people to interact with. You can sustain a healthy life style within your dorm rooms because they have a lot of available vegan meals.
Freshman,4,"I like my experience so far. School feels very community and engaging. The one thing I would change however is money. Like many others students in other schools, I wish mine was better funded to support student grants, scholarships, those in need, etc. But also understand the investment I have made on myself."
Sophomore,4,"California College of the Arts if a school of Craft. Professors, students, and faculty are all super engaged in the curriculum of the students. I love that all of my teachers are practicing professionals and can give me insight to my field within the Bay area and around the world. I feel so inspired to be learning in San Francisco. Diverse group of students and faculty allows for making connections across the world.

The only downfall this school has is within the administration of financial aid and student housing. Communication can be really frustrating and the people that work in these departments seem to be consistently changing."
Freshman,4,"The college has two campuses, with different features and advantages. The professors are patient and skillful, and academic resources are abundant. However, the safety of campus is terrible regarding the area. There is a lot of robberies and sometimes gun shoot happens near the campus. Students need to go together off-campus and try to avoid going out at night."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year and I am an incoming freshman. I really enjoy the community – you are surrounded by creativity. I've been pushed as an artist and that challenge has made me such a stronger person, artist, and student"
Sophomore,4,"While no art school is perfect, CCA has an awesome community that I am glad to be part of. I'm an animation major and the community of artists are very tight-knit. Alumni are very supportive and many return to give events and advice on the industry. Professors at CCA are also very tightly associated with Pixar Animation Studios and it's very accessible to form connections with animators in the industry! 

I also believe that your experience here is really what you make of it. I decided to attend CCA initially because of the scholarship and financial aid that they offered me, but I stayed for the community and because the professors and animation students are very passionate and supportive of our craft. This year, I've also become involved in Student Council and am starting a CCA UNICEF club to improve outreach and promote awareness among the art community about social issues. These activities, and the people I've met through them, have really enriched my life."
Senior,4,"The admissions here at CCA can be a bit complicated but the opportunities presented to me have been great. I have had paid internships, the chance to be a teaching assistant, I have curated a show, and even get my own studio to paint in. Professors at this school are usually extremely qualified and often teach at other renowned schools such as UC Berkeley."
Sophomore,4,"from firsthand freshmen transfer experience, the California College of the Arts debatably for the worse or best places more emphasis to their programs for their students than other things such as a gym. The various instructors  in campus are a hit or miss situation meaning that some are fully experienced with their studies and others that are casual about it, nonetheless all instructors do their best to help you pass their class. Although it's highly appreciated that some instructors help students with their classroom issues, it's best to let the students figure out their issues on their own for experience. In conclusion, The school cares for its students, even if it's not shown in a way most would be familiar to or appreciate, the school does what it can do to aid its students to strive towards their careers."
Sophomore,4,"Diversifying the student body and staff inside of the college would greatly improve the community morale, and give the staff and administration more tools for working with the surrounding communities instead of a relationship that is much less that symbiotic."
Freshman,4,It's a fine school with teachers motivating students to do well. I am eager to do well here for the next 3-4 years.
Freshman,4,"The campus may be small, but it's one of the most diverse and creative colleges in the country. I recommend applying here if you are looking for an art school and want to live somewhere with decent weather."
Freshman,4,"CCA has an incredible community that invites diversity in order to create an environment where students and faculties are open to freely exchange their ideas and creativity. I found it easy to meet new people and the community was overall very welcoming. Academically, I had minor issues in regarding some programs that fail to provide broader opportunities and options following certain specific major programs but there are professors who aided me significantly through out my first year in college! There aren't any sports or athletics clubs that are offered and unfortunately the school also doesn't offer any gyms for students to access."
Senior,4,"The faculty is amazing, and the BArch program is great, but I wish interdisciplinary connections were facilitated more."
Sophomore,4,"I study an undergraduate in Animation and going into my sophomore year. Although CCA has great teachers from Pixar, the teachers don't really seem to help you unless you ask for help. There are many great resources, and you can definitely learn more than you could ask for in multiple disciplines! Lately, CCA has opened new VR classes for animation and have a new professor who is the author of Force: Dynamic Life Drawings. Individually, you WILL spend a lot of money for his classes, and with a little asking around you'll find what is worth your money. The exchange program offers you to go around anywhere in the States, but you also have the opportunity to go overseas! CCA has a lot of great programs to take you on trips, you get to improve a lot."
Freshman,4,Both Campuses are great and have really good facilities. There's a wide and interesting range of classes to take. The teachers are helpful. The houses is also pretty great.
Junior,4,"This school has allowed me to have access to so many opportunities and resources for having a higher education.  There is access to programs, and equipment that I would have never been able to even use and learn about if I had not attended."
Junior,4,"I am currently a Junior Animation major at CCA. I enjoy the oakland campus and the students who attend. While some students are competitive and cliquey, overall I think CCA has a supportive community. The only struggle so far is the difference in skill level. I had very little art skills before attending the school. While I have improved tremendously, my work is not quite on the level as most of the other students. This has proven to be a problem when working with groups and during critiques. Even though I still need practice, my work is sometimes looked down on by other students. Maybe if there are more collaborative projects as freshmen, the students can learn to not be as competitive."
Freshman,4,"CCA is a really really amazing school. It is so diverse and just being there helps your creativity flow. However it has it's major flaws. One being that they literally don't care about the living situations of their students. Honestly i'm paying almost 9,000 dollars to live in run down dorms on top of a random high school that's 3 miles away from campus. On top of that we pay so much money and it feels like we get so little back from the school."
Sophomore,4,"I a transfer student in CCA. This is my first year to be here. CCA is a great place for learn art and design, but the location and food here are not that good."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe when I am inside school, sometimes at night it is a pain to have to walk to your car where there is a bunch of homeless encampments taking over. I don't want to be bothered."
College Junior,4,I did Admin on the Spot which was great to be face to face with the person who was looking at your application.
College Junior,4,The school has open up doors for me to think differently and creatively. I am surrounded by students from around the world that all bring something to the table and I am grateful that I get a chance to learn more about other cultures too.
College Junior,4,"I am very happy with my college experience. It is very different from most colleges, but I think that is why it is so great for a lot of students."
College Junior,4,"All of the professors I have had in my major have been amazing. They expect a lot from students, but in a very supportive way. I have no doubt that the connections I have made and all of the skills I have already attained here in my first two years will land me a job. Everyone at the school is so different and creative. We may complain about the lack of computer scanners available or the computers getting jammed at the worst possible moment, but in the end we get to learn from extremely successful, working professionals in the field which is the best."
College Junior,4,"We have a great security program, there are always public safety people around and they are able to escort you where you need to go, if necessary. There is a number you can call if you need assistance or feel unsafe, as well. I haven't heard of any assault on our campuses, it's a very peaceful, progressive, and respectful campus."
College Junior,4,"I have seen a lot of really incredible alumni success stories, but you really need to make things happen for yourself, I wish there was more of a community and more clubs for students to connect."
College Junior,4,"In the animation program, it seems a lot of the professors are industry professionals who had nothing else to do. Some are really great, but my favorite teachers have been in other programs, such as illustration and film. The animation students tend to be very introverted and keep to themselves. A lot of people have friends, but a lot of people are kind of loners, especially transfer students such as myself. There are two campuses, one in San Francisco and one in Oakland, each campus has a completely different vibe. The SF campus is much more of a community while the Oakland campus feels like a commuter school. Both campuses, however, have fantastic resources and tools for student use."
College Freshman,4,You make what you can with your education.
College Freshman,4,It also depends on the program that caters towards what you want to learn and how that can benefit you and our career
College Senior,4,"The education is priceless, the price and resources available to help find additional scholarship and grant aid is a constant struggle."
College Freshman,4,"Although I do feel a little intimidated while moving around campus late at night, when I have to work late hours in the studios, I feel like there are adequate safety measures in place, like the Public Safety department, that are at my disposal in case of an unwanted incident on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The work and projects are demanding, but most of the professors are very helpful and help you improve and grow as a student if you have a good attitude. Sometimes the courseload can become stressful towards finals week, but the output of creative work is definitely worth it."
College Freshman,4,"I've just completed my first semester at CCA. What I have seen so far is that the work is largely project based, and the classes demand a high quality of work in order for students to excel. The people I have met here come from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds, and are generally extremely warm and welcoming; I've made many friends so far, and I look forward to making more. Towards the end of the year, I've had to work extremely hard on  skills I was not previously familiar with, like hand drawing, but the rigor of this course has definitely improved my skills considerably."
College Junior,4,The quality of courses at the school has been great and so have the professors. But i believe the amount of work assigned to the students is unreasonable especially since the students need time to work on their own artwork. I also believe that the courses offered are VERY helpful but there is little to no time within the students' schedules to take these courses so they are almost useless.
College Junior,4,The career prospectives are great but the competition for jobs is so intense within the field that it almost nulls their efforts to help students find jobs.
College Junior,4,I personally have learned a lot while attending my school. The opportunities to learn animation in my hometown do not exist AT ALL so I may be biased in saying that the program and the professors in the program are great. I believe the tuition-to-education quality is not quite right but I am getting a quality education and access to resources that not many other schools would have.
College Freshman,4,"First off, there are a lot of lowkey things bad with CCA. The housing isn't the best, and people often don't clean up after themselves. Most of the dorms have small/mediocre kitchens, but Clifton has a large one on each floor. Additionally there's overflow housing, Irwin and Country Club Terrace (the latter not apart of the school.) Irwin was converted for this school year because of the large amount of first year students who had applied, and CCA rented out CCT rooms for students as well. Its not terrible, and it's not the best. Classes are great, but for the first year you have four core classes, D1, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Many students don't like these classes (they think they're unimportant/worthless) but they're actually very important to developing you as a well-rounded artist! Additionally every single teacher on campus (including the President of the school) is a practicing artist who teaches in the same field they work in. The school offers no meal plan but so many students eat on their own time it's not really needed. The Oakland campus (there's two campuses, one in Oakland, one in San Francisco)

This school will work you hard but it's very worth it. Also, when you're a first year take advantage of the studio spaces you have! Many of the studios are open until very early in the morning (ex: the glass studio is open nearly every day past 1am) and believe me you will need all the time you can get in them. There's the three computer labs that are open until 2am daily, and the cafe, A2, (which has bad hours, and isn't open on the weekend, but the nearby Safeway is open 24/7 (go in groups!!) and College Ave has so much to offer!) provides a comfortable place to sit with a strong and stable wifi connection, hot/cold water, small bathrooms, and a microwave!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Of the two colleges I have attended in SF, this is by far the superior for my field of study (illustration). The staff make all the difference. The campus isn't stunning like the Oakland part of the school, but the atmosphere from the people involved make the school a wonderful place to work."
College Freshman,4,"Great place with lots of things to see and do.  Vibrant local art and music scene.  lots of tourist attractions and pro sports teams in the area, too.  It is expensive as hell to live here, though."
College Freshman,4,"Campus staff are all aware of the policies regarding sexual assault and harassment. Campus Safety is available to escort any student to their car or to the BART Station/bus stop upon request, and regularly remind and encourage students to use the service.  Students are required to attend an orientation that includes the school's policies and procedures before classes start.  Focus is on prevention of crime (of any kind) rather than response to it.  Official policy on sexual encounters is ""Only yes means yes."""
College Freshman,4,Faculty are pretty open to whatever as long as it is safe and legal.  massive student-led protests and open-forum discussions on hot-button topics are fairly norm.  Alcohol and drug policies are strict in compliance with federal educational policies.  Priority is placed on student safety and wellbeing by all staff.
College Freshman,4,"They're really trying to improve their game, especially this year. I feel like I have a lot of options when it comes to safety here."
College Freshman,4,So many different types of food places to explore and discover
College Freshman,4,"With a Bart ticket and some change for the bus, there are so many great places you can go in San Fancisco and Oakland."
College Senior,4,There's also a big variety. But they all somehow contribute to the study of art and design.
College Senior,4,I believe our school has a pretty good reputation in the bay area. And the opportunities in the bay area are abundant.
College Senior,4,"Even though this is not the normal University life I expected, it is a great school for arts and designs."
College Senior,4,We have very good design and art programs. Very competitive too!
College Senior,4,"I've never heard of any sexual assault in our school. Seriously, in the past three years. NONE!"
College Senior,4,"There are many different kinds of people here. As art and design students, many of them are artsy and creative. The school is very open, we have gays, lesbians, transgender people... people wear what they wanna wear! It's really cool."
College Sophomore,4,"With all the security officers, its hard to feel unsafe. You are never alone, even in the middle of the night."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, its hard to complain. The winters aren't too cold, the summers aren't too hot. Its cool at night, often sunny during the day. Its great really."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of opportunities for internships, professional feedback, highly trained professors, any kind of machinery or facility you can think of! Any medium, any material, they have it. Its awesome."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a divers group of people at this school, who all get along with each other. Everyone can be themselves, no need to find the right look or appearance to fit in. Everyone is here for the same reason, and you can always find someone who shares the same passions you do when it comes to interests and hobbies."
College Sophomore,4,"Great guys & girls, but I'm not looking."
College Sophomore,4,"CCA campus strictness mainly focuses on making sure all students have id present, meaning our safety officers are always on the look out for those who do not belong on campus."
College Junior,4,Super chill! Except for the front desk. They are pretty strict about checking ID cards.
College Junior,4,"CCA is an art school in California, so naturally there is a great deal of diversity. I have noticed zero intolerance for orientation, religion, or otherwise."
College Junior,4,"Nightlife at CCA is great because you are in San Francisco. There are so many great bars around. Close to school is a dive bar called Thee Parkside as well as a music venue called Bottom of the Hill. When you get out of the CCA bubble, there is all that there is in places such as SOMA or the Mission. Popular places frequented by CCA students are bars such as Dear Mom, Homestead, Southern Pacific, or Latin American Club. And there is SO much more to explore. 

In terms of parties, those are pretty much explored through word of mouth, so make lots of friends! Also, SF has a good culture of underground parties and DJ venues, so keep your eyes peeled!"
Freshman,2,"Many reviews on this site have already addressed the main issues the school has yet to fixed, such as the lack of real diversity of students and professors, unqualified faculty members, poor communication between departments, and no meal plan and healthcare."
Freshman,2,"School has no care for their student's health, and forced them to go to class in unhealthy air quality conditions or they could fail."
College Junior,2,it's expensive as hell for all housing that is basically like living in a jail sell that I have to pay for out of pocket
College Freshman,2,"There is not really much of a nightlife in this college, it's not really part of the CCA culture."
College Freshman,2,"There is an architectural fraternity that one can join on campus, but no fraternities in the typical ""greek life"" sense."
College Freshman,2,"There's no athletics in this college, as it is mainly an art focused college that doesn't have a lot of athletics-oriented students."
College Junior,2,The housing quality of my school is very poor. The housing for Oakland students is shared with a high school. The pricing for the quality of housing is far too high. The resources and cleanliness of the building are horrible. There are absolutely NO resources for the residents to exercise/stay healthy.
College Sophomore,2,"A good amount of the administration, and teachers do not take attendance, so a lot of students get away with constantly being late or absent. The school, the administrators, etc. say that there are not drugs or alcohol allowed, but that is a joke. 

Example one: Orientation consisted of students smoking pot masked as a cigarette in front of chimera leader. 

Example two: End of the year a couple of friends were smoking pot outside Oakland campus gate one night.

Example three: Student living in dorm invited random neighbors to room to have alcohol.

The school does not care and it is rare if you get caught (even with the door wide open, and the drinks sitting out). No, seriously."
College Sophomore,2,"The on-campus dorm, Irwin has to be the worst besides Webster which is pretty far away from the school. Irwin has pretty large rooms but the living area might as well be the size of a box, consisting of an old sofa and several school desks. The kitchen is worse, it is supposed to be useful for all kids in the dorm but can not even fit two students. Webster is literally located on top of a high school. I repeat, on top of a high school. It is also not in the best area (or a good area) many of the students fear going outside that dorm at night and many are eager to find another residence after living there. None of the dorms are affordable, absolutely none. And if you live in a dorm besides Irwin, Clifton and Webster then you'd better find some sort of way to get transportation to school every single day."
College Senior,2,Art students don't pay a lot of attention on sports. But we do have free yoga sessions...
College Senior,2,"We just have a cafe at school. So it's really limited. Even though there are some restaurants around, it's not convenient. And the options are limited too."
College Freshman,2,"The fact that this is private school and it's really expensive doesn't really help me. I maxed out on government loans, received grants, and I have scholarships from the school but I was still $10,000 short for this year and I might not be able to attend for the spring term."
College Senior,2,There are scholarships but they are low in value compared to the cost to attend.
College Sophomore,2,"Sports Need to Be Encouraged – CCA is not known for its sports, we do have a couple of communities that like to get involved but not enough."
College Sophomore,2,"If you get to school in the morning a half hour earlier than classes start, you will definitely find a space. If you have a class that begins in the middle of the day it seems impossible to find a space. The parking is around the perimeter of the school. The extra parking is up a few blocks and it has different days and certain times in which you shouldn't park. The parking tickets are horrible and unfair to students. I got one for $100 once."
College Senior,2,"Mostly the surrounding area of the SF campus of CCA is completely unmoderated. Every other day I get harassed by a homeless person, not to mention the horde of hobos living down the street from CCA. It's very unsafe. I think with the tuition I'm paying I should be getting some safety and some hobo filtering within a reasonable radius."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of places around which could be accessable so long as you have a roommate or more then one, being in California it is fairly expensive for even a small apartment. Be that as it may, I was easily able to find an apartment after a few tries at looking through and figuring the right place, but having friends who are looking for apartments and hanging with them is for the best. The Pros is that there are many who are close by to the school itself and the shuttles, while the Cons are the expenses and how hard it could find and move out of a current place in a short time unless experienced."
College Freshman,2,"Tolerable but limited – Parking is limited and almost entirely on the street, but students with cars seem to manage. Note that students in the dorms are not allowed to have cars, and most off-campus students can easily rely on public transit."
College Freshman,2,"Pot is Widespread and Open – Use of pot-and, to a lesser degree, other drugs-is widespread, fairly open, and informally tolerated by RAs and administration. That being said, severe abuse seems very uncommon, and I have never encountered any peer pressure to engage in drug use."
Junior,1,"i have no words for this school. they JUST WANT YOUR MONEY. DONT GO HERE. EVER. food - terrible, there's no meal plan don't listen to them they give you a card with 300$ on it and the food is terrible. the campus has no safety, there is a gate but then a parking lot right after and it absolutely makes no sense at all. the teachers are mostly failed artists that brag about their own work but don't know how to guide you. there is no gym, no way of getting the students to know each other, everyone is by themselves. i have no words for this school, absolute waste of money and time. ALSO you won't be living in San Fran, you'll live in Oakland so get ready for some fun e-mails of how students are getting robbed weekly."
Freshman,1,"What I did like about CCA was the frequent student organized activities. Some of their faculty are also very qualified in their job and have ties to thier respective industries. That is about it. I attended CCA for a year and decided not to return. The primarily incompetent faculty, poor living conditions in the dorms besides Clifton, the administration that is woefully incompetent and often downright malignant made it against my better interest to return for the next term."
Junior,1,"This school is an expensive waste of time. The administration is terrible. The classes are asinine. No sports, no meal plan, a three absent fail policy. The amenities are barely existent. If you live in the dorms I hope you like drafts and mold. The only thing that keeps me here is the stellar animation staff. If that’s worth terrible conditions and $40,000 a year minimum to you knock yourself out. Wish I had never come to this garbage heap."
College Junior,1,we don't have greek life it's art school
College Junior,1,we have no athletics because it's art school.
College Freshman,1,No parties happen because there are no spaces for students to organize them in.
College Junior,1,"Housing is terrible. They don't give a s*** about the spaces. Students don't care about shared spaces and are filthy. No dorm life whatsoever, really"
College Junior,1,"This school makes excuses for rapists. Someone was literally assaulted in public and the school didn't do much to kick the asshole out. The ""next steps"" were sending them to therapy and classes of some sort. It's hard seeing this person still walking in school.

We also will get a few intruders, no biggie. But shout out to the public safety officers in the dorms, you guys are awesome."
College Freshman,1,There is no health center here. It's a joke. Also I feel like they don't take injury caused at the school seriously. Based on personal experience.
College Freshman,1,there is no athletic facility or sports teams/clubs.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no meal plan. There is A2 cafe on the San Francisco campus, the pizza and bagels are the things that most people order. I can vouch for the pizza. There is a cafe on the Oakland campus too, in all honesty, I do not waste my money on either."
College Junior,1,"The prices are PAINFULLY expensive, not to mention finding a place in the first place is terribly difficult. Good Luck!"
College Junior,1,"I don't park at the school because there isn't a parking lot at the school. If students have a car, then the students have to find the parallel parking spaces are the neighbor. There is a small lot, but that is reserved only for the faculty."
College Freshman,1,"we have no parking structure, only the residential street parking around the campus"
College Student,1,"First Year Program – Although I just recently moved in I realized that during the check-in (where it was possible to see every single freshman) the majority of students where either Caucasian or Asian. If this school really is diverse then where are all of the African-Americans, Native Alaskan, etc?
For every 30 people there is 1.5 African Americans or other. Literally. This is not diversity."
College Sophomore,1,"Attendance Is Crucial – Attendance is really oppressive and abnormal. If you have any unexcused absences you could have a grade lowered and after three, you fail the class. It sounds pretty normal, however, the workload is so heavy and unreasonable that people get sick often because of sleep deprivation. They require doctors notes or notes of various kinds to excuse the absence, however, if you needed sleep so that you could actually function driving to school, that is inexcusable."
College Sophomore,1,Car and Vehicle – My school does not allow students to have a car in their first year. They also do not provide housing for all students after their first year so parking is not an issue.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school is really focused towards the design majors. The painting and drawing major program lacked community and focus. Also CCA has two campuses, one in SF and one in Oakland. The painting major is really spread out between the both of them. When dragging large canvases around, this becomes difficult. 

Also Oakland has the forth highest crime rating in the US. It's really important to ask yourself how you feel about being in a city like that, or to ask exactly how many classes you'll be having in oakland. I was a transfer student, most transfer students who choose campus housing live in the Webster dorms. I left CCA because a shoot out with machine guns happened outside my dorm window. Even if you're living in the dorms closer to campus ... a guy got shot in the back while using the Bank of America atm next door to campus. Also two female students almost got taken into a van while walking together to Safeway right by campus. Not a safe place to be. It's a whole different level of unsafe. "
College Sophomore,1,Off Campus Apartments – It was quite hard for me to find a decent apartment in San Francisco. The reasonably priced ones are in shady areas and I would hate to live there. Studio apartments in good locations are quite small and still pricey. It's a task to find a nice apartment unless someone is willing to splurge.
College Senior,1,"There is no consideration for people who drive to school whatsoever. There are a few streets to park on near CCA, all of which have a 2 hour limit, which makes no freaking sense when classes are at least 3+ hours. There really should be a parking lot dedicated to CCA students, but only if the hobos at the back are cleared out."

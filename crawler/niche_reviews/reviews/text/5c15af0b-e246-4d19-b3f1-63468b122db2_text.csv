Sophomore,5,"The first bit there is an adjustment period, it may be rocky, but eventually your work pays off. Simon's Rock is the perfect place for those looking for a quirky learning community, with some flaws and oddities."
Alum,5,"I attended Simon's Rock from 2015-19 and studied pre-med and studio arts (drawing & painting). I don't regret my decision coming to Simon's Rock because the community is truly one-of-a-kind in its openness, progressiveness, and overall concern for students. Everyone, including faculty and staff, is on a first-name basis, and I know of many professors who check in with students during each class and adjust the syllabus or deadlines to accommodate for students needs. 
As for academics, the types of assignments, the workload, and class structure will vary depending on the subject. Students have a lot of choice in their courses and because the concentrations tend to only involve 25-30 credits (unless you're pre-med or pre-engineering where its 50+), people often double-concentrate or even triple-concentrate because the space in their schedules allow for it. Overall, if you put the effort in, Simon's Rock provides the resources to facilitate your vision and help you grow intellectually."
Freshman,5,Bard College at Simon's rock gave someone who is nobody like me a chance to show the world what I have to offer.
Alum,5,"Simon's Rock is not only absolutely unique in its early college format, but it offers a completely unique student body and set of academic experiences. It takes a certain type of student to do well here, but having seen a lot of different academic institutions in my years after graduating, nowhere is as honestly invested in its students and its mission as the Rock. I had an incredible time here, formed incredible relationships, and have had an incredible academic and professional career in my years since graduating."
Niche User,5,"It has been an amazing experience. I have made many friends with very similar interests, and have tried many new things. The teachers are engaging and very interesting, while also being knowledgeable in their fields. This has been the best decision of my life."
Senior,5,"I've never experienced a community like the one I found at Simon's Rock. The staff and faculty are so nice and friendly and genuinely care about you. The dining hall gives me ingredients to bake with anytime I ask and the provost will often stop and chat with me in the hallway. Professors are enthusiastic about what they are teaching and want to see you succeed--they get to know you and your interests and are always available to meet with you for extra help. The students are also nice more often than not. I think because a lot of people who come here were considered weird or misfits at their high schools (like I was), we really have no tolerance for any sort of social hierarchy or cliques. The academics are great too, but it's the social scene that has really changed my life."
Sophomore,5,"AMAZING! Like everything else in life, it's what you make out of it. The resources to do so are offered here. So, make the best out of it!"
Freshman,5,"I think that the academic experience offered at Simon's Rock, while slightly limited in variety due to the small number of faculty available, is extremely high in quality. The professors who work here are dedicated to their fields and to their students and actively engage the students' minds with relevant and useful assignments."
Alum,5,"I went to SRC for 2 years before transferring out. I loved it there, but I knew transferring was the right decision because SRC did not have my major."
College Junior,5,"All professors are the tops of their fields, fantastic"
College Senior,5,"We actually have a really strong academic program. The teachers take us seriously, we can craft our studies, our classes are discussion based, we read and write a ton... it's pretty great. Students often come to Simon's Rock for the academic program, which is more rigorous than several of the programs offered at top tier college, but also provides a lot more support without a culture of inter-student competitiveness."
College Senior,5,"The school is 33% students of color (which isn't radical or anything, but is nice), 20% international students, at least 50% queer students... etc. The school is full of people from several backgrounds, and also full of people who are talking about identity politics, society, culture, and politics in really important and positive ways. This is a great place to learn about yourself and others."
College Senior,5,"78% of Simon's Rock students eventually go to graduate school, and and we are #13 for schools that send students off to get PhDs. The academic program at Simon's Rock is strong and I've seen several classes of students leave very prepared for both their graduate studies and work opportunities. I don't think this happens inherently on the part of the school. You need to be motivated and willing to pull together your own experiences in order to take full advantage of Simon's Rock. I don't think any school can create a stellar graduate without serious contributions from the student. Make the most of your time here. This school has so much to offer."
College Senior,5,"I love the classes I've taken here. I'm a huge fan of just about every professor I've had, and the courses have been thoughtful, discussion based classes where I've gotten to learn so much from the professor and other students as well. We don't have huge regular offerings in each discipline, but you can design your own classes, study away, take classes at Bard main campus, straight up ask professors to offer certain classes, do independent projects, and design your own concentration."
College Freshman,5,"I love it here. I'm learning, I've made amazing friends. All I could have asked for."
College Freshman,5,This school is amazing for the opportunity it gives.
College Sophomore,5,"In Bard College at Simon's Rock, I learned how to study whatever I like. The professors, including my academic adviser, are very helpful in a way that they not only care about the students' academic experiences, but also their life in this new college environment. As me, being a second year freshman studying abroad in Simon's Rock, I feel that my campus is my second home. Furthermore I most valuable thing I learned in these past semesters is that I know how to set up a goal for the next period of my life. I found the direction of what type of person should I be as well as what career I really want for the rest of my life. I am really glad that I chose to come to Simon's Rock."
College Freshman,5,"Discussion based classes is what encouraged me to apply in the first place, and that is what i look forward to most"
College Junior,5,Security is not super strict.
College Sophomore,5,"If you get good grades, you will be fine."
Sophomore,4,"SR is mostly in-person with very strict covid guidelines, but the online instruction that is going on has been solid in my opinion. The professors are communicative and understanding with remote learning."
Sophomore,4,"I can say that for myself, as for many of my peers, Simon's Rock college has granted us with a myriad of reasons to be thankful for its place in our lives. Most of the students are extremely autonomous and strong willed, with a lot of passion. Undoubtedly ""different"". And plenty of the professors seem to find this energy invigorating-- often times going out of their way because they want to help you execute a goal and they think you have good ideas. The administration not so much, though I think that is to be said about most schools. The quality of academics ranges, but if you choose the right professors you can get a lot out of your classes, as some of our professors are truly very knowledgeable and good at their job. Overall SR is worth the ride, especially for a high school dropout. I have met the most amazing people. You learn a lot in not only academics, but life as well."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really love attending Simon’s Rock! All the professors I have met so far are very nice and willing to help. The school also does a fantastic job on inclusivity. Simon’s Rock has several support groups for minority students, including groups for LGBTQ+ students, students of racial minorities, and students on the Autism spectrum. As a student diagnosed with Asperger’s, the school’s performance on inclusivity has made me feel more welcome around my fellow peers and improved my social skills around other students. However, I give Simon’s Rock a 4-star rating because I have some concerns regarding safety. There are no security cameras located outside campus buildings, making it harder to catch students breaking college rules. I’ve definitely seen Simon’s Rock make some safety improvements recently, but I honestly think that this college needs to do a better job in keeping students safe, especially in the event of someone trying to attack students and faculty."
Sophomore,4,"The Simon's Rock experience is most definitely unique. Yes, we are a small liberal arts college that houses high-school-age students and throws them into the middle of nowhere with little to no access to the outside world past apart from 2-9 every day besides Sunday (where no shuttle besides those used for religious services are offered). Yes, we have a range of professors from Jessica Robbins, Anne O' Dwyer and of course, our lord and savior, Amanda Landi to Marina Barsky, David Meyers, and John (Tai) Young-Taft. BTW the range goes from godly to god-awful if you could not tell. The academics are challenging almost always for most (you will find yourself knowing more about certain topics than your Ivy-Educated peers) and you can find a clique to stick with but the entire school is your crowd and community, which is both amazing and yet limiting."
Sophomore,4,"Bard College at Simon's Rock is a very unique place. Everyone on campus is open minded about each person as an individual and their identities. Although our school lacks in athletics in the competitive department, there are still competitive sports. Being that it is such a small campus the entire student body know each other to some extent. All the professors here on campus are willing to see you succeed. If you are having trouble the professors will sacrifice time out of their office hours in order to help you. The student life at Simon's Rock is also very unique. You will always find people who are doing something late at night or doing some goofy things during the day. The academics at Simon's Rock is challenging and most students here are motivated academically. You will probably find yourself getting and giving help from your peers."
Sophomore,4,"I like Simon's Rock for what I did and who I met, not the school itself. This school is what you make of it and I made it good by surrounding myself with talented people and good work. It is a big commitment, especially at 16 and you should take a long time to consider why you want to go, not just why you want to leave high school."
Niche User,4,"Though the workload is intense, you definitely learn the material. It is expensive, and some of the dorms aren't as nice as they could be. There are definitely a lot of issues at the school, but if you can handle the work it can be a memorable experience."
Senior,4,"If you really want a place where you can learn and delve deep into your interests than Simon's Rock is a place for you. The academic experience and individualization here is great. As a student who struggles with learning  I have found the professors here are very kind and caring and will help you to succeed. I'm not very involved in student activities and events, typically just keep to myself, but there are always events taking place here."
Freshman,4,"There is a lot of debate on whether or not early college is really helpful. While a lot more research is still required for this relatively new concept, I can say from experience that some handle it well while others do not. The college itself has very good professors, and the workload is often described as ""rigorous."" The student population has increased dramatically in size, making some classes difficult to get in to. The food is mediocre in taste and quality, but they do make significant efforts to accommodate dietary restrictions."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the academics and extracurriculars. The sports are small and less competitive, but I enjoyed the fact that they were oriented around team experience as well as winning. I wish there were more classes offered, but it is a small school. The counseling ad health services could be improved, as could the meal plan. Both are good in theory, but fall short when met with over four hundred students."
Freshman,4,"The academic experience is challenging in general, and serves well the purpose of helping younger students get used to college. There is a warm and socially engaging LGBTQ+ community on campus, as well as strong and outspoken groups of liberals that center around feminism and communism. What really impressed me is the closeness between the professors and the students. With a 1:6 faculty-student ratio, students would be able to develop a closer connection and more personal relationships with staff members. I personally had an amazing working experience with my advisor."
College Junior,4,"Because Simon's Rock is such a small, unique and tight knit school, the alumni tend to be willing to help current students with internships or job opportunities once they leave ""The Rock"""
College Junior,4,"The freshman dorms are decent, but the rest are pretty great"
College Junior,4,"Although it's extremely small and in the middle of nowhere and needs to work on diversity, it's a great place to be. The campus strives to encourage inclusion and creating safe spaces for all students and the professors are absolutely amazing"
College Sophomore,4,"I'm mainly here for academics and plan on transferring after 2 years, or pursuing the 3-2 engineering program with Columbia University. The coursework here is very intense and the professors really do care. However, I am looking to transfer to a larger school with a little more excitement and funding for more opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"The health services department is decent, but there is virtually nothing you can do on weekends to have any needs addressed. Otherwise they are very accommodating."
College Sophomore,4,"It's only missing one ""dot"" because to do well here, you need to apply yourself and get in with the right crowd, not the druggies / ones that are falling behind. The courses can be very challenging and you have to be committed to doing well."
College Senior,4,"There is definitely a presence, but honestly where is there not? Students can get their hands on drugs, but the community is pretty non-peer pressure oriented. There are also lots of workshops and conversation on understanding alcohol and drug use. Most of the responses to use are also education based more than they are punitive. The school actually has a program, call for help, where you can tell security that someone is in a dire situation and they'll respond without any punitive action for the use."
College Senior,4,"I honestly believe this is an incredibly safe campus. Occasionally, something might be stolen but for the most part it isn't a significant issue (especially since the campus is so small and you'll probably see them). Additionally, you can tell who people are in the dark pretty easily and walking around at night isn't that freaky. The security team is also very personable, and there is a team of people on call every night. There will be a couple security guards available, as well as the pair of residence directors on duty, the RDs in the vicinity, and the PAs (residence assistants) in the vicinity. I think that people here are very serious about and very supportive towards survivors of sexual assault. I wouldn't say that it happens on this campus more than any other, but in such a small place it may feel like a saturated occurrence. I think we are fortunate to have a community with regular and structured conversations about the matter, training with new and current students, support systems, people that genuinely care, and a year-round culture of understanding consent."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I would never regret Simon's Rock, for all that administration is a nightmare creature from the Black Lagoon. It's a wonderful, tiny school, full of fantastic minds, and has a stellar reputation amongst most Northeast colleges should you wish to transfer or attend graduate, especially for being so young!

The people and professors here are why I came - what they need to do is revamp the campus all-around, particularly wifi and cellular access. There is NO cell tower, and we live on a literal mountain. The students need one. Legend has it, the battle is with the town over a tower blocking potential views, but there's only 300-400 students, and they could place it in a completely unnoticeable locale. It's just unacceptable and irresponsible to not have firm contact, especially given that there is no blue light system, poor campus lighting, regular blackouts and flash floods, tornado warnings, and only one to two security officers on call at any given time, who do NOT wander the campus, but stay in their booth and must be CALLED with a PHONE if you need assistance. It's a risk at this point not to build one. I myself was there for two years, and experienced two flash floods - one of which was during a blackout in which the generator gave out, and was stuck on a flooded hill up to my knees at 9:30pm in the pitch blackness of November in the Berkshires. I was knocked down by the water onset. I was in danger - this was also the fault of the professor, Bernard ""Bernie"" Rodgers, who, despite the EMERGENCY LIGHTS flashing on after the generator failed, and wild winds and water whipping about, threatened his class that the students who left early would not be credited for the day's work - this was with 30minutes left of a 3 hour class, during an actual emergency situation. By the time class concluded, the emergency lights had turned off, and the students were stranded. He himself offered no assistance to anyone - this, to me, was a severe scar on an otherwise fine experience."
College Junior,4,"The coaches are wonderful but students do not come here for the sports, they come for the education. That being said it has fantastic facilities and the teams do pretty well."
College Freshman,4,"Not in varsity myself, but many fun club sports!"
College Sophomore,4,"High school for me was bland, uninformative, and very unfocused on the individual needs of each student. Simon's Rock is the complete opposite! Not only did I get to start my college career a year early, but I also ended up on an academic path much more intense and fulfilling than I could get in many other places. Here there is a close relationship between professors and students which fosters a productive and highly educational experience. Personally, after just my freshman year I was able to acquire a summer internship wherein I got invaluable work and learning opportunity that I likely could not get in most other institutions so early on. To be challenged and involved in an academic setting is something I have not had for a long time and having that now is something I would never trade!"
College Senior,4,"Overall, I am very satisfied with my experience. The courses are interesting, challenging, and discussion or research based, and this really helped me go more in depth with my ideas and learn how to write better. The school has great internship opportunities, and allows for you to work with your professors on finding work or studies that are catered to your own interests. The only catch is that this is a small campus with a small class size in a small town, but this becomes manageable with so many activities on campus and the fact that NYC or Boston is 2 hours away at most. The work here has meaning and nothing is ""taught to the test"", most things you learn are above and beyond what a standardized test would expect of you. This is wonderful if you are interested in learning deeply and richly and in surpassing what the normal academic college experience would be like. This isn't an ordinary school, and that's what makes it so appealing."
College Senior,4,"If I was sent back in time to the beginning of my sophomore year in high school, when I first received the flyer for Simon's Rock, I would apply again. This has been a unique experience that I highly doubt I would have gotten anywhere else. I have been taught how to read, write, think, and learn at the college level before my high school classmates even started college. The classes here are challenging, and the assignments at times stressful, but successfully overcoming the challenges thrown my way has been rewarding beyond belief. The school is small and in a rural area, and while I prefer larger campuses in more urban areas, I love the small class sizes and attention given to each student by professors and faculty. The professors are amazing; they are as much teachers as friends. I definitely think that Simon's Rock is unique in that the professors are so engaged with their students both academically and on a more personal level."
College Sophomore,4,"Simon's Rock is the best decision I've made so far in the academics realm. I was at first skeptical when the Admissions team said that Simon's Rock has a more rigorous curriculum than most of the other schools in the entire country. But when I actually got here and sat in the classes as a freshman, I was deeply impressed by the maturity and the open-mindedness of the fellow young students here, and of course - SRC's liberal arts education at its best. Though it is a really small school, and Great Barrington is kind of small for a college environment (there isn't much to do here in this small town), we can always find ways to challenge ourselves and have fun at the same time. The professors here are the best in their fields, and they truly care about their students. We don't call them professor or Mr. and Mrs. something, we just call them by their first names. To students, the professors are more like peers instead of superior individuals. The engagement in class is wonderful, given that everyone (quiet or talkative) is participating and contributing to the conversation. Staff on campus are also very responsible and caring. And one best thing about Simon's Rock is its huge campus and beautiful scenery - you can't get enough of it :D"
College Sophomore,4,"Simon's Rock is an interesting place. Everyone is very sophisticated academically, but many people are still quite young mentally and emotionally, which can put a damper on the social life for someone who isn't that way. Still, everyone here is definitely an individual, and as someone who is in their third year, I will say that Simon's Rock was not cliquey at all when I first got here and has become slightly cliquey in recent years but still not nearly as much as at any high school I've ever seen. Because everyone is so different, the pool of options for who one might want to be friends with changes frequently and is often quite vast and varied. The academic experience is by far the best aspect of the school: the teachers are all amazing and personable, and classes are personalized because students here really get to form relationships with their professors. Most people who stay do so for the intensive, personalized, world-class education opportunities. The only downfall of the academic program in my opinion is that since the school is so small, not everything that needs to be offered every semester is, so you have to pick and choose your classes very, very carefully, because you might not have another chance to take a given class. The other (related) downfall is that the academic departments are so small that it can be hard to get as much out of them as you need. For instance, I realized I wanted to be a sociology major right before the professor of sociology and African American studies left for sabbatical for a year, so for a year I couldn't take any classes within my major, which set me behind in my track to my academic goals. Again, though, the professors themselves are amazing people and amazing educators! Shoutout to Anne, Becky, Francisca, Chris Coggins... ye."
College Junior,4,I really love this school and the professors.
College Junior,4,it's fine if you aren't a sports fanatic
College Freshman,4,"Simon's Rock has a lot of problems, both administratively and community-wise. I know so many people who have had bad experiences that my feelings towards the school are very complicated. But Simon's Rock is a very special place and I really love it. Personally, I've had a great time here, and that's probably because it's a very specific type of place and it's one I can do well in. If nothing else, there are a variety of weird and interesting people, and a lot of weird and cool spaces. The academics are great and will make everything worth it for you if they have classes in what you're interested in."
College Freshman,4,"Every building has its pros and cons. The Tridorms, the three dorms on lower campus, were part of the original buildings planned by the school's founder. Built sometime between 1966 and 1970, they have a lot of history. But they're kind of falling apart. Kendrick (co-ed) was the last dorm renovated, in 2008. It's in good shape, and is usually clean. Community depends on the people who are put in it. Rooms are small but if you organize your beds right it's fine, feels a lot less sterile than rooms in Dolliver or Crosby, which are usually split down the middle. Dolliver, the all-boys dorm, has a great community, a great lounge, and a prevalent video game culture. But it's not in great shape. Crosby is also kind of falling apart. Crosby rooms are generally a lot larger than any others, but the singles are tiny. (Whoever wrote that the singles are big below was wrong.) Crosby has a very bad atmosphere. 

All the Tridorms are close to everything. They're probably the worst dorms on campus, but saying that is saying something because they're definitely not that bad. 

Hill House is also on lower campus (again, whoever wrote below...wrong), and houses sophomores and up. It's very nice, very clean and new building, large rooms. There's a lounge on every floor with a kitchen and multiple study lounges, too. 

Upper campus holds Pibly and Carriage. Pibly is very nice apartment-style housing for juniors and seniors. Carriage is going to be used for Bard Academy students next year, but it was a nice option while it existed. 

Sometimes the school opens up one of the Mansfield houses or the Orchard houses (usually used for faculty) to students if there's not enough room. Next year, one of the Orchard houses will be open. That's going to be very cool; these houses all used to be used as student housing when Simon's Rock had more people going to it. 

Overall, I really like the housing at Simon's Rock...the buildings are full of history, weird feelings and quirkiness."
College Sophomore,4,"Great Barrington has quite a few different restaurants, which is great. They are a bit (only a bit) on the expensive side because this is actually a tourist town. However, they're pretty good and give nice variety."
College Sophomore,4,"There are parts of the administration that students anywhere will hate inherently, particularly those that get in the way of drinking/drug use on campus (dry campus, most students are under 21). It should be noted that the administration can be a bit difficult in certain spaces, but overall the administrators are rather considerate people who try their best and have the interest of the students in mind. There are also only like ten administrators."
College Junior,4,"Downtown Great Barrington is about a 30 minute walking distance & 5-8 minute drive. Shuttles to and from town are available, but on a very limited schedule. Townies are very friendly (some might even give you a ride if you're walking from town)."
College Junior,4,"Very strong security presence. It's a small community, therefore, petty crimes generally don't go unnoticed and are not tolerated. There is also some residual fear of school violence due to the school shooting a few decades ago. I generally feel relatively safe. However, both security and the residence directors can be very overbearing and invasive."
College Senior,4,"Off campus dining is varied and really quite good quality. It is the berkshires, so the town has a lot of vegan and organic food options (which my friends appreciate even if I don't). However, there is very few fast food options. There is maybe one fast food place and two places that deliver food to the college (crappy pizza place and chinese food that is kinda expensive and could be better). The places in town are great but a lot of them are really expensive. I recommend eating at Staax for diner. It isn't too expensive and the burgers are amazing."
College Senior,4,"I usually feel very safe on campus. Security is pretty helpful (except when it comes to a medical issue, they don't always handle mental health issues the best but they try and really have the best intentions) but mostly the students are pretty trustworthy and Great Barrington is an area with little to no crime."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I was not eligible for need based financial aid, I was able to receive a merit-based scholarship for 50% of my tuition every year. Most students on this campus get some form of financial aid. Off the top of my head I can only think of two students who pay full price."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as school food goes, the food here is pretty good. Our dining hall staff are lovely and are always willing to accommodate dietary needs. I can just ask someone for an omelet in the morning and they'll make it just for me! The food can get pretty repetitive after a while, but it is all edible and they try to mix it up."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the food in town! There is a great variety of foods to choose from. Some of the most popular are Thai, pizza (the best in the county!), and Indian. There are also many restaurants, especially Chinese ones, that are willing to deliver to campus."
College Sophomore,4,Each dorm is very different but they are all very liveable with a great community of people nearby.
College Sophomore,4,Working in the theater program is one of the best experiences I could have asked for. I am currently the production stage manager on our main stage production of Much Ado About Nothing and I am getting so much experience. I get to work with a group of professional theater artists (designers and directors) and they treat me like an equal and not as a student learning the trade. The other day in between rehearsals I just watched TV shows with our amazing Assistant Director who has worked on Broadway! I have also gotten a lot of opportunities off campus because of my connection with professors. I had the ability last summer to intern at a local theater festival and next summer I will be interning at a larger theater company!
College Sophomore,4,its a great way to escape campus
College Sophomore,4,SRC doesn't accept SAT scores which takes off the pressure because they are more focused on seeing students for them and various abilities
College Freshman,4,"The parties really mainly consist of school sponsored dances, however there are some kids that throw some parties by Lake Mansfield. BBQ, music, swimming--you get my drift."
College Freshman,4,"Housing on campus for freshman is pretty awesome. The tri-dorms are basically right next to the majority of your classes. However, the dorms (Dolliver) can get to be smelly. I guess that can happen anywhere when you have 50+ guys living in the same building. The worst part is no air conditioning. It can get very hot and humid in the dorms. A fan is like a small slice of heaven during that time. Parietals are pretty lame in my opinion because we are in college now and curfews aren't really something necessary for us. Overall, it's pretty nice to living."
College Freshman,4,"The process in general isn't really hard, however you really don't receive all of the financial aid you need. For me, I had to pay about $16,000 out of pocket. If they had more scholarship opportunities for freshman, it would be a lot better."
College Junior,4,"If you do what your told and work hard, your education will pay greatly."
College Junior,4,"Campus is safe, no worries. Sexual assault is not an issue."
College Sophomore,4,"Great Barrington is a great little town. There are tones of local stores filled with all sorts of things. For the amount of restaurants there aren't many good ones, but there is a local movie theater which is great!"
College Sophomore,4,There are tones or internship options and chances to meet up with alums. Although I have not gotten an internship through the school I did attend an event where the school brought back several alums in my field of study to answer questions about the premed major/career path.
College Sophomore,4,"As far as majors go, there's no problem. You just say what you want to do and that's what you do. The biggest competition is getting into classes, certain teachers are really popular so their courses fill up quickly, but if you ask nicely they'll probably let you in. The range of majors is good too, you can essentially do anything. However I think depending on what your major is you might want to transfer schools. Social sciences are really strong while other sciences, although good courses and teachers, may not be setting you up the best for life after SRC."
College Senior,4,Student to teacher ratio is great.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe hear and the health services are great for basics.
College Senior,4,"I love the people here, just wish there was a lot more of it."
College Senior,4,"I came here and feared that i would be rejected for my sexuality, but when I got here everyone was accepting. Only a few people disapprove but they tend to be only a handful."
College Senior,4,"Good gym and library (though not for anything in pop culture, but for student purposes).

Best building is the Daniel Arts Center (DAC). 

Student union is very crappy, and nobody actually hangs out in it. 

The only campus event is Mayfest which happens in (you guessed it) May for a weekend. It's alright. Basically, people order a jumpy house and you wander around in flip flops eating sweets. 

There's no parks or anything, but this place is tiny, and this is a forest, so there's nature-made ones all over."
College Senior,4,"You could be a three-headed pansexual zebra and you would be accepted here. Doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, who you like, what you do, everyone will accept you. It's fantastic. 

For the most part, students are very non-religious, and extreeeeeeemely liberal. I tend to assume someone isn't straight unless told otherwise. 

Diversity is good considering the area itself is 99% white. We have lots of different countries represented, and many, many minorities. 

There is some classism present because of the amount of wealthy students who attend, but most are middle class, and some are below. 

The only thing you will be judged for if you attend here, is if you voted for Mitt Romney."
College Senior,4,"In general speak, the academics are very good. The curriculum is made up mostly of required courses, I'm sorry to say, but most of us did skip high school and this is for an associate's degree in the liberal arts, so it is understandable. Almost all of the professors are incredibly intelligent, and love their subjects. The literature and science departments in particular. The workload is immense, much more than other colleges. Do expect that, and remember to relax and not take all of that too seriously, or you will go mad under the pressure. 

Bad things: attendance gives no space for you to be sick, so make sure to communicate with your professor. They are the ones who can choose to abide by the policy or not, so make friends with them and it will benefit you! 

The study abroad options only exist for those continuing on the bachelor's program, so you will be stuck here on campus for two years if you do come. Also, there is not many study abroad options, and they are all expensive. 

Registrations is a DISASTER. This school is stuck in the 90s, technology-wise, so you actually register in person. Seniority is given priority, which means if you are a freshmen, by the time you get a chance to register, almost all of your classes will be filled up and you will watch your plans go down in flames. Don't freak out; you can drop and add classes like crazy well into the semester, but most youngins are a crying wreck when this happens. I recommend expecting disturbances to your schedule, and having multiple backups for each class. Also, get there on time!"
College Freshman,4,"Simon's Rock has a diverse group of students. Most are accepting, in fact, small minded people are not favorably viewed amongst the general campus. "
College Sophomore,2,"Nope.

Sports here are awful. Small pool of potential athletes, and everyone is more intellectual than sporty anyways."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a party scene but no one is pretending there is. Not only do students not come here to party, but typically drug and alcohol use is casual and sporadic rather than celebratory and constant."
College Sophomore,2,"Chartwells oh Chartwells, you're awful but the employees are such loves."
College Student,2,"Sports are a complete joke. Don't waste your energy. There's a gym, it has average equipment but it's shared with the community of Great Barrington, it's not owned by the college. There's a pool if you're into that. There's a field for soccer. I don't think it's well kept."
College Student,2,"There are very few places if you don't want to travel far, and if they're not shi**y they're pricey. However, there are two decent cafés. One doesn't have good actual food, however."
College Student,2,"It's bland. The bathrooms are not clean. Toilet paper is often not refilled and trash often overflows. There are odd smells throughout the dorms. If there are things wrong with the room, unless it's major it isn't fixed. There is an attempt to recognize gender-variant individuals but I've heard people having issues. There's not a sense of community."
College Junior,2,"""Parties"" generally consist of 5-8 people sitting in a dorm room drinking, listening to music & discussing either Marx or Kanye. However, friday & saturday night dances are often organized in the PAC, which function as on-campus parties."
College Junior,2,"Very few students participate in athletics, therefore it's not selective at all, and it's quite possible that you might not even know they exist on campus. There's a severe lack of funding for the teams and they're taken seriously on campus. In fact, the basketball team often plays high school campuses. However, the facilities (the KAC) are very nice & functions as an open gym."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are gross, rooms are small unless you live on upper and then it's pretty far away (especially in winter)"
College Sophomore,2,"the food at SRC is terrible, but the food in town is great problem is that it's costly and not a lot of students have cars so either take the shuttle or calling a cab for $10"
College Sophomore,2,"If you like sports and know you can't commit it's great coaches are very leant,  but if you really want to play D1, 2 or maybe even 3 I wouldn't recommend playing or going here."
College Sophomore,2,yeah its not even at a college standard of partying
College Junior,2,"The actuals forms are all right, but the housing process is awful"
College Sophomore,2,"My overall experience has not been good. I the find the majority of students to think they know everything when in reality they are the most ignorant people I've ever met. In order to get an aa degree the school requires you to complete three semesters of a seminar course, this is complete bull s***. My first semesters teacher didn't care at all and never gave feedback on my papers, but never gave high grades either. As a result I felt my writing backtracked. The school claims to encourage critical thinking but since I've been there I've stopped thinking critically and instead have thought calculatingly on how to pass my courses."
College Senior,2,"Small on sports, we are geeks."
College Senior,2,"No help is given to students looking for internships. There is an email sent out once a month that usually offers four or so, for months from now, without pay or amenities, spread across the entire country. So if you happen to have a second house in California and randomly want to work in a field not at all related to your own, then great. Otherwise, there's nothing offered for you, or anybody else."
College Senior,2,"I'd do it again, but only because this school is LITERALLY the only option for early college students, specifically. If I could do it again with all the other colleges in the world available to me, I would never come here, not in a million, trillion years."
College Senior,2,"Only okay if you are an aging, socialite, health nut, hippie, liberal, who wants to live in a bubble far, far away from society. The rest of us want to get the hell out. The closest mall is an hour away, chains do not exist here, there are no museums of any interest nearby, and all culture occurs in the summertime during arts festivals. None the rest of the year. People hate students and do not accept them kindly, there are no sports, and no nightlife to speak of.

Only pros are it is very safe. There's lots of local businesses, but they are not meant for students, so that is why it is difficult to go out and socialize if you live here. There is one movie theater called the Triplex, but it only has five screens."
College Senior,2,"Tiny, smelly, dirty, and required by college policy to live in if under the age of 25 and unmarried, which everybody is. It sucks. Sucks so very much.

Best option for freshmen: Kendrick 

Best option for lower campus: Hill

Worst: Carriage

Best bathrooms: Carriage

Best option overall: Pibly for upperclassmen, Hill for everybody else.

Best community: Dolliver

Worst stench: Crosby

Noisiest: Carriage

Quietest: Crosby

Kendrick is the only coed freshmen dormitory, and the best. But make SURE to live on the second floor, because if you live on the first you will hear absolutely every sound anyone makes on the second. The walls are made of paper. The second floor is bigger and has better structure. Crosby is the all-girls dorm, and it is horrendous. The only advantage is it is the most spacious. Dolliver is a pit of hell and boyhood (all guys), but many of the guy's enjoy it. Definitely the closest community, since none of the other dorms are that tight-knit, but Dolliver is. 

All other dorms on campus are co-ed, and they include Hill, Carriage, and Pibly. Freshmen may ONLY live in Kendrick, Crosby, or Dolliver. Most sophomores live in Hill, which is the best dorm on lower campus. Carriage is a nightmare zone, and is located on upper campus, and home to many juniors with cars. Pibly is for seniors (and select juniors) only, and is an apartment mod. Apartments are shared by 3-4 people, usually who pick one another. Again, only for lucky upperclassmen, no hope of ever living there if you are just getting the associate's. 

Also, the myth of the mods - if you read anything about the ""mods"", those are a set of old dorms that were shut down because they were so disgusting and not up to code, but the school couldn't afford to fix them, or to knock them down, so they just exist by the art's center, rotting away. The only thing they are home to is rats and mold."
College Senior,2,"No one here is an athlete. If you are, I'm very sorry because you will have a very rough time. The gym here is really great, and there is a track, court, and pool, but this isn't just the college's, it's the town's gym. So expect to see all the locals there. We do not have varsity sports, and there is never any big sporting matches to attend. ACE (athletics and health) requirements aren't taken seriously by anybody, including the faculty. Working out is pretty big here among some groups, but sports and games are not."
College Junior,1,"Depending on how you view it, considering there is no greek life."
College Freshman,1,"I understand that the administration is strict because we're all younger here, but I honestly think that campus policy as far as Security goes is terrible. I feel like they treat us like children and look to get us in trouble. I definitely don't feel like Security is there for my safety; I feel like they want to get me in trouble so they can fine me. I also know many people who have had terrible experiences with them. I haven't personally, but I just don't feel like Security contributes to a safer feeling on campus. They discourage community, they discourage gatherings, and they discourage spaces where people feel comfortable—which is really important to campus atmosphere and is probably why campus is dead most nights. 

The administration is also just unreasonable on a lot of things like housing and special requests and just generally make everything more difficult than it needs to be."
College Sophomore,1,"I give one star because all students are required to live on campus unless you live with your family, so there is no off campus housing. The school is starting to provide more on campus *house* options, like the Mansfield houses, but for now student mostly live on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Crosby? Are you kidding me? The place is falling apart. Dolliver as well. Hill, where I currently live, is up to par."
College Student,1,It doesn't exist. No Greek stuff.
College Student,1,"They give out too much, and then they can never have enough to improve the school. So they invite lots of students to an unimproved, dilapidated school. Some people have major issues with it, and I heard of some pretty nasty cases. I don't think it's easy, even though they go over budget with it, they're not reliable."
College Student,1,I never eat there. Ever. It's a privilege that everyone would take if they could.
College Sophomore,1,"I wouldn't even say there is a party scene, besides a couple house parties off campus and people drinking in the dorm rooms in small groups."
College Sophomore,1,"It's not strict at all. As long as you're not waving drugs or alcohol in securities face, you'll probably get away with it. And even if you do get caught you probably won't get kicked out."
College Senior,1,No nearby clubs that I could find.
College Senior,1,There is no Greek life. Although the one all men's dorm for freshmen is practically a frat house.
College Senior,1,"We have no Greek life of any sort, no fraternities, and no sororities. People scoff at the idea of them here."
College Senior,1,"Welcome to New England, where it will rain, snow, hail, and fog in the span of 20 minutes.

This has really happened to me. This weather is extreme because of our mountain climate, so everything is about ten degrees more extreme than the rest of the region. The winter is never ending. So much so that there is free therapy offered, and many students develop Seasonal Affective Disorder from the lack of sunlight. It really is disconcerting, so make sure to get outside and keep up with a social life so you aren't stuck in your tiny room all day, which really is depressing. 

The summers are beautiful, but being students, we miss them completely."
College Senior,1,"Great Barrington is made up of retired New Yorkers, and families attending alternative schooling. Everything closes at 9pm, and 5-6pm in the winter months, which is eight of the twelve months when you live in the Berkshires. Despite there being a college here, none of the local businesses have taken advantage of this, or even acknowledged it. No business caters to students, and this is a very expensive town to live in, so it is tricky on the wallet to try to find a way to get out at night without spending $50 on dinner. This leads to many students staying in their dorms and getting high. A word of advice: make friends with someone who has a car, or get one yourself. You'll thank yourself every day for this, campus can feel very secluded and claustrophobic, especially in the winter."
College Junior,1,Not a great town unless you have a lot of money. 
College Freshman,1,"There is almost no available off-campus housing. And while the parties off-campus are pretty great, everything requires a car and lots of transportation tine and money in the Berkshires."
College Freshman,1,"The shuttle only runs hourly on weekdays from 2 - 7, not when it's really convenient. You really need cars, but freshmen can't have them."
College Junior,1,"There is very little diversity on our campus. There is about 15 African American students, 25 Asian students, and the rest are white. Most of the people that are white have a bit of an attitude, but the minorities tend to stay within their own kind, so there is never tension amongst groups."
College Sophomore,1,Shaking My Head – This is the most lenient educational institution that I've ever attended and it annoys me to no end. It takes forever for people to get in trouble and there is such a bias towards scholarship kids and full-tuition kids.
College Sophomore,1,"Theft is common. This year there have been so many case of people (cough)freshmen(cough) going into people's rooms and taking things. Also, a large controversy is that heath services is the most reckless thing on this campus. They prescribe what ever the student does or doesn't ask for. There have been situation where students were prescribe medications that clearly stated they were not supposed to be mixed"

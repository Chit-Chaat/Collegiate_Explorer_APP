Senior,5,"I love my liberal arts education, I have thoroughly enjoyed being stretched in areas outside my field. I also love that Taylor has such a strong emphasis on community, both in our little town of Upland as well as on our campus."
Senior,5,"Summer Blackboard courses are offered every year, and I have participated in 16 credits worth of online courses. In each situation, the professors have been prompt and prepared to teach online material."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes, so this isn't really applicable to me. But niche is apparently making me do this as part of the review process, so..."
Junior,5,"I’ve never had such a tightly-knitted community of professors so dedicated to getting me where I aim to be, or guide me toward goals that I didn’t realize I could reach. It’s all even better when the people you live with also want the best for you, which is the case no matter where you live on campus. Having to choose between here and The Ohio State University, I chose Taylor because I felt led to by nobody but God, and there hasn’t been an ounce of regret. They all are God-fearing, loving people. They all have your back through every circumstance.
Yeah, it’s in the middle of cornfields with nothing good to do within a 40 minute radius, but the community is what makes this university like none other."
Freshman,5,"Taylor has an incredible community and great people. Intentional community is a big part of the Taylor experience, and it had a major positive impact on me personally almost as soon as I arrived. Taylor also provides a lot of great opportunities for students for studying abroad and building their learning experience off of all areas of knowledge."
Sophomore,5,Taylor University is a college that is surrounded by people living in community and fellowship with one another. It's not just students you see students eating lunch or grabbing a cup of coffee with a professor. The academics are challenging and that's amazing they are also all integrated with faith based learning so every prof teaches with the scriptures in mind
Niche User,5,"Taylor university has been the best University I have found while navigating the college process. They have been the most helpful, understanding, and passionate."
Sophomore,5,"Intentional community is so prevalent at Taylor that it is hard for someone to not feel like they belong somewhere. From chapel three times a week to countless clubs and intramurals as well as floor events and fun campus activities, there can always be something fun to do, despite being in the middle of the cornfields. Overall, my experience at Taylor has been life changing and I am so thankful for the opportunity to grow here."
Freshman,5,"Taylor University has the best community of any school I have ever even heard of. This campus is dedicated to making sure everybody genuinely feels involved and included, be it for eating dinner or doing homework, everything is done as a team. To feel lonely at Taylor is a challenge. 
Though the campus is located in the vast cornfields of Indiana, there is always something going on. I came here with a fear of being bored - now I find myself so occupied that it is difficult to find time to do homework (Something I consider a win). There are 2am missions to steal relics from other floors, there are floor ""Open Houses"", where an entire floor will pick a theme and invite their guests to visit the most random and insane experiences of their lifetime.
This is not only an awesome place to get a Liberal Arts Education, but a place where you will make friends and connections that will never leave."
Sophomore,5,"The community at Taylor is unlike any other school you will go to! There are facutly, professors and staff that geniunly care about you and want nothing but the best for you. You will make that best friends of your life, and participate in some good, clean fun! You will grow mentally and spiritually over your time at Taylor. It is a truley priceless experience!"
Niche User,5,"Everyone was very welcoming. Campus life is a very large focus there, and they are very focused on the students. Everyone wants the students to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Taylor has an incredible community. I feel cared for and given an opportunity to learn outside of my major study courses. A whole person education is the focus here, and there are incredible opportunities to get involved in all aspects of campus life."
Freshman,5,"Taylor University is an absolutely amazing place. From my dorm life (so fun) to late nights in the Euler Science Building I have so much fun here. All of my professors are so kind, loving, and caring. They always make sure that I am doing okay."
Freshman,5,"I came to Taylor last fall and have found an invaluable community there. It's not a perfect community, but I feel like I can be fully myself with the people I've found at Taylor."
Freshman,5,I love the community on campus. We love Jesus and you can generally tell by the way others act. The professors are great! They really care and want to know what's going in your life.
Freshman,5,"Taylor is a perfect place for Christian students of all political views, ethnicities, and races. It provides a place of learning and discussion with all points of views being considered. The community is extremely loving and warm yet still allows you time to be to yourself. There are numerous Taylor traditions to be apart of and enjoy. Personally my favorite thing is how personal the teachers are, they truly care about your well-being and work hard to ensure you excel in academic endeavors."
Freshman,5,The community here is amazing. You will not get lost in the crowds here. The integrated dorm living of the classes is great.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the way the students and faculty are very accepting of any one with any background.
Freshman,5,"So far, it has been a welcoming and loving community. This is a place I would recommend to many people."
Junior,5,I love the community that Taylor offers and the individual investment that the professors have in each student. The only thing that I would change is that I would like for the Bible to be a little bit more central in campus life.
Freshman,5,The community at Taylor is unlike any other school but it would be nice to have things to do around campus with the new friends we've made.
Freshman,5,"So far I am so happy I chose to come here! The community here is better than one I have ever had before. The people are so genuine and want to encourage us to be the best people we can be. Our professors prepare us for the workforce, and for life in society. One thing I do not enjoy is the surrounding town. There is nothing to do off campus, but luckily the great community makes up for it."
Junior,5,I love Taylor University. I think that this school has shaped me and molded me into someone completely different than when i walked in as a freshman. This university prepares you for what you will encounter in your future job. The professors are also great mentors and teachers. They are very personable and care on a deep level for each of their students.
Freshman,5,"Taylor University is a place where you just don't grow academically, but also spiritually. That was a key reason why I chose to come to Taylor. I wanted to grow stronger in my faith. Also, the community here is outstanding because everybody has the same goals. There are also tons of opportunities for students to get involved and meet new people. Whether that is volunteering or just an event to bring the student body together, there are always things going on. The only downside of Taylor is that there isn't much of a town around this area. Upland is a very very small town with basically Ivanhoes as the only place to go to with in walking distance. If you want to go some where out to eat or to go to a move somewhere you are going to have to drive to Gas City or Marion. Otherwise, I have nothing bad to say about Taylor. It has already impacted my life in a huge way and I don't see it stopping."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore here and I absolutely love it here. I have not had a negative experience here, unlike the community college I attended before. Everyone is so friendly, and willing to be your friend, I love it."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing 4 years at Taylor. I would not trade them for anything! I made lifelong friends, found out what I was passionate about, made tons of memories and will forever be connected to the school. I am so thankful for TU!"
Freshman,5,"I love how it feels like youre a big family. I love the campus, the people, the food. Everything about Taylor is great! I love the way if youre not at chapel people ask about you. I did a Campus Tour and it was a great enviorment and I can't wait to start in the Spring!"
Junior,5,"I love being at Taylor University. This unique school has provided an atmosphere that I can grow not only academically, but also a whole person. The faith and learning integration has been a vital part of my development."
Senior,5,"Taylor is a place that welcomes students of all backgrounds and experiences. There is a community here I haven't found anywhere else. There is space to have intentional conversations and grow in relationship with one another and to grow and develop a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ. Our chapel services are intentional in the content and worship for students to engage in. They bring in speakers from all over the world to share and encourage us in our faith. The student life on campus is always inviting students to participate in various events, like our annual Halloween Dance or Silent Night tradition, Pick-A-Date's on our floors, and plenty of opportunities be involved in leadership in the many student-led programs on campus. This is a school that will invest in you and help you grow and develop into an adult during your time here as you ask big questions about life and discover who you are through conversations and embracing one another with the honest, gracious love of Christ."
Alum,5,"Great school, education and faith well integrated. Place to grow spiritually and prepare for your career."
Niche User,5,I visited this summer and it was an amazing experience. They really did roll out the red carpet for me and made me feel welcome. Our tour guide even prayed with us afterwards. I would highly recommend Taylor University.
Sophomore,5,It is a fun little community and it easy to get to know one another. I became really involved with my dorm and connected with it pretty well.
Freshman,5,"The moment we walked on campus, it felt like home!  The professors we met with were warm and knowledgeable, the classes we visited were engaging and small with a lot of instructor contact, and the students I stayed with in the dorm were incredibly welcoming and fun."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year here. I love this place. Everyone is very nice. I am an engineering student, and although its a small university, the engineering program is excellent."
Sophomore,5,I have loved being a part of the Taylor community. My time here has helped me grow in more than just academics--it has helped me grow as a person.
Alum,5,"From reading the posts, it seems some students clearly do not like the Taylor experience. If you're looking for lots to do outside of Taylor, such in the general locale, it's true you won't find it.  If you're looking for a well-rounded environment where students are trained to graduate and go on to serve in a variety of ways, both professionally and personally, then Taylor could be for you.  Frankly, the students who do not like Taylor should try a different school to determine a better fit.  Essentially, all over the world, many people love Taylor, and those who graduate from her are recognized across all industries to be some of the most top-notch folks around."
Sophomore,5,"I've been enjoying going here for the past two years that i have attended. Everyone at the school is friendly and the classes are challenging and interesting.  I've learned alot pertaining to my major in the first two years, more than i expected to too. It is an excellent environment to attend college in."
Sophomore,5,"Taylor University is a great collage to attend.  The science majors are particularly well developed, including computer science.  Taylor is a Christian collage, so you will not have to worry about your personal beliefs affecting your grades like it would at some other collages.  being a Christian Collage also means that there is a lot of life-issues support; if you think you're perfect, this is not the collage for you.  The only issue might be the price tag, but Taylor is willing to work with all its students to make sure affordability is not an issue."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled at Taylor University and I love it! This place is my home and the friends I have made there will last a lifetime. Attending Taylor has helped me grow so much in my faith, and it has helped me become a more independent, well-rounded individual. The one complaint that I have heard a lot about Taylor is its location. Yes, it is in the middle of a cornfield, but I have never been bored and I have attended this school for a year and a half now. There is so much to do on campus and there are several smaller cities within 30 minutes of campus and two large cities within 1 hour if you really need to find something to do."
Sophomore,5,Taylor is an amazing experience and has a great Christian atmosphere. The academics are amazing and it is well known for its science department.
Freshman,5,"I love Taylor University so much. The community is great, the professors are beyond amazing and are so grateful to help you. Pretty much anyone on campus is awesome. "
Sophomore,5,"I am in love with Taylor University.  I have learned so much here, and my professors truly care that I become the best that I can be.  "
College Freshman,5,There is all kinds of emails that go out on this and who to get a hold of when you need jobs or internships.
College Freshman,5,I love everything about Taylor. Taylor is amazing.
College Freshman,5,There is not a time when I do not feel unsafe at Taylor. If you do not feel safe then you can always call campus police.
College Freshman,5,Our athletics at my is beyond great. Our attendance to our Silent Night Basketball is outrageous and so is the attendance for everything is just so awesome.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Taylor. The Community, staff and students are amazing and their love for God is just so powerful."
College Senior,5,The CCO is very helpful in connecting students with alumni and with potential jobs.
College Senior,5,I love class size and the way that professors truly care about their students.
College Sophomore,5,"I am not sure what I want to do with my degree post-college. However, I am confident that whatever I go into, my degree will have prepared me for vocational ministry in a way that a degree from a secular school could not do. The calling and career office is very helpful with finding internships, jobs, and alumni connections if we are wondering about possible career options in our fields.There are also career fairs, and people who speak in chapel who graduated from Taylor, giving students more ideas as to career options."
College Sophomore,5,"I declared Christian Educational Ministries this past semester and am really looking forward to taking more classes in the subject. My adviser is someone I can go to for advice, guidance, and prayer, and I feel similarly about my other professors as well. The class sizes are small and intimate, and allow for healthy conversation and discussion, as well as seeing familiar faces between classes. It can be hard to figure out schedules with the smaller amount of classes and times offered, but my advisers have all been extremely helpful with that as well."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt unsafe walking around campus alone at night. It's also nice to know that I can call campus police at any part of the day if I don't feel safe, and they can take me back to my dorm or somewhere else on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"I live in Breuninger and absolutely love it! The floor is always extremely clean thanks to the maintenance and housekeeping, and the close proximity to the dining hall is really great. Most of the friends I have made are from my dorm. While there isn't Greek life at Taylor, each dorm kind of serves as a fraternity or sorority because of how tight knit each one is. I applied early for housing too, so I had no issues getting into Breu (which was my first choice)."
College Sophomore,5,"I have made friendships at Taylor that span the miles between us during the summer, and I wouldn't trade my time so far at Taylor for the world. I absolutely love my dorm, floor, classes, major, professors, and the community I am surrounded by. While it is difficult financially, I am trusting that if Taylor is where God has me, He will provide."
College Freshman,5,My field is well known on this campus
College Freshman,5,Professors and students practice what they preach
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. The only thing  I have feared is my Bike or Longboard being taken, or possibly getting hit by a car, but in general there are no real threats on campus. we always have police patrolling campus. Not only that but with us being a christian school there is little to no hostility on campus. I have never feared a fight or anything breaking out and nobody as far as I know has been mugged or anything on or near campus. Our campus is very calm and safe."
College Junior,5,Taylor University is a very safe
College Junior,5,I'm in the newest dorm so its the best dorm.... In my opinion
College Freshman,5,"Taylor University requires that all students sign the Life Together Covenant. In this contract students agree to abstain from drugs and alcohol. Of course, like anything, if you look hard enough you can find it, but it is very difficult to engage in these activities."
Junior,4,Professors did a great job at adapting to online teaching in the Spring of 2020. I really appreciated how well they did.
Junior,4,"Because of COVID-19, all of my classes were forced to go online - many of my teachers adapted very well, coming up with creative ways to substitute assignments and end the semester well."
Junior,4,Taylor has been a safe place to grow and mature as a person in a nurturing environment. Their liberal arts education has given me an opportunity to learn and develop beyond my major.
Graduate Student,4,My experience at Taylor was a good one. I studied Elementary Education and felt that my professors were knowledgeable in their field of study and were always available to chat if I had any questions about my classes. I was also an intercollegiate athlete and my head coach not only cared about me as an athlete but cared about me as a whole person. I was able to be involved in many on campus activities and that was a great chance to make friends. I would recommend Taylor to anyone that wants to receive a well-rounded education and who want to grow in their faith walk with Christ.
Alum,4,"Taylor is all about the relationships you get to build with friends, professors, and dorm mates. It was the best experience of my life!"
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the really up-date learning with the use of current news and ideas. Learning at Taylor is very specific and does not feel like general ideas, however the location of the campus makes it tend to get very boring living there."
Sophomore,4,"Taylor University is a family. You will find a great dorm environment no matter where you live and everyone is always nice. Instead of students looking down at their phones on the way to class, people always are looking up and smile and say hello to each other. The professors are wonderful too! They look out for their students and genuinely care for them. They offer opportunities for students to get real life experiences and put in effort to the student’s spiritual life."
Senior,4,I have very much enjoyed my time so far at this school. There have been tough opportunities of growth but it led me to figure out what type of student I wish to become. I have very much loved the faculty and staff. The majority of faculty love their jobs and truly wish the best for their students. I also value the living community Taylor had achieved--I have made my best friends and loved getting to interact with a faith based community each and everyday.
Junior,4,"Taylor is an overall good place to live, you can walk around and get to places easily. You can get to everything within ten minutes. The dorms are like any other and there is not much of a party sense the campus is dry. The food is good and the professors are friendly and are willing to help. The people get along with each other and are supportive of each other. I think that if it had a town near by that would make it even better."
Alum,4,"Taylor University was overall good. From an academic standpoint, which is the main reason I attended, I have no complaints! Excellent professors that showed care and investment in their students, especially within my major (Exercise Science). Being a minority student on campus truly is a very different experience than what the majority culture would probably say about their experience though."
Alum,4,"I had a good overall experience here! The professors are really great, they are there to help you in whatever way possible - and they care about your future. I also liked the intentional community focus. I made lifelong friends here!"
Junior,4,"I really liked being apart of the community, meeting new people and especially getting to know God more. I has been an amazing to be apart of the TU family and to learn so much about the school's heritage. I love how Christ centered it is and how we are encouraged as students and young people to seek God and to live and serve him through whatever we do and what we strive to become."
Senior,4,"My experience has been quite interesting. Overall, I would say I have had a good experience at Taylor. But there has been a lot of internal struggle between the conservative and liberal sides within the university. For a school claiming, advertising, and recruiting on the basis of their conservative christian stance, much of the education and administrative decisions lean heavily on the leftist agenda. The community is true to it's word, rich and full of culture."
Sophomore,4,"Very great school with a lot of amazing opportunities! I appreciate Taylor for its constant faithfulness to its students, the helpful faculty, and the intentional community."
Junior,4,"Taylor is a great Christian school focusing primarily of getting a Christian education in order to build up characteristics of servant leaders. The school is making strides towards improving the positive nature of their diversity, which is encouraging during these times of racial tension. Taylor University has a lot to work on financially. Students are unable to attend the university without experience substantial debt as their financial aid programs are lacking. I'm hoping to see more improvement in his area in particular. Their academics are challenging and rewarding. I feel prepared academically for graduate school as I look on toward more practical living experiences in an apartment or home."
Freshman,4,Even though I have only been at this school for just over 2 month I fell in love with it fast. The school gives you a lot of outlet to met a lot of people very quickly. Many of the people I have met here were people I probably would not have at a big state school. Classes are challenging but not an overload.
Graduate Student,4,"I loved the intentional fellowship at Taylor University. I wish that there was less stigma there, however, I found that people often meant well and wanted to genuinely get to know you. I appreciated the professor's effort to go the extra mile. There is a great academic program, however, little to do in the area unless you are willing to drive."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Taylor University is that you have professors that actually care about your education. I hear that there are some professors at other colleges who don't care about the grade you get, and that they won't work with you when you need some last minute help, which is completely understandable. But here at Taylor, you can come up to a professor at the last minute for a little extra help or something, they work just as hard as you to help you get to where you want to be. One thing I would love to see change is the diversity on campus. Although Taylor does their best to try to incorporate all of the cultures into the community, I feel like they don't get enough attention and there are too many people who are unwilling to expand their horizons. Taylor should start by doing better job of broadcasting when a multicultural event is happening and then move on from there."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the atmosphere of Taylor University. The christian based education is a great way to grow more spiritually. I would recommend Taylor to anyone who is wanting to strengthen their personal relationship with Christ in a Christian atmosphere.
Niche User,4,"Taylor's got a beautiful campus and I love the dorm buildings, which look more modern/clean than other dorm buildings."
Freshman,4,"I love the community at Taylor, but I would prefer if they gave the students more opportunities to voice their opinions."
Sophomore,4,"Taylor is a great school with great professors and above average dining options.  Chapel is an awesome worship experience, and the professors really get to know you as a person."
Niche User,4,"Taylor University is centered around a strong community. Each and every person is invested in you as a whole. The loving, kind, and amazing spirit that perpetuates the school creates for some neat interactions."
College Sophomore,4,I like it. Really depends where you live
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on Taylor's campus. I have never worried about being attacked.
College Senior,4,"The dorms are great, but very difficult to get off into an apartment!"
College Senior,4,"Taylor University is the perfect small university where people go to learn, not to party. If you're serious about learning and your field, you'll love Taylor."
College Junior,4,The professors at Taylor are great. They are welcoming and always eager to assist in anyway possible.
College Junior,4,"As a student, I feel 100% safe on campus. I never hesitate to ride my bike in the middle of the night or walk back to my room at 2am."
College Junior,4,My dorm room is spacious and I love my roommates
College Sophomore,4,"I am a member of the track and field team, and while it is a big time commitment, the integration of faith and athletics is really amazing to see. We are always encouraged to glorify God in our competing, which is something I had never experienced at the large, public high school I graduated from."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are small and personal
College Freshman,4,A safe environment is promoted
College Freshman,4,"I love this University. The faculty student relationship is above expected, the social life in the dorms is phenomenal, and the food sucks, but I love it. The courses usually challenge you but are good. I have enjoyed my experience for the mot part thus far."
College Freshman,4,"I love the social atmosphere. There is so much brotherhood and acceptance throughout the dorms. There is always someone to turn to if you need help or just someone to talk to, and there is always something to do. The residence life is great at Taylor University!!"
College Freshman,4,My overall experience is that most professors will go out of their way to help you. they will try to the absolute degree that they believe they can go without jeopardizing their integrity. I have greatly appreciated this and has helped me to decide to go back.
College Freshman,4,"Concerning the quality of courses offered, there will always be an integration of Faith and Learning. This is more visible in some classes than others, and some disciplines make it hard for this to happen. The quality of education at Taylor University, I would consider to be above average for a college. Each teacher cares about individuals, and are more than willing to help students who seek help. Each professor is also more than willing to form first-name relationships with students, should they seek to know them better.

Concerning class styles, Taylor mixes group work, lecture, and student teaching into their curriculum. Depending on the class, each professor will vary how, where, and when these styles are used. In Psychology, group discussion is heavily used in classrooms, especially one classroom designed like a courtroom, specifically for the purpose of group discussion."
College Freshman,4,"Opportunities to succeed exist, if you go after them."
College Junior,4,Its good but it could always be better
College Freshman,4,"When it comes to religion and economic background there is not very much diversity, but we have many ethnicities represented."
College Junior,4,I have loved nearly every professor that I have had.  I love the small class sizes.
College Junior,4,"It's great, but it's expensive!"
College Freshman,4,It's a great place to live!
College Senior,4,I think our campus police are very helpful. They even helped me when my car got stuck in the snow.
College Senior,4,"I've grown as a student and as a person here at Taylor, and they do a great job of encouraging students to interact with faculty members outside of class."
College Senior,4,"I got a wonderful internship through a faculty connection here at the school, and I feel very supported as far as my future career plans go."
College Senior,4,"Socially, residence life at Taylor can be really wonderful, if a tad overwhelming at times. I have nothing but good things to say about the residence hall directors, who do a wonderful job of promoting community."
College Senior,4,"I have really grown as a person while I've been at Taylor, and though there are things about the school I don't love, I think the faculty have really amazed me with their kindness and genuine concern for the intellectual and spiritual growth of their students."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are very caring and knowledgeable overall, which is all I can ask for on that part. I'm not completely sure about all the gen eds we're required to take, but a couple have been useful. Class sizes are small for my major, which I like, however there are a few lecture halls for gen eds that I'm not the fondest of."
College Freshman,4,"I just moved to Bergwall from Gerig. It depends on what you value more. I appreciate the space I have now. And it is connected to the DC and every room has its own bathroom. Gerig was fine while I lived there but space wise, it could feel very cramped. However the community was better there. I still hang out with my friends there so I'm not always bothered by the lack of social life on my floor. Plus I am good friends with my roommate and a couple girls down the hall."
College Freshman,4,"My school is very original. We get excited at football games mostly, but there is a special tradition called Silent Night. This happens every December. It is a basketball game where you have to be quiet until our team scores the 10th point. The crowd roars at this point, and it is nearly deafening. Also, you get to dress up in really crazy costumes. It is actually really fun."
College Freshman,4,"My college is great. I appreciate the integration of faith and learning because I am a nondenominational Christian. I appreciate that my professors truly care about me as a person and about how I am doing in their classes. The best thing about my University is the connections. All professors are pretty experienced in their fields and have contacts in their fields as well. Just in the first semester and a half I've met several CEOs in companies nearby, people in my desired industry (film), and others in different fields as well."
College Freshman,4,The people here are friendly and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is pretty good. Dorms differ depending on the hall, but they are of decent size. The social atmosphere within halls is strong, but not really pushed for between halls. Convenience varies depending on where you stay (there are at least two halls that are pretty far away from everything)."
College Sophomore,4,"Being in the middle of a small town with few residents and many cornfields, and being a Christian college that tends to attract a student demographic with a majority leaning strongly toward upholding its professed religious principles, Taylor University experiences very little campus crime, so its campus police presence isn't too overpowering. However, students still have adequate access to safety/protection: for instance, if a student wants a police escort after dark, he/she can call campus safety and get a ride across campus from the police."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors I've taken courses with are of very high quality. They push their students to engage with the course content and ask further questions. They are passionate about what they teach. Smaller class sizes, with Taylor being a small school, are fairly common and very nice because they tend to improve the quality of student/faculty interaction. I've been mostly pleased with the courses I've taken. Even the gen. ed. required courses, such as Foundations (for freshmen) and Biblical Literature, have been quite valuable in my experience–worthwhile content, well-taught."
College Sophomore,4,"I would consider Taylor's social atmosphere to be exceptional, and I think a lot of this can be attributed to the intentional closeness within residence hall groups. Taylor does not separate its dorms by class, so freshmen live amidst peers from all classes, and each wing or floor is generally very intentional about creating a good social environment for its students. Since the campus is small, residence halls are conveniently close to everything. All community bathrooms are well-kept by a great cleaning service, so using them is reasonably pleasant. I've never been a part of the ""room draw"" process (trying to switch dorms) because I've kept to my same room with my same roommate."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience is based on my involvement within the cross country and track programs. I have found the coaches to be genuinely concerned about their athletes' lives–not just as athletes but as students and people. While Taylor's sports (I speak for all the athletic programs now) are not generally highly attended–with the exception of Silent Night, a famous basketball tradition–I think this is to be expected given the small size of our school, as well as its location in a low-population area. I have found my participation in the cross country and track programs at Taylor to be of high athletic and social quality."
College Sophomore,4,"A large part of my experience at Taylor is my involvement in its intercollegiate athletic programs, which has been extremely enriching to me not only athletically, but also spiritually and relationally. However, I still consider my academic and intellectual experiences to be my primary reason for coming to Taylor. I wanted a school with not only decent track & xc programs, but also one that was very committed to its spiritual claims and one of high academic quality–as well as one that had a Chinese program. Taylor met all of these expectations, though I did choose it with the realization that its Chinese program was very new and thus very limited. This, and learning that the school has no linguistics program (while simultaneously realizing that what I was interested in was linguistics), have sometimes left me feeling like my hands are tied as far as academic opportunities go, but I attribute that to the specificity of my interests rather than a failure on the school's part. I signed up knowing full well about the limitations of the Chinese program, and I have chosen not to transfer to a school with a linguistics or larger Chinese program because Taylor has offered me so much in other respects that I do not feel lacking, nor do I feel that my personal vision/goals are being compromised by me staying here. I've found the classes to be very intellectually enriching, and by extension, spiritually enriching. Taylor's courses and professors aid me greatly in my search for truth, which is simultaneously an academic and a spiritual pursuit. The professors are very helpful and knowledgeable. While I can't do much with Chinese here, I am at terms with it because I know that I can and will tackle the language in much greater depth post-undergrad if I am to use it in my eventual occupation (as I hope to), without being out much in the long run. Furthermore, a master's in linguistics, which I plan to pursue, can be attained with undergrad programs provided at Taylor."
College Freshman,4,"I love the environment my school provides. However, I do not appreciate the lack of a surrounding town. It is very difficult to go anywhere off campus due to the distance of things."
Junior,2,"To be honest, I don't think that Taylor was the right fit for me personally. I loved my freshman year, but as I started to stay there longer, the problems with the school became more evident to me.

I started to have a rough time in my dorm and really wanted to move, but its nearly impossible because of the limited space that they have. Taylor prides itself on the community, but I found that over time, this did not seem to be the case. The area around Taylor is extremely boring and isolating. I found myself extremely lonely and anxious being in the middle of nowhere. The dorms have no air conditioning and are extremely run down- which to some people may seem like they bring people together- but to me, it felt like a bad use of my money. 

There are many decisions the leaders in the school began to make that I did not agree with, which led me to eventually transfer. The professors were wonderful though, and to me, the academics of the education department were the best part."
Alum,2,"I think if I had attended TU during any other time (before or after my four years there) I would have loved it more. I went to TU during some of the most volatile times at the University, and without going into too many details, it was probably the worst four years of my life. 

I loved the clubs and the professors, but any success I found after my time there came through hard work and perseverance on my part. Our program overpromised and did not deliver, and the dorm life left me far more shy, introverted, and wary than when I had entered Taylor."
Alum,2,"I did very well academically, I pushed myself to be where I am today. But I do not believe Taylor helped in that process. There is a statistic that 93% of students who apply to Med school from TU get accepted. It wasn't until the class above me had a 10% acceptance rate that I started asking questions. The put a false statistic on their website and had no explanation of this data. Later that year, the university adjusted their website, putting a footnote stating the student had to obtain a 3.8 GPA and do ""well"" on the MCAT. 
This false stat was a big reason I chose Taylor. And while I managed to get into my dream Grad school, I accredit that to my hard work and not anything the university did to help. I have great respect and appreciation for my teachers, but I feel the school as a whole failed its promise to me and lied to me. And for this reason, I am very upset"
Junior,2,"Academics:

-average, but highway robbery when considering the cost ~1500/month
-Upperclassmen may apply to live off campus ~500/month
C"
Freshman,2,"Taylor University is not like most colleges. They focus on community within dorms, but not all dorms are created equal. Although the quality of professors and education are good, TU lacks in social aspects, as there is little to no diversity, not much to do in the area, and very biased ""communities."""
College Freshman,2,"I would like to start this off saying that Taylor is not a bad school, It is just a bad fit for me personally.

It is a very small campus with really nothing to do, and the surrounding town is almost non-existent. The closest real towns are all half an hour away, so either make friends with someone with a car, or bring your own after Thanksgiving. The dorms and wings are pretty cliquey, but its not always bad because you can build up a pretty strong bond. That being said, I have not made a single friend outside my dorm. The people are relatively nice, but there are still jerks here like anywhere else. All of the Professors are pretty nice and attentive to your needs which is nice. You are not allowed to dance here, and you can only visit opposite sex's dorms during certain hours on weekends and the door needs to be propped open. 

Again it is not really a bad school, I know a lot of people here love it. I am having a miserable time however and am bored out of my mind and have made virtually no friends, so I will be transferring next year."
College Freshman,2,tiny town with like 3 places to eat.
College Freshman,2,Feels like high school and you cant be an adult and make your own choices because they are all made for you.
College Freshman,2,We need more dining options and we should have an option on campus to eat late at night.
College Senior,2,"Very few options are available, but that is the price we pay for living in a cornfield. There isn't much around, but that is part of the culture."
College Freshman,2,"It's not such a big deal, because the food here is decent and there's always the Grille if you get an attack of the munchies. But there's pretty much nothing nearby. There's a McDonalds about 15 minutes away; Mexican, Cracker Barrel, and China One 20 minutes away; and Ivanhoes 5 minutes away. They're all decent but anything else is hard to get to. Unless you like picking your own corn for dinner."
College Sophomore,2,"It is extremely hard to apply for off campus housing, not many are accepted. You are granted based on credits and GPA."
College Freshman,2,"Taylor is bigger than the town it's in. Residents come here to eat and to come to events because there aren't any of those options locally. To get to a big city, you have to drive to Indy which is an hour away."
College Freshman,2,"If it rains, it pours. If it snows, you're buried. It makes walking around campus quite hellish, at times."
College Freshman,2,"Driving around blasting music at 3 in the morning. That's about it, unless you want to go to Ball State for a few hours."
College Sophomore,2,Taylor is located in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of great people. There is no nightlife or culture near by. 
College Sophomore,2,Since Taylor is located in such a small town it takes ten minutes to reach even a fast food location. The closest late night option is Taco Bell 10 minutes away or McDonalds 20 minutes away. There are approximately six fast food options within 10 minutes and three other options besides that. 
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do around campus but there are a few small towns a little ways away if you're willing to drive. The locals are super nice and willing to take you in during breaks if you don't have anywhere to go. 
College Junior,2,"Although people of different backgrounds are accepted, they are not understood by the general population of students. The people who go here are also generally conservative."
College Junior,2,"It gets so cold and windy in the winter, and the summers are very hot. If your dorm doesn't have air conditioning, you will be sweating for the first couple of months."
College Junior,2,"I live in Olson hall. The rooms vary from spacious to small. I live in one of the smallest rooms. If you want to change roommates halfway through the year, good luck. The reception for that kind of thing is awful due to politics mostly. Changing rooms, even for the most legitimate reasons doesn't ""foster a sense of community."" The front desk does not often resupply their food. The laundry room is good, and so is the kitchen. Boys are only allowed two days a week for certain hours, so that is very unfortunate."
Recent Alumnus,2,A lot can be done landscaping wise to beautify the campus. There are also several outdated buildings. 
Recent Alumnus,2,Typical mid western weather. Not very predictable. 
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a whole lot going on. 
College Student,2,Not too much.. at least not compared to my old international school.
College Freshman,2,"There are very few restaurants in Upland, IN. Ivanhoe's is probably the most popular restaurant because it is one of the only restaurants within walking distance and it has a great variety of sundaes and shakes as well as a few hamburger/sandwich options and some delicious salads. The next nearest restaurants are in Gas City (about 10 minutes drive away), but those only include a Cracker Barrel, 1 or 2 fast food places, and a few small restaurants such as Payne's -- a coffee shop/diner."
College Freshman,2,"In a way Taylor is like a bubble or a box where the students get so comfortable staying on campus or going to Indy, there is not a strong college and local relationship. There are programs and activities that some of the Taylor students do in the town (i.e. library and church)."
College Freshman,2,"Taylor, being a Christian school, is pretty tough on partiers, pranksters and the like. The grade Taylor recieves might differ based on what you're planning on doing. Looking to go hog wild smoking drinking and engaging in general debauchery? Good luck, matey. There aren't a lot of opportunities and not a lot of grace for repeat offenders. Looking to have guilt-free fun with some midnight pranks and such? The officers are some of the coolest guys you'll meet and generally won't give you a hard time as long as you don't do anything too outlandishly crazy."
College Junior,2,"There are not a wide variety of restaurants by Taylor.  The few restaurants that are close by include Starbucks, McDonald's, Burger King, Ivanhoe's, and Pizza Hut.  If you want a wide variety of restaurants then you will need to drive at least 30-40 minutes away from campus."
College Junior,2,"Public transportation is okay around Taylor.  Since the campus is fairly small, most people can just walk to their destination.  It is hard to find public transportation outside of campus unless you have someone who can drive you to your destination with their vehicle."
College Sophomore,2,"I am definitely not a picky eater and most of  the time I can find something tolerable at the D.C. However, I hate those days when I can't find anything edible. It can be frustrating when a hungry college student who is paying so much tuition has to eat cereal or something nasty."
College Sophomore,2,The weather is extremely bipolar. We had an Indian summer a month  ago where we found ourselves in 70 degree weather. The next week it was in the 30's. One never knows what to wear or if they should bring their umbrella.
College Sophomore,2,"public transportation is pretty much non existent at Taylor because of where they are located. However, there is a system to get a hold of other students to find  a ride somewhere, and for breaks there are campus cars that take students to the nearby airports."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Options. Taylor has one main dining option. Everybody has to get the 21 meal plan. It is not flexible at all. If you don't get breakfast, you lose that meal. They do not roll over and cannot be transferred into anything else. The food is much better than most dining halls."
College Sophomore,2,"No Partying – While there is a a lot to do at night, there is no partying due to a contract all students must sign."
College Senior,2,"Girl's volleyball and men's soccer are both excellent, other sports are decent at best. Indiana's Title 9 law makes introducing new sports nearly impossible. School spirit is apathetic, fans are no-shows"
College Senior,2,"Good, Bad, and Ugly – Some girls here are incredibly attractive, others have potential but don't dress well. Great if you like sweatpants, sweatshirts, and uggs. Guys tend to hang out with guys, girls with girls. Don't even think about walking anywhere with someone of the opposite sex, apparently that means you're dating."
College Freshman,2,If You Have a Car.. It's great if you have a car and are willing to drive for at least 20 minutes in order to get to the restaurants. But if you don't then you're stuck with whatever you cant get at Ivanhoe's or the Handy Andy down the street.
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation is nonexistent due to the small size of the campus. It makes having a car imperative to traveling distances. However, there is not a great need for a car. There are plenty of upperclassmen willing to drive."
College Sophomore,2,"Since Taylor is in the Midwest the winters are brutal. The cornfields result in wind tunnels that makes students dread walking across campus to classes. However, everyone appreciates the nice summer weather and the entire campus flocks to the front lawns to hang out during the beginning and end of the school year.  Just watch out for those middle months!"
College Sophomore,2,"Enforced...But Not Really Hounded. Obviously the school wants you to act in a Godly manner towards everything that you do.  Some people have mess ups, like smoking or anything.  It can be aggravating to not do those things that may help calm you down or that you are used to.  The enforcement can be a little severe, but I haven't had to tussle with it, so I don't know much about it."
College Sophomore,2,"I receive $2,500 scholarship every year at Taylor, if I keep above a certain GPA. This scholarship came from my ACT score, a test I took as a Senior in high school. Taylor usually won't give out a scholarship to a student who scores less that a 27 on the ACT, but I scored a 26 and had above a 4.0 GPA in high school. My family did not think it was fair that I was going to  get nothing because of being one point off in my ACT score, so we talked to my admissions counselor about it and she recognized that my GPA was very high and I was close to the accepting score for the ACT. She was able to give us the $2,500 scholarship, which is less than what I would've gotten for having a 27. What is frustrating is that the next year the restrictions changed for scholarships, and focus more on GPA than ACT score. It upsets me because I could've received more scholarship money if they would've done that for me. Like I said, unfair restrictions."
College Sophomore,2,"Buildings Could Use a Little Help – The facilities at Taylor are all over the map. Some of them, such as Ares, was just re-done, and looks really nice. While the whole English building, Reade, is dingy, and smells bad. The Union, or our student center, is run down and small. It is a cosy environment, but isn't much to show off, at all. The gym is nice."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is a bit of a hassle for students, especially if you live in either Wengatz, Gerig, Olson, or Olson, there is really only three parking lots four dorms. One parking lot is supposed to be for Gerig and English ONLY but because that lot is also close to Wengatz, those people like to park in the Gerig/English lot, making it crowded and forcing others to park over in the other two lots which are for Olson and Wengatz, but Olson tries and take up both lots. So some people have to walk a bit because people can't part in the correct lot."
College Junior,2,"Jumping Through Hoops and Getting Nowhere – I don't live off campus, but the system for applying is ridiculous. If you want to move into an apartment, the best bet is a campus apartment, which in my opinion is not actually living off campus. To achieve total freedom, you must have a high number of credit hours and, preferably, be female. Then, when a high number of people have been denied the privelege to move off (even if they were already living off campus), after too many new students have been admitted into the university, students who have already secured dorm housing and gone through the process of choosing roommates and making plans for the following year are asked to move off campus. This, to me, seems like a backwards and insensible system. I am unsure as to the convenience, cost, and subject of landlords, as I still live in a dorm, but parking and safety I consider to be more subjective to the exact location of the off-campus housing people choose."
College Sophomore,2,"Having a car is a must on Taylor's campus because most students used them to get to church or go do something fun on the weekend. If you want to get to a fun place, you have to be willing to drive. The permits are not expensive, but good luck trying to find a good parking spot!!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Dining Options – These could DEFINITELY be better. There are very few within a short distance of Taylor, and there are even fewer inexpensive, healthy options."
College Sophomore,2,"Extremes in Every Way – It's extremely hot in summer, extremely crisp in fall, extremely cold in winter, and extremely comfortable in spring. In retrospect, there's a perfect little piece of the year for everyone. Summer is always hot and humid, Fall is always dry and crisp, Winter is always cold and snowy, Spring is always comfy and rainy."
College Junior,2,"Closed Community and Denial – This campus is isolated and has no social scene. This makes it difficult to socialize unless you are in a school activity. The student center is really the only environment and many things are closed early. It is difficult to travel to a city without your own transportation. There is no grocery store within 10 miles. While the academic program may be challenging, there is very little attention to the mental health of students. Should have an AA sponsored meeting here."
College Junior,2,If You Are Not Like Them You Won't Fit IN – Mostly uptight. Conservatively dressed. No social life other than school sponsored plays and activities. Live in a surreal world that is isolated and limited; have little experience in the real world or its problems. Naive.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Police – Taylor really wants your money, so it is extremely hard to get kicked out of school. Some people have been kicked out but you have to be really dumb about it.  Most of the time you get talked to by a hall director and that is it nothing to serious."
College Sophomore,2,"Sparse Selection – If you want to eat off campus in Upland, Indiana, there are two choices. Subway or Ivanhoe's, a local yet very delicious restaurant. There are a couple more places in along the highway, and in Gas City ( a town about 10-15 minutes away), but as far as local places go it's just Subway and Ivanoe's."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly Milk (And Bahamians) – TU is largely comprised of ""white folks."" However, many students come from varied backgrounds--the Bahamas, South Korea, South Africa--and their influence lends a sense of diversity to the school. Furthermore, despite being (technically) a Baptist Christian university, there's a huge range of religious thought (at least, 'Christian' religious thought) which helps stimulate open-mindedness and better thinking."
College Freshman,2,"Not Too Bad – Parking can be difficult at times, but other times it isn't bad at all. Really just depends on time of day and if you do have to park somewhere else, the walk isn't too bad to where you were originally goign to park anyway."
College Junior,2,"Upland Dining – If you're dining in Upland, you have two choices (and three gas stations in addition). Ivanhoe's, a classic choice for students, offers more variety in its ice cream choices than actual meals, but the meals offered are delicious (and inexpensive). If you're not in the mood for burgers or nachos, the other option is T.O.P.P.I.T. Conveniently located two blocks from campus, this acronym literally means ""The Only Pizza Place in Town."" Even if it is the only one, it does have delicious pizza."
College Sophomore,2,"they are not the best. Some teams have done well in the past, but other than womens volleyball there are none that are national contenders"
College Student,2,The wind sucks! Don't come to Talyor if you weigh less than 100 lbs you will be blown away!!
College Freshman,2,The weather is very unpredictable. It is probably the worst thing about Taylor
College Sophomore,2,"You Need a Car – If you want to go anywhere off campus, you need a car or a friend with a car. Most things on campus are withing walking distance, but everything off-campus requires a drive."
College Junior,2,"Taylor does try to be as diverse as possible, but since there is such a high price tag and not a lot of financial aid, combined with being in the middle of rural Indiana, the average student is white with a tiny bit of financial aid."
Alum,1,"I am an Alumni of Taylor University. My hard work allowed me to be accepted into a very prestigious dental school. All this aside, I would never recommend someone attend Taylor. 
Res life at Taylor ruined my experience as well as the experience of every one of my friends who has graduated from the school. The Res Life staff is more interested in making examples of people and following the rules than it is in investing in the growth of the students. 
A great example of this is I know of an RA who got fired from his position after legally drinking a beer; whereas, a student sexually assaulted a girl on campus, but Res life ignored the incident and never took action. 
If you are looking for a shallow community, this is the place for you. But if you actually want to grow as an individual and meet genuine people, then I would suggest another university."
Junior,1,"Well, they hid a sex offender. They lied to me about my finances. Had one of their professors treat me like dirt. And they tore up my loans and scholarships."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,There are no parties.  There is nothing to do at this school.
College Freshman,1,nothing really unless you drive
College Freshman,1,We don't have parties like that. We have open houses and do fun things besides getting drunk.
College Freshman,1,The purpose of the school is not to party so if you want a party go to Ball State.
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We don't have the typical parties here!
College Senior,1,Taylor is the only thing around. The school is in the middle of nowhere.
College Senior,1,We do not have a greek life. We are very attached to our dorm floors/wings. We have stereotypes and traditions for each dorm.
College Freshman,1,I applied for fin aid but did not receive anything.
College Freshman,1,"Indiana is incredibly flat. So any snow or rain hits campus hard. This winter has been especially awful. There is nothing to block the wind, so we were constantly in ""it feels like"" temperatures that were in double-digit, sub-zero temperatures. Also, campus is just small enough that walking is the only way to get around, but big enough, that it takes 10 or 15 minutes to get to class."
College Freshman,1,There isn't any night-life options. The school doesn't really condone that behavior either.
College Freshman,1,"It's simple, there isn't much off-campus dining. The only places we have are 15-20 min away. "
College Junior,1,We do not have campus transportation.
College Junior,1,Taylor doesn't have a 'nightlife'. Taylor is a dry campus and it is tightly enforced. 
College Junior,1,"Literally the worst dining plan ever. The Dining commons is only open certain hours for breakfast lunch and dinner and unless you are a senior or have a filled schedule it is you're only option. being an on campus student you are required to buy this poor value dining plan. The Dining Commons lacks both variety and quality. On the weekends there are even less options for food. I go out whenever I can, although there are few restaurants nearby. "
College Junior,1,"Taylor has awful off campus housing. not because there aren't houses and apartments available, it's simply that Taylor will not let you move into them. Taylor trys hard to keep students on campus regardless of what students want. Taylor claims its to 'build community' but the majority reason is they just want your money."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are very few off-campus housing options at Taylor University. Taylor prides itself on being a close knit community, and therefore most students are encouraged to life on campus during their time at Taylor. "

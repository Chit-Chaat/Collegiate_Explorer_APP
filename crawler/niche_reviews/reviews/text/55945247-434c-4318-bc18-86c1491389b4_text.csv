The professors I had worked with my high school schedule and still provided all the materials I needed to succeed. Overall my experience with Georgia Military College was very nice and I recommend it to dual enrollment students.
Sophomore,5,"I love that the entire staff is dedicated to making you not only have a pleasurable experience but that your success is as important to them, as it is you. I’ve attended two schools prior and Ga Military is my far my favorite school."
Freshman,5,"Georgia Military College is a great 2 year college!! The Professor to student ratio is very small, so no worries about having huge classes and never feeling like you have time to speak with the professor. All the campuses are in smaller towns but they are fairly nice towns. Georgia Military has a long list of schools you can transfer to on their web site, so that makes your options very large. They also work very well with military veterans. Being that I am a vet they set me up with someone on Moody AFB that is right up the road from the school and he got me all set up and was willing to work with all my special requests."
Freshman,5,My experience with Georgia Military College has been amazing. Everything from the staff to the classroom settings has made the campus feel welcoming and comforting. I have never had a negative experience in my 2 years of attending one of their campuses. I recommend it for anyone whether it's for someone who recently graduated or is looking to go back to school.
Sophomore,5,Great one-on-one help with the professors. Faculty treats you like family. Advisor really help to try and find the best classes fit for you and your schedule.
Sophomore,5,It's a great place to start off your college education if you are not ready for a 4 year institution.
Sophomore,5,The classes are small. This gives professionals a chance to help more individuals with day to day issues. It is quarters which make the time fly by!
Freshman,5,My Experience at Georgia Military College has been amazing I love the way they always have events  going on that we can participate in.I love how they make sure that we understand our work and last but not least I love how they’re alway trying to help us
Freshman,5,It is a great school to start off college with. with being it being with it being cheap and you can work on campus. their classes are go to get into. with starting a stable gpa
Junior,5,I really enjoy attending Georgia Military College. I benefit greatly from the overall size of the school. Georgia Military College is a smaller university with more one-on-one opportunities. This provides a great learning environment and supports a more personally tailored education. They also accept and transfer credits very well compared to many other colleges in the area. I would recommend Georgia Military College to anyone.
Sophomore,5,"I loved Georgia Military College because they worked so well with my schedule, and I was able to work full time whilst completing my Associates Degree. They worked with me while still being in high school, and I was able to get my degree for free."
Freshman,5,I LOVE HOW GMC HAS WELCOMED ME AFTER NOT BEING IN SCHOOL FOR 10+ YEARS. GMC HAS BEEN VERY EAGER TO MAKE SURE THAT I ACHIEVE MY GOALS. I HAVE BEEN SPREADING HOW GOOD GMC WORKS WELL WITH THEY STUDENTS.
Freshman,5,"This college is an amazing experience.  You can start here and go anywhere, they help with everything.  Most of the classes done at Georgia Military College can be transferred to a four year university."
Sophomore,5,I attend the Fayetteville campus and love the smaller classrooms - very helpful to someone who has been out of high school for over twenty years.  The only thing I would change would be the food in the cafeteria.
Freshman,5,I recently heard about how this school added a class that I have been wanting to take up and now I have an opportunity to take it and it's closer to home.
Sophomore,5,It’s a small college but the professor and everyone there are so helpful they have taught me so much that I didn’t ever know
Alum,5,"GMC is truly the best decision I’ve made! The process to obtain a degree is not lengthy by any means! On top of earning a degree at a fast pace, the tuition is affordable. The professors, administration staff, student workers, and tutors are extremely helpful. They cater to the needs of all students effectively. Based off their interactions with their students, it is evident that a student’s needs/questions are in their absolute best interests. Best decision I made was choosing GMC!"
Freshman,5,I love this college. The class scedules are very flexible and the advisors are willing to work with your schedule. They have online classes that are flexiable as well. This is the first community college I have been to and so far its going well.
Junior,5,I'm at the valdosta campus and I love everything about this school. You can get your courses done in 8 weeks and they are least expensive!
Sophomore,5,"Great starter school to attend, especially for individuals that cannot yet attend a full time on campus life. Great for military members abroad."
Alum,5,"I gave Georgia Military College a 5 star or “excellent” rating, because the smaller classroom size allowed my professors to give more attention each student.  This is the first college that I have ever attended after high school, and I will never forget my experience there.  I receive complements from my friends and family, because I performed well in my classes at Georgia Military College.  While I was pursuing my Associates degree, the advising staff helped me to choose the right classes.  When I reviewed my final transcript, it showed two years of hard work and I felt extremely proud of myself."
Freshman,5,So far ok just interested in becoming a cadet with the college and meeting ssn awesome adminatration team.
Niche User,5,I currently attend GMC in Valdosta. I am a dual enrollment attending Valdosta High as well.  I enjoy my experience at the campus. The staff members and professors are kind and helpful. They are understand that I am a high school student but do not treat me differently from other students. This is something I appreciate because I am able to truly go through a college experience without being pampered. The courses are challenging to a extent. I am always able to do well in the many courses I have taken. My experience at GMC is preparing me from College at the next level.
Freshman,5,I LOVE GMC! All of my teachers have been very helpful and friendly. They offer free tutoring and a lot of other free services. GMC always has some type of giveaway drawing going on and it makes school exciting and fun!
Freshman,5,The staff at GMC are fully dedicated and committed to helping students achieve their academic goals in order for them to be completely prepared to transfer to a 4-year college. The academic advisers and financial aid department constantly stay in contact with students to make sure that they are on track to be successful.
Sophomore,5,"This school is a very good school. The teachers are nice and since I am a dual enrollment student, everything is paid for."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Georgia Military College. The teachers are very helpful and the hours are flexible. I work full time and I'm a mother of four and I needed to school that would fit in and around my schedule and Georgia Military college was the only college that fitted perfectly with my schedule.
Freshman,5,"I just started and im doing online courses, but overall the experience has been amazing. Free tutoring, Military lounge, and very helpful administration."
Junior,5,I enjoy this school! Class sizes are small so you get more time with the teacher for questions and being able to understand what your learning. The students and teachers are also very nice
Freshman,5,"I am in the Augusta Campus section, it was not listed so i chose the milledgeville campus instead. The campus so far has a great location, teachers are amazing at trying to understand your learning style and finding ways to see that your get your assignment completed within the set amount of time. The students that attend this collage are very friendly and the staff is very helpful at guiding you to where you need to be financially and academically."
Sophomore,5,"i love this school. Everyone, including staff and students, are so helpful and very nice. Anyone you talk to can answer your questions and its just perfect all around."
Niche User,5,"I classes with GMC through their campus in Columbus, GA. The professors and advisors were thorough and were very helpful. Great outside resources such as tutors and library were available. I had a great experience here!"
Niche User,5,I love the campus and how much it involves its' students. It provides numerous opportunities for students to get involved in community service and work. It is very easy to register for classes and to talk to advisement if help was needed. Teachers are very open to taking criticism on how to improve teaching styles to ensure that learning is effortless for their students.
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Military College in Warner Robins is a phenomenal junior college. Georgia Military College provides great instructors and professors that assist college students in developing advanced critical thinking abilities. At this institution I was able to complete the course work to attain an associate degree in business administration. Their classroom facilities welcome small audiences on a mission to academic success. This campus also provides superlative advisement and financial aid assistance. The advisors are friendly and take time with students to make sure they are on the correct path to graduation. However, it would be nice if Georgia Military College added more degree programs such as atmospheric science, finance, and meteorology. I enjoyed the school’s work study program that offered students with great grades time to work and study. Overall the school is just a wonderful place to start when transitioning from high school to college."
Freshman,5,Great experience at GMC! Faculty is very helpful and there to see you succeed! Classes are based on quarter system rather than semesters so be ready to learn quick.
Sophomore,5,I really love the fact that the people who work here care about your future. As long as you try your best and use the help give to you.
Freshman,5,"Well for starters it’s a great school even though I attend another gmc campus which is located in Valdosta Georgia. I can still complete this survey because we all focus on the same goals especially understanding the QEP which is also known as the quality enhancement plan which focuses on makeing students really think and make better choices, also known as critical thinking."
Sophomore,5,I absolutly love GMC. It is a great school where all of the teachers care and are very willing to help!!
Sophomore,5,Wonderful college. All professors are excellent and seem to really care about their students' success. Highly recommended. Cost of attending is a lot more affordable than a four year university.
Sophomore,5,This has been a great experience of college for me. The professor are great and want you do your best and they do everything they can to help you get propered for text and exams. All in all it's a great college.
Senior,5,I am a current student at Georgia Military College. I love this college. It has been the greatest experience yet. My instructors are awesome and very knowledgeable of the content they're teaching. They're always willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"I like that Georgia Military College makes every college student feel like they can accomplish anything he students want, the teachers care about their students from their classroom and to other teachers classroom. The campus is very safe and well kept. My classroom environment is very hands on."
Senior,5,"Georgia Military College has given me the ability to go back to school. It is very hard for me to pay for school, so they allow me to pay payments. Every check they get half of it. The classrooms are smaller and the class size is smaller. I believe they care more about the students. The school has a good library and resources to help a student succeed. I would recommend GMC to anyone."
Sophomore,5,GMC is a great place to start no matter what your looking for. Teachers really help you in whatever you need extra help in. Campus is very nice. Students are friendly and very respectful
Freshman,5,"CONSIDERING THIS BEING MY FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE, SO FAR GMC COLLEGE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD. CLASSES AREN'T OVER PACKED. ANY DIRECT QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THEY CAN ASSIST YOU THE BEST WAY THAT THEY CAN."
Freshman,5,"I love the small classes and the instuctors willingness to teach. The students are very helpful and well mannered, I like the fact that all staff at this schhol wants every student to excel and at a high level. I would like to see the hours change with more earlier classes so I can spend nore time with my kids."
Sophomore,5,"I had so many great teachers at Georgia Military College. They were very caring and extremely helpful. At Georgia Military College, you feel welcomed, and students and faculty members are so friendly."
College Junior,5,"My major is biology. Although I'm going to transfer, my current courses are from the Associate's in biology curriculum from GMC. I had to take college algebra, chemistry 1&2, English 101&102 and a bunch of other core science classes. The work load is relatively okay and manageable"
Freshman,4,At first it is hard but there are your instructors that are always there to help when needed. They give there up most best advise to help at the moments that are difficult.
Sophomore,4,"Was a great college, overall very good institution. They are eager to help you in any way they can. The professors are happy to help you and work with you to help you achieve your overall goals."
Alum,4,"As a new transfer to Georgia College & State University, I have enjoyed the simple, straightforward applications of both academic and administrative processes at Georgia Military College, which GC&SU cannot match with their wide, varied student body. GMC is an excellent stepping stone into higher education, and it is easy for dedicated students to excel with free tutoring, online resources, and skilled professors who go above and beyond to assist their students."
Alum,4,"With the exception of one unhelpful professor (which I consider an anomaly), when I struggled to transition to online learning, there were so many people lining up to help me. I emailed with a staff member at the library to assist me with research, and the Dean of Online Students would look over my assignments and offer advice. The online classes are structured, the professors are prompt in replies and helpful with answering questions, and the expectations are straightforward. Although there is tiny variety from instructor to instructor, overall, the online learning system is a simple, effective 8-week system."
Alum,4,"As a working mom, I did need to take some classes online. However, since I always took at least one on-campus class, I was able to ask campus personnel for answers and help with my online classes. Some online professors respond and communicate better than others. I think I only had one class where taking the class with a more supportive professor was not an option. Overall though, I would say I had a good online learning experience."
Sophomore,4,Georgia Military College is a good beginner school. The professors are very nice and flexible. Classes are good.
Sophomore,4,"Okay school. Great Price, Average Professors, Strong Safety, Fun fact you do not have to be military to attend this school. I had some amazing professors and some not so great. There is no party scene, because we all commute from home to the campus."
Junior,4,"I like that this college does quarter hours- but that means courses are condensed, so make sure you know how much of a workload you can take on. This school offers online science degrees which is nice because you cannot find that often, and that is why I transferred here. The counselors are nice, and they have academic success coaches that reach out to you when they are concerned about your grades, missing assignments, etc. I have not seen any of the campuses as I am an online student, but it is very easy to navigate the classes online. I will say that the online sciences are very strenuous- so it may not be a good idea to take them online unless you are a science major or really love science. I suggest going to rate my professor before deciding what courses you will take! They have a flat rate cost per credit hour and no specific in state/ out of state tuition, but I feel that the cost is  a bit high per course."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great college filled with some of the most delightful teachers. It is a wonderful place to come for earning a two year degree or if you need to ""boost"" your GPA."
Sophomore,4,"I am a State Service cadet participating in the Early Commissioning Program. The Corps of Cadets is not for everyone and can be vary invasive on your personal life, but all MSD cadre and faculty and staff are very pleasant to work with."
Freshman,4,The teachers give you several opportunities to pass. The school as a whole is its own community. Everyone is very connected and involved.
Senior,4,"It is a really good campus, much like a lot of the GMC campuses found throughout Georgia. They also have a pretty strong debate team. I would definitely recommend this school for anyone to attend, especially if you are looking to have your associate's degree within no time!"
Freshman,4,So far I’ve had a pretty great experience. It’s a nice small community college do these classes are easy to find. The teachers are great so far even though it’s only my freshman year. I haven’t really tried the food on campus but I see a lot of other students eating there.The only problem is that a lot of times the on campus activities can seem pretty bland.I really enjoy going here though and I feel like it’s a great place to mature before going off into the real world it gives you time to get your act together so that you won’t make as many mistakes.I hope to continue my success for the next two years and transfer to a four year university.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Georgia military college has been very enlightening. The campus is close to home so it does not take me very long to get to class. The teachers are very informative and will go the extra mile to ensure that I understand the material. The campus itself is very easy to navigate around and it always well-kept. Here at GMC they are not only working tlwards greatness, but they are changing lives while doing it."
Niche User,4,I really love this school because it just feels like home. Everyone here is so friendly and super willing to help out with anything you need. The academics here are great as well except i dont feel as tho the professers are teaching in a way that is fair to everyone.
Freshman,4,"I really loved how devoted the professors were to us. They are all very passionate, and that helps boost the learning curve. I also love the diversity this school has. Since arriving here I have met people from all over the world."
Sophomore,4,The school is very nice and welcoming to new students. The professors are always there to help you when you need help. The fellow classmates have been very nice. I would recommend this school to anyone.
Alum,4,"I had a great time attending Georgia Military College.  I really liked it because it was a small, community college.  I’m not really fond of big schools.  I even like that all of the classes on lasted 8 weeks!  So I finished a lot of courses in such short time span.  All of the teachers are great and are willing to help every student."
Freshman,4,Everyone that I met was nice and willing to help with anything I needed or wanted know. The atmosphere of the campus was chill and not to crowded or completely empty but felt safe and comfortable
Alum,4,Georgia Military College served as an excellent stepping stone for my 4 year college career. They specialize in jump starting education. GMC also proves to be an excellent place to start school if you have taken a significant amount of time off. Small class sizes allow for in depth conversation.
Senior,4,the school is very much a good school. the best part about the school to me is truly the professors and staff that they have there. The staff is great and always tries to make sure the students make the best possible choice. the professors make classes so easy and are always willing to help students out.
Freshman,4,"Georgia Military has many benefits. Classes are small and functional, tuition isn't very expensive, there's no military obligation, around the clock is available whether it be in person or via email. Students and staff are the best. Everyone is respectful and very kind here."
Sophomore,4,I love the flexibility of this college. With most of it's degree programs being offered online it allows you to work and still go to school. The online work can be a little time consuming but otherwise a great school.
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about Georgia Military College is the diversity of their students and the enrichment of their courses. Every student stems from a different part of  Georgia, so I get to learn about other places in this beautiful state. I also enjoy how diverse the classes are. GMC offers many courses ranging from Algebra to Spanish to Wellness. The only thing I'd like them to improve is making it easier to get in touch with teachers and administrators."
Sophomore,4,If was a very great school. The campus was very small so there werent many students in the classes. That made it easier to talk with your teachers.
Sophomore,4,It's a good school. Made to accommodate all types of students and it helps to have free tutoring as well as a 24-hr library.
Graduate Student,4,"What I really like about Georgia Military College is the diversity it has to offer. The classes are not easy but with the professors providing work hours it makes getting the grade you work for much easier. It has a variety of sports ,corps of cadets ( Army and Coast Guard)."
Sophomore,4,I like the school because its close to home and I'm able to graduate and move on to a 4-year college.
Sophomore,4,"I love their online learning system.  I am a full time, online college student and their online program provides a flexible and easy way of learning."
Sophomore,4,"Absolutely fantastic school. Start here, go anywhere is the moto at this school and it's completely true. The classes are small and the teachers are attentive. It feels like everyone is interested in my success and the success of the other students. I work and go to school full-time, and it easy for me to find classes that for my schedule. Also any classes that aren’t available, can be taken online. If you have the drive and are willing to put in the work, this school is the place for you. I 100% recommend the Fayetteville and Fairburn campus.les."
Sophomore,4,Georgia Military College has professional teachers and a good learning environment. The staff works well with the students and they are flexible. The staff and administration is always available to help the students and are positive people. It is good to have positive people that are willing to assist you throughout your college experience.
Niche User,4,"I actually have attended the smaller version of the Milledgeville campus in Columbus, Georgia, and I have enjoyed my experience with the Columbus campus of Georgia Military College! The only thing that I would change about it is the class offerings. Sometimes they only have one offering of a certain class I need, and I cannot make it to that offering. It puts me behind in that class an entire term!"
Sophomore,4,"I like the school the way it is, I attend the Augusta campus. There are no  dorms so I stay at home. There are no sports but they attempt to try different activities to get students involved. The student body is nice and everyone is different in their own way. The professors help you to their fullest potential. Sometimes we get free pizza. Parking lot fills up fast."
Freshman,4,Georgia Military is a great school! They have much to offer to all students. The professors are wonderful and are more then glad to take time out of their day to sit down and chat with students about anything wether it be class related or just life choices.
Niche User,4,I attend the Fayetteville campus and so far its ben good. The teachers are nice and teach well and the work is easy to grasp.
Sophomore,4,My experience at GMC was a positive one. It's a good school to work on raising your GPA and a great starting point for your academic career.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Military College is a great small college to attend if you are looking for convenient secondary schooling. The Augusta campus has tremendous professors and amazing staff. Because the Augusta campus is not part of the main campus in Milledgeville,  the small campus does not have a food facility, just a few snack/drink machines. Also, because a lot of the students attending there are adults with families and careers already, high school students, or students looking to get there associates degrees there are no parties or athletic programs."
Freshman,4,"Georgia Military College in Augusta, Georgia is an awesome community college for students who have been out of school for three years or more. Admissions, faculty, and staff create a very friendly environment that can make one's college experience blissful. There are no gray areas at this school so what you see is what you get. To keep spirits high, the GMC staff will host pizza parties, popcorn parties, and bring in goodies to celebrate the Georgia Military College anniversary. The academic curriculum is not too challenging but does require to put forth some effort. Free tutoring is also available all throughout the week as well. Resources are readily available to all students that attend GMC."
Alum,4,"I loved that I was able to start a new club easily and could work with the school closely to help achieve this personal goal of mine. I will always be grateful to the tutoring lab and the help they gave me to help me reach my all time lifetime goal of getting honors in college.
What needs to be improved is that the prep school is in a way ""the bully"" of the school. If I was down stairs eating lunch in their cafeteria, I would be told that I couldn't sit where I was anymore and had to leave. The cater more to the prep school than to the actual college students. I ended up finishing my degree online because of how the school handled that situation as a whole."
Freshman,4,"GMC's Augusta campus is a great college for getting an Associate. The  students are friendly, the staff are efficient and helpful, and the professors are willing to help. It has many clubs and there are a lot of opportunities and events. It also has a student lounge with coffee and vending machines. Though one of the things that could be improved, would be a bigger and more comfortable outside area."
Niche User,4,Gives high school students the opportunity to take college classes and receive high school credit as well as college credit.
Freshman,4,"Georgia Military College is a very small, two year community college located in a lively college town in middle Georgia. Since GMC is so small, there are not as many clubs and organizations as bigger universities, but they do offer activities for students to participate in. The tuition is very affordable, and includes several useful assets for students to use. In the tuition fees, GMC incorporates a book rental fee so you don't have to buy books every quarter, and they include a tutoring fee that allows them to provide tutors for every subject that are available most days of the week."
Freshman,4,The staff is very dedicated to the success of each student and are very helpful in the process of students transferring to other colleges or universities to complete their degree.
Freshman,4,"I had a excellent experience at GMC. The teachers were helpful, their instruction were fun and easy to understand. It felt like any regular class, but had the college teachings and atmosphere. Although I was just a dual enrollment student it helped prepare me for college. Also selecting your class was a smooth process and teachers would reminder students of when to register for the next quarter class. The only down side was that the online class. You have to remind your self to check EVERY SINGLE inbox no matter what because there is no notification or alert that the teacher announce anything which would cause you to fail classes like I did, and you won't really have an opportunity to change your grade, but that's all part of an obstacle that I had to learn. Other than that I would recommend any student either your in high school or taking a gap year or you want to earn some money before heading to a 4 year college GMC is an awesome place to start."
Freshman,4,"I am currently at Georgia Military College and this is my first year. When I first started this past fall I was nevous because I was unaware of how I am in a college setting an wether or not I can keep up. So far I love this college. My Fairburn campus is small but convient. I like that the classes are small and intimate so I can easily voice my concerns to my instructor. I am not comfortable in College. This college helped me keep a positive mind and stay motivated. After being here at Georgia Military College in Fairburn, GA, I know that I can will succeed anywhere. "
College Senior,4,So far Georgia Military College (GMC) has been a wonderful experience from the professors to fellow classmates. I would recommend this institution to anyone who wants to start small and end big!
College Sophomore,4,I have not started school yet
College Senior,4,Happy I can transfer my credits anywhere
College Senior,4,"Classes have been flexible but - since I'm getting closer to finishing my core classes Im  having a little problem with my schedule. Science classes offered doing the day -when i work. Fall quarter limitation has put me in a bind because i can only take one class, therefore no financial aid"
College Senior,4,The classes have been average . Professors have been great. But certain classes such as college algebra should evaluate their curriculum -so much to take in. The math class was fast paced and if you missed one concept you would be totally loss. I passed the class barely with a c
College Freshman,4,The school has career centers to help graduates find jobs.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are smaller than universities so it's easier for more one-on-one interactions with the professors.
College Junior,4,The flexibility is great at GMC. I have all afternoon classes that fit my busy work schedule perfectly so I'm never late to class or work.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are challenging and informative, helpful to me."
College Sophomore,4,I like the school because of its many campuses. Everyone there is helpful
College Junior,4,The professors at the Fairburn are very good. They are understanding and they help even after class with whatever issues you might be having with the class. Class size is very reasonable. Usually ranges from 6-30 students depending on the class and professor.
College Junior,4,Transferring credits is very easy. You don't have to go all the way to the school to ask for your transcript. You can do it easily online.
College Junior,4,I was easily able to select the classes I desired for my degree.
College Junior,4,The professors provide outside of class help if it is needed.
College Junior,4,I was offered a position to help others in mathematics.
Freshman,2,While going to middle Georgia I enjoyed doing my classes online its much easier and I can pick my own time to do the work.
Sophomore,2,Georgia Military College doesn't try to help you get ahead. They only care about how much money you are paying in tuition. They do not care about the individual student.
College Junior,2,GMC dose not have my path of career.
College Junior,2,"There has only been one employers recruit one campus, that I have known of. I do plan on doing an internship soon."
College Freshman,2,"Although I no doubt had Hope, the financial aid office lost my information several times and I did not begin the school year with Hope. After attempting and failing to communicate with them several time, I went to the office. Here, I was told it would take another two weeks for my Hope to process. I eventually got the rest of my tuition covered by Hope, but it was just a difficult and frustrating process."
College Freshman,2,I don't feel that I am very challenged when it comes to the academic portion of the school. Courses are not rigorous and classes are often canceled without any assigned work.This is the reason I am looking to transfer to a larger school.
College Freshman,2,it was hard to communicate with the people at the school.
College Freshman,2,"not unique at all, very plain and usual school."
College Junior,2,"I am a student at Gmc- Warner Robins and the financial aid I received for my schooling did not pay for my classes and I still have an unpaid balance that has to be paid before the 19th of this month(September) at noon. I was granted an estimate of 1,495 for my pell grant and 5,500 for an direct Stafford loan. From these two estimates I still have pending amounts."
College Senior,2,"The online course is very irrational, in not well setup and its hard to follow again"
College Junior,2,I DO NOT LIKE THE WAY WE SUBMIT WORK. IT IS UNRELIABLE.
College Junior,2,"At GMC, there is an online library, but nothing you can really use. The students that are supposed to be helping others have a lot of attitude most of the time. There are no athletic centers unless you are able to get onto the base, which some of us are not familiar with. No campus activities other than blood drives or ""pizza days""."
College Junior,2,"They do offer tutoring which I think is great, but we do not even have an actual library, which is horrible, in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"It is kind of hard to rank this, as e-mail sometimes seems to lack some level of personality.  Face to face is nice, but the online course interactions are usually friendly and helpful.  GMC has a very good online process for most things that are important, just be sure you always follow up though."
College Freshman,2,GMC in warner robins has nothing at all to offer us except food every once in a while
College Freshman,2,"Unfortuantly in attending such a small school there isn't really much of a campus. we have one tutoring center, two computer labs, a smoking area and a kitchen. However with such a small number of students there we don't need large facilities."
College Senior,2,"The School is great for getting through your first 2 years, but thats why we do not go to GMC to learn, you have to memorize and move on."
College Freshman,2,"Poor Communication – GMC has not had great communication with the student.  It is very difficult to get in touch with someone in the business office/financial aid/advisor.  I have called and e-mailed a few times and never received a response so I drove out there and finally did get some answers.  Other than that, they offer evening classes so I can work during the day.  This is why I chose GMC."
Sophomore,1,"You would think that going to a military school, the professors would be understanding of your military circumstances. I am currently activated for COVID-19 relief and have limited access to internet for school work. I sent my orders and followed all the correct protocols for letting them know my situation. Granted, two of my professors were very understanding with deadlines while the third did not care that I was activated and proceeded to give me no extensions on any of my work. Seems like GMC is a weak excuse for a military school and I am GLAD to be leaving a school where professors do not care about their students and only about themselves. Thinking about a cheap education? Literally go to any other JUCO and avoid the self-centered teachers."
College Junior,1,I have a legally blind teacher. Its kind of hard. I just wish I had a little  more work and understanding in the class instead of off talking topics.
College Junior,1,Online courses aren't for everybody. That's all I have to say for a review. I am a much better student in a physical classroom on campus.
College Freshman,1,"The network is so slow, that it is almost impossible to do homework on the internet."
College Junior,1,"Because I am a transient I am not allowed to use any form of financial aid, therefore I am forced to pay out of pocket."
College Freshman,1,I keep having problems with taken test on my computer. I asked the teacher if she could help me out but she said no can do. She called me buy my name until the last email she sent me then she called me Angela. I founded it kind of rude by i moved on
College Junior,1,"I received horrible aid, not even enough for a book. I am unemployed, and I am paying full tuition. I thought colleges were supposed to be cheaper than universities, I am pretty much paying the same."
College Junior,1,"My major is social work, and there are not many courses that i can take specifically for social work."
Recent Alumnus,1,Needs Work – The Student body is almost never brought together. We all come there to go to class and leave as soon as possible. It was a good school to go in and get my classes done. Definitely not social life distractions at this campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,13Th Year – it reminds me of doing an additional year of high school. I didn't learn anything new. I was just reminded of everything I did know.
Recent Alumnus,1,Lacking Variety – While yes they do have all your Gen ED classes you need it is hard to fill your elective portion of the degree because they have barely any that one would find as an elective or even interesting for that matter.
College Junior,1,"GMC lacks in these departments. There are few activities for students, the library is nearly all electronic, and there are no athletic centers at this campus."
College Senior,1,I attend Georgia Military College and every since I have attended school here the financial aid office always have had trouble processing my aid.Sometimes it get so bad I have to fax my documents to the main campus myself to make sure my aid gets processed properly.Also they have had financial Advisors in the pass that didn't know a thing about financial Aid so I really didn't under how was she really suppose to help me when she couldn't tell me of any scholarships or source of aid to apply for. As a result of that I was forced to pay for college to pay the balance that was due after my Pell Grant was applied.
College Sophomore,1,Finacial Catastrophe – The schools financialaid officer is not educated in her job.  I have often made the joke what does it mean when the person handling your money is still in lss math. (not at college level)

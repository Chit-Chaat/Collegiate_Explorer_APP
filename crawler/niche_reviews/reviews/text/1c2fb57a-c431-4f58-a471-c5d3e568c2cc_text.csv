Freshman,5,"I am currently in my freshman year of college and I am in love with this school. When applying to schools I considered this my dream school. The campus is gorgeous (especially in the fall), the people are so friendly, academics are great, and the school sets you up very well for life after college."
Alum,5,"JMU has such an amazing community. The professors, staff, and alumni care about the success of their students.  It truly was the best 4 years."
Freshman,5,"Originally, I only had 2 fully online classes before everything was moved online. However, when it was announced that all classes would transition to online, my professors were quick with how the transition would work. My classes that were synchronous stayed synchronous, so it wasn't too hard to adjust to the schedule. I've only had one time where a teacher had technical difficulties resulting in a cancelation of class, but that didn't hinder our learning track at all."
Junior,5,"JMU has the best food, the best people and the best environment that makes you feel really welcome. The campus and off-campus life is very lively. The education material at JMU is also very tough but very rewarding."
Niche User,5,"Daughter did very well during the online period. Well handled by her professors during the pandemic to ensure students were successful, will be attending in the fall and taking in person as well as online classes."
Niche User,5,"Amazing and supportive staff. Excellent communication with parents and students. Incredible community, involved parents"
Alum,5,Amazing faculty and students.  I felt the professors did a great job of helping students and offering extra study sessions.
Sophomore,5,JMU is a great environment for all kinds of students from across the world and has been very open to me and all of my friends since my arrival.
Sophomore,5,"The community is SO accepting and diverse. You are able to learn about anything you are passionate about and can even make your own major! There truly is a place for everyone since it is such a diverse community which makes it easy to call home. Not to mention the food at the dining hall is very appetizing and whatever you are craving, they have! When I'm not there I miss it and feel homesick. Not to mention the professors truly want to see their students succeed to matter what they are involved in or even if it is just a gen ed class. This is home."
Sophomore,5,"Once COVID-19 happened and we had to take classes online, I was heartbroken because I would miss the classroom and the campus but professors were very understanding once classes went online because they too were struggling with the change. I had the same access to my professors as I did while on campus even though it wasn't in person."
Sophomore,5,I LOVE JMU! I would not want to go anywhere else. I love the community and openness surrounding the campus. The people are all so welcoming and the campus is absolutely gorgeous.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a class online and I had a good experience with it. The professor did a good job at communicating as well as giving us resources to succeed.
Junior,5,I took online classes and they went very well. My professors are always quick to respond and still allow me to learn as much as I would in a classroom.
Freshman,5,"I feel a sense of belonging when I'm on campus. Ever since the first time I visited during high school, I knew that this would become my home away from home. Everyone I've met at the school"
Junior,5,"It is a great school with a beautiful campus, good food, and great academics. I am currently a junior Chemistry major and I love it."
Junior,5,"COVID had to transfer to online studying. Professors were really good with the change, worked efficiently on transferring the coursework to online."
Freshman,5,JMU is an excellent place to get a higher education. They have plenty of extra-curricular activities to have fun along with getting an education.  Their sports teams are worth following and their marching band is outstanding. You will feel at home while attending JMU.
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any online classes at James Madison University.  However, based on experience from other classes, I imagine that the online classes are just as good as traditional."
Alum,5,"The best undergrad college experience one could ask for. Endless opportunities for student involvement in clubs/sports/research/greek life/etc. A stunning campus. Amazing  professors who go above and beyond to assist students. Anything you want to do or be involved with, you can find it here. Go Dukes!"
Alum,5,"The online components of my classes were simple and easy to navigate through ""Canvas"" - this being the main hub for assignments, documents, and important links."
Graduate Student,5,JMU has been a great graduate school with experienced professors and a great cohort of students to learn from. I’m glad I chose JMU.
Junior,5,"The campus life is amazing, there's endless organizations/groups/events to be involved in and no day is boring. The classes are challenging but rewarding and I feel like I'm getting the most out of my education here!"
Junior,5,I love being a member of the JMU community. You always feel welcome and the academics are really impressive. I would recommend JMU to anyone!
Junior,5,The professors were very open and helpful during this difficult time. They adapted well and I had no problems transitioning into online learning.
Sophomore,5,Amazing school with a great environment and opportunities to learn and make the best 4 years of your life.
Sophomore,5,The school spirit is probably the best part about attending James Madison University and the professors and students really care for each other.
Alum,5,My years at James Madison University were the best of my life. I highly recommend that perspective students attend this institution. The academics will prepare you to be successful in life whether that be through your future studies or professional career. Go Dukes!
Senior,5,"As a senior Special Education major, James Madison University has prepared me to become the person I am today. From providing students with abundant study/research resources, financial assistance to low-income/middle-class families, and numerous major/minor selection, JMU truly cultivate each and every student's learning."
Alum,5,"Best choice I ever made! Very glad I attended. The school continues to get better and better each year. Live on campus for the first two years, it’s worth it."
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman at James Madison University starting the fall of 2020. I am super excited! Due to this corona virus pandemic I haven't been able to visit but, emailing has been readily available with fast responses. For obvious reasons my family and I haven't been able to visit but it still feels like we've went due to the virtual tours they've made available to the freshman students! Everything is easily accessed, clearly stated, and organized. Getting enrolled and set up wasn't a long process at all. James Madison was the first school I applied to and my dream school. For anyone unsure about a college I would 10/10 recommend this one. If you can't get in contact with a representative most , if not all your questions could be answered on their authentic website."
Alum,5,"I was taught by some of the most amazing professors while at JMU. I always felt safe, supported, and encouraged by the faculty there. After graduating, I felt prepared to enter my field."
Senior,5,"The best years and experiences of my life. I wouldn't trade JMU for anything, that is why I decided to attend graduate school here. I am not ready to say goodbye but I can also not attend without scholarships since I am paying my way through school."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love JMU. It is very easy to find your place with clubs for about anything you can think of. Tons of stuff to get involved in for your major, give to the community, and for fun. While JMU is a big campus with a large population, Harrisonburg itself is not too big which for me was a plus not having a big area, but still a fairly large school. Professors have always been helpful and great teachers, with the exception of a few which you will find anywhere. Overall, if you're looking for a school with a population that focuses hard on academics, yet likes to have a lot of fun with a goof party scene, then JMU should be one of your top choices."
Freshman,5,"Absolutely love JMU! I have had the best experience thus far. Greek life is so much fun, there's a variety of clubs and sports to choose from. The classes are educational and entertaining. The professors are overall very nice and understanding. The dinning options here are great as well, I never get bored of campus food. Dorms however, are not very good unless you get into a newer building. Highly recommended this college!"
Freshman,5,"Being accepted to this school was a dream come true. Once I got my letter saying ""You're In,"" I knew that this school was going to be the best thing that has ever happened to me. The amount of opportunities I have came in contact with through this school has been amazing. The resources provided to us students are very helpful, and there are so many to offer. There is a place to everyone at this school. Since attending JMU, I have had the best experience with making new friends and trying new things. I am glad that I decided to continue make academic career at this university, it has done nothing but benefit me."
Senior,5,"The environment and the community of people at JMU could make anyone feel they are welcomed and at home here.  The students and staff are all very friendly, and the campus is beautiful! I wouldn't change anything about my experience I've had here at James Madison University."
Niche User,5,The registration process and communication with accepted and new students is incredible.   They really make you feel like you belong.  Highly recommended!
Freshman,5,"What I liked is how beautiful the campus is. Probably the best part is definitely the food, it is fantastic here. There are always teachers willing to help you progress in your major and become very successful."
Niche User,5,"This school gives such a home feel. Although it is a big campus, the large number of clubs and organizations allow you to feel involved and included. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. The new renovations make the campus feel more special and very modern."
Niche User,5,"JMU is a very good college because it has very dedicated professors and nice students. Its academics are decent, and its sports are very good. The food is great and there is little to no crime every year. JMU basketball is getting a new basketball stadium that is going to help turn around are program and are football team has made the FCS national championship 3 out of the 4 last years.
Are women's sports are outstanding as they won the Division 1 Lax championship."
Niche User,5,I went to the campus of James Madison University two years ago. The campus was very beautiful and the people were very nice and welcoming. There were a lot of things to do on and off campus and the food on campus was very good.
Freshman,5,"James Madison is an excellent school! If you are a person who wants to be surrounded by others who care for your success then JMU is a great school to consider. Upon first attending the school, I was a bit hesitant to leave my old life behind but I truly feel as if JMU made transitioning from high school to college so easy."
Niche User,5,"The campus is very beautiful and simply laid out, so it is not hard to find where you are going to. The atmosphere is sensational and I loved the big college yet homey at the same time feel. My favorite part were the amazing food courts- they had so many options for every different eater!"
Alum,5,JMU can be anything you make it. Everyone is friendly and genuine. The campus is BEAUTIFUL. You can party or study or be whoever you want to be.
Freshman,5,"James Madison is a place where it feels like home. Once you step foot on campus you would know if you belong there or not. The students and professors there are very nice and caring, just like family. It is a place where I would enjoy spending my 4 years of college."
Sophomore,5,"James Madison University is a place like no other. That may seem like something every college kid would say about their school, but at JMU, good luck finding one person that would disagree. Dukes support Dukes, its such an incredible place that you can literally go up to any staff or student and have a full conversation, or get the help you need. The incredible academics, athletics, and various programs around campus just remind us how insane it is that we go to such a perfect school. All the professors care about you, all the counselors want to help, all the students want to succeed, and every single one of them wants to be a Duke. 

I am an out of state student, it is extremely difficult for my family to find the money for me to attend this school, but they offered scholarships and opportunities beyond belief. You couldn’t pay me enough to go anywhere else, I have never found my happy place until I attended James Madison University."
Freshman,5,"I have only been at JMU for one semester, but so far my experience has been extraordinary. I have made a lot of friends and have learned so much in the past 3 months."
Niche User,5,Great school with lots of school spirit.  Students are very enthusiastic and proud of the school.  Lots of outdoor activities to do nearby.
Sophomore,5,absolutely love it! the atmosphere in this area is amazing! the student body is super friendly and always willing to help out anyone who asks! the professors try their very hardest to help all students succeed.
Freshman,5,I am only a freshmen and I feel so at home here at JMU. It's such a charismatic place with so much to do. I absolutely love it and I'm so glad that I came to school here.
Alum,5,"JMU gives you the opportunity to find yourself through the immense amount of clubs and organizations available to students. My overall experience at JMU was one I will cherish forever. The college is beautiful and clean,  the faculty and students are wonderful and everyone WANTS to be there, the food is amazing, athletics are so much fun to go to, and the amenities are incredible. I would recommend for anyone who is exploring the idea of college to just walk through the campus and talk to anyone they passed. Everyone you meet will say JMU is home."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love JMU. This is the best school ever and I am really happy with my choice to come here. It is an amazing environment, so welcoming and friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I love James Madison University with all my heart but would love to see more diversity on campus. Also not having AC in a six person dorm was difficult. However, overall my experience at JMU has been amazing and I recommend for anyone to attend."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed its diversity. I valued the fact that the minute I stepped onto the campus I felt as though I was one of the students. Something to change would be that I wish it was around more shopping areas.
Sophomore,5,"I really like how the school is so beautiful, the professors are really direct with the students, and that the food is really good. I do not like the fact that their financial aid is terrible."
Freshman,5,Great atmosphere everyone is social. If you’re a guy and not in a social club or fraternity you’re not going to have fun.
Niche User,5,My friends who I went to high schools goes to James Madison. My school counselor also suggested me to apply to James Madison due to what I want to major in. They all said it's a great school to go for film and law. Reading about the school online makes me really want to go there. I can't wait to go visit the campus soon and the surroundings. From what I have been told that it's a huge party school. The one thing that I would change is have restrictions about how late and where the parties are located at. I would also like to reduce the class room sizes to about 15 to 20 people in the rooms.
Niche User,5,I think I was fantastic and I am definitely considering going the atmosphere is wonderful also including the clubs and organizations they have and the have great food
Alum,5,"The great thing about JMU was the smaller class sizes. Although there were some larger lecture classes, professors were always available, and always took time to help if needed. I still keep in contact with some of my professors even after graduation."
Freshman,5,"Currently a freshman here and I love it so far. The atmosphere on game days and the love that students have for each other and the school. Professors communicate and work with the students. Outside of school, social life is very fun for whatever you like to do. Campus is a hike but you get used to it and the buses are improving."
Freshman,4,Currently all of my classes are online. I would say that overall learning online at JMU is okay. My professors have been working really hard to try and adapt to online however some professors are struggling more than others. One of my professors is not very tech savvy and that makes online learning difficult sometimes. I also feel like I am not learning much of anything compared to if we were in person. Luckily I am a freshman in gen eds so my classes are not important at the moment however for those taking major focused classes this could be negative.
Alum,4,Honestly it depends on the professor.  Most professors are extremely understanding if you let them know what's going on.
Sophomore,4,"This past summer I took a health course online and it went very well.  We did not have synchronous class, only assignments and tests. I am currently taking a full course load online due to the Covid pandemic, and I really don't mind it that much.  My classes now are synchronous and professors are live on zoom incase I have any questions about anything in the class."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere and the sense of community that the university has.  I just feel as though I'm home every time I go on campus.  I really like all of my professors and I really enjoy learning here.
Freshman,4,"If COVID was not a thing right now, my reviews of the university would be outstanding, however the way the administration has dealt with this is disappointing. Everything about JMU is amazing. The campus is beautiful, the food is good, the professors are the best, and the students are all very driven and kind to each other. I am a freshman right now and my experience so far has been very unordinary. The first week I was here we got sent back home after racking up over 600 cases, then a month later we're back and as of right now are still here. I strongly believe that the main reason that admin decided that we should come back is only to squeeze whatever money they can out of us. I appreciate the fact that I get to be on campus and have the ""college experience"" but its at the risk of my health nonetheless. No matter what safety precautions they put in, the students will still party and spread the virus."
Junior,4,"The classes taken online are as good as the professors can make them. There can be some issues with online learning when the professors either don't know how to use zoom or when they lag in material behind due to question answering or a difference in pacing, but overall I've enjoyed my online experience."
Alum,4,I enjoy classroom education more. When I attended JMU there was not online learning available.  I do like the fact that it is offered now.
Junior,4,The education and faculty are great. The students are great if you love school spirit and being a part of Their community.
Sophomore,4,Half of my second semester was online and all of the teachers were very accommodating to the circumstances
Sophomore,4,"The interactions I have had with the school so far have been for the purpose of getting prepared for the coming semester. Although it is limited at this point, I consider my experience with the school to be positive."
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid, we had to switch to online delivery in the Spring and some in the Fall 2020. The transition was easy and the professors worked hard to support the new way of learning."
Sophomore,4,"During our second semester when the coronavirus hit, online courses (for me at least) were great. It was very ideal for my situation. It really gave me the opportunity to make my own schedule every day. And most of the teachers understood the student's concerns."
Sophomore,4,The sense of a welcoming community mixed in with the classic college lifestyle is great. Everybody seems to be happy and carefree. The campus itself just seems very free-spirited.
Junior,4,"As a transfer student, I struggled to adjust to this school, but by my second semester, I really started to get comfortable, enjoy the library, make lots of friends, and excel in my classes."
Sophomore,4,They may say it's a diverse university but it's definitely not racially diverse whatsoever. That would be fine if I didn't have to educate my peers constantly on how stressful it can be.
Freshman,4,Professors were clear with their expectations and kept up communication with students even through the crisis. I never ran into a problem with asking questions or talking with professors.
Graduate Student,4,"My professors have done their very best at making the best learning environment with the technology at hand. I just don’t like online learning anywhere and the technology right now on all platforms, keeps failing because of internet overload."
Junior,4,All my professors were great during the move to online classes. They were very supportive and willing to help with any issues that occurred. The course load was doable and I didn't feel too overwhelmed.
Freshman,4,"Pros: Teaching college. Great campus and staffs. Offers many programs and activities. Amazing food. 
Cons: Would like to see more diverse ethnicity in students."
Freshman,4,Great environment. Everyone is so welcoming and helpful and always has a smile on their face. Faculty are always willing to help and genuinely want you to succeed. Big greek like school so getting involved in that will bring you more social experiences and great opportunities to meet new people and friends. Advisors are there to help you get to your end goal. There are also various clubs and one is bound to help you reach your end goal.
Freshman,4,James Madison University is full of dedicated teachers that are passionate about their subjects. There are so many activities and groups to take advantage of to find people with common interests.
Sophomore,4,"I love James Madison University because I transferred here and immediately felt welcome. I am part of the Nursing program here and it is amazing and has already taught me so much. The campus is also beautiful as well and food is amazing so that's an extra bonus. Overall, I love James Madison U but the only downfall is that the cost for out of state students is crazy. Although, many schools out of state cost around the same. James Madison University has become my home even though I am from New Jersey, I feel that I am most comfortable here. If it was cheaper I would give James Madison University 5 stars for sure."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoy James Madison University due to the fact that it's been my dream school since my Sophomore year of high school. I tend to visit Harrisonburg, VA a lot due to the fact that one of my siblings lives in the Shenandoah area. It excels a great environment to be in and there is a great community that creates a lot of amazing groups. Every time I go on campus to visit, I always feel welcomed by the students at the university and to all my friends that attend JMU, they talk very highly of the university."
Sophomore,4,"If you’re looking for the dream college experience you see in movies then JMU is for you. the student life is great, the campus is beautiful and the campus food is one of the best in the country. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is very cliquey and of you don’t join clubs and get involved you’ll feel lonely at times. Other than that i recommended JMU 100%"
Sophomore,4,James Madison University is a lovely 4-year college. The university provides their students with an abundance of resources to help them be successful during their years at JMU. The community of Harrisonburg is friendly and safe. The only thing I want the school to improve on is the diversity among the students.
Freshman,4,James Madison University is an amazing school! You always feel at home there no matter what! Great resources for everyone and so inclusive of all people
Freshman,4,"Good Professors, friendly people, interesting classes, vibrant student life. Could have better parking and harrisonburg isn't a desired city to live in. Could be more diverse."
Sophomore,4,"Campus is beautiful dude, love seeing those views every day. Academically it's really challenged me and pushed me out of my comfort zone in mostly the best ways, professors are mostly very good and want you to succeed but sometimes they can be a little hit or miss. Overall I do not regret coming here."
Alum,4,Everyone was so pleasant to be around and oncampus living was fun. The campus is a little spread out so be prepared to walk a lot.
Freshman,4,"Love the school itself, hard to make friends. not enough funding for counseling because all its money goes to athletics. Sketchy area that has reached onto campus with sex trafficking."
Freshman,4,"My experiences has been great! I have met so many new people, there are lots of food options, and the campus is beautiful. There are many places to study and hang out."
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus. The open space is warm. JMU's Academic Policy and Curriculum Development is a service-oriented department dedicated to providing reliable information through innovative technical communications that facilitate constructive interactions within the academic community. Our primary deliverables include the undergraduate catalog, graduate catalog and faculty handbook."
Niche User,4,My experience was very welcoming. Their food was great and so were the dorms. I really loved how the people are diverse at the school.
Niche User,4,Their campus was very big and had a modern styled compared to other schools in Virginia. JMU is a fun school and has great school spirit.
Niche User,4,"James Madison is a bit of a party school, but has some great teachers and opportunities for learning and research if you seek them out."
Sophomore,4,Overall it was a great experience although the I wish it was a little more diverse. The first year went well for me as I made a few new friends and orientation week was a blast with my hall mates. The staff did an amazing job welcoming freshman!
Alum,4,"James Madison has a lively social scene, beautiful landscaping, and a wide variety of majors. It provides a lot of support for students and has many work-study opportunities available."
Sophomore,4,I love the community at James Madison University. Everybody is so welcoming and so kind. I doubt that there is any university in Virginia that has such a welcome and inclusive atmosphere like JMU does.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't started my year as a sophomore yet so I've only been in the freshmen dorms, and the get really hot during the summer, so make sure you pack your fans. Everything else has been great- the campus food especially."
Senior,4,James Madison University is a wonderful school that cares about the success of its students. Entering my 4th and final year I can say that I am sad to be saying I'm almost done. The teachers and friends I have met here have inspired me to try new things and to step out of my comfort zone and become a better person because of it. The university is not without its flaws as any place is but I truly consider JMU to be my home away from home. Go Dukes!
Niche User,4,It is a great school in many aspects such as student life to the professors and the variety of majors.
Senior,4,I really enjoyed having the professors that I did at this university. The real treasure of this place is its well qualified professors in any field or branch of the university. The only thing I would want to see changed is a slightly larger investment in the Computer Science/ISAT branches at JMU.
Freshman,4,"James Madison University has a beautiful campus and super helpful people. My advisor is the best, always helpful and responds to my emails fast. JMU has the top campus food in the country and thats awesome. My mom went to this school as well and was in love with it back then, but now its even better."
Freshman,4,"JMU is an incredibly fun school for almost everyone. While it is slightly lacking in diversity, there is a home for anyone who attends as long as they are willing to search for it. Additionally, the campus has a very connected and caring energy to it, and in most cases it is very evident that everyone wants you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"As a now former student of JMU, I loved my time there: from the people, to the activities there. I was a memeber of the Pep Band for the basketball games, and the energy there was so powerful, we are respected for it, too. But beware, if you don't do well in certain courses, you will be in trouble, so keep your grades up at the school. Future JMU students, enjoy your time there, don't waste it!"
Niche User,4,"When I went to visit it was a rural area with hints of city life, it was a perfect environment for students who will be in school and working."
Alum,4,"The peace and friendliness of the university makes it a place to fall in love with. The staff is fantastic, the town has southern charm, and the food is highly rated. The university recreation center is a enormous and incredible, and there are always activities to participate in on campus. You will never find a friendlier campus to make your home."
Freshman,4,"James Madison University has a great campus as well as academic programs like majors, minors and concentrations.  All faculty is overall very willing to help and very friendly.  All professors are willing to help and provide a lot of times to meet and materials outside of class."
Alum,4,"James Madison University was a very welcoming, inclusive campus and the professors and staff members were very encouraging of any and all academic pursuits. I enjoyed the four and a half years I spent at this school and created many irreplaceable experiences and memories, as well as life-long friendships. During my time there, however, I always wished the student population had been a bit more diverse. I felt like I was surrounded by very like-minded people, and that my college experience was more an extension of my earlier education experiences than anything else."
Senior,4,I like the small campus feel at this very large university! JMU has a very close community that is very supportive and definitely sets their student up for success in getting involved on campus.
Freshman,4,"I totally love JMU; everything about it is wonderful! The overall atmosphere is very friendly and social, and the unique town of Harrisonburg has a lot to offer. The professors are all passionate and caring, and the university offers a few programs you may not see in a lot of other colleges. Even though I'm not at all about the party life, JMU has one heck of a scene. The food is some of the best in the nation, with a lot of options (including vegan), and there is a multitude of on and off campus housing options. In terms of safety, there are a fair number of services to make sure campus is secure; even though the Title IX department has seen some iffiness, it's made some steps towards improvements very recently."
Freshman,4,James Madison has amazing faculty that really know how to challenge their students. All the professors make sure to help every student and have a personal relationship with their students. It is not really diverse but they promote diversity and encourage diversity.
Freshman,4,I have been challenged academically and feel as though I am receiving an excellent education. The student life is wonderful here.  There are a variety of clubs and activities to be involved in.
Freshman,4,"One of the things I love about JMU is that everyone looks out for each other. If someone were to leave their backpack on a bench in the library, no one would mess with it. Even if they're not actively looking over it, people would be keeping an eye on it nonetheless. People hold open doors for each other, and if something is needed, a message is sent out and others are more than happy to help them out. The one thing I wish would change is within the theatre major. I want the faculty to create a more friendly environment that doesn't deter students from working on a Mainstage production"
Alum,4,"JMU was an overall good experience.  I enjoyed my 4 years there as an undergraduate.  I had wonderful academic opportunities while attending.  I studied abroad, spent a semester interning in DC and presented research at a conference.  Harrisonburg itself is a boring place, but the campus is full of life."
Niche User,4,"One of the best things I have experienced on their campus would be the variety of facilities and resources that are for the students. This insures that there  are many thing to do and many places to go. Great Atmosphere, but gets quite chaotic during game day."
Freshman,4,"Great environment, welcoming people, and the school really tries to get people involved and make the atmosphere at JMU the best it can be-socially and academically."
Junior,4,Some things I like about JMU is the experience the different choices for medical ways about what to learn better for the future and other different reasons to go to this college and learn.
Freshman,4,"Entering college, I had no one. The environment here has helped me create a lot of new friendships. The atmosphere is always positive. Facilities are well kept, professors love what they teach and engage their students, and the campus itself is beyond beautiful. JMU has a plethora of opportunities around campus both academic and socially, many different clubs, and organizations opened to everyone. There is never a dull moment on campus. It truly feels like you're apart of one big family and everyone is always rooting for you. The athletics and school spirit is a huge, the football games; other athletic events bring the university together. The food here is not your average college campus food. We have a variety of options to choose from so you wont be left hungry. The safety around here is well enforced. There are police on campus so if there is ever a problem it can be easily diffused. I can't imagine myself anywhere else and am very happy with my decision becoming a JMU Duke."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus, and most of the people on it are very nice and helpful. There are lots of activities to get involved in, but if you're shy, it can be a little hard to make friends, especially if you don't join a club or go out to parties. The teachers are committed to helping you learn, at least most of them are. Overall, I am very happy with my decision to come here."
Sophomore,2,The online experience as partially explained in the previous question is debatable in terms of its quality. Students across campus have to fight for online classes with their professors because JMU has not enforced online classes to their professors. The positives to our online experiences are heavily negated by the actual responses by JMU for this semester.
Sophomore,2,"James Madison University is one of the most innovating schools in the east coast, and this has shown in both positive and negative ways. The professors and the administration work hard to bring its undergrad education up to the giants of this nation. The college is building and improving buildings across campus such as our new dining hall or our convocation center on the east side of campus. But it also has made decisions that go against the ideals of the student body.

With COVID-19 and its detrimental affects to the community at large, JMU has innovated negatively. They force the student body to pay thousands to the in-active sports body through our tuition. They have forced students to come to campus to maintain the debt and local community of Harrisonburg, but have ignored pleas by students to forcefully allow online classes as an option for professors.

Overall, JMU has been a great experience when the administration does not have to face events tough current events."
Sophomore,2,My classes were online due to cover-19. It was not the best experience but we were all going though an interesting time.
Graduate Student,2,JMU lacks diversity and needs to do more to protect minorities on campus and in the community. There should be more diverse representation within the faculty as well.
Graduate Student,2,For music majors it is difficult since performance venues are shutdown. Also private lessons were harder due to internet interruptions or poor connections. I don’t think it’s a suitable method for performance majors.
Freshman,2,"James Madison is a good school for some people and some majors. The way the programs are set up make it difficult to graduate on time. There is also a lack of diversity at the school, and everybody parties. The area surrounding the university has little to do or offer alternatives on the weekends."
Freshman,2,"It is a great school.  The problem is you have kids that who have absolutely great academic record but you cant give them any scholarship.  The school states because they do not receive lot of endowments to give out scholarships, but it seems you have any funds to build more buildings.  Remember it is the students who makes the school what it is, not your buildings."
Sophomore,2,"If you are health conscious or have dietary restrictions you will be miserable.The price of the on campus food vs the quality is robbery!I lived in Hillside; it has a possible mold/mildew and dirty air system.Professors don't teach, lack office hours, use online test banks rarely making exams from anything in my notes or classroom experience.Average test scores in all my classes are 60 and below. Few professors curve.1st year classes are structured more for a transfer student or eqv incoming freshman with a year+ of college credits.Bad professors are now disguised as TBA when signing up for classes. It is very difficult to get into many geneds.Advising is severely lacking, as is quality STEM professors.I'm still wondering the function of the campus nurse because JMU made headlines this year with mumps, measles, flu, mono, strep outbreaks."
Niche User,2,"I am writing as a parent.  My son's experience with enrollment, every semester, has been horrible.  When trying to register for classes for the spring of his 3rd year, he as given a time and day when he was to register.  Just so happens it was during one of his classes so he missed that day.  When he went to register he was only able to get into one of his classes that he needs for his major.  I wrote to the Registrars office and was given instructions for him.  He went and spoke with them and was told to either pick up a minor or take a semester off.  Really, is that what we tell our kids.  Also, his advisor basically told all of the kids not to bother her with registration, she could not help"
College Sophomore,2,"Ethnic diversity is pretty much nonexistent. The vast majority of people are white. I believe that JMU highly pushes to have sexual orientation and political beliefs thrown into the diversity question. But when most people think of diversity, ethnicity is the predominant factor, of which, JMU does not see much diversity."
College Sophomore,2,"Most people participate in some form of drug use, and it is done in various parts of campus. If caught, the law is enforced, however, I believe the vast majority of drug usage goes unenforced."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is a joke now on campus. People join to have friends, but greek life continuously shines a negative light on JMU's campus. As a result, most fraternities are being put on probation constantly and/or getting kicked off."
College Freshman,2,The health center doesn't give you anything when your sick and you have to go elsewhere to get what you really need.
College Freshman,2,"Housing is unfair, some students get the nice, new dorms and some students get dorms without air-conditioning that haven't been updated since the 1950s."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of drugs. Open use of LSD in hallways. Weekends practically everyone is drunk.
College Freshman,2,"Not what I expected, teacher quality isn't great. Overall not happy"
College Freshman,2,"JMU has this program for incoming freshman to show them how ""diverse"" JMU is, but when it comes to race and ethnicity....it's not diverse at all, mostly white people."
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are costly and a lot of them don't have air conditioning. Most of the rooms are pretty small. The worst dorms are in the lakeside area and the best are in bluestone/skyline.
College Sophomore,2,I'm still trying to get everything that I need and its really hard on my family.
College Junior,2,"Unless your families income is <50,000 you wont get any"
College Sophomore,2,My parents got very frustrated
College Freshman,2,"There seems to be quite a disparity between Greeks and non-Greeks here. Fraternities by nature are sexist and cause a fair amount of problems on campus. I almost never feel safe at a frat house and stay away from Greek life apart from service fraternities and sororities as well as academic based Greek life. Sororities can be a negative influence on self-esteems of their members and other women; however, this is not exclusive to my University at all."
College Freshman,2,Athletics are good but not many people attend the games. Students do not go out of their ways to watch the games.
College Freshman,2,"Students drink all the time. The campus doesn't really do anything about the problem. They only catch the drunks that are wild and are in the streets. However, the parties still happen. Alcohol is still brought back to the dorms and consumed."
College Sophomore,2,"The nursing program, while very good, is way too small for the amount of students who wish to pursue it. In addition, even after getting into the program there are a multitude of extra fees (the required background check, scrubs, required ipad etc.) as well as there now being an extra fee of 90.00 (i think) for every nursing credit hour you take in the program."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some very nice dorms on campus, but they are the minority. The village dorms aren't horrible but there is absolutely a giant gap in quality between those and others on the quad or east campus (lack of air conditioning, smaller dorms, old bathrooms, etc.)"
College Sophomore,2,"As someone who isnt in a sorority or fraternity, the Greek life here seems to be overly important to people who are involved in it but those who aren't, aren't really affected much by it."
College Freshman,2,The athletics here are not good but they are getting better.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many scholarships given by the university unless you are poor or extremely smart
College Sophomore,2,They don't offer many scholarships or grants. You have to rely mainly on loans and out of pocket payment. The payment plans are horrible. They even charge you extra for setting up the plans.
College Senior,2,JMU is not a bar and club scene school. The students rely on cheap beer and house parties.
College Junior,2,Campus and local cops see students as easy targets
Recent Alumnus,2,"The lack of ethnic/racial diversity is disappointing. Try to find more ways to recruit students. Harrisonburg is one of, if not the most, diverse areas in the country. Surely we could use some new students..."
College Sophomore,2,"Weather is unpredictable. We had a ton of snow and rain, but also beautiful days with sunshine."
College Sophomore,2,The cost is too much and there's never enough spaces. It really needs improvement.
College Freshman,2,The Wifi is so unreliable and so many dorms on campus do not support Wifi
College Sophomore,2,"I am an international student so i cant apply for financial aid, thats why i didnt apply for one. I wish they offered it to us it will help alot."
College Sophomore,2,"I mean i dont really know but i know Harrisonburg cops are out every weekend, there is alot of underage drinking but thats about it. Us JMU students are really good people. But its just alot of people drink, like on special occasions like st pattricks day or before football games or halloween etc. But people are careful and not many accidents occur, they are mature."
College Freshman,2,"Being in the mountains, it is extremely hot in August and September when we first get here. However, when the winter hits, it hits hard!! The weather is very bipolar here, like one day it will be raining then the next it will be snowing, then it'll be sunny outside and blazing hot, then the wind will practically blow you away!"
College Freshman,2,"I have applied for financial aid through the school and have received nothing. I cannot speak for any other students here because I do not know their financial aid situations, but from a personal account, there was no financial aid awarded to me of any kind. Because of my particular situation, I do not have any tips for getting financial aid at my school, considering I was not able to receive any."
College Freshman,2,"JMU drinks a lot. There is not a huge hard drug scene, though a lot of students smoke weed. The drug of choice is alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much diversity at JMU, especially from the outside looking in. However, we have many different types of personalities and backgrounds so that it makes the campus an interesting mix."
College Junior,2,"It seems to me that many JMU students, including myself have a hard time paying for college."
College Junior,2,"I applied early FASFA and was told the fin aid would be available to me, but the 

school had too many people ahead of me so NO FUNDS FOR ME. (out of state)"
College Freshman,2,"Eagle Hall is the worst. Dirty, small, no AC, inconvenient for a science major who spends all time on east campus and yet it costs the same as new dorms !"
College Freshman,2,It's like hardly anyone underage gets in trouble for drinking. Do they care?
College Sophomore,2,"There are no long-distance buses coming through our town. Few options are offered by the university, but they are too expensive. Getting to the airport takes 2 hours and is possible only by a shared ride. train station is in the near-by town, where one can get only by taxi. "
College Freshman,2,"The scholarship I applied for which was the centennial scholars program, was my only hope. These scholarship was for students who performed excellently in high school and needed  the money. This describes me but I didn't get the scholarship. I am really angry about this"
College Freshman,2,"I don't drive on campus because I don't have a car at the university, but my friends who do complain all the time how difficult it is to find parking.  Almost all of them have missed a class or two because they couldn't find a parking space either at all or anywhere near their class.  I'm not looking forward to paying a large amount of money for a parking pass and not being able to find a space as often as I hear. "
College Freshman,2,"Diversity isn't really what James Madison University is known for.  I don't think that's a bad thing, but it's noticeable that caucasians are the main race on campus by a long shot.  I think as long as everyone is comfortable in the community that's all that matters, no matter gender, race, religion, political affiliation, etc. "
Recent Alumnus,2,It was good for this year but now I really don't know how I am going to pay for school next year and I have been trying everything I can think of to try to take care of it.
College Freshman,2,"A parking permit costs a lot of money, and it is never easy to find a spot to park in. If you park illegally, you will get a ticket. If you live off campus, having a car is necessary, but if you live on campus, you can easily do without it. "
College Sophomore,2,"I did not fit in, the people were not as accommodating as I was told because I did not fit the mold, my major is in the middle of reconstruction for facilities so my facilities were under par, my living situation was less than satisfactory, I left after my first year because I was unhappy and wanted to transfer."
College Sophomore,2,They are kind of cliquey and they act as though they are doing something way above everyone else. It's not like this at all schools.
College Sophomore,2,I have only heard things I did not actually park at school
College Sophomore,2,"They are all the same and interested in being all the same, people are not really into being different and interesting they try to fit into the crazy-lilly-pulitzer-wearing-longchamp-carrying-frat-party-going-sorority-girl mold."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at JMU is okay, but the spots fill up fast and Parking Services has no mercy. "
College Sophomore,2,"People complain a lot about parking, especially in terms of finding a spot for getting to class.  Many people are late because there aren't any spots left, so people just take the bus."
College Freshman,2,Hard to find parking after 8am classing and permits are expensive per semester.
College Junior,2,Parking passes are very expensive and it is almost impossible to find spots. 
Alum,1,"I took one class online, and I didn't feel academically supported.  I chose to not take any future online classes because of this."
Sophomore,1,"Have not had a one to one experience with teachers. She completed courses online, so minimal contact."
Sophomore,1,"I am so very disgusted by how this school does business. Anyone looking for correspondent high school, contact The American School instead. My adult daughter who had medical issues during high school contacted this school to get her diploma. She was trying to pay for it herself and only able to work part time. They would not work with her, once her job ended and now have turned her account over to a collection attorney even though she only completed 4 classes and paid over $300.00. I am hiring an attorney for her. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCHOOL!!!!!!"
Freshman,1,Most depressed I’ve ever been in my life. The weather is gray from October-March and freezing cold but with no snow. Professors rarely care about your well being. Campus is ugly and boring. There’s nothing to do around town so everybody just drinks and goes to parties which was so bad for my mental health. The area is also really dirty and kinda dangerous. If you don’t rush you feel incredibly left out. I also had to apply to my “incredibly competitive” major but once I got in I couldn’t take any of the classes that I needed as prerequisites because they let too many people in. 90% of dorms are disgusting with no AC. Food is okay but not a lot of options for vegetarians/vegans. So many preppy white kids. I came from out of state and felt extremely lonely because most people are from nova. Too expensive for a low-tier party.
Junior,1,DO NOT come to JMU for General Engineering if you don't like group projects and you don't care about whether you can get a real engineering job with this degree.  I wasted 2 years at JMU then I transferred.  It was the worst decision I ever made!!! I learned more in 3 months at my engineering internship than 2 years at JMU. The engineering classes didn't teach me any technical skill that I could apply to work.   I wasted $$$ and time at JMU.
Freshman,1,"Uninviting people, really hot humid weather, pretty much West Virginia, really old dorms, no air conditioning, students  are out of a Vineyard Vines catalog, really far walks to class, and almost everyone is from ""NOVA"" which is this really pretentious way of saying your from Northern Virginia."
College Sophomore,1,"I stay with my boyfriend in a better dorm nearest to my classes and a decent dining hall because my hall (Weaver) is disgusting. Last time I went there on a weekend at night there was an ambulance. It's pretty awful. The housekeeper is miserable and treated poorly by residents. Also, too much beer pong. All the time. I've heard the third floor is the worst for parties."
College Senior,1,"Horrible chapters from notable fraternities that disgrace their founders with gross northern ideals. Ive never in my life seen such a poor Sigma Chi and Kappa Alpha Chapters. Robert E. Lee would have smacked the KA brothers at JMU. If you're a Long Island Guido, you'll love greeklife at JMU. If you're a southern guy, Id enroll somewhere else."
College Freshman,1,Greek life to be honest divides the campus. Sober folk are left on the sidelines.
College Sophomore,1,No money is given to out of state. booooo.
College Freshman,1,"I applied for financial aid, thinking I would get some because my parents are divorced, and my sister also goes to school full-time, but I ended up getting zero financial aid, and a $2,500 work study if I could find an on-campus job. I was disappointed that I couldn't help my parents out, but many of my friends and people I know that go here said that they didn't get a lot of financial aid."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a party person, and I find it quite difficult to find anything to do for sober folk."
College Sophomore,1,"I didn't get much financial aid, so I am struggling to pay for my education."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only parties. Hardly anything to do other than party, and hard to get away from the drunk scene"
College Sophomore,1,"Only party, don't actually give back. Extreme haze"
College Sophomore,1,"Lots of pointless rules, none which are important"
College Sophomore,1,Townies are incredibly creepy. Lots of violence.
Recent Alumnus,1,RA's will make up any nonsense to write you up for things. Don't give them the time of day.
College Sophomore,1,"From what I've heard, parking is the absolute worst for how much it costs. People compare finding a parking spot to the hunger games."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do in Harrisonburg. The town itself is very very unsafe and unpleasant to be in. You are constantly receiving emails involving armed robberies. Harrisonburg is not a safe place to live. However, if you are on campus, or in off campus housing, you are safe. There is not much to do in Harrisonburg. There are a few restaurants down town and Cats Cradle, but thats about it."
College Freshman,1,This year has been awful. You never know what the weather is going to be at the beginning of the day to the end-it could be completely sunny and warm in the morning and then pouring down rain in the afternoon. This years winter was freezing and we had tons of snow.
College Junior,1,"Finance Honors program seems to be a select small group

work load is not too bad"
College Freshman,1,"Kids, underage and of age, are getting wasted every single day and night"
College Sophomore,1,I was given the worst housing on campus and residence life was terrible at helping me with my ongoing issues with it
College Student,1,"If you're looking for luxurious living spaces, you won't find it in the area I'm living! We have a centipede infestation, worn-out bathrooms, a poor heating system, and no A/C or wi-fi. The only factor that makes up for it is the people!"
College Senior,1,"A dreadful mess. And Parking Services will ticket you even when there are no car in the lot just to justify their meaningless existence. Oh, and the parking passes work on strict schedules so you can pay for a custom amount of time based on when you will be driving to campus."
College Senior,1,"I have received no financial aid from JMU.. there are a few scholarships available, but you have to be a stellar student in all aspects to get anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible and the parking attendance make it worse. They give tickets at every second they get. Sometimes I do not want to be on campus as is, getting tickets makes me not want to be there even more."
College Senior,1,"Parking is pretty terrible on campus, and differs depending on what side of campus you are going to.  If you're going to east campus, there are no parking decks, so it especially hard to find a spot if it is for any class other than an 8 AM.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are the worst days.  Freshman aren't allowed cars, but you won't need one because the buses will bring you everywhere."
College Junior,1,"It's hard to find spaces. If you make a mistake, you will be ticketed. I've  had three tickets already."
College Freshman,1,"Don't bother. If your classes are on East Campus, you should be okay. But anywhere else, don't even try."
College Freshman,1,The only scholarships available are within a major it seems like.
College Freshman,1,"Since I am out-of-state, i recieved no financial aid from JMU (sucks)!!!!!!!!"
College Senior,1,You need to come to campus in the morning or you will not find a spot
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of the JMU population is White, almost 85%. However, the administration at JMU are taking subtle strides to increase the diversity on campus. The minority population at JMU is particularly small, but they never use that to their disadvantage. There are numerous programs and organizations on campus to help and provide for the minority community but the administration and majority population often overlook their thoughts, opinions, and voices."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is absolutely horrible. You might as well wake up early to catch the bus.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Services will ruin your week at least one time per semester. My roommate got towed, had to pay $100, parked back on campus and two days later, had two $25 tickets."
College Senior,1,The only time you are guaranteeing a space is before 9:30am. It is very difficult to find a spot. You have to leave you house at least 30 minutes before your class or you will be late. Also parking is expensive it can be around 300 dollars for a parking pass
College Sophomore,1,Uptight Pricks – The amount of parking spaces is so-so. you definitely have to search for a spot. and the parking people are uptight pricks who write you a ticket whenever they can. I got 3 tickets in 2 days IN THE SUMMER
College Junior,1,"I really can't even put into words how much I hate parking services and parking on campus in general. This past year, there was construction on one of the biggest lots on campus and 60 spaces were gone. Parking permits are $200+ dollars for the year and there are several lots you still can't park in. The parking garages are always full and I've had to miss class before because I couldn't find a spot. You can take the bus if you're off campus which is annoying, but doable. Having a car is still nice though just to go to wal mart and things like that, just don't bother getting a larking pass"
College Sophomore,1,"Almost Nothing to Do – There is a movie theater and a local mall and a bowling alley. That's it. The rest are you rlocal shops such as walmart, Ross, staples, adn etc. There are alot of restaurants. However, there aren't any clubs or city nightlife events. It's hard to find stuff to do."
College Junior,1,"Walking on campus it feels like its 90% white, 5% Asian, 3% African American, and 2% Other. Some people will say ""oh when you get to know different people it's diverse"", that happens anywhere, please. If you're a minority I personally would say look elsewhere, I would transfer in a heartbeat if I could."
College Junior,1,"Not for Me – Harrisonburg is dull to say the least. The mall barely has any stores but there's a Target and Kohl's by it which is kind of okay? Downtown Harrisonburg is VERY boring, there's nothing to do. My other friends talk about going to clubs by their school, no such thing here. The campus also will smell like manure and dog food because of a local factory. The attitude between townies and students is okay, never really paid much mind though."
College Sophomore,1,"The Campus Cadets do not do much to help the school environment, but I have never felt unsafe anywhere on or around campus. There is not much crime off campus. Mostly around a few areas, but it is east to avoid those areas."
College Junior,1,After the first month of school at JMU I sold my parking pass back and took the shuttle or rode my bike to school. Parking is awful at JMU and I would just plan on taking the shuttle if you live off campus.
College Freshman,1,"People aren't joking when they say the weather in Harrisonburg is unpredictable. There have literally been days where it's been 75 degrees and sunny one day (in October) and 25 degrees and snowing the next. The warm, spring-like weather you occasionally get during winter and fall is nice, but the weather is never constant and you have to keep your entire wardrobe in your dorm room all year because the weather changes so often."
College Freshman,1,"Middle of Nowhere – James Madison University is located in Harrisonburg, Virginia- aka the middle of nowhere. It's impossible to get around without a car, most parts of town are pretty sketchy, and there is pretty much nothing to do if you set foot off campus. That and the townies are scary, unfriendly hicks."
College Freshman,1,"Worst School Ever – I mainly chose James Madison University because it was cheap and seemed to have a friendly campus, but I wish I could take my freshman year back. The people there are the most naive and closed-minded people I have ever met in my life, there's hardly any focus on academics, all they care about is partying, and there are highly sexist attitudes despite the fact the campus is 70% girls. Save your money and your sanity and go somewhere else- nothing is worth this."
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Minorities – James Madison University barely has any non-white, gay, or progressive students. The campus is mainly composed of white, middle to upper middle class, christian conservatives who are NOT welcoming to liberal ideas or the LGBT community."
College Freshman,1,"Too cold or Too hot – The weather here is hardly ever nice.  Most of the year, it is freezing cold and raining/snowing.  Or it is extremely hot and humid and you can't walk anywhere without dripping in sweat.  It even gets down to freezing temps in the springtime which is extremely annoying if you have already taken home your winter things since the day before it was 90.  Oh, also it smells disgusting when it rains"
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at most colleges is a terror. JMU seems to be getting worse, in my opinion. Don't bring a car if you live on campus, it is such a waste."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is very strict with their honor code for academics - any possible violation goes before a judicial council and punishments can be very severe.  
JMU uses a 3 strike system for alcohol and drugs and the RAs don't go actively looking for the stuff, but if it is obvious, they will report you. Off campus, the police definitely have a presence in neighborhoods where parties happen"
College Sophomore,1,"SO UNPREDICTABLE – Seriously, bring some serious winter gear, and a rain jacket, and boots, and a scarf, but wear layers. Also, it can be  30 degrees at 10am, 70 degrees and sunny at 2pm, and 20 degress and snowing at 7pm."
College Freshman,1,No veriety – Not very good quality. Not much veriety.  Not very good vegitarian or allergy accomidations.  They do usually have good fresh fruit though.
College Freshman,1,In the beginning of school its so hot your skin could melt off and in the winter you will freeze to death.  
College Freshman,1,"Watch Out – During Halloween weekend, James Madison triples the police force and stakes out bus stops in order to ticket student drinkers. The Residence Halls are extremely strict on drinking and drug use in the dorms and on campus. If you are caught doing one of these, you will mostly likely be issued a strike and will then be put on academic probation. James Madison abides by the ""3 strikes and you're out"" rule however strikes can be considered ""minor"" and aren't as serious as a major strike so you may not be kicked out after 3 minor strikes."
College Junior,1,"Parking sucks. People have a hard time finding parking especially near classes because there are few places to park. A parking pass at the beginning of the year is $212. However, the parking officers get out at 6:30 and are off during the weekends so people often sneak on campus. Also, there are now gates preventing people from driving through campus during the day. The good thing is we have a good bus system to accommodate the bad parking."
College Sophomore,1,"First of all, NO FRESHMAN PARKING ON CAMPUS. There are private lots that you can use, but they're pretty far away. Secondly, the ticketing is crazy. I've heard stories of students and even professors leaving their cars for seconds, and coming back with a ticket. Seriously, either go to class early, or catch ths bus."
College Sophomore,1,"Beware: Campus Police – Ever since the riot that occurred in Spring of 2010, JMU campus police has been strict with anything drug and alcohol related. With that being said, they really focus on nailing freshman more than any other class. It is a burden, and I would not suggest walking home intoxicated, as on weekends, the entire campus police force is out, along with there narcs (student cadets). Campus police is a joke though, none of them graduated from a college and they are usually washouts from other police services."
College Sophomore,1,"JMU has very, very strict policies about drug and alcohol abuse, especially because of Springfest 2010.  If you drink and drive, you will most likely get caught.  Even if you walk home, you can get a ticket.  The police will literally sit out in the street, waiting for people to step out of the apartments onto public grounds so that they can catch them.  Just be smart about where you drink, and be very discreet.  If you are obnoxious, you will get caught!"

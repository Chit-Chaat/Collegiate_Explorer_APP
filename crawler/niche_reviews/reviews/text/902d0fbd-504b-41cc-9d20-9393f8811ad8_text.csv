College Junior,5,"It Has It's Purks â€“ Although transportation is very easy. They have parking in case you need to park your car. However it is an expensive school, and there are no need for that. They charge you for everything even printing paper. When it comes to cost it is horrible. But for transportation and for the learning process its amazing, they have amazing teachers who enjoyed their job. And that is an A+ in my book."
Graduate Student,4,"I only had a few online classes so it's hard for me to give a thorough evaluation, however the classes that I did have were good and engaging."
Junior,4,During Covid-19 pandemic we had to switch to online classes. It was a big change but my professors will answer any question that any one had and will find a way to help us.
Freshman,4,"I like that it is a small class college, each class number is not too big that it will overwhelm students to ask professors questions. What i would like to see change is more job opportunities."
Junior,4,"Overall, Bloomfield College has been one of the best decisions I ever made. Even though it's extremely expensive, the connections and people there are extremely amazing. The teachers are extremely nice and dedicated to help the students in any way. Bloomfield College always make sure you return again and that's is breathtaking."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are willing to work together with you in order to help you. Downside is does not feel like a private school the campus is pretty open and anybody could walk around on it.
Junior,4,I would like to see bigger cafeteria with better quality food and lounging area for commuter students since its an expensive school. The school is small which is great because professors get to know each student and are always willing to stay for help. I would also like the school to help students with getting more scholarships and aids. The feedback I have with registration office is that I wish they were consistent with the same feedback and not have students take extra classes that are not counted for. Overall experience is great and happy I chose this school. The professors are willing to guide you for success.
Senior,4,"I have attended Bloomfield college, for the moment. I would like more attention paid to the academics than the expenses. I hate the way commuter students are treated as if they don't belong."
Freshman,4,Very quaint and diverse. Teaching and administrative staff are very welcoming and helpful. Resources are spectacular.
Freshman,4,I feel like the college does its best at helping students succeed and classes are very personal with only a few students a class which helps the professor connect with the student.
Senior,4,I have met amazing people that have been the most help while attending Bloomfield. I have advisors that care about my future and are very determined to help me graduate with my Bachelor's degree. I tend to have a lot of questions and they always have the answers to help me understand and just give me a sense of relief if I am ever overwhelmed and/or worried about an issue overall. They want to make sure I have my future on the right track and will offer the most help possible.
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior  Nursing student at Bloomfield College. I love the professors here because they really put in a ton of effort to make sure you are leaning and getting something out of the classes. The financial aid packages could be a lot better especially being that this is a private college and they are not held to the same standards as public colleges. The food is okay and the scenery around the college is beautiful and always peaceful. They always have a lot of events going on around campus so youâ€™re never really bored. Overall, I would recommend this college to somebody else."
Freshman,4,"small classes, quiet and peaceful environment, staff is kind and friendly. Campus is small and inviting."
Freshman,4,"My Freshman year was a little stressful but overall exciting. I got to meet new people and make really good friends. The academic part was challenging at first, trying to get into the grove of things but after a while you will get use to it."
Freshman,4,So far I am liking my experience at Bloomfield. The staff do a lot to make you feel like more than just a number here! Benefit of a small school! Lots of resources to help students get acclimated to college life! I believe your experience is what you make it!
Senior,4,"The professors are phenomenal however tuition goes up every year which prevents a lot of the students from graduating and obtaining the degree that they are pursuing. Financial aid could be more helpful, or the school could be more helpful by keeping a fixed tuition plan according to the amount present when first starting rather than raising the price every semester."
College Sophomore,4,"Looking at all of the survey questions I would have to say that the campus is more efficient than your average community college so I do live what I have experience so far. The school is now trying to give into the modern age by dodging new facilities so I'm content with staying here for the rending years. The general education courses left much to the imagination as they don't really tell the students just how important this course is and then the students are stick in a class that cost 3,000 dollars that not only were they forced to take but also was not as mandatory as it was believed  be. Meaning  take a class that no one else you know that's on the same grade as you have to take and you are not down thee thousand dollars. That happened twice already, so just know the game plan before allowing one of the secondary counselors to form your schedule. Focus on what your primary costly in you major has to say. That's my prior exp experience that I had to learn the hard way from."
College Sophomore,4,"I can only day it great because of what I've done to make it great for myself. Not many students know that the school offers a whole website based sorely of of gaining experience in your field. It is just like indeed however all you would have to do as an application is import your resume and send in our to the jobs they match you with. No need to open a new tab or full in the go Lanka with you information or even post a picture of who you are because it all goes through the school. Not many students know or take advantage of that. Which can be good or bad depending if you have the right fitting for yourself once you leave college. Although since Bloomfield college offers it, it should be noticed by the students. The website also offers internships and work studies that will be available to the students until it is taken. I use it and i will continue to do so since it had already provided me with two work study jobs relating to my field."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't have much to say on Greek life but I have gone to since of the events they have held. It bored me, I only rally think their hid for networking and parties because they have yet to prove otherwise. it didn't interest me in the slightest because of the lie variety the college offers and the fact that they don't offer dorms. You only pay that much money for a jacket and a seat on their bus for when they go to other schools.I don't see the point of a small college having a Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,"The art department is what pushed me to saying that the overall students were kind and the professor cared about their surge age their passion. Other professors I've encountered outside of the art department should signs that they didn't care whether or not students failed on succeeded. I would only reapply to Bloomfield college because of the connections that i have made with other like-minded successful animators. Also, the jobs I've earned on campus were very helpful and related to my field of study."
Sophomore,4,"Bloomfield college is an excellent college, that i feel is the right school for me. The professors that I have had have been amazing. They truly take the time to teach the material at a decent paste. I enjoy free tutoring whenever it is necessary because I'm always in need of help. "
College Freshman,4,There's nohting that I hate about this college.
College Freshman,4,Student make what they put into their college education.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,I was lucky enough to get into 225 and it has satisfied my needs
College Sophomore,4,there are very good professors who help you out when you have a question or anything they explain good. the sizes of the classroom are good like it is not overly packed it is a reasonable number.
College Sophomore,4,I see a lot of Bloomfield police around I feel safe since I know the area.
College Junior,4,They have 24/7 campus security
College Junior,4,The school is very known for hiring newly graduated students to give them the experience they need and then do a really great job helping them find other jobs.
College Junior,4,The professors are very involved with the students and the setting for teaching is very comfortable.
College Junior,4,"Being that I am in the nursing program, jobs after graduation are of high demand and the passing rate for the NCLEX is extremely high."
College Junior,4,Security is throughout the campus. I feel safe at night knowing that there is always a security guard around watching the areas.
College Junior,4,Greek life on campus is not huge but when events do occurs many students who are not Greeks participate and support the Greeks. Their events are very fun and give the college a whole different involvement.
College Freshman,4,The amount off work the is required to pass the class is very large and important. Professors are also very helpful when it comes to students having a problem.
College Freshman,4,It is very wonderful to live on campus because it's like you have your own apartment but just has rules and you have a roommate. The building is very clean and has quiet hours for those who likes it quiet. There's different departments where students can go to be independent or to socialize with others.
College Freshman,4,The athletics at my school are very wonderful at the sports they have. Most students who play for the teams are treated equally no matter their race or sex.
College Junior,4,"At my school I'm enrolled in a program where they focus on mentoring, tutoring, and building relationships. Even though my school is small I don't feel comfortable in the crowds of students so this campus fits me perfectly."
College Sophomore,4,I love that the staff helps out a lot.
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of different restaurants and food options nearby or not too far from campus
College Freshman,4,"The strictness is mostly fair, with a few exceptions, such as fining entire dorm floor levels, or breaking up a large group of students who may not be making too much noise"
College Freshman,4,"The financial aidc process is relatively smooth, and the school helps students. However, the school may not help enough for certain students and parents. They also don't discuss the scholarships that are available that will help students pay for tuition or how to apply to them. The financial aid process itelf is very quick and easy to go through."
College Freshman,4,"There are many activities that go on throughout the year on campus, and living on campus is very convenient to attend those activities. Resident advisors and directors create a family like atmosphere with students within the dorm."
College Junior,4,I do not live on campus but I have heard living on campus is pleasant for the students. The Bloomfield community is very involved. When I am on campus it is always a wonderful experience. There are activities that engage the residents and the functions in which they are held are adequate if not exceptional.
College Freshman,4,Actually i'm a freshmen student but i do have a experience concerning my course. It's my dream to be a nursing in future because i love helping people.
College Freshman,4,"It's a great thing to be in a specific program in school, because i'm  working toward my future, i love what i'm doing and i am happy with it."
College Freshman,4,"Is like a hand on a chance to learn new skill and methodologies, although my internship is unpaid position but the experiences i gain from it do matter to me."
College Sophomore,4,"In the campus there are people from different countries the have different costumes. No one has to adapt to beliefs of other just because they hang out with people that have different interest. Since everyone comes from different places in this world, everyone learns something new about each other."
College Sophomore,4,"The Student Health Service its great. As soon as you walk in the office the secretary is friendly. There are free stuff such as pads, lotions, deodorants, booklets on how to be healthy. The nurses will assist fast. They will also not talk among themselves about student's issues."
College Sophomore,4,"Many students that are in the college have scholarship because of the sport they practice. Many people I know are involved in sports. Some sports are soccer, baseball, basketball but the most common is boys and girls soccer. I heard they have early morning practice and then they have classes to attend. Having sports in the college is a good chances for students to received scholarship while they enjoy practicing a certain sport and getting educated."
College Sophomore,4,"Guys and Girls are very friendly in my college. There are some days that either boys or girls are in the mood to dress up nice and other lazy days that they wear anything comfortable. At the end, it does not matter because they are going to class not to parties. Both guys and girls are friendly and outgoing. There are always group of both sex hanging out and laughing."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is well organized and clean. The students and professors are friendly and helpful. There is always someone to guide you if you do not know where a place is located.
College Sophomore,4,Many of my friends who are juniors and seniors are in off campus housing because they prefer it. It is suggested for those who have had the dorming/on-campus experience.
College Sophomore,4,File your Fasfa as soon as possible and if you have troubles or your are unable to fill out at home then go to the campus' financial aid office which has an amazing staff willing to help
College Freshman,4,"My mother and I processed all financial aids, grants and scholarship application together"
College Freshman,4,I think the Greek life is a really good thing here. I actually have thought about joining the Greek life. We are a small community school where every gets along no matter what.

College Freshman,4,They are up to date.
College Freshman,4,"There are programs to help you stay focused, and tutoring."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a commuter, but I heard it's strict. However some kids get around it."
College Sophomore,4,thankful for the scholarship my school gave me
College Sophomore,4,I don't live on campus
Senior,2,I Think My Biggest Mistake Was Attending Bloomfield College . I Already Peeped How Unprofessional & Shady Most Staff Members Were Especially The Housing Department. I Came Here Right Out Of The Foster Care System So My Guard Was Already Up & I Didnâ€™t Trust Nobody. The Housing Department Is Probably The Most Messiest Department On Campus. They Sit Around & Discuss Everyoneâ€™s Personal Business That Students Entrusted Them With. There Was One Point In Time They Tried To Get Me To Get A Student Locked Up His Senior Year & Even Tried Bribing Me With Jobs & Internships If I Helped With Theirs & The Policeâ€™s Investigation. They Didnâ€™t Like The Student & They Knew I Had A Few Issues With This Student So They Tried To Get Me To Get Him Locked Up. Thereâ€™s so much that goes on behind the scenes. I wouldnâ€™t suggest anyone to come here for four years
Freshman,2,"The only thing I enjoyed in Bloomfield College were the professors. They are clearly passionate about what they teach and are always willing to help students. I wish that there were more things to do here. I also wish there were more food options on campus. Even though there is security, they are rarely seen and the campus is out in the open. Most of the time it's hard to feel safe here. I paid for one of my transcripts to be sent to another university months ago and the university still has not received it, so I feel like the only part of the faculty that is reliable are the professors."
Freshman,2,"If you like a small school with barely anything to do than this school is for you. its also very overpriced in my opinion. for 41,000 you should be getting more than what they offer."
College Junior,2,Not exactly the best education and famous quality for the amount you're paying.
College Freshman,2,The RA always shout down everything before everything start because of the fact that this is a small campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting information about financial aid is a headache. The housing selection process is a joke. The administration makes decisions about the students tuition and housing then asks them ""hypothetically"" how they would feel about those changes without telling the students that they've already put those plans into action."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of the girls dress alike. The guys are immature. Most are only into the parties, smoking and being seen."
College Sophomore,2,"The Social Work program needs to be worked over. It is a bit depressing that there are not many classes offered in my major, especially nearing my senior year. Going into this upcoming Spring 2015 semester, less than three 300 level courses are available and the counselors just suggest that you try to convince the professor to offer the courses you need. That's not my job and it seems unprofessional for the college to tell you that."
College Sophomore,2,The professors that I've had have been hit-or-miss. I've had some who are really great and inspire you to go out and make a change in the world. I've also had some who could care less whether their lectures are understood or correct. I've also had professors who haven't showed up more than twice the entire semester and then came to class with an attitude for no apparent reason.
College Sophomore,2,"While I qualified for more than twenty scholarships, I was not given any. The scholarships that this school does have are tremendously limited. You can't find any information about the scholarships online and you can only apply to them through the financial aid department. The process is as follows: you fill out a form, write a short essay about your goals after graduation and submit. From there the school determines which scholarships you are eligible for and does not contact you after that. I had to go in to ask if I had received any and was not given any answer for a week. There is no explanation as to which scholarships they applied to for you."
College Sophomore,2,"The administration here doesn't care for the students. They seem to be in it for the money, but aren't most colleges? The advising departments aren't very knowledgeable about the systems and advise students to take classes that don't count towards their major. I can attest that the only time I've seen the dean or any other administrator is when alumni come or when there is an open house event."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really care for this college's housing or the directors of it. Some of the residents of this town, that I've spoken with, are about as upset about the building of it's newest dorm building as some of the students. The price of living in it is tremendous and they force students into it as well without giving them an increase of funds to pay for it. A suite with eight people should have at least two refrigerators and students should be able to change the settings on the thermostat. Students were not given full access to many of the amenities until after the middle of the semester and were not given room inspection sheets upon move-in. And there was plenty wrong with the rooms including leaky toilets, malfunctioning thermostats, and peeling paint that I'm sure we will be charged for when it's time to move. The housing process is a mess, students who were promised and assigned a certain suite were moved into the new dorm building for their own good but we know it's to pay off the cost of building such an unnecessarily ""luxurious"" upperclassmen building that has a lot of irresponsible underclassmen living in it."
College Freshman,2,"Every time I come to Bloomfield college, I always commute through public transportation because there's almost never any parking spots. Good thing I don't have a car yet."
College Freshman,2,"closest mall is 30 minutes bus ride away, only two or three clothing stores near by and that just about it."
College Freshman,2,"there is only one shuttle bus for all students, in the event a student misses the bus that student must wait roughly two hours for the other bus."
College Sophomore,2,the food is so disgusting and not enough options.
College Freshman,2,"I don't like the school, only come to study and have no concern or interest in finding a job by school"
College Freshman,2,"It is winter time, therefore we have a bunch of snow. We have had many closings due to inclement weather."
College Freshman,2,"I think if you're going to be here at Bloomfield, you need a car. The shuttle is pointless because it as it's own schedule. It has been said that they are going to cancel the shuttle service next year. So the need for a car is high."
College Senior,2,I have heard many students complain about parking around the campus especially those who do not have a parking pass. They are constantly receiving tickets or have a hard time finding parking spaces therefore making them late to class. I am a parking permit which was costly and some days I am not guaranteed a spot because the parking lot is always filled to capacity. I believe this school should only give out the amount of parking permits that are equivalent to the amount of spaces in the parking lot.
College Freshman,2,"It's bad that there aren't cameras on every inch of the campus. The campus only has camera here and there, it's an insufficient amount. That really scares me."
College Freshman,2,Not interested in the Greek life at all. I dont care about it
College Freshman,2,There isnt much of a nightlife. There isnt too many bars to go too that are really fun. 
College Freshman,2,I found one guy i been with from the school since it has started so i havent been really looking. But most of them guys there arent for me. 
College Freshman,2,I dont think the food is very good on campus. I wish that it was healthier and had more options. I just never been very interested in the food on campus.
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing is really hard to find. The price is so much also. It isn't very convenient. 
College Freshman,2,It seems to be some what diversity. But you can see that there isnt much of a ethnic/racial diversity. But there is some. 
College Freshman,2,Sports dont seem to be that big of a deal on out campus. There is the teams but none of them are really good. it is a small school so there isnt a huge look on sports. 
College Freshman,2,I with there was more stores around that were healthier. It would be nice to have more of a healthy option around me. Also there isnt any student discounts that are for the college kids. 
College Freshman,2,"The food on campus and off is very nasty, but few are ok
"
College Freshman,2,The security isn't that good because people sneak in drugs and alcohol all the time without them knowing.
College Student,2,Everything is perfect and goes on smoothly.Bloomfield is a lifetime college one need to attend.
College Junior,2,"if you don't have a parking pass then your out of luck because of the stupid and confusing signs placed throughout the township of Bloomfield by the college. I think they do it on purpose because its guaranteed money. On two sides of the school there is a ""No parking here on Mondays from 12-3"" and a  ""No parking here Tuesdays from 12-3"" knowing those are the most frequent times people are going to class. Too many people including myself have been hit with $30 tickets. After 3 times you might as well spend the $107 on the parking pass because you're now in that and range and one more ticket you'll be over so..."
College Junior,2,"Confusing signs place on the side of the street for parking outside of the lot. Very easy to get a ticket and parking isn't always accessible, already spent $90 in tickets so it forced me to pay the $107 for the parking pass."
College Sophomore,2,Bloomfield's campus is really quiet but thefacilities surrounding the campus are perpetual. There are tons of different clubs you can join. For Commuter students its really hard to be apart student life. In my opinion lots of the programs at Bloomfield are geared toward residential students.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I would say that Bloomfield College's campus strictness is about average. They need to be strict because of drug issues and normal student discrepancies. Security is tight nowadays due to school shootings. To be honest, for minorities like me, we just want to take our classes and get out. I think Bloomfield College is pretty lenient for most things."
College Senior,2,The parking is okay - the price is a bit steep and there have been a few occasions when I have been unable to find a spot. Mondays & Wednesdays 10am - 2pm are the worst.
College Sophomore,2,The campus can be very strict sometimes especially with the school being a dry campus.
College Freshman,2,Many people don't care about there grades. Most people just go out party if they pass than they pass if they fail they fail. Basically some people dont care about whats going on. Its our own decision wether we want to actually take in this information the professors are giving us.
College Sophomore,2,The staff and Directors are really outgoing and reachable.
Sophomore,1,They literally canceled my major out of no where. The school is ran like a business instead of trying to care for students. Itâ€™s only students looking out for one another and some teachers but the higher ups like the Dean are trash. They just like the money but not the students. So much potential is wasted because of the ratchness and greed. Worst school ever unless you have no chance anywhere else.
Niche User,1,"I only attended one year before transferring, and from the very first day I could tell it was a mistake. The professors barely taught, choosing instead to assign pointless homework and then never bring them up again.
When they werenâ€™t failing their classes, students werenâ€™t even showing up. Donâ€™t expect to make friends here unless you enjoy being drunk or high 24/7.
One class in particular didnâ€™t match the course description at all so I was left banging my head against the wall three hours a week.
The staff never answered the phone, and even when they did, they never answered questions properly either. They accidentally withdrew me mid-semester because of a misinterpreted email, the consequences of which have me playing catch up even still today. You could replace anyone of the staff with a brick and nothing would change, as they all had the experience and personality of one. Actually, the brick might be more useful, because you could use it to put yourself out of your misery."
College Senior,1,Every semester I have to go to the Financial aid to fix thing they screwed up on. This school is not what I thought It would be like when I first took the tour.
College Freshman,1,the gym is full with like 3 people in it and the new one you need someone that live in the building in order to get in
College Freshman,1,many people prefer to stay in their house instead of been in  the campus
College Freshman,1,Everything is far if you dont have a car you cant get to places easily
College Freshman,1,in the school student are not allow to do anything. basically they are telling students to stay in their dorms and do nothing.
College Freshman,1,"parking is the worst at this university, many students get to class late due to unlimited parking. many pay for their parking pass and still cant find a parking spot in the parking lot. around campus is hard to find parking and sometimes students have to park far away and walk back to get to class."
College Freshman,1,no one knows anything about the sports unless one of the athletes mentions something. the teams are awful they barely ever win.
College Freshman,1,"there are only a few off campus dining's with includes a buffet, Ihop and a diner. there is a endless chain of Chinese food and soul food. that is about it. the student discount is nothing to mention and there is nothing exciting off campus."
College Freshman,1,When it snows it is the worse to commute too
College Freshman,1,I'm very unhappy. The school to me feels like a smaller version of HS
College Freshman,1,I didnt get much help from the school that i needed. It made me a little upset that they wernt as helpful. 
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no off-campus dining. Theres one place on Bloomfield Ave called Crown Fried Chicken but it will give you diarrhea. I think all the way down Bloomfield Ave is a quickcheck and dunkin dounuts.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I studied Computers, so I'm not a junkie. However, there's definately a drug problem on campus. I worked on campus, and my co-worker bought and smoked marijuna. He even smoked it in front of our building with students and security guards walking by. I smoke cigerettes, so I wanted to try it. He hooked me up in broad day light. It's unbelieveable easy to buy marijuna at Bloomfield College. I know a couple of dealers and I still buy from them occastionally."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bloomfield College needs to fix themselves because over the 4 years I've been there, between paying for parking and parking tickets, it cost me about $800."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If your not black, you won't fit in. Most people I know on campus have friends at home. Minorites like me don't bother trying to be accepted into the Afican American greek life."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Computers are unreliable. They only give you a couple hundred copies to print. If you accidently leave your login open, someone else can print from your account. Although they update the technology, overall, I found the computers and printers to be useless. I prefer to use my home computer."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Taking classes here is like taking fifth grade again. You will not learn anything. The teachers are friendly, but in terms of acadmics, your tuition will not be put to good use. It costs so much to come here and I expected to be challenged. If your looking for an easy college degree, you should come here."
Recent Alumnus,1,The services at Bloomfield College are terrible. Trying to make appointments and recieveing help is nonexistant. All the staff and administration cares about is taking your money. Go to a reputable school like Montclair or Rutgers.

Freshman,5,Have not started yet but the online classes/ hybrid structure make athletes feel like all the work is very manageable.
Freshman,5,Just starting out but the coaches of the beach volleyball team are great! They made the recruiting process very easy and simple.
Junior,5,It's a small local institution and so far I have had a great experience with the advisors as a transfer student.
Niche User,5,"I have been an MBA student at Westcliff University for the last two years. I chose this university mainly because it is convenient for me due to its location and flexible schedule. However, the most important reason that made me decide to register is the prestige of the university and the knowledgeable faculty. The affordable tuition is another very important aspect that had an impact on my decision.The education I have received so far has tremendously benefited my business in the area of consulting. I am now more able to identify client’s problems and address the right solutions. It has also benefited my company due to the fact that I can think about expanding my service by formulating and implementing a better business plan. I am now more aware about the many uses of technology to improve my business and my client’s businesses."
Senior,5,"My experience at Westcliff University has been phenomenal experience. It is a stepping stone University that will help you develop the type of perosn you want to become and what your next step will be after you graduate. The faculty and staff are very encouraging and patient with their students and work hard want to see students graduate. I am involved on the basketball team, and administration treats their student-athletes very well. Overall, I would recommend this school to any incoming high school students or transfers."
Freshman,5,I have been 7 months now  in this university and I am very happy to be a part of this university. I feel I made a good decision as curriculum is really flexible. The staff & professors are very supportive. I am learning something new everyday and they have a day 1 cpt.
Graduate Student,5,"The professors are very friendly and helpful, they have experience for years as a teacher and the best part of this MBA Program is its a STEM MBA and our professor has also worked at NASA."
Freshman,4,"The school is up and coming and is really supporting their sports program. The semester is broken into 8 week quarters with 8 week classes. There is so much to do in the Irvine area around campus. As the school out grows it’s campus, I’m excited to see where it goes."
Junior,2,I would say my overall experience was poor. The school didn't even have a dining plan and the campus was not big at all. Very poor quality experience and education. Not worth the time and money I spent.

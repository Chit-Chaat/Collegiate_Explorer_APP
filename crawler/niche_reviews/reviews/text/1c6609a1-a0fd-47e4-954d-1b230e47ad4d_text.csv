Junior,5,Professors were very understanding of what was going on in the world yet still maintained a reasonable expectation for us all.
Junior,5,The campus staff is helpful as well as knowledgable. I feel taken care of when I have an issue. The facilities and amenities are also quite extensive. The Ray is always clean and the front dress help is friendly.
Junior,5,It is a great business school with an excellent accounting program. The campus is big and in downtown so you can easily get an internship as well.
Freshman,5,I'm only an incoming freshman but the interactions I've had with professors and other students I've met have definitely exceeded my expectations! Everyone is very caring and the professors will reach out and make connections which I'm grateful for.
Freshman,5,I'm currently enrolled in an online class at DePaul and it's been such an amazing opportunity and learning experience. The discussions are engaging and insightful yet every student and professor is respectful of other's points and opinions. It was super easy to figure out how the layout of the class would work and also to navigate the websites. It's also very interesting to meet people from their homes in other states and to get on a more personal level from behind a screen.
Junior,5,I have taken classes online during COVID-19 and before then. The professors do not take long to reply to emails. All due dates and assignments are set from the very beginning. They are willing toThey make accommodations because things are online.
Junior,5,"Since being at DePaul I have met so many great people. You definitely feel a sense of community being here. It is hard not to be involved. there is always a campus event happening, that gives out FREE food, and DePaul apparel. By the time you graduate, you will have tons of DePaul shirts, and other cool apparel. There are tons of resources to help you succeed academically and in your future."

Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed all of my classes so far, my professors were very helpful and nice. Also, the community at DePaul University is diverse and open-minded."

Alum,5,"Online classes were beneficial and help get another class out of the way, especially when the traditional classroom setting may not fit your schedule best. I found the online classes were flexible enough to fit it into my regular school and part time work schedule. Most of the online professors are the same that teach in the classroom setting, so I never felt like I was missing out, and I found the content and challenge to be similar to the classroom. Professors were responsive to e-mail and calls, where needed, and very engaged in the topics. I took a variety of online classes from general education courses, to major level classes. I enjoyed every one of them!"
Freshman,5,The endless amount of opportunities you will receive going to DePaul is amazing. There are so many ways to get involved in your community and help one another.
Freshman,5,I have not taken any online classes although I do know if I did the professors would do they most they could through virtual learning to make sure I was on the right track.
Senior,5,This experience has been phenomenal. My online professors are more well versed than real class professors.
Junior,5,"During this pandemic is having been a challenge for everyone but they have been it very easy to transition to online classes this quarter. Before this all happened though the online experience was also very well done, the teachers stuck to a clear schedule that helped in turning things in and enough time to read."
Sophomore,5,"Depaul is an institution who helps individuals get a degree at hands on level; cant say that about a lot of other places. Curriculum is top notch, gets us students ready for the real world once we leave. The connections and networking this place has is amazing, a lot of routes you can take to get hired anywhere knowing you went to Depaul and that is the best part!"
Junior,5,DePaul University accepts all of their students with open arms. DePaul is very liberal and allows all of their students to speak on behalf of their own opinion; there is never any backlash for relaying what you think is right. DePaul University teaches their students to live among people with different backgrounds.
Junior,5,I love that it is in the city of Chicago and a great school to be at. The city is the best place to make connections and get a quality education.
Niche User,5,DePaul University is a unique school because of the experience of having to the ability to stay in area and explore the city of Chicago.
Freshman,5,"DePaul is an amazing school that has many oppurtunities for many diffrent types of students. For me I found myself loving having school in a large city, and that provided me with the best oppurtunites out there."
Niche User,5,Love the atmosphere and the neighborhood was beautiful. Staff is very nice and buildings are clean and cozy.
Freshman,5,I love the urban neighborhood of Lincoln Park and getting the time to get accustomed with my surroundings and the nearby Chicago theater scene.
Junior,5,"It's really a fantastic school. The professors are some of the best in the world and it really gets you ready for success in your career.  Tuition is high, but that is to be expected of such a great education."
Junior,5,DePaul is invested in their students representing well when they are out of the university and transitioning into the real world. You will find more professors that care about what they're teaching to students than those that don't. The campus is a great place to be whether you're downtown or Lincoln Park.
Niche User,5,"I am looking to enroll, and so far I love the school. DePaul has a great diversity background, they are all about hands-on learning  and getting an education that is tailored do you"
Sophomore,5,"DePaul University is in one of the greatest cities of the US. Even though it is located in Chicago, DePaul has its' own feeling of home and being a college campus even while in the big city. With many opportunities and career advancements, DePaul offers many opportunities for everyone!"
Freshman,5,"DePaul is an absolutely amazing school. I am a freshman right now and my college experience has been phenomenal. I have met so many amazing people and have felt so supported and encouraged by everyone around me. Although the transition to college seems scary, thanks to DePaul it wasn't scary at all and I have loved every second of it."
Graduate Student,5,I really love the environment of DePaul University . Everyone seems very nice and welcoming . I’m very excited to start my new journey at DePaul University .
Junior,5,DePaul University provides students with a supportive learning environment. The professors are very supportive and there is a lot of assistance available to students looking for a variety of services.
Sophomore,5,"Being in a big city, DePaul attracts a diverse student body which allows for expanded world views to be developed."
Niche User,5,I really love DePaul University. Once I got accepted into the school it made me so happy. I realized that I have a dream of going to this school. It is a big and powerful school that I would love to be apart of. Just seeing the school helps me see my future. I would love to actually get to be apart of this school.
Sophomore,5,I like that DePaul in Lincoln Park as well as the Loop because you can get a change in scenery when going to classes. I also like how easy it is to have a job or internship and go to school at the same time since we are located in a city. The only downside to the university is that there is not much school spirit. I also think that you need to try hard to find a group of people that you click with. Since most people commute to DePaul it is rare that you actually connected to the campus unless you join a club.
Senior,5,"DePaul University is a wonderful school to attend. Placed among the beautiful architecture that encompasses Chicago, there are endless amounts of things to do and see right outside your dorm room! Plenty of clubs to be a part of, places to eat, theatre to see."
Junior,5,DePaul is a really good school with good professors who cares about how are you doing in class. I really like the classroom size that are less than 40 students which is really beneficial for the students and for the professors to interact with each other. The campus is really organized and clean. I really like their 10-weeks quarterly program which goes by real fast.
Freshman,5,"I liked how close the campus is to downtown Chicago and there are lots of things to do in the area. There are always parties to go to, the mens basketball games are also very fun. Since there are a lot of students, it isn't very hard to meet new friends, especially with downtown Chicago being only a few minutes away by train. The class sizes are small, which allows you to really connect and have one on ones with your profesors. I really liked this since most big schools had class sizes over 60 people, but Depaul offers a small school in a big city."
Graduate Student,5,I've loved my time at DePaul University this far. The staff is amazing and they are so helpful when it comes to helping with time management. There are workshops all the time that give us students the opportunity to meet future employers and make those connections that will help us move up in the world. I love DePaul!
Freshman,5,"I just transferred here and I'm having a great experience! I didn't think my old school was the right school for me so I decided to make the switch and I'm really glad I did. I get to be so much closer to my family, visit my friends at surrounding schools and overall just have the college experience I have always wanted to have! I have so many connections to the school and it has already proven to be a place I can see myself thriving at and I'm happy to call myself a Blue Demon!"
Niche User,5,"I like the school very much and i especially like the diversity in all aspects such as race, sexuality, gender orientation, and everything else. The people there are very nice and very fun to get to know and being at Depaul is a wonderful college experience."
Niche User,5,"My son was accepted into DePaul.  Having employed a number of graduates across all the schools in the Midwest, I can tell you DePaul graduates are by far some of the most work-ready.  I think the difference lies between it being a teaching school vs a research university.  Students are very well prepared for the working world.   Great university.  Great teachers.  Great location.  I am thrilled my son will be going here and confident he will be employed when he graduates."
Niche User,5,"What I liked about DePaul was the overall student friendliness that they have.  They have their times where they are serious, also have their times when they are about having fun and I overall love that about the school They seem to really care about students being on track while in college and in life. Overall a excellent school and is on my list of choices for my college education."
Sophomore,5,"I love DePaul University. I came in as a transfer student from a different university after my freshman year of college. I started my Sophomore year in the city of Chicago at DePaul and have fallen in love with the professors, the people, the atmosphere, and the culture at the university. It is an amazing school."
Freshman,5,I love it here! Always something to do with TONS of opportunities to try out new things and to meet new people.
Sophomore,5,DePaul is such a beautiful school with great education  and it’s located in such a fun and busy area. But I would love to see more diversity.
Alum,5,"Amazing education, experience, and learning structure.  I was seeking a diverse school with maintaining a connection to my faith, this was it."
Senior,5,I love all my classes for my major along with all the student organizations. Some of the gen ed classes aren't too bad.

Graduate Student,5,DePaul is a great place to go to school. The campus is beautiful and theres always something fu  happening. It's easy to commute to as theres a red line and a brown line stop right on campus. Theres also a whole foods on campus which has Amazon lockers which is super convenient. The teachers are amazing and have real world experience and do a great job of preparing you for the workplace.
Graduate Student,5,"My first year at DePaul University, so far it is not bad but I do not enjoy taking a hybrid course for my program. It seems like DePaul chooses anybody to teach the students."
Graduate Student,5,Depaul  is  very  cool  place  for study. It  has wonderful  teachers  and  in  downtown of  Chicago.  so  you can go  for  party  and  do other stuff.
Freshman,5,DePaul University is an amazing school with welcoming staff and a plethora of resources. This university is very diverse filled with individuals who are willing to help at any means necessary. This is also very kempt with workers who care.
Freshman,5,"I love how inviting everyone at DePaul has been to me. From orientation as a current first year student to students who work in the Career Center and around campus, I have found all students, professors, faculty, and staff to be be amazingly friendly. I an currently in a program called TRIO SSS that helps first generation low-income students like myself transition into a college environment and learn how to life as the best and more productive student one can be."
Junior,5,"The classes are small, the professors are extremely dedicated! The institution does everything they can to keep the students safe on campus. It is an expensive school, but it shows through what they have to offer."
Senior,5,"Overall, DePaul has been a rollercoaster of emotions, lessons and personal growth. I believe it has been a great place to improve on skills, meet new people, network, and indulge in all things that make DePaul great. It is filled with different opportunities, experiences and it is what you make of them that creates unforgettable memories and lessons learned. I've been lucky to have great professors who are dedicated at their craft. I have also met the greatest people at this school and that makes it much more valuable and amazing."
Junior,5,"I am a commuter at DePaul University and I love it! It is in an area easily accessible from anywhere in the city as the campus is right off the Fullerton CTA train station. Its location gives great opportunity to access many main attractions of the city. Once you step on campus the environment is very welcoming with such friendly staff and faculty. The professors always seem passionate about the classes they're teaching and they are also more than willing to aid you and make themselves available for you. There is always a variety of events happening on campus, even for commuters which engages them to really feel like they belong as a student. There is always great spots like the quad to hang out with friends, and class sizes are relatively small for college classes allowing you to meet great friends and allowing the professors to really get to know their students and personalize their teaching. Overall, a great school!"
Sophomore,5,"DePaul has very caring, educational professors. I have never had a bad experience with a professor not helping me or not having enough resources to learn the information completely. There are many welcoming organizations to join and there is a crew for everyone! The school is very diverse and the students are fun, nice, welcoming, and hard working! I am so thankful I ended up at a University that I care for and love so much! DePaul really is my home away from home and I recommend everyone apply for a good education and fantastic college experience."
Junior,4,"DePaul is a great place for computer science (and related fields) majors. The teachers are wonderful and fun, they help you with networking and understanding the field you're going into. Downtown Chicago is lively and fun to explore (with friends for safety). Overall a good place to study and cool teachers to guide you along the way."
Freshman,4,The teachers were awesome when it comes to communication with their students. They made sure they were able to stay in touch with us and to see if we needed any assistance with our work.
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking for a school with a friendly environment of student colleagues and staff that go out of their way to help connect students to useful resources then this is the school for you. My overall experience so far at DePaul has been marvelous, the resources that the school offered allowed me to pursue options about my career interests and helped me thrive in my classes. The students I encountered in my classes have been friendly and I've had a pleasant time networking with fellow classmates. The location of the campus also allowed me to discover the city that the college rests in. This gave me the ambition to start exploring and connecting with the community and helping me get immersed into the culture. With classes that helped challenge me and professors that pushed me to go above and beyond I can safely say that my experience at this school so far has been met with excitement and gratitude for the connections I've made and the advancements I've made in my field."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are better than physical classes, I learned much better and didn't have to deal with the headache of finding parking in the city!"
Junior,4,"It has been pleasant for the most part, but it is difficult to say, as I have only just started taking online classes. There is also a great difference between each professor's tackle on online learning. For the most part, the teachers did their best and provided the type of education they felt was best according to both the content and material their classes cover, and based off the stress students are going through."
Junior,4,"Some of the remote access was difficult to connect to, such as SPSS software. However, Tech support really came through and was easy to access and helpful."
Junior,4,The classes online were well structured and greatly equipped with Zoom and D2L. Professors stayed on top of things
Sophomore,4,I love DePaul. My only issue has been with how they are handling the pandemic. They cannot seem to make up a solid plan for the situation at hand.
Senior,4,"My overall experience at DePaul has been enjoyable. The campus life is diverse. There are lots of clubs and events on campus. Most classes are engaging and appropriately challenging. In my experience, most professors seem to care about the material and students. Plus the location and vibe of both the Loop and LP campuses create such a unique city experience that other schools really can't compete with. I have really enjoyed my DePaul experience."
Sophomore,4,I love the urban campus and my particular degree program is very well designed.  I have only had a couple of poor professors but most of them love what they are teaching and are dedicated to student success.
Sophomore,4,I took all of my Spring Quarter classes online.  Most of my professors held live Zoom meetings for lectures which I appreciated.
Alum,4,"Having taken a couple classes online at DePaul - I would say they are pretty well coordinated. The teachers know how to use the format, they instruct pretty well. They do their best to keep the students engaged and vice versa."
Alum,4,"Good school
Great location
Lots of opportunities to network and understand the ""system""
Teachers are strong (could be better)
You get to live a truly independent lifestyle"
Alum,4,"DePaul's two campus' are in the heart of two very popular areas of Chicago. Chicago is your campus. The largest Roman Catholic university in the world, while it is not like a traditional campus, it is a unique experience in that you can walk around, explore, and enjoy all that Chicago has to offer. Many of the professors do this part time after their regular jobs as a way to give back. They are experts in their field and often provide real life scenarios/situations in the classroom. As with any school, there exceptions to this and you get through it with the support of others. The curriculum is challenging but not impossible if you dedicate the time. There are a lot of resources and those in the city that are connected to DePaul in some way which provides even more opportunity than another school."
Freshman,4,"Like most institutions, DePaul used Zoom for meetings and to host classes. I had one class that was asynchronous, and since Zoom decided to update in the middle of the quarter, it was slightly annoying to figure out how it worked. Besides that class, all my other classes were completely online; including labs. I personally feel like I did better this quarter for labs, however, my chemistry lecture experience could have been better as I learned that taking tests online is more difficult than taking them in person. Due to the pandemic and the recent protests, we had the option to complete the class, take an incomplete, or have 70% of the work we completed be used to calculate our grade. Additionally, we had the option to opt for a letter or a pass/fail grading for our classes even after final grades were posted. This way, everyone was guaranteed to pass."
Freshman,4,"As a Biological Sciences major, I personally never went to the Loop campus and therefore do not have any reviews for that campus. For the Lincoln Park campus, however, I appreciate how diverse the campus is and how there are so many opportunities to get involved as well as the various events during the school year where they give out free school merch and food, especially during finals season. Although DePaul is on a quarter system, I personally never felt too overwhelmed with how fast we learned the material or how long the lectures were. As a freshman, the autumn quarter is the most eventful and you feel like you're in a university by the time winter quarter comes around. Overall, I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed studying at DePaul."
Senior,4,"I liked that the hands on classes were really well developed. I would like to see more professors receive counseling services, because more often than not a lot of them are very unhappy individuals or have sketchy friends they align fieldwork with and may need extra assistance to prepare better lessons with a positive mental health attitude. Online learning has been somewhat of an adaptation, but I have the pleasure and good fortune of having professors whom are experienced in this platform."
Junior,4,I have been at DePaul for almost 2 years now and it’s been a great experience. The faculty has been fantastic in showing their skills and years of experience in the field. The classes do a great job helping you succeed in school and in you’re upcoming career.
Graduate Student,4,"Solid academics, city campus, buy very very expensive. Try to look for schoolroom before accepting a spot here."
Freshman,4,"I have truly enjoyed my experience at Depaul. I am a freshman and I feel as though I was welcomed properly and have been able to access many opportunities not only for my major but for important life experiences. It is accepting, diverse, inclusive, and has taught me many unique things I wouldn’t have learned without attending. It has a wide range of majors, great professors, and a variety of classes. Like all colleges, it is not perfect but it makes sure to help students when needed and the administrators always ask for feedback. I feel like my opinion matters and I am so proud to be a student at DePaul."
Freshman,4,I have taken classes online and have enjoyed them. Teachers have been very clear with what the course is about. If there is a question they provide different ways in which we can contact them.
Freshman,4,Things that I liked about Depaul were that they did not discriminate against any race. You can truly see the diversity in both campuses. Also there are many majors and minors that students can choose from. You will definitely find an interest you can pursue.
Junior,4,"It was cool. great faculty, very in debth bio-labs. All professors are nice, and all faculty is there to help/"
Senior,4,"I like the small class sizes DePaul offers to students. My largest class was close to  50 or 60 students. The instructors are generally very supportive of the students and quite available to help. The university has very helpful student resources from financial aid, the career center, support for LGBTQ+ students, students of all religions, and other resources. There are even counseling options for students who cannot meet with a therapist."
Freshman,4,"DePaul is located in the most perfect spot in the city and if you like that, then this is the school for you. DePaul has amazing scenery in every class and everything is so local. DePaul provides good student life with Greek life, sports, clubs, and student events that you can attend."
Sophomore,4,Poor since of community but good academics. A little hard to graduate in 4 years with some of the majors.
Sophomore,4,"Depaul University has great academics and is in Lincoln Park in Chicago. However, The return on investment is not worth it’s private school cost. The campus overall has great professors and many cultural clubs through the APIDA center."
Niche User,4,"The environment is nice. All the professors are genuinely nice and interactive with their students. They offer help and provide work that actually sticks to someone. The campus is very nice. It is not so close to the lake so it doesn't get as freezing. The campus is very lively with greenery and it is located in a very nice neighborhood and there is hardly anything bad happening around that area so it can be considered safe. The athletics are also pretty advanced being ranked in a Division 1 scale, they are pretty competitive. The students are also very kind, they just go to school and go about their day. It is not a very problematic school if I say so myself.  They also have great security and they are very vigilant at night and this helps the students feel safe while being on campus."
Niche User,4,"I really like how Depaul University are very helpful with their students. As an incoming Freshman I really appreciate that the University really care about their students. Also I like how the students are really involved in the activities they are able to offer like clubs, organizations, and Study abroad."
Freshman,4,I've had some really great Professors here at DePaul University. I also recieved a generous financial aid package that brought the price down to a state school cost. The school is very diverse and has a lot of great resources for students like the career center.
Freshman,4,All the students and the staff equally demonstrate the importance of inclusion and helping out others. Being in the city helps out with being involved and moving in a fast paced environment. I also enjoy the attention that there is is on the students overall.
Freshman,4,First-year student. DePaul is as diverse a college is going to get. Being a student at DePaul gives you a real-world experience because so many different people attend there. It is expensive but that just college for you. I am overall having a good time.
Junior,4,"While visiting DePaul, I was very impressed with all of the opportunities they had to offer. The places you can study abroad to is outstanding! The campus is diverse and makes you feel safe, it's also in the heart of Chicago if you're looking for an urban setting."
Sophomore,4,"DePaul is an excellent school located in the heart of Chicago. Students interested in studying Business or Computing should come to DePaul, those are some of the best schools in the university."
Freshman,4,"The one thing that really excited me about depaul was the diversity it has to offer. Being the largest catholic school, the diversity and welcoming of the school does not fail to impress me"
Junior,4,"Very expensive, but beautiful and very accepting. Classes are very challenging but professors are amazing"
Junior,4,"Attending DePaul University has opened my mind so much in the time I've studied there. Its location in Chicago allows for so many opportunities, experiences and connections. It has also given me a real taste of independent living in the big city, and opened my eyes to poverty, gentrification, and other issues that become very real and apparent when living in a city like Chicago. DePaul and its professors always express the importance of giving back to the community and applying what we learn in the classroom to the serving of other people. As a music major at DePaul, I have been able to connect with the music scene in Chicago, and I've already learned of ways music has been used to connect people in Chicago of all different ages, cultures, and social statuses. My time at DePaul has definitely been worth it."
Junior,4,As an upcoming Junior at DePaul Univeristy I've lived on campus for my two previous years and enjoyed my time so far. Living in the city of Chicago is a fulfilling experience and the school work is just hard enough to feel like you're learning something.
Sophomore,4,"Depaul is a great school, but it is not 5 stars. The professors truly love what they do and there are some great people on campus. Being in the city is fantastic and with transportation covered in tuition, students have free roam of the city. 
But, some of the ""help"" they show new students isn't as great/helpful as they'd like it to be. The school is extremely expensive too."
Freshman,4,"DePaul University is the type of college that has a bit of everything for all that attend it. Being a big named school, the price can scare off people interested in attending. Yet, if you find a way to move past that, you'll find a place full of potential and self-discovery as you explore your options."
Sophomore,4,DePaul University is a fun school however I don't recommend going if you want to enjoy college food! The academics are alright but I don't regret going since I was exposed to a lot of amazing people here at DePaul.
Sophomore,4,"DePaul is a pretty good school considering the location since both campuses are close or right in downtown Chicago. The school is mid-size, and the Lincoln Park reflects that. DePaul is definitely socially/politically aware and has plenty of clubs/organizations to suit anyone's interests. The counselors and staff are invested in helping you succeed, no matter what major you're in. Campus food isn't the best and there aren't many options, but beyond freshman year you can adjust to a different plan according to what you need. There are always lots of events on campus, especially at Lincoln Park. DePaul definitely isn't perfect, but if you take advantage of opportunities available, you're gonna find your own circle and do well."
Senior,4,"I am a film student at DePaul, and for those who want to work in film, it is an amazing school to go to. The professors are wonderful, very knowledgeable and experienced in the industry, and are valuable connections to have. The film students are great, everyone is very talented and creative, and working on students sets with other fellow DePaul students is a great way to create relationships and connections outside of the classroom. You also have access to tons of professional film equipment as a student, which is something I cannot recommend enough to take advantage of while in school. Also, you have numerous job/freelance/internship opportunities all around you since you are in the heart of Chicago, which another great way to gain experience and build your network and career as well. DePaul already has a fantastic film school and new students have a lot to look forward to because it's only going to get better."
Senior,4,"I have loved my time at DePaul University. More than I have loved the school, I have loved the city of Chicago. I am originally from a suburb near the city and it has been such a breath of fresh air to feel like I am in the middle of the action.  There are opportunities for every walk of life and avenue of success in this city. You just have to keep your eyes open and be ready to go when the opportunity shows. 

The other thing I love about this school is that there are so many different kinds of people that you can truly be yourself.  You will find people that love you for you. Whether they are at DePaul or otherwise, this school is a great place to mature and find yourself because the city gives you the room to do it on your own terms."
Niche User,4,Its in downtown so the traffic is really bad if you don't live there. The campus is very nice. The building are kinda far from each other but its a nice walk in the spring. I thing its a great school
Freshman,4,"I like that it's big enough to meet a lot of people, but the class sizes are never more than 40 students.  The professors are very passionate about the subject that they teach, but some are a lot better at teaching than others."
Niche User,4,"Its extremely close, and a pro-dominant school in the Chicago area that brings with it a lot of respect and attention."
Graduate Student,4,"I was a Health Science major. Super tough classes, mainly because it was fast pace due to the quarter system, but I had great teachers. Overall, GPA was 3.28. One thing to keep in mind with DePaul, they only had certain classes each quarter. For example, if you wanted to take CHEM 101, you wouldn't be allowed to take it in Spring, only in Fall."
Freshman,4,"DePaul is a great school. Professors genuinely care about their students and want to see them grow. They try to be flexible if office hours do not work for a student. The campus is beautiful and easy to maneuver. Public safety and office for student with disabilities are not great, however.  Both departments could seriously use some work when it comes to helping physically disabled students."
Junior,4,"Chicago is your campus. That is the biggest marketing campaign that DePaul University has out there. However, when you start getting in there, you may find that DePaul has a lot of wonderful resources that are available to everyone at the university. For film, DePaul is one of the biggest schools out there to get hands on experience with people who have worked within the industry. They have computer labs, studio spaces alongside the lots of famous shows and movies being made, animation labs, video game production labs, workshops, movie screenings, and so many people to help you with your next project. The only complaint that I could have is that it's a very big commuter school, so you don't get to see much of the people who go to the school unless you're on campus a lot. Overall, it is worth the experience. You will learn so much."
Niche User,4,We had a good experience at DuPaul. The time spend between presentation and tour is reasonable.  One thing tour should  include is actual visit to labs and classrooms. The campus is well integrated to the city and with good commute options. We should take DuPaul as good contender for on our college research process.
Freshman,4,"This school provides students with diverse learning environments that appeal to students who learn in different ways. They provide students numerous opportunities to better themselves, get involved, and further their careers."
Senior,4,"DePaul is really diverse, from students to professors. Every class is a new challenge and professors really push you to become the best you career wise and personality wise."
Junior,4,"I have transferred to DePaul University and I felt pretty welcomes there. The first thing I liked was the orientation. In the orientation, I got to know to campus, met an advisor, learned about all the services, and everyone I met during the orientation welcomed all the students. All of our questions got answered as well. Now, during the school year, I like that the class size is from 30-40. It makes me feel more comfortable and that makes the professors easily reachable. I can ask questions in the class and can schedule to meet with the professor as well. I also like that the faculty staff is very helpful to every student. I have asked questions and all of them have been very helpful in guiding me to the right direction."
Graduate Student,4,I'm a graduate student studying Data science. The location of both Depaul's campus on both of the very good business area of Chicago which give me an opportunity for finding job either internship or after graduated.
Junior,4,"The professors are very professional, and most of them are more than willing to help you if needed. I've had a few that are a little full of themselves, but overall the majority are there to see you succeed. 

The quality of education is excellent, but it does come with a hefty price tag. I'm a little nervous about paying back the five digits of student loans, but for my major, 90% of students find a job in their field of study after graduation. 

I would certainly recommend this university for anyone looking to for a great education."
Junior,4,"The teachers seem to genuinely care about their students.  There is a variety of courses.  The campus is a little confusing, but overall not too difficult to navigate.  They are very good to their transfer students."
Junior,4,I've felt like I have become a better student with what they have to offer. They really show how working in the city will feel like. They set you up for success and everything that life will throw at you. It's great being able to tell people that I attend a great college.
Graduate Student,4,The professors I’ve had thus far are very knowledgeable and great at their job. They also have a good way of teaching and I learned a lot in the courses.
Graduate Student,4,"As an online student, I've had an enjoyable experience so far with Depaul. The teachers are humorous and effective and my classmates have all been supportive and great to work with."
Freshman,2,Depaul Is a great place to go to college. If you are rich and your parents are paying for your college.
Junior,2,"Visit campus before even thinking about attending. It is nothing like how you would expect it to be. Calling this a Catholic school is nothing more than an advertising term used by the university to give the delusion of a somewhat exclusive education. Nothing exclusive here. From run of the mill amenities and old disgusting buildings, DePaul is falling apart at the seams. There are two reasons you attend DePaul: You didn't get accepted into Northwestern or you want to live in the city."
Freshman,2,I’m hopeful that it will get better at DePaul but it’s not been great. Academically- I had one really good professor - one that was horrendous and a couple that were so-so. But socially - it stinks. Nothing going on in dorms - people generally not friendly. Focusing on my studies right now and will think about transferring after this trimester.
Graduate Student,2,"I am from Chicago. Being in Graduate program at DePaul, your classes will consist of early 20 year old students. They are closed-minded, high income. The professors are not flexible when life happens outside of class. Since your classmates, do not work, but live off their parents income. Their examples of why they want to serve privileged communities, are memories of them seeing a poor person and feeling bad. It's disgusting how closed minded the students and faculty are. If you are African-American, DO NOT ATTEND HERE. The ideal student is WHITE, HIGH INCOME. They are not for the people, but For Profit."
Freshman,2,"DePaul is probably the most boring school you could possibly go to. The fact that a school can be so close to Chicago yet be so lacking in things to do, is appallingly bad. The teachers are okay but none of them ever post grades or will tell you how you’re doing, just a “everyone is doing fine”. Like what does that mean?? The discover classes are a complete waste of time and money and you learn literally nothing. Back to the boredom, a large amount of people commute so the weekends are pretty dead. Also there’s no parties after fall quarter ends, so be ready to spend boatloads of money every weekend. In terms of sports, nothing much to say, the sports culture is nonexistent so just forget about it. Finally, academics are good, but not worth the price at all. You could go to a state school and pay less or equal the price and have a better education, social life, and overall experience. Bottom line: don’t go here, it’s not worth it."
Niche User,2,"The community and everything around it is great. The school itself is far from perfect. They're way too expensive for what they give you in return. Some of the staff is awesome and are very nice people, others are only there for their income and are not willing to help you out in any way."
Senior,2,"DePaul University FUNDS private prisons! However, if you don't pay your tuition on time, they will put a hold on your student account so you can't register for your classes, and will hassle you until you pay... even if you have just had surgery."
Graduate Student,2,"Classes were not challenging. Teachers were good, but  many of the classes that I needed were not offered. I was also waitlisted for entry into courses for 3 straight quarters and it set me back a full year."
Freshman,2,"I came to DePaul with the hope that I would get the perfect mix of a college experience and a city experience. I didn't realize, though, how much of the college experience I would be missing here. DePaul has virtually no school spirit and the vast majority of students live off campus, mostly 2-3 L stops away. Trying to live in a massive city like Chicago when you're 18 and from out of state is a scary thing. I always thought that moving to a city would be the best thing to ever happen to me, but ultimately I ended up transferring. DePaul does not give students a ""college experience"" in virtually any way at all. I strongly recommend to visit the campus and to also consider larger campuses where there are more opportunities to be a true college student. After all, you only get to be a college student for 4 years of your life, but you can live in a big city whenever you want."
Recent Alumnus,2,I quit the sorority I was in because they were judgmental and also charged you for ridiculous things.
College Sophomore,2,School is very hard on drug use but not on alcohol. Cannabis is viewed as the devil but alcohol is mostly normal in regards to punishment. I was unfairly kicked out of campus housing for cannabis.
College Sophomore,2,"DePaul is far too aggressive with feminist issues. As a male my biggest fear on campus is being falsely accused of sexual assault. At DePaul you're guilty until proven innocent. It's blatantly clear if you are accused of sexual assault than you're going to be expelled no matter what 95% of the time. 

The campus security is kind of worthless in my opinion. It's lincoln park, if you have a problem just call the CPD. They're there though for rides for girls across campus and everything though."
College Sophomore,2,Very few people are involved or go to games.
College Freshman,2,"Let me start off by saying that DePaul does not have a football team. I hate football, so this was a good thing for me, but it may seem strange to students who are looking for the typical ""college experience."" Men's basketball is everyone's main focus here, although the women's basketball team is apparently much better. However, nobody goes to the men's basketball games because rather than playing at McGrath-Phillips Arena, which is the women's basketball stadium, the men play at the Allstate Arena in the suburb of Rosemont-- a 40-minute drive away. There are buses that take students to the games, but nobody wants to bother taking such a long ride to see a team that isn't very good in the first place. I personally do not know anyone who has attended a sporting event at DePaul, including myself. This doesn't really matter too much to me, though, because I don't care for sports."
College Freshman,2,"I thought I would be surrounded by students who care about their education, but I know more students who have failed classes than students who haven't, and it's only the first quarter. I live in a freshman dorm, and the majority of students on my floor, including my roommates, get drunk multiple times a week, even on school nights. When I try to befriend kids from my classes, they suddenly stop talking to me when I tell them I'm not into partying. I feel as though everyone I come in contact with is a borderline alcoholic. Two of my three roommates are on academic probation and will likely be asked to leave the university. In theory, DePaul is my dream school: the absolute best location, unlimited train pass to go anywhere, free access to several museums, Catholic Vincentian values, WONDERFUL classes, long breaks, and no class on Fridays. However, the students I am surrounded by make college an unpleasant experience for me, and every day I wonder why I didn't just choose to go to community college. I go home whenever I can and think about transferring all the time. If the students cared about their grades and actually upheld the Catholic Vincentian values that the institution claims are so important, I would be having a much better time at school, but over halfway through the school year, I have not met a single person who thinks about more than just partying. As nerdy as this sounds, going to class is the only thing that I ever look forward to here, and I think college should be about much more than just going to class. Although DePaul sounds like my dream school in theory, if I had known how awful my classmates would be, I would have saved myself thousands of dollars and gone to community college."
College Freshman,2,admissions process could be less confusing and the staff could have a better knowledge of the process
College Sophomore,2,This is a major concern for majority of the female body on campus that needs to be looked into more.
College Junior,2,"I am not a part of Greek like at all, but I've rated it bad because it's practically nonexistent on our campus, and not important. Many but not all seem to be centered around parties, but I think there are also some community service-based Greek life at DePaul."
College Junior,2,I don't think that the university invests enough time or resources in satisfying its mostly adult (working) graduate student population - most of whom are paying for tuition out-of-pocket.
College Junior,2,"My graduate program has very low standards for its students (some of whom barely seem to have a command of the English language or any actual commitment to their education), mediocre advising, and an ever-rotating cast of faculty."
College Sophomore,2,The only people who care about Greek Life are Greek kids. There's better things to do at DePaul then pay for friends.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, sports don't matter unless you're on the team. Some people go to basketball games, but that's about it."
College Junior,2,"If you are a distance learning student - good luck. I've reached out to my academic advisor twice and he never responded. Administration and financial aid are not very helpful. If you email, you won't hear from someone for a week. For the amount that you pay for this school, you would think that they would have it together - they don't. I ended up transferring to a much better school. The only reason that I'm  giving them two stars is based on their innovative online courses. Other than that, this school is the worst."
College Junior,2,"Calvin college has a lot of work to do concerning cultural diversity. As a minority student, I did not feel very welcome."
College Sophomore,2,I lived at 1237 and had the worst experience of my live. It really degrades the name of DePaul. DePaul is too good to be associated with 1237.
College Sophomore,2,"The parties that I have been to were horrible. I was treated poorly as a women. The guys were rude, and it was all pointless. DePaul really isn't a party school. Its a bar school. You will find more students at bars then at parties drinking."
College Sophomore,2,"My family has no money, and I didn't receive any financial aid from the school. I'm in constant anxiety about the debt I will have from having not having financial aid."
College Freshman,2,Off-campus housing is hard to find in the middle of the city. There are a lot of apartments in Chicago but anything near campus is going to be expensive.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are spacious and we have the luxury of not having community style bathrooms. The building i stay in is pretty quiet most of the time, yet it does feel like a community. The building is up to date and is very clean. The housing process is easy and they give you a chance to request your roommate."
College Freshman,2,Getting financial aid was a huge process.
College Sophomore,2,"I may be biased but I don't like Greek life; most if not all people I have met that take part in Greek life are incredibly stuck up and two-faced. They don't do much, just a few events and then they drink and party the rest of the time."
College Sophomore,2,The verification process is a nightmare and the scholarship offered for my academic achievements is lacking in my opinion. It's an unfair system that truly benefits the athletes at the school--I don't see how I get bottom dollar for all the work I put in to maintain a high GPA yet the athletes here who have a minimum GPA to keep up get everything here for free along with pay. I also get recognized for my academics when it's most convenient for DePaul--i.e. I've been recognized for my credit hours by being charged an additional amount of $135 to my tuition yet I'm not offered Junior-level options for my course carts.
College Freshman,2,This school is expensive and my family is poor. I'm struggling to find money.
College Freshman,2,The housing applicaiton system was awful. Many students from the area were offered on-campus housing and a lot of out-of-state students were waitlisted. There are few dorms.
College Sophomore,2,The school has some pretty visible issues with campus rape that the administration isn't going to address as far as I can see.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been able to get any scholarships through my school.
College Sophomore,2,For what you're paying you're better off living off-campus. I have many friends who room in the dorms and hate it. Thankfully I was able to stop last semester. No particular dorm seems to be better than the rest. RAs are very strict and will destroy electronic devices if they find they've been left plugged in. I lost a $200 stereo system this way.
College Freshman,2,"Only certain people are allowed into parties and most are invite only. If you get into parties they're typically not fun, just people standing around awkwardly and talking."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Living on campus is the absolute pits. Like I said in previous posts, DePaul does a horrible job at integrating students of different backgrounds like out of staters or transfers and therefore all the commuters go home on the weekends and you are stuck trying to seek out something to do. Also, the demand for dorm space highly exceeds the supply so you will be stuck on a waiting list if you do not apply extremely early. More dorms+more marketing to out of state and international students=less commuters."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I guess you have to distinguish between the party scene on campus which there isn't one, and those off campus which are a plenty. If you are under 21 and without a fake I.D. you are pretty much screwed for social life. It wasn't quite the same when I first attended 2009 in the good ole' days of under-age drinking at Soirée and Goodbar...no one probably remembers that."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Recently, not while I've attended, but in the past few months there have been a couple cases of assault happening on or near campus to my knowledge. I can't speak to it personally, but I doubt that adequate campus resources are in place to deal with sexual harassment or assaults. If someone has more info on this issue please let me know."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics is not a part of the experience at DePaul. Most students are not involved in them.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Other than Starbucks...everything else is just as bad as on campus dining (I.e., McDonald's, burger places, subs, etc.)"
College Senior,2,"The one and only thing that keeps me on edge in a positive way with DePaul is the cost. It's an expensive school, I never thought to be in the much debt at such a young age. Finical aid is extremely helpful, but taking out loans is the biggest pain. I have applied to scholarships, but I have not gotten as lucky as others."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have no received any grants or scholarships. I feel there could be many more scholarship opportunities and I wish they would stress upon them more.
College Senior,2,Financial aid is somewhat helpful. Funds for a deanslist student is still extremely difficult for me.
College Senior,2,"Sports games, specifically basketball games, are difficult to attend due to location of home games and times of games. Not to mention that DePaul basketball usually ends in last place."
College Sophomore,2,"For a school that charges so much money to attend, the financial aid that could be provided is no where near the amount they are providing. When it comes to allowing time and help for those who cannot pay on-time, they aren't very lenient and stingy with the process."
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life at Depaul is fairly non-existent. There are Frats and Sororities, but they do not have their own housing in a traditional sense. Overall the Greek life itself is pretty disappointing."
College Junior,2,"If you're lucky you can find a spot. The garage on sheffield isn't bad, especially if you're going to be at school long enough to make it worth your while. Other than that it can be hard sometimes to find a spot, or you have to walk a ways."
College Sophomore,2,"If I ever drive at all, the parking especially in the Loop campus is awful. Sometimes you end up paying up to $40 for only two hours!"
College Sophomore,2,they are not the best
College Sophomore,2,DePaul is too strict and there is no fun on campus
College Student,2,There has been a new trend where students have started taking ADHD medication in order to boost their attention span. It is very scary to see my peers doing that because I was never so explicitly exposed to it.
College Junior,2,"Students do not pay attention to athletics as DePaul is a commuter school.  Students are dispersed all over the city, so it's hard for all of us to come together for large sporting events.  In addition, DePaul does not necessarily promote athletics as a big part of campus life; DePaul chooses to focus on the diversity of our students and academics."
College Freshman,2,it gets pretty cold and windy at time. but Depaul is not a very outdoorsy school so it doesn't really matter.
College Freshman,2,It is cold 75% of the year and it makes commuting a little hard if you live off campus.
College Sophomore,2,You do end up living in the murder capital of the world...so it's really kind of give and take.
College Student,2,Just don't major in communications. The courses are vague and the students in the college are aimless airheads.
College Student,2,"The dorms themselves are pretty average, and the atmosphere created among the residents is pretty bad."
Senior,1,When you've been on the deans list your whole time at the school but when its a pandemic during your senior year and you're $2000 short; this is not the school to come to. They (DePaul Central) would not make an exception for me to register for classes even though I held prestigious standings sat the university. #HereWeDoNot

Freshman,1,I am sure that anyone in college would say right now go and apply at your local community college. Don't go to college because of their name.
Sophomore,1,"This place is so unwelcoming it’s unbelievable. None of the classmates are socialable unless you’re a specific type of person, and even then good luck getting them to actually hangout with you. Also, the teachers are horrendous. My math teacher was only on time like 3 times all quarter"
Sophomore,1,"DePaul is not worth the money at all. The social life on campus is trash. You need to be very wealthy to have any social life there. The teachers are subpar for the most part. The discover classes have to be the biggest waste of time ever. My discover teacher told me there’s no criteria to how we are graded it’s just whether or not we “showed spirit”, but when I asked what that means they said “don’t worry you’re all in the same boat”. The campus is not visually appealing whatsoever. There are homeless people INSIDE the student center begging you for meal swipes. If you go on a tour, they show you the first floor of the student center and the welcome center and then that’s it. Finally, you are not allowed to have an opinion unless it’s to the most liberal of all extents. Our “discussions” are just an echo chamber of people agreeing with that their favorite celebrity’s tweets. Bottom line: 1) boring 2) not worth the money 4) straight up trash"
Freshman,1,"Going here has got to be the biggest mistake of my life. The academics are average (at best), the social life is basically non existent unless you have bags of money to spend every weekend. Most people are commuters so it is very hard to meet people. Which makes sense because, again, there’s nothing to do and the dorms are pretty bad, at least my building. They smell weird and the rooms are incredibly small compared to my friends at Big 10/SEC schools. There is pretty much zero school spirit whatsoever. If I could go back and do everything all over I would’ve chosen a different school. Also, if you want a traditional college experience, don’t go here it’s like being at a corporation not a college. In all, DePaul is: boring, lacking in school spirit, not worth the money, unhelpful, has bad to barely average academics, and just all around a pretty bad university."
Freshman,1,"The academics are good, but for 40,000 you should aim higher. The social life there leaves a bit to be desired as the amount of commuters and lack of houses means after first quarter you need to go to actual restaurants for activities. Which is cool but it is pretty expensive. Another thing is the level of care about college sports there seems to be very low. After about two weeks I realized everyone has a different favorite college team which is a bit odd considering it’s a D1 school. Overall, as I was looking for “the college experience” I was extremely disappointed with the lack of things to do in that realm. I think they rely heavily on their reputation from years passed. Overall, the school isn’t very good at all for someone looking to have a regular college experience, the academics and social life both leave a lot to be desired, and for the price it just isn’t worth it whatsoever. I am currently looking to transfer. Huge mistake attending this school."
Alum,1,"DePaul 101:
After being in college longer than most (due to a car accident I had to take time off), less than 1 semester away from graduating, they added additional course work for me to complete me degree. I had to pay EVEN MORE TUITION and stay even LONGER. BE AWARE: They state that they can change degree requirements at ANY time. So you might think you are almost done, but then they tack on 1 or 2 additional classes - then you're there for 1 or more semesters. I recently brought this up to admissions. Their reply? ""Well, it's ok because other colleges do it"". At the time, it completely crippled me.

Unhelpful staff for looking for a job post-undergrad. The counselor I was assigned to literally printed me jobs off of Monster. Pathetic - especially for their steep tuition.

Go if you want to be treated like you are in high-school! Super strict & You can only miss a few classes per semester."
Graduate Student,1,"I believe DePaul is (or was) a great university WITH the exception of the Department of Education. Warning! Beware! I have complete 2 degrees and DePaul University in non-Department of Education departments and always had a pleasant, insipiring and mutually respectful experience. Always. Until I came to the Department of Education. A true nightmare. Disrespectful towards students, demanding but giving very little, authoritative in an environment that one expects to promote authenticity and proactiveness. The couple of times I inquired about the expected and enforced status quo the vindictiveness and manipulation came out. I truly recommend that you look elsewhere if you are planning to go to DePaul University for Education. As a consumer, I can report the negligence on the part of DePaul Universities Department of Education."
Freshman,1,"I would not suggest you go here. This school requires a very specific type of person. Snobby, rich and rude. This was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life! I hate this school with a passion. The academics are okay I guess but the quarter system is not for me. Everything moves extremely quick, you basically have to study for midterms and finals at the same time if you want to do okay on the tests. The vibe is also weird and I knew at orientation that I wouldn’t like this school. The people are as weird as the vibe. Seems to me the students are more worried about cigarettes and AirPods than the work. There’s no time for fun it’s all work. Please do me a favor DON’T COME HERE there are so many schools in Chicago let along Illinois. If you want to be miserable and have a horrible first year come here. P.S there’s no diversity. I would say it’s majority white and you’ll often find yourself as the only person of color."
Freshman,1,"When I got to Depaul, they advertised it as an amazing school where you can follow your desires in life and achieve any goals. When I got there, my whole perspective was completely mixed around. Half of the student body are commuters, meaning that if you want to reach out to make new friends, it is very hard because they could be in your class but then they go home immediately after their class. The academics are horrible as well, teachers don't take their jobs seriously here. One of them went to go and see a Kanye concert and felt the need to cancel class on top of the three other classes he canceled for the QUARTER."
Senior,1,"I am on the a different side of the spectrum with my opinions about DePaul. Once I started commuting my perspective of the school diminished. My whole life actually changed once I saw the kinds of people that went to this school. Consumed by themselves and the competition to appear to have a better life than one another. In the end the school is about making money, so if financial troubles hit then the school won't help. Attending an expensive and snotty type school is a choice I will forever regret."
Freshman,1,"I quickly transferred during my first year (luckily) the others from my cohort wound up with worthless degrees (most due to DePaul, not their choice in majors) and no support in job placement/ career opportunities. Horrible professors and environment that follows through to administration. DePaul-- What a joke."
College Sophomore,1,DePaul is too accepting as bad as that sounds. The school's diversity program is run by a bunch of feminist tumblr's. They completely shut out the right wing and have no problems with denying free speech to create a safe space.
College Sophomore,1,DePaul doesn't care about its students. It's administration is absolutely terrible. The professors and education is good. The school experience is alright but I have trouble getting over just how bad the administration is. I've been screwed over by the Administration 3 times. DePaul puts up a fake Vincentian front but the administration absolutely doesn't care about it's students. They are just numbers and $$$ to them. They cut my financial aid after year one and I will have to drop out despite having a 3.7 GPA.
College Sophomore,1,I got caught with cannabis and was kicked out of housing permanently during the school year. Dorms are a good way to get friends at first. Once the second quarter comes around the dorms start to really suck. My roommate request was completely ignored and I was placed with a total weirdo.They started searching every room that had multiple people in it for drugs and alcohol. Literally 1/3 of the rooms in my hall were searched by campus security. 2 of my friends and I were arrested for cannabis in separate incidents in a city where it is decriminalized. The local cops hate DePaul because of the arrests that they force to make on the students for petty amounts of cannabis.
College Sophomore,1,DePaul Doesn't care about it's students.
College Freshman,1,"Some people may think this is a good thing, but partying is everywhere here and I hate it. My roommates are drunk every night of the week. They get into bars underage multiple times a week and are always at frat parties. I believe that all the partying has a negative impact on grades. I am in the second quarter of my freshman year, and most people that I know have failed at least one class already."
College Freshman,1,"I am not exaggerating when I say that almost everyone I know here is on drugs, is a borderline alcoholic, or both. I do not drink, and once people find out, they stop talking to me. I haven't met anyone here who even drinks casually. I have struggled making friends because I do not partake in these things, and that is the reason why I will most likely not be returning to DePaul."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a part of Greek Life; however, two of my three roommates are. Greek Life is a lot different at DePaul because we are located in the heart of a big city and we have limited space, so there are no frat/sorority houses. I absolutely despise partying, so I think that the fact that Greek Life members throw a lot of parties is super annoying. And like I said, there are no sorority/frat houses, so the parties are all in shady apartments in Wrigleyville. Sororities and frats don't really do anything here. My roommates are never out doing anything with their sororities. From what I understand, being in a sorority is simply just a title you pay thousands of dollars for to get you into parties. My roommates are fine with that, though. All they ever do is get drunk, and because we don't have classes on Fridays, it's not unusual for them to come back wasted 3-4 days a week. Their partying has had a negative affect on their grades; they are both on academic probation and risk getting kicked out of the university. Their sororities do not seem to be doing anything about that."
College Freshman,1,There are not athletic clubs
College Sophomore,1,"When I came to college I wanted to join Greek Life, but everyone hates the Greeks at my school, so I didn't."
College Senior,1,"It is a very expensive school. Do not try paying for this school if you don't have the money ready. It is very expensive and you will need to take out multiple loans, and many which you probably will not be approved for. You might be stuck in the middle of quarters without enough money, forcing you to take a long break."
College Sophomore,1,"No real party life here unless you're 21 or have a fake; also the parties are much more ""exclusive"" in terms of who hosts them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most professors seemed disinterested in getting to know any of the students outside of the classroom, and they were very ego-centric and hard to open up to about anything. Also, most were reluctant to teach material outside of the textbook, and lack both personal and professional experience in their fields. I felt like I wasn't receiving the return on investment for my tuition, and only had to put forth minimal effort to achieve good grades. After awhile, depaul seemed like one big overpriced diploma mill."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of my professors were arrogant, self-interested, had an inflated ego. They cared more about their own research papers and reputation than actually getting involved with the students."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Recruiting on campus is embarrassingly poor, with only one job fair occurring per quarter, and most companies will never follow up with you anyway. Alumni are extremely disconnected from each other and are unwillingly to reach out."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is nonexistent at DePaul. There are no chapter houses, no rush events, and the only visible signs are fundraisers or bake sales at the student center. If you want Greek life and want to be in Illinois, go to UIUC. Otherwise just go to any state school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The career center is a complete and absolute joke. It is constantly understaffed, the advisers are not helpful whatsoever, and their services are usually along the lines of making sure your Linkedin profile is up to date or resume critiquing. Really? Thirty plus thousand per year for that! Ridiculous and pathetic if you ask me. Career counselors are supposed to help you identify your skill sets, find your ideal job placements, align you with the right recruiters, and be an advocate for your success. 

After graduating DePaul June of 2012, I am currently unemployed, have not found meaningful and gainful employment since completing my degree, and the entire alumni network is so disconnected and unhelpful it is astonishingly sad."
Recent Alumnus,1,The school spirit at Depaul is almost next to none. There are hardly any big on campus social functions besides FEST which is pretty lame anyways. We have no noteworthy sports arenas or facilities besides the Ray Meyer Gym which really is state-of-the-art. I'll give DePaul that...it has a stellar gym. Not the best library but amazing gym...wow college priorities at it's best right!
College Sophomore,1,"Campus security sucks, they take so long to pick you up. You have to call them otherwise if they see you being attacked on the street, they would probably drive right past you"
College Senior,1,Greek life is pretty fake on campus. Frats are just big cliques and don't even party harder than the average student.
College Junior,1,"There are parking garages, but they cost $8.50 everyday, unless you pay for a permit.  Otherwise street parking is unbearable, because the free parking is always taken, so paying is a must."
College Freshman,1,"I hate any type of Greek Life. I personally think it is dumb and not needed, especially in a city like Chicago. This Review is obviously very biased."
College Freshman,1,"i've lived in chicago my whole life and the weather sucks here. it's been cold since november, and I suffered from the polar vortex this year (-50 degrees with windchill in january). classes were often cancelled because of weather conditions."
College Junior,1,"Weather in Chicago always affects my commute to school. When the weather is terrible, it takes me about 2 hours to get to school."
College Sophomore,1,Winter makes commuting back and forth and walking around campus horrible; it delays the CTA a lot too
College Student,1,"I moved to Chicago from Dallas, Texas. If you're used to the subzero temperatures then congratulations, but for us out of staters: buy a down coat."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, there is barely ANY strictness enforced. There's always alcohol or the smell of drugs in the dorm. It's sad how easily it goes on in the rooms and on the floors. I don't think they really care."
College Senior,1,Pretty shit. People still join Greek life but its not big on campus at all. Without special housing its hard for them to get noticed.
College Senior,1,Lincoln park is really expensive to live. Also it's old. But there are a lot of options in terms of choosing the right apartment.
College Junior,1,the Greek life is very limited the fraternities don't have very much diversity but i expected it to be that way.
College Sophomore,1,"Sororities are not allowed to have houses in the city of Chicago because of an old law that says more than 8 single women living in one house together is considered a brothel. Because of that, not a lot of parties happen, and when they do, they're in the small, cramped off-campus apartments that a few frat bros live at. People who aren't involved in greek life kind of groan when they see frats or sororities gathered to do their thing, but they seem pretty involved in events such as Relay for Life and DemonThon."
College Sophomore,1,"The college ""parties"" I've attended at DePaul pail in comparison to my high school parties. The greek system is a complete joke. 

It's possible that I simply have high standards, but I have yet to find a single attractive guy in any of my classes. 

People don't really know how to dress themselves, aside from the kids who grew up in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York City. If I were the fashion police, I would be issuing hundreds of citations each day of class."
College Sophomore,1,You are dealing with the Chicago Police who are very strict. If you come back to your dorm drunk the front desk people will call an ambulance to take you to the hospital. Parties rarely get busted and the most action happens at bars anyways. No one drinks on campus except at the 1237 apartments.
College Sophomore,1,The food on campus is below average. They don't offer too many healthy options and for the most part everything is processed. The best food options are located at the Ray Meyer Fitness Center! I recommend getting a cheap meal plan option because chances are you will be eating elsewhere.
College Senior,1,"The parking at DePaul is nearly impossible especially if you are attending their loop campus. Yes there are spot where you can pay to park which fill up before 7:00am. The other spots you can park in are the garages that surrounds the school. Per day the garage is near 20.00. Well parking in these garages daily adds up quite a bit. The worst part about it is that in the loop DePaul does not offer any parking discounts, garages, spots, passes, or anything to make driving easier on the students. Parking is terrible!"
College Freshman,1,"It's Chicago! Very hard to find a place, and real estate is super expensive. Be prepared to be scrambling to find a place a month before you move in, and to be living somewhere pretty far off-campus since DePaul is in a VERY expensive neighborhood."
College Junior,1,"Chicago weather is unpredictable. If you are not native to Chicago, you will have a hard time getting used to the the erratic weather. Blizzards are a common occurrence. Remember to dress warm during Winter."
College Senior,1,"If you're talking about the downtown campus, forget it. You won't find parking, and if you do, it'll cost you big bucks. The other campus also has hard to find parking, or if you choose to park in the school garage it is also costly."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on the street is horrible. Most of the residential streets are permit parking so you cant park there during certain times. I have gotten multiple tickets because of this. The police are very strict with these signs. You also have to make sure you arrive to campus a good 30-40min before your class starts to find parking because you have to drive around for a while looking for a spot. I would definitely recommend buying a parking permit. Spending the money is worth it rather than pay hundreds of dollars in parking tickets.
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life doesn't have any affect on the school
College Sophomore,1,"God, this was the worst part about being a freshman. Now that I live off-campus, I quite enjoy attending DePaul. But the dorms were a terrible experience. I lived in Corcoran, yes this is the cheapest and most run down dorm. Aside from the stench that constantly permeated every corner of the building, the policy on drugs is draconian. It's quite an obvious fact that a ton of college kids smoke pot. This really does not harm anyone, however, DePaul chooses to strictly enforce its policy of calling the police as soon as any marijuana is smelled. Yes, that's right, an RA will and is bounded by policy to call the police as soon as any drugs are suspected. I had several friends spend the night in jail for a small amount of marijuana. DePaul does NOT keep it's housing occupants safe with this senseless and harsh policy; it does the opposite, sends them to jail! Does this do anybody any good whatsoever? NO! I have never heard of another school with such a harsh and frankly ridiculous policy. Yet for something like drinking, you can get caught up to about 3 times before you are even really punished; something that's proven to be much more harmful than marijuana, despite the laws. Chicago is not even a city with strict marijuana laws, it has been decriminalized in the city already! Other than this, I met great people at Corcoran, everyone seems to get along more when they can complain about their living conditions together."

College Freshman,1,"I am absolutely miserable here. If you're not from the midwest, don't go here. I'm from the east coast and I'm having an awful time. The community at DePaul sucks, even if you do live in the dorm. I live in uhall and I hate it. No one leaves their doors open and or talks to each other. I don't even know who lives on the otherside of my floor! I am transferring after this year."
College Sophomore,1,There is not a lot of diversity at DePaul and I would like to see it change. The only way I see diversity is if I go looking for clubs or classes.
College Sophomore,1,"DePaul has no on-site medical facility; it is rated among the worst in the country. As for safety, it is adequate."
College Junior,1,"DePaul does not play when it comes to drug usage on the campus. You must take that else where. Cheating is not allowed, they take that very seriously."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Attention prospective students...we 

do not require you to submit any standardized testing materials to us because guess what we are Vincentian and we let in everyone! As long as you can write a detailed essay about how you are socially responsible or environmentally conscious we can guarantee you admission to our institution. However, we have a lot of debts and repayments to cover so about your financial aid well we'll do the best we can."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Say you are expecting or about to 

have an intimate encounter with someone and don't want to spend money on condoms at the nearby CVS when you could use that money for a handle of Jack. What do you do? Go to the Campus Health Center right? But wait...DePaul doesn't have a campus health center...it has to contract out with Sage Medical Group. Yes you heard me correctly...DePaul does not have it's own clinic! That means if you sprain your ankle, have a panic attack, get an infection, etc. you have to use them. Oh yeah and going back to condoms they are not allowed to be distributed on campus because that wouldn't be catholic now would it. It isn't a surprise then that DePaul is notorious for having high rates of STD's and unsafe sex. The priests must be so proud."

Senior,5,"The diversity, professors, and student life made me fall in love with UIC. Maybe because I was a transfer coming from a community college, but I really loved my first year at UIC. I think the campus provides amazing study spots, and perfect hang out locations to meet up with friends. Amidst the pandemic, I am really missing being at UIC and learning in the classroom with my peers."
Sophomore,5,"The library has been my favorite thing about University of Illinois at Chicago by far, the lay out and the fact that they have multiple seating for students to get their work done in a quiet environment. The resources as well has been a favorite and the unlimited access to the computers and computer labs have been a great help as well."
Senior,5,"University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has taught me valuable skills between the multiple opportunities it has to offer. I have experience performing research for three years as an undergrad and was able to present my foundlings at multiple conference where I was able to meet a vast amount of people in my attend field of study. There's a wide amount of clubs, some that focus on your major and professional life and a lot more for making new friends and forming new hobbies. Professors here want you to perform at your best while you study here and will make multiple efforts to help you learn and succeed."
Senior,5,"Online learning at the University of Illinois at Chicago is set up to help category to your form of learning. They can present all the course work for the semester at once, so more independent students can work at their own pace. At the same time their are courses that need more attention so live lectures, discussions and time to meet with your professor are provided to help students learn better."
Freshman,5,"I had taken an online prep class before officially starting class, and it was a very enjoyable experience with very few technical difficulties. The professors and students were a pleasure to work with after getting over the awkward zoom silence during the class!"
Freshman,5,"Nice student life, great student support. Advisors are helpful with any questions, and UIC students help each other with any questions or class tips."
Freshman,5,"School is good, nice student life. Students are able to contact each other and are willing to help each other out."
Sophomore,5,I love my experience at UIC. I made so many friends and I feel at home when I'm on campus. Seeing the skyline and seeing the diversity makes me really happy.
Sophomore,5,"Online classes was a hard transition for everyone, but UIC definitely handled it well. I think online classes made me respect in person classes a bit more though."
Junior,5,"Besides that, it a commuter school, UIC has the best resources to help students to be on track to pursue their major degree."
Junior,5,"I initially did not sign up for online classes, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the University transitioned to online learning. The transition was smooth as professors of the University already use a few online communication platforms (zoom and collaborate), which helped tremendously. Communication with staff is always there, and the user-friendly platform makes it easy to communicate with classmates. Though I always feared taking online courses because I thought it wasn’t my mode of learning. I will say that my overall experience has been great, and this is due to the resources the University offers."
Junior,5,A great diverse campus with excellent professors and student body. The admission process is simple and the staff is very resourceful.
Senior,5,"Very understanding to each individual needs, always there to provide help to those in need. Friendly people, and great learning environment."
Senior,5,Took classes online during this pandemic and professor were very kind and understood the changes around us can be difficult in our life.
Graduate Student,5,All my classes were switched to online during COVID-19. My professors were accommodating and well equipped making the switch despite the little time they had to do so.
Graduate Student,5,"I love how extremely passionate some of the departments are at UIC. Not all, but if you're lucky, some departments and professors are so caring and helpful and truly want to see you succeed."
Junior,5,"Towards the end of my sophomore year, the COVID-19 pandemic started so I had to finish my classes online. The professors were very helpful, resourceful, and understanding to help by any means necessary."
Junior,5,I have been at UIC for three years now and it has been a very eventful experience. If I had to do it over again I would.
Senior,5,"Blackboard certainly makes online learning very easy, I honestly like it way better than zoom as there are more options to it to interact. Professors have been lenient in certain aspects of their syllabus and have empathy towards those who feel much more eager and engaged in learning while in person other than online.  I guess this is why I've been able to tolerate and not hate online learning."
Freshman,5,"I’ve felt the best , and easiest way to take classes during this pandemic at home . They made me feel comfortable taking these classes especially in hard times like these ."
Freshman,5,"They have the most welcoming environment , out of all the professors I’ve met , they’ve all welcomed me as one of theirs . Especially as an incoming freshman , they’ve made me feel welcome at home. The surroundings made me feel comfortable , and made me feel the best at home ."
Junior,5,I like how UIC is very diverse and accepting to every student regardless of their background. Something beneficial was the large number of clubs that UIC offers for every interest and major. A thing that I would like to see change at UIC is the number decrease in unhealthy restaurants in the food court.
Freshman,5,UIC is great at helping students when they need. They have right resources and is always there for you when you need it. They also don’t put any pressure on you. Giving you the space you need to make decisions.
Freshman,5,"I am taking online writing workshop and so far I have no complaints. Assignment are assigned as usual and I turned them in before the deadline. Also the teacher does a good job staying in touch with students to see how they are doing, or if we need any  help with the assignment."
Sophomore,5,"I transitioned to online at end of the spring semester. I have loved the organization of my professors for math especially, but overall I would say it's been positive and supportive. Professors kept communication open and also tried their best to lenient and fair."
Freshman,5,"Because of COVID-19, we had to use Blackboard and Zoom to do learning. It took a while for us to actually adjust and there were moments of awkward pauses but it was overall still just as effective as in class. I learned things that I needed to learn to pass and often asked the professors for more information after class."
Senior,5,"This summer I am currently taking a class online as a result of COVID-19. The professors and teaching assistants leveraged the online platforms to enhance learning and communicating for our class by pre-recording lecture videos and giving us access to  the videos each week. For this class all of our assignments such as quizzes, exams and homework assignments are due at the end of the week. Particularly our assignments are due on Fridays and Sundays. The professor and teaching assistants are also reachable by email and they offer office hours for students who would like extra help. The office hours are flexible and last for thirty minutes. Since it is summer, the professor did not assign a set time for attending lectures,  the hours are very flexible and students can work at their own pace to complete the assignments due on the weekend. In order to take a quiz, on blackboard you go to your class section and click on the quiz tab and the quiz is timed for twenty to thirty minutes."
Alum,5,I did not complete any online learning while attending the University of Illinois. All my classes were in-person. I have heard that the school has a good online program
Sophomore,5,Very understanding the professors in general. My espero en e was very pleasant and my professors tried their best to give me the same level of education as if it was in person session.
Sophomore,5,UIC from my experience is very friendly thus far. Most of my professors are lenient yet assertive with education which I believe is very important in a university especially when it’s most famous major are STEM majors.
Graduate Student,5,"The professors have made the switch to remote learning as soon as possible. With flexible office hours and an open door policy, you can get all the help you need anytime!"
Graduate Student,5,The faculty and staff are amazing! So caring and knowledgeable. The location is also second to none. Views of the Chicago skyline never get old!
Senior,5,I loved how UIC made me feel so welcomed from day one. The professors are absolutely amazing. They care & put so much effort into making sure we succeed. UIC has allowed me to fall in love with my major even more.
Senior,5,"During this pandemic, we were all forced to study online. Every professor that I had adjusted GREAT! It was hard for me, but they made the transition that much more efficient. Exam, quiz and lecture logistics were thought through. I felt as if I was in rap lecture."
Senior,5,"I think UIC handled the pandemic as gracefully as possible and the transition to online classes was understandably bumpy, but teachers were overall sympathetic to any struggles due to covid. It was difficult at first to find my stride in online learning, but the classes that were most successful in my opinion spent at least some time in Zoom sessions. These classes facilitated student participation which was more motivational than a pre-recorded lecture. If in the fall, classes are still online, having at least a weekly video check-in session could be really beneficial to student learning."
Junior,5,"UIC is a great college university. UIC is a great university for anyone for any major that they decide on. UIC does a great job on preparing their undergrads and graduate students for their future job in the area of work that they decide to work in. In my three years in UIC, I haven't had anything negative happen to me. The professors that I met at UIC have been some of my favorite teachers of all time during my education. The school is very diverse and has clubs or sports, and many other activities for everyone at the school. The campus is easy to navigate, I learned the campus in and out on my first day of freshman year. The school has many areas where students could go to eat, study, do homework, workout, or just hang out with friends. The campus has a student rec, bowling alley, and many restaurants in walking distance of the school. All in all, UIC is a great school to go to for any type of major, the school will do a fantastic job to prepare you for your job."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about this University! The diversity, the support, the campus, the courses offered, and I feel like I belong. I'm definitely looking forward to going here in the fall!"
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity and the high-quality education given at a great price. Because of that, it gives you great opportunities in your field after graduation."
Freshman,5,"UIC is the best. I was scared to transition from a small high school to a very large University within a matter of three months. I felt like I was not going to be able to make friends and get good grades. But the best part, I had nothing to be scared of. When I went to my first day of class I did not realize how easy it was to make friends and surprisingly there were some older friends I went to school with or seen them around a couple of times that also were attending UIC and we were taking the same classes. The number of resources available by UIC can not be counted. There are many people at UIC who work as a student to student instructor and there are groups of people who work together. There are resources like the MSLC(Math and Science Learning Center), The Writing Center, and the REC where people can go and get things off their minds by playing a sport or doing exercises. I am very happy to have chosen UIC."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled here and I enjoy it, there are many things you can get involved in and make you feel like you belong. The chemistry department is tough but you can get through it!!"
Senior,4,"Currently, I am taking all my class online and it is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I truly never liked the idea of online classes, but due to zoom calls and group meetings I still feel that connection with some classmates. Of course, the connection is not as strong, I think amidst the pandemic my professors are really trying their best to accommodate for on-line learning. The professors at UIC are also very understanding when it comes to personal matters, especially during this global pandemic."
Senior,4,"Due to the recent pandemic, online classes have been very heavy. My teachers have been amazing with giving extensions and being giving lax deadlines and I appreciate their care and understanding. I do feel I am learning more at my pace, compared to in-person classes. Being able to meet through online meetings has helped in my group projects because, even with very busy schedules, we have time to check-in at times that work for all of us. It is a new way of learning, but I am happy with the way my school and professors have handled our studies and our health."
Senior,4,"I have had a great experience at UIC. I truly feel it is my alma mater. My college experience did not start on a good foot. I started my freshmen year at UIUC, which is UIC's sister school is Urbana, Illinois. After my first semester, I was very home sick and did not settle well while living in the dorms. After I left Urbana, I transferred to Morton College, which was my hometown's community college. I completed my gen-eds there and then transfered to UIC. UIC understood my journey and they welcomed me and helped my transition to a great college experience. I have joined some intramural soccer teams and I am grateful for the friends I have made and my involvement with the UIC community."
Junior,4,"I moved to Chicago for school and to be closer to campus and so far it has been a great decision. Although the pandemic has affected my experience, I am happy to be at UIC."
Junior,4,"So far, as a transfer student all of my classes taken at UIC have been online. I feel like our university is handling it very well however I just feel like as a new student the transition has been slightly harder than normal."
Junior,4,The school is located right next to downtown Chicago which is really good as it really helps to get out of campus when your free and just have a great time with family and friends. Transportation is also very convenient as the metra is right next to the University and we get a CTA pass that is available throughout the semester.
Freshman,4,"So far, through the enrollment process during the pandemic, all staff, professors, and deans have been very patient and helpful!"
Sophomore,4,"The TAs were very helpful and thoughtful when it comes to assignments. Lectures could be boring sometimes as it’s hard to concentrate at home. However, course materials are very accessible and helpful!"
Sophomore,4,"I adore almost every professor that I studied with. They were all very kind, supportive and professional. The Math & Science Learning Center and the Writing Center are great sources of help in studying. I also like that there are buses everywhere around the campus so it’s really easy to move around. The only two things I don’t like is the tuition fee and school safety."
Junior,4,"Yes, I took all my classes online. Some of them were a lot easier than being there in class. I didn't have too much trouble with the collaborative software we were using. The quality, teaching, and interactions went very well. We did have minor issues here and there with some of the collaborate software but other than that we always found decent alternatives"
Junior,4,"Overall, UIC is very welcoming and interactive. I love this college because you make friends easily, the professors are very instructive, and the campus is filled with a lot of resources needed for student life."
Sophomore,4,University of Illinois at Chicago as a commuter school it often times lack in school spirit especially in athletics.
Sophomore,4,"Professors responded very quickly in case of questions or technical difficulties. However, asynchronous classes may vary depending on the professor."
Alum,4,"As with everything, you pretty much get out what you put in. In a big school like this, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and ignored, but the resources are there if you look for them."
Junior,4,"My online learning isn't as bad as I thought it should. I had more time to work on projects, and even my professor was more open to helping online, and it was more time manageable."
Junior,4,I have not taken any classes but look forward to the Fall 2020 semester. According to my friends online classes are very organized and easy to follow. Nearly all classes have an online option due to COVID-19 and I look forward to experiencing it.
Junior,4,The university is very diverse and has a great campus. We also have a great medical and engineering department.
Senior,4,"The University of Illinois at Chicago is a commuter school, so it's hard to make friends. However, they offer many organization and clubs. Not to mention, that the financial costs of going to this school is beneficial in the long run. However, as the years go on, the financial support also decreases. Overall, the courses and classes at UIC are fantastic if you know how to choose the right classes and professors."
Senior,4,The professors are extremely understanding when it comes to the pandemic situation and the transition to online courses. Classes are through Zoom and work well enough.
Senior,4,"I love how diverse the campus is and how affordable tuition is. I would like to see more spaces for commuters, considering the fact that it’s mainly a commuter school."
Senior,4,"It's initially difficult to set up a personal schedule in order to keep up with all of the coursework without the regular classes, but at least for me it was manageable to continue with online classes as most of my work is done on/using a computer anyways."
Senior,4,"It's an alright school. I've personally been pretty satisfied with how my classes have been and the work that I've done, especially the classes that help me figure out specifically which career I really want to pursue. Most of the people you meet are pretty friendly, and I've learned a lot that I can use in my future career(s)."
Senior,4,"I hear most people complain about UIC, but I seriously do not see a problem with coming here besides the fact that there is some crime here and there... Typically near the evening when most students are off campus though. Besides that, the University truly feels like a second home to me where I can just hang out and spend some time in, whether or not I have classes. All the teachers I have had were wonderful and understanding, most of them truly made the experience even more satisfying since the teachers actually seemed to have a true interest in what they were teaching. I'm not much of a party animal, so I can't say much about the wild side of UIC but academic-wise it's great lol"
Junior,4,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning was forced on all students. The format of online education was significant for lecture-based classes, but for lab classes, it took a meaningful experience away from students. Lab classes are a chance for students to understand the course material in a more hands-on way fully. There should be an improvement in online learning for Fall 2020."
Sophomore,4,Professors adapted to online classes using Blackboard Ultra which was very successful. Some professors could have improved their communication during this time.
Sophomore,4,Courses are challenging and professors have high expectations. Really great school for the money. Would love to see students more involved and active on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity at this university. I have met people that have legitimately changed my life for the better. Unfortunately, the school's food has caused a lot of digestive issues. I also wish the science department was more supportive/developed."
Freshman,4,Some of the teachers are super nice and they genuinely want to help you reach your career goals. Feel free to ask them for any questions or arrange a meeting.  I generally just had issues with the financial aid department because they would never reach back to me.
Senior,4,"Attending UIC has been a pleasant experience for me!  My favorite building is Student Center East not to far from the ""Inner Circle"".  SCE has many popular food chains such as Chic fil a, Panda Express, Dunkin Donuts and more. Upstairs is another food court that includes restaurants  such as Sub Way, Sbarro's and more. There is a bowling alley located in SCE and upstairs is a commuters lounge. Academically the classes are very intuitive and challenging in a positive way, the professors are very nice and memorable and they care about helping their students understand the material and also provide great availability with office hours. Using ""Rate My Professor"" will be a huge help when a student is trying to register for classes. Student life is very nice! UIC has an invent each year when all different clubs advertise their club in the inner circle and they have a sign up sheet where you put your school email. It is always a great social event for students to meet and see their options."
Junior,4,"It was difficult at first, since I learn better when I am in the class room and able to ask the professor questions, but towards the end of the semester, I was able get the hang out online learning."
Sophomore,4,UIC is a diverse campus that creates welcoming environment. There are many resources to help students academically. The social feel of UIC isn't the college life the media tends to portray. The school has D1 teams.
Sophomore,4,"In the midst of a pandemic, I give UIC props for their efforts in shifting to an online environment."
Alum,4,"I initially was a student at U of I in Champaign Urbana. Because I needed to transfer into the nursing program I had to transfer to UIC. I only had to be go to class on the healthcare campus which was fine. I had a better experience at U of I Champaign. Attending school in the city I did not feel like I was on a ""real"" college campus"
Junior,4,The professors have been mostly enjoyable. There are a lot of campus resources and support for students. The atmosphere of the campus and the buildings can be off putting however.
Niche User,4,"It is a pretty big university when I first came to visit. They offer a lot of help, but sometimes can be overwhelming, and sometimes student don't know how to get help, which is another problem. I know they have their student services building, but its financial aid is not the best. I see many of my friends dropping out because they can't balance work and their education. It is heartbreaking to see, but it seems like a common problem I see in almost all public universities. I know we don't have the best final system, but we are wasting a lot of money and time when good students decide to leave school."
Senior,4,"I believe that UIC is a very nice campus but one thing I do recommend is to keep the bathrooms safe and clean. There are times when the doors in bathroom stalls open on their own and that's not good. I also feel that there should be multiple professors teaching a course. For example, there is only one microbiology professor and 1 course. It would be better if there was at least 2 courses because professors don't always match everyone's learning needs."
Freshman,4,My only complaint is the incompetent guidance counselors. I got better advice and more resources from student lounge attendees.
Junior,4,"There are many courses, activities, and opportunities available at UIC. However, I would like to have a wider range of options for electives."
Sophomore,4,"Their location is really good, and easy to go to the downtown. I really liked their location. Also, their transportation is really good, too."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are good. I really enjoyed them. You will learn a lot of things in this university. Online programs, not all of them, but most of them are clear and interesting."
Sophomore,4,"It was a learning experience for both the professors and the students but they all seemed to get the hang of it pretty quickly. They were very flexible and understanding with students who had jobs that interfered with meeting times. Most of the lessons would be posted ahead of time, allowing the student to work at their own pace without feeling rushed."
Sophomore,4,"So far everything about UIC has been great! My experience is only beginning but I can already tell that this school is a great fit. It allows for a student like me, to navigate their new responsibilities along with offering enough help if you ever need it."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy walking/running from class to class on campus.  I like going to the Student Recreation Facility to workout and release some stress. Also, safety is a priority at the university and it shows with the different school methods for safe transportation and protecting its students. With the university being in Chicago, there are a lot of activities/opportunities to take part in."
Sophomore,4,"It was a new experience for instructors to teach online. The instructors would usually use zoom or blackboard collaborate to teach classes. Overall, the instructors got the hand of teaching online and using the online tools that zoom or blackboard offered. I personally enjoyed online classes."
Senior,4,"It was horrible! At least it was when I was majoring in Engineering Physics. Engineering Orientation taught me many things, but didn’t teach me any tips or tricks for EP. For our one advisor, they couldn’t help guide us by explaining the Technical Electives we could take. Most courses I took were uninteresting and difficult. After a year, I took a semester off. I transferred to Computer Science. This became substantially better for me and my experience at UIC. Though, for some reason, advisors are still an issue. The courses are great; the professors are fun/strict/and at times flexible; the atmosphere of CS is refreshing and gives a type of welcoming energy. The TAs and Grad TAs I’ve met are experienced and know what they’re talking about! 

I rate my experience at the University of Illinois at Chicago 4 stars for giving me life lessons, Engineering Physics and Computer Science knowledge, and exposing me to numerous connections via student or company."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with UIC is great. UIC is growing especially in the engineering field where they have built new buildings. There is a lot of diversity here, with many backgrounds. You may find people from many different  places around the world. UIC provides great resources for students, they provide seminars, career fairs, internships for first year students in engineering, summer programs, etc. The University also has many student organizations and extra curricular activities, so take advantage. The professors I had at the school are helpful and are available to assist you. I got to meet some outstanding and kind people. UIC is not so expensive  compared to other schools if you're in-state and commute, you get a good bang for your buck. I would like to see a change in the school spirit because not many people attend the athletes games. Yes it is a commuter school but there are almost 30,000 students. I would also like to see more security on campus for the safeness of the school."
Senior,4,"Professors quickly adapted to the new online classes, for some classes it was harder than others but overall the transition was made very well for such changing times."
Sophomore,4,"I would prefer more updated buildings and conditions; however, there are many useful resources. I also believe that the chemistry department and physics department can be improved; however, in regard to social sciences, the professors are great. There are also many research opportunities."
Junior,4,"UIC is a great and diverse institution. I enjoy the diversity, the huge campus, the resources that are available for students."
Junior,4,The online learning was personally hard for me. I learn best with in person classes and the interaction with my peer. Even though there were very good materials provided for online learning it just did not work well for me.
Senior,4,"I'm going into my fourth year as design student at UIC. Overall, my experience at school has been very good. The design school in particular really shines because the faculty are trained in Swiss design so the techniques we are taught is fairly cohesive across the board. The teachers have a sense of job prospects in the real world and have always been responsive to helping students transition from academia to the professional world. As for the rest of campus, my experience has been good. When not in lockdown, the campus offers many places to plug in and study, I would only wish for one more decent building for studying/eating. Student Center East and Richard Daley Library often get too crowded. Overall have loved my time at UIC."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the staff for my particular major’s department, the staff are friendly, and usually everything is clean and comfortable."
Sophomore,4,"Most professors adapted well to e-learning, but it is ultimately up to the student to stay accountable and actually watch the online lectures. All the resources are there, and professors tend to be flexible and understanding. Most UIC professors use BlackBoard as their online lecture platform, which I don't love but don't hate either."
Alum,4,"I didn't take any online classes but a lot of classes had online portions, I always thought these were well operated and there was a lot of communication from professors."
Alum,4,"I loved attending UIC. I lived on campus my freshman and sophomore year then I moved to an apartment in the neighborhood. I studied education and really loved the focus on urban education. I had incredible professors and really was guided right into my career. The support is there if you seek it, I found some things that you need aren't always just open and easy to get, you have to dig a little to find the right advisor, mentor, etc. The campus is old but they've worked to build new, modern buildings and update some of the old spaces. I'd love for the majority of the campus to be this way, some of the old buildings are just blah and dark. Overall I had a great experience here and loved going to undergrad in a city."
Senior,4,"I have strongly appreciated almost every professor I have taken while at UIC. They are all brilliant and have given clear objectives for the courses as well as an understanding grading scale and course expectation.  Some of the larger courses may make you feel a little anonymous, but that is normally fixed with a smaller discussion/lab section that helps you get to understand the material and those grading your work."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy coming to UIC every day, the on-campus organizations have really made everyone feel welcome. Of course, there are difficult classes and difficult professors, but the overall feeling at UIC is that we want to see each other succeed. There are so many tutoring and help centers, and even the Teaching Assistants are on your side!"
Sophomore,4,I like the academic environment as well as the on campus events for students. I think there are many opportunities for students to get involved with different clubs and organizations that are available on and off campus. I like that the campus is not far from downtown and places are easily accessible. The professors that I have had have helpful and accommodating to their students.
Junior,4,Experiences vary tremendously when it comes to which professors you have for the semester. There were moments where it felt rather unsafe to be at school due to security.
Freshman,4,"I really like the University I am attending. There is so much student life and there is always something going on at every moment. with a school that has over 30,000 students, there is so much love and diversity, it is like we all protect each other even if we do not know each other. One thing I like as well is the academics. in comparison to the community college near me, the University of Illinois at Chicago definitely has stronger curriculum and you can definitely learn way more while attending this school. Overall, I really love my school and the friends I have made There and the clubs I have joined as well."
Senior,2,"My experience has been marred by implicit and systematic racism and inadequate instruction. They expect you to do everything on your own and proper instruction isn't given. If i wanted this i would have taking classes online or youtube (they always refer you there). My experience has been less than stellar. This is a shame because this is a beautiful campus! The students rarely get to enjoy the campus, space to lounge is limited. On the bright side, tenured professors have great attitudes that are contagious! They keep the students motivated and learning. Unfortunately, You don't  see them that often. These professors are awesome, committed to the students and welcome you to ask questions and be curious. This is what keeps students there. Student involvement would improve if they encourage the studets to get involve, stop talking down to the students and respect everyone's perspective and  encourage others to do so as well! Kids come to college to learn, meet new people and have fun!"
Alum,2,I took a few summer classes online to fulfill gen ed requirements. I give it 2 stars because I at least didn't have to physically be at UIC.
Senior,2,"Overall, the entire school system needs major improvement. Particularly, the staff and department structures need proper training on thorough communication and efficient responses to students who are utilizing services, relevant curriculum changes, and hiring better passionate professors. The funds do not reflect the quality of all the professors and registering for courses always restricts students and limits professor options."
Junior,2,My time taking classes online was a worse experience then being on campus. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic classes were switched to online mid-semester and it was a rough transition. The learning experience is severely limited and i feel less is gained and achieved in the online learning environment they provide.
Niche User,2,"I don't like it at all because I learn better with human interaction. I know some people like it, but online classes are not for me. Plus, I got no choice due to the virus, and I find it difficult to stay motivated, due to the many distractions I have in my home. The reason I like going to campus is that I want to escape from my home."
Freshman,2,Nobody was ready for quarantine and I don't blame faculty for that. That is my only complaint.         b
Freshman,2,It was super hard. A lot of Professor were extremely laid back and did not do much to help. It was an emergency situation but to be honest they could have done better.
Alum,2,The classes are too large and impersonal. Making friends is very hard. Getting letters of recommendation is hard. The campus is poorly designed and dirty.
Freshman,2,"UIC is mostly a commuter school, around 90% of the students are commuters. This means there’s basically no sense of campus community. All dorms other than ARC or JST are absolutely disgusting. Campus looks like a prison other than one or two buildings. Nobody wants to help, you’re completely on your own from setting up classes to anything else. I still don’t even know who my advisor is after asking multiple times. My overall experience at UIC has been pretty awful, which is why I’m leaving after my very first semester. Really think before you decide to choose UIC. One of the only positive things I’ve found about UIC is the convenience of being in the middle of the city, oh and the diversity of the students."
Niche User,2,"I graduated from UIC. The education was decent. Also, most professors were helpful. The campus isn't pleasing to look at and the neighborhood isn't the safest."
Alum,2,Education is good. Not much community to help form you into a badass individual outside of school. Alumni are not helpful.
Freshman,2,"If you're looking to become involved and create friends, this isn't the school for you. It's strictly to go to classes. It's a commuter school so not much can be expected."
Senior,2,"There are some undergrads here who, cannot even spell ""Chicago"" correctly, and yet they somehow got into this school. The undergrad academic theme is pure memorization, so graduates enter the field not having a clue as to how to apply this knowledge to their careers (if any of it actually applies). Everyone is a ""pre-graduate student"" here; that's because a bachelor's degree from UIC will be laughed at by most employers. - That's the stigma a UIC degree will taint on your academic career, no matter how high your GPA is. Students bring their baggage/drama/social lives from high school, so ""sensitivity, and safe space"" are the prevalent terms used on campus to describe various organizations. One club in particular, Vietnamese club, prides itself on being open minded, yet, as soon as an individual with a different life philosophy comes along, he/she is shunned and scolded based on his/her beliefs."
Niche User,2,"The academics at this school are very poor as they steer you into a direction you may not want to go. During my time, my general education credits were emphasized without regard to my major. They refused to take my AP scores even though they were legitimate, and didn't allow me to take placement exams to avoid taking redundant classes. The campus itself is nice as it is in the city, but some of the dorms are abysmal."
Alum,2,"College of Urban Planning promises jobs and career paths, I would say out of a group of 30+ students, one found a job in the field, two in a somewhat related occupation, and the rest went on to become hair stylists and sales workers. I am still slogging through, 5 years later trying to play myself off as a marketer instead. Don't listen to the adults and don't waste your time, their job is to get your money! The campus is dismal, a hodge-podge of some antiquated soviet-looking architecture and bum urine. Social life and parties were nill, as most students commuted and at the end of the day just wanted to go home. The gym was nice."
College Junior,2,"Small room, dirty floors sometimes walls thin walls sharing a bathroom loud people living near strangers lengthy check in for guests rude people"
College Freshman,2,"The school's non-academic attributes are extremely better than its academics. Most of the teachers are bad because they don't really care about their student's individual success in their field. With that being said, if you get into a class that is not filled, were a good teacher is, your academic experience will be much better. Most of the class sizes are small, but there are exceptions were you have to have lectures with 300 other students."
College Junior,2,Awful dorms which are not worth their price.
College Senior,2,"I think we only have academic fraternities and sororities, not traditional Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,Showers are absolutely awful. I would definitely not dorm here.
College Junior,2,There is security all over campus but safety is a huge problem.  The main reason is that the campus is very big and is located in downtown. That makes it very hard for the security to keep everything under control at all times.
College Junior,2,I don't do housing like most people and i can't tell how the dorms look like but I've heard that it is overpriced and not very worth it.  Most people just rent an apartment with other roommates close to school.  The benefit of the school's location is that it is practically in the city which gives you many options about finding apartments.
College Junior,2,Greek life is not very popular here and i don't know many people who are involved.  It really makes no difference if you are Greek or non-Greek and Greek housing is hard to find.
College Junior,2,Most student commute and that makes it hard for them to attend athletic events.  You can feel the school spirit but it is not overwhelming.  The athletic facilities are relatively new and many people use them frequently.
College Sophomore,2,UIC greek life cannot have houses so it is not a big deal here
College Sophomore,2,"It happens a lot as we are a campus located directly in the city and right off the train stations. Overall, I would say so long you know where you are and what time you are going out and are aware, you will be okay. However, that is not to say that things do not happen to students."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life on campus is a joke and is very race specific.
College Sophomore,2,The athletics is non-exsistent at UIC. So don't attend the college if you're looking for sports.
College Sophomore,2,"I commuted my first year of college but from what I hear, many students are not in favor of campus housing and have choosen to live in apartments for the upcoming school year off-campus."
College Junior,2,No one wants to live on campus.  Majority of UIC are commuters.
College Senior,2,Men's sports get more attention even if they lose more
College Senior,2,The campus is very inaccessible for disabled students
College Junior,2,"UIC is a commuter school. This makes it hard to really get behind the sports teams. Most students are there just for class and then rush home or to work. The school attempts to attract students to games, but it does not seem to be working."
College Freshman,2,"Very expensive for poor quality. The bathroom is horrendous. Half of our showers don't work, as well as the sinks. I'm glad to know I'm paying to have to wait to take a shower because they can't fix the other two."
College Freshman,2,I don't care for the athletics. We don't even have a football team. Very little school spirit regarding athletics.
College Junior,2,Campus housing could be way better considering how much it costs to live here.
College Senior,2,I really never hear about or see our greek life
College Junior,2,Housing is too expensive if the loan could be given instead you could buy a house stead of dorming.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life at my school is huge. If you are not Greek people think you are nothing. I personally do not like Greek life, I never have. The fraternities are really nice to everyone. The sororities are really rude if you are not apart of they Greek life. There is no Greek housing available, but all the Greeks go in on apartments together."
College Senior,2,"This school is terrible. The professors only teach to get funding for their research and do not care about the students. The classes are curved so much that some classes are 30% as a passing grade. What do you even learn at that point? I wish I never went here, I have not learned anything useful because the grading is horrible. The advisors also do not help whatsoever and you basically do things on your own."
College Junior,2,It was very stressful trying to receive the financial aid that I needed.
College Junior,2,"The campus is friendly but hardly clean. The campus cafe for on-campus students has the same food daily. The dorms are average looking and the internet on-campus is really bad.  The cost of living in the other dorms which are newly built are almost twice the regular dorms and that too you can get in those dorms if you apply early. There is no special services for international students and the amenities are average. In conclusion, the dorm life at UIC is really bad."
College Sophomore,2,"I am in the process of looking for off-campus housing and it is easy to find an open spot however, prices are ridiculously high. This is unfair for college students. It seems difficult to even live day to day with paychecks going straight towards living costs."
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing is not very great. The space is limited and the cost is very high. Also, there is not enough parking near some housing areas."
College Freshman,2,I received no aid after applying.
College Sophomore,2,I would never want to live on the south side by UIC. Lots of crime and it's very expensive.
College Sophomore,2,You don't really get any aid and the service people are the worst.
College Sophomore,2,I really don't like my University due to the atmosphere. Most of the time I have to teach myself and people are not friendly at all.
College Sophomore,2,The food available are bad since it's mostly fast food and hardly any healthy food is offered.
College Freshman,2,"The food is terrible, I would feel bad feeding it to my dog."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are cold even during the summer nights.
College Sophomore,2,Unfortunately I am struggling to pay my tuition but no financial aid is offered to me based off my parents income. My parents do not want to pay my tuition so unfortunately I lose out on any financial aid and am stuck taking out extreme amounts of loans.
College Sophomore,2,"I refuse to eat the food on campus because it is bad quality, mostly unhealthy and very expensive."
College Sophomore,2,The pricing of housing near UIC is extremely high.. chicago is very pricey. there are many commuters that come from all over the chicago area and they take public transportation. chicagos very expensive though. you would have to get a few roommates and have a decent job in order to live around there.
College Freshman,2,The facilities have not been updated in a long time.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of people do not participate in the school's athletics and athlete programs. The school is not known for its sports.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is very diverse, its easy to meet many different types of people"
Recent Alumnus,2,The sports are not very interesting and the only one worth going to basketball games
College Senior,2,"A lot of our policies are nonsensical and are really only enforced in order to make the administration look good. They crack down on the teachers the worst and our school was actually blacklisted by a lot of professors for firing a teacher for speaking his mind about the Gaza bombings and using ""bad"" language. So not so much about the students but it shows you what they think about their staff and in turn how they treat the whole campus. Doesn't give us a very good image."
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't feel I was offered any scholarships and didn't know a single student who had a pleasant experience with it.
Alum,1,"A joke of a school. I came here on a scholarship and was admitted into the Honors College, and even that wasn't worth it. None of the classes were challenging and none of the faculty were helpful - most of them had a huge attitude problem, too. I stayed in one of the newer dorms, but the food was so disgusting and the students were so immature that I just started commuting. Taking the sketchy L train to this filthy campus almost daily was miserable. The campus was dead and even more unsafe by evening since most people commute, so there's really no student life. Lots of strikes happen, too. I graduated a year early just to get out of this place ASAP. Avoid this place!"
Junior,1,I personally do not like online learning because its very hard to stay motivated and learn from home. The one positive thing is that it taught me how to manage my time a but better but nothing too crazy.
Senior,1,The admissions process was extremely terrible. These guys certified my board's mark sheet as fake(you know how much that hurts as an Indian student) and inappropriately declined my application without giving me any explanation despite having contacted them for the same through multiple times. I am pretty sure I was one of the best applicants over there and they inadvertently did this to me. Absolute imbeciles I would advise any international against applying to this university.
Niche User,1,"I attended UIC for one semester. I felt stress everyday going there. Most of the offices did not help and seemed clueless as I was. It was very difficult meeting up with my professors and my T.A's. I know I was not the only one that felt like this most of the students always complained about the school and did not show school spirit. The safety is also a big concern there is not one day that did we did not get notified about a robbery or harassment taking place around the campus. Many did not feel safe walking around campus alone around the afternoon. I would expect this from going to a school in the city but not as soon as you step one foot of the campus as UIC advertises how many ""safety services"" they offer especially the security that is supposed to be around campuses. I decided to enroll in a local community college and then transfer to different university. Once I transferred to my new university, I knew I did not make the wrong choice of leaving UIC."
Sophomore,1,"Very corrupt school, poor academic honesty, low rigor, and depressing environment. I transferred from UIS, and I can say it wasn't worthy. The university of Illinois and Springfield help me grow In ways UIC couldn't."
Junior,1,"I transferred there for the Spring semester of 2018 from my previous college. I fully regretted transferring to UIC once I got there and saw how concerning the professors and staff were. Although it is very diverse, the school is not diverse with non-international students. The environment is cold and unfriendly. It is difficult to meet people and make friends. They do not want to help with tuition assistance and you are on your own for mostly everything. The advisers do not want to talk with students for what seems any longer than 5 minutes."
Niche User,1,"I transferred here after 3yrs at a different college because of money reasons and I fully regret it. The classes are set up in a way that is not helpful, it is mostly group work and the profs dont teach. The professors are very strict about class attendance and will ruin your grade. There is no diversity and the people are not friendly at all. The overall atmosphere of campus is very depressing."
Junior,1,My 3 years experience was littered with TA's with broken english and professors who didn't care. It was difficult getting help with new topics learned in many subjects. TA's also went on strike 3 times over the 3 years I attended UIC due to low pay. This experience made me feel hopeless and lost. I wish things were different. I would have graduated on time rather than returning many years later to restart my education career.
Niche User,1,I did not like this school. I had to do a university withdrawal because I received no help. They didn't give me good information. The professors were unsympathetic.
College Senior,1,"Literally terrible, live off campus is the best way to go, even as a freshman"
College Junior,1,"UIC does not give many scholarships or financial aid. Although the students are very bright, they do not consider every student. There are several students that are very bright who need financial support, but they are not given anything. The only thing given are loans and even then some do not qualify for those loans."
College Freshman,1,It is absolutely annoying to file this report because one small thing and you have to start all over and your financial advisers barely help too.
College Freshman,1,"We barely have any parties. If we do have parties then they are discreet because you have to know certain people to get into any parties, but they are so picky on who can and cannot go to them."
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene.
College Senior,1,This campus does not care about its students at all. They send out those crime alerts and then do absolutely nothing to change the level of safety on campus. I have been at this school five years and have seen absolutely no new safety measures go into place to protect the students whatsoever and I'm certain that more crimes have been covered up than have been solved and it's amazing that there haven't been more sexual assaults than there have been. It's disgusting how much the administration simply doesn't care about the safety of their students.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no athletics on this campus, it's a medical school."
Recent Alumnus,1,I barely received any financial aid; I had to take out a private Loan because of how little money I received. Horrible experience
College Sophomore,1,UIC wifi is always kicking people off. There are never any computers available during the day. The computers are bulky and old
College Sophomore,1,"when it is so cold classes are still ongoing. also, when it is inconvenient for students the campus is still open."
College Freshman,1,This winter was terrible. You need to walk from building to building and especially this year the winter was so cold. People would give themselves snow-days.
College Junior,1,The people at the financial aid office are not qualified to be dealing with such strenuous work.
College Freshman,1,"It affects us so much. This winter for instance, Chicago has been freezing and buried in snow, causing a lot of classes to be canceled or students to just not show up for class. There are no hallways between buildings, and the two largest most used buildings for undergraduates are four blocks apart."
College Freshman,1,"The experience I had was terrible because I had so many roommates and we overall, didn't like eachother."
College Student,1,The weather in Chicago in the winter is at times unbearable.  The wind chills are bad.
College Freshman,1,"Assured there is aid, but none is given"
College Sophomore,1,"Extreme cold, snow, and wind."
College Sophomore,1,Buildings are far apart and have poor temp regulation
College Sophomore,1," Being located in downtown Chicago certainly doesn't help with safety issues on campus. There's at least one or two major crime alerts per week. Never walk alone, there's so many random people who walk on campus. A lot of lights go out and some places aren't lit very well. Lots of raping going on at parties, mostly, especially within Greek Life. Seeing someone doing drugs on or near campus is a regular thing. Drugs are a huge safety issue at this school. "
College Sophomore,1,"The professors here expect you to be some kind of genius. It's extremely difficult to meet with them if their office hours don't work into your schedule. Also, the professors and teaching assistants speak broken English with heavy accents. You're treated like a number here, not a student. This school doesn't care about its students. "
College Junior,1,Parking in the city could get annoying real quick because it's always packed.
College Freshman,1,Teachers are uninvested and students are from all around. Not a great campus vibe.
College Senior,1,"Sports are most definitely NOT an important part of life here. The soccer and basketball games are interesting and fun to attend, but there is no real following for sports here. It's hard in the urban campus, and I think sports would unify the community a little more."
College Senior,1,"Greek life is not very common at UIC, and most people don't have any interest in it.  There are also no Greek housing options."
College Junior,1,I'd say UIC is a very unsafe school. Robberies and thefts happen around the clock in nearby neighborhood.
College Sophomore,1,"They claim they're going to make the campus ""tobacco-free"" but I know that won't happen because it's already ""smoke-free"" and I see lots of people smoking a cigarette before, after, or while going to class. Alcohol is easy to sneak in and store in your dorm, but if you throw a party in your dorm and are loud, you're quite guaranteed to get busted and written up for it. Smoking marijuana is quite easy to get away with because where I go to school, it's decriminalized under one ounce so nobody really bats an eye about it. But if you're outside drinking and you're underage, or smoking pot, the campus police will bust you"
College Junior,1,"Parking is not the best at UIC, especially for students that commute to campus. To park on campus students are required to pay a hefty fee. However, Chicago has a great public transportation system that allows full-time students to ride for free throughout the semester. If parking is an issue, the CTA is the best--and free!"
College Junior,1,"Drug use at UIC is visible, and it turns out that people are not mindful of how it affects other students. Alcohol i don't mind very much, but i do wish that the drug policy at UIC could have been stronger and stricter. So that it can make a safe environment for the freshmen. Though it would be best if they have a great college experience without being exposed to drugs and narcotics."
College Junior,1,"I don't quite feel safe at the school because there are so many robberies near campus. Apartments are broken into and students have been held up at gun point. This happens many times throughout the year. While no school is safer than the other, UIC is still a school struggling with safety."
College Freshman,1,the drug scene is not really big. i have not seen anything or smelled anything for that matter
College Junior,1,"The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is impossible. Very hard to find parking near by and then heading to class. Either way you still have to take a bus to get to campus.
College Freshman,1,"The Campus Dining deserves a D, mainly because the workers working at the cafeteria. Blatantly, they are loud and obnoxious. Almost most of the time, they are arguing or giving attitude to the students they do not like. I come to eat, but i lose my appetite when the workers give me attitude. Also, the workers close early and make students leave casually. The dining is the worth the cost at all. To be honest, I feel ripped off. The cafeterias do not deserve an F, because the food is appetizing. Although, most of it is the same, the luxury of having food almost whenever is great. But the staff is horrible, that is why the cafeterias deserve a D."
College Freshman,1,The Halsted bus and the trains seem to always be full especially in the evening.
College Sophomore,1,"The price for parking in a semester is way too high. Its suppose to help to save by bundling the four months in our semester instead of paying by day one uses it.Some, almost all, college students are broke or trying to save because of payments and the cost of life, and parking prices aren't helping us save. The commute from the north part of Chicago to UIC is about 20 minutes without traffic but rush hours leaves me to take a 40 minute prior to heading on I94. I would rather commute the blue line 2 hours round-trip everyday pay a flat rate of $100 and get unlimited uses of transfers than pay about $600-$700 for 4 months of parking (which also runs the risk of no open spots available)."
College Sophomore,1,"School's in session during the winter.  It's nice right at the beginning, and right at the end.  And if you take summer courses.  Maybe global warming will help."
College Sophomore,1,Most of the few scholarships offered by the school help a different demographic and don't apply to me.
College Junior,1,Parking at UIC is absolutely too much money and there isnt much free parking there
College Freshman,1,The Unhealthy Route – The cafeteria at UIC gives a evident clue as to why people gain freshman fifteen.  Most of their options consist of sugar and fats.  Being stressed college students the sugary and unhealthy food provide no nutirents to feed our minds.  I suggest not eating at the dining hall so much.
College Sophomore,1,"Ridiculously Terrible, Advisers Don't Advise. It's honestly like they don't want you to get aid. The running gag in my house is that they keep making you jump through hoops in hopes that you'll give up and pay for everything out of pocket, and honestly there's more than a kernel of truth in that. The financial aid advisers aren't helpful at all, they don't explain anything to you, and they're very rude and catty if you don't follow their instructions to the T. There are no useful explanations, no guides to submitting your financial aid, and EVERY SINGLE YEAR you get hassled to do more paperwork than what you already submitted. It seems like every year they come up with a NEW way to waste your time and energy verifying things that they can easily check with the government for if they weren't so lazy. Scholarships are a joke at this college, there's not enough to go around and no consistent way of finding them. I actually found out about some of the merit aid I was qualified for from College Prowler and not my actual university - even though the aid was university specific! If you plan on applying for financial aid at UIC, expect a long, painful slog to get any money."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible and Expensive – On campus parking is plentiful for those with the budget. Off-campus parking is a hassle and expensive as well. Street parking is available for those who can get to campus by 6:00 am. The upside are the U-Passes which is included in tuition and valid on cta (public transportation) 5 days prior and after the semester, which is what a majority of the students use."
College Senior,1,"Safety Issues – Even though the university is located at one of the busiest places of the city, the neighborhood has been famous for being unsafe to some extent. However, this is not a good enough reason to not consider this school. Students should try to take morning classes mostly because beside some safety issues the rest of the atmosphere is quite attractive."
College Junior,1,Not Much Luck – Have met with the Scholarship Office and they were not very helpful.
College Sophomore,1,"If it snows a lot, it is hard to get to school on time because most people communte. Also, it is very unlike that teachers will cancel class"
College Junior,1,All sports at UIC are not popular. Students do not attend games and do not show interest.
College Sophomore,1,"The Illegal Courtyard – The sad thing about UIC is that the visibility of drugs (mostly weed) is so in-your-face. I live in the Courtyard of the school and I live on the first floor where many people walk in and out through because of the location. I smell weed all the time and I see people clearly doing it. But does security do anything about it? No, and I don't like that. I'm against drugs and alcohol and it's a little disappointing for me to see a couple of freshman walking in with a case of beer or the entire courtyard smelling like weed when it's warm outside.
I really wish security cracked down on it a lot more because I'm tired of getting nauseous because of the smell."
College Junior,1,"Computer Labs Crowded During Most Afternoons – The computer labs at University of Illinois at Chicago are always crowded during early afternoons. A good portion of people are actually doing assignments for classes, but you'll often find another portion of people browsing facebook. I would definitely suggest bringing your own laptop and using the WiFi."
College Senior,1,many apartments in the area but somewhat expensive.
College Senior,1,"Terrible dorms, overpriced, and run down, and horrible RA's. It takes several months for things to get fixed."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Look, maybe I'm not being fair here, but I didn't live on campus, and I wouldn't go to school at night because no one I hung with lived there either. For all intents and purposes, their night life is dead."
Recent Alumnus,1,Drug Scene – I wouldn't really know the drug scene on campus because I do not affiliate myself with those activities but from what I see on a daily basis the drug scene is not apparent on campus and is strongly looked down upon within our facilities.

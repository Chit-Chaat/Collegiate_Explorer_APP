Freshman,5,Currently a majority of my classes are completely online. I have been very successful as the teachers are providing extremely detailed notes to support our work. The professors are consistant with their classroom organization so it's very easy to follow and stay on track. I feel Carlow's online program is much easier than surrounding schools as I have had experience with other schoool's programs. I am a very successful online student as well as a majority of the other students.
Freshman,5,"I love how driven Carlow is. Carlow wants nothing but success for each and every student. Each professor knows you personally which makes Carlow feel very welcoming. You are provided with so many options so you can be as successful as possible. Carlow is a catholic college but they are open to anyone from any religion, background, and beliefs. Carlow has a large LGBTQ population and allows those students to feel just as welcome. I have recommended Carlow to so many students considering nursing as their major. Carlow has an excellent nursing program with extremely high NCLEX passing rates. Students graduating from Carlow are almost guaranteed a job. With the current situations in the nation, Carlow has made online learning very easy. They are open to communication at nearly all times of the day and they care about the students health. I am very happy with my decision at Carlow."
Junior,5,"It is quite and adjustment, but the faculty and staff do anything and everything they can to help you succeed! I would not hesitate to apply here."
Junior,5,"Carlow feels like home. It is a small campus on a hill, so you feel safe and protected and can get some privacy. But you also have the benefits of a large campus. Pitt is right down the street and we have all of Oakland we can walk around and enjoy our nights."
Sophomore,5,Carlow University is a very welcoming and diverse community. Every nursing professor guides you to succeed!
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience was only through the covid-19 pandemic that started in March 2019. All of my professors were very organized and taught all of my nursing classes throughly. They also had many Zoom reviews for tests and finals. Whenever I needed assistance, the professors at Carlow guided me through the material."
Junior,5,I did not take any classes online but many of our professors put all the material for the entire semester online for us.  It was very useful for studying and time management due to knowing all assignments/exams in advance.
Junior,5,"Carlow made me feel like home. It is a small campus and all the professors are there for you, weather it was personal or academically. Someone is always ready to help you!"
Graduate Student,5,"Small class sizes, personal attention from instructors even during online-only classes. I really feel like I'm learning a lot from my coursework."
Freshman,5,"Carlow is a very small school and it has a very small campus as well. I love how helpful everyone is on campus. however, it is not very diverse."
Sophomore,5,"Very understanding professors and staff. Great material for learning. This school works very well for those that have a job too, they'll work around your schedule."
Junior,5,"At Carlow University everyone is someone special, the professors take a special investment in their students to make sure that everyone has as much ability as they can to succeed. I would strongly recommend anyone in the Pittsburgh area to come to this school. From wonderful academics to an amazing area outside of the classroom Carlow leaves you with wonderful new experiences and memories to last a lifetime."
Sophomore,5,I like about Carlow is that there a lot of majors to pick up for profession in the future and their campus is full of diverse students. Their food are good but sometime you want to go on the walk to get some food
Sophomore,5,"I am so far loving my time at Carlow. I am about to be a sophomore and everyone is always so nice and friendly. My first couple of days on campus, upper classman were willing to help me find my way if I did not know where I was going. I am proud to be a student there."
Freshman,5,"I feel as though Carlow University is a great school because they are very accepting of everyone no matter what their race, religion, ethnicity, or other types of diversity. The school is also very accommodating to those with disabilities such as hearing, vision, or other impairments. They also promote students to have many experiences that will expand their opportunities in the workforce, in school, or even just the community.  Even the professors recommend being kind to those who are different than us to make them feel welcome and to expand our own knowledge of others and their traditions and culture. One thing that I would like to see change at the campus is the security people who sit at the entrance of the dorms because they do not seem enjoy their job, nor do they seem that friendly or approachable."
Freshman,5,"I love the location, Oakland is such a busy and beautiful place. This college accepts everyone from all backgrounds, despite being a Catholic school. I really enjoy the diversity here. The class sizes are perfect and the professors really get too know you."
Sophomore,5,"The university has amazing food, and amazing study grounds. Being in the heart of pittsburgh is so great, it allows you to have so much fun! The professors are amazing here and are very clear about what they want. The campus is all close together, so there isn't all that much walking involved. And they have a killer gym and swimming pool!"
Junior,5,I find my school academically challenging especially in the scientific science. Being challenged helps me understand difficult concepts which will make life easier in the end.
Sophomore,5,I am starting my sophomore year here and it is the school of my dreams. You get to be right in the heart of this city with a small community vibe.
Sophomore,5,Work hard and Carlow will reward you! Great location; kind peers and professors. Also right next to Pitt and CMU so you can fullfill your partying needs.
Freshman,5,"Carlow is a wonderful school.  I feel that they genuinely do want you to succeed.  I also feel that a lot of the people I have met here are some of my closest friends.  Overall, I know that my program is quite difficult, but in a good way where it pushes you."
Alum,5,"Carlow was an amazing experience for me. The small school feel in the middle of Oakland was the perfect mix. The professors are great and always willing to help. Everyone at the school is supportive and goal oriented. As Carlow grows as a university, I encourage anyone seeking a degree to check it out."
Junior,5,"Thus far my experience at Carlow has been awesome. My teachers has been great. As long as i study and stay focused I get good grades. Thus, far I have no grades lower than a B-. I have learned so much, and anticipate to learn much more!"
Freshman,5,Carlow is a great university with wonderful opportunities and gives you a chance to meet new and interesting people from all over.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Carlow University. I like how there are small classes and the teachers are extremely helpful. If you ever feel like you're struggling or get discouraged there is always someone around to talk you through it or make you smile. The professors make sure you understand the materials before you leave the classroom. If u happen not to get it they are always available for after hours other than classroom time. If I could change anything about Carlow I would change the dorm settings and probably how the classrooms are set up. The dorms are old fashion and it's community bathroom.  That is one thing that I don't like. Also depending where u have class some of the classrooms are the same way.
College Freshman,5,Very easy! Sam is one of the best people to help with admissions!
College Senior,5,It is a awesome University!
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy my school very much! I always find myself wanting to go to class, never skipping, and doing all of my work. I have met some diverse and wonderful people both students and professors here. I'm excited to continue my studies at this school."
College Sophomore,5,"I personally know different people who previously graduated from Carlow. They all have wonderful careers in their fields, and make the salary that they should expect with their degrees. Before I finished my admissions into Carlow, I asked each one of them if they could go back (knowing what they've learned during and since leaving college) and pick a different school to attend, where would they go? Every single one said that they would pic Carlow again. In my experiences (32 years of life experiences), I have never heard of that, and it speaks volumes."
College Sophomore,5,"Somehow Carlow has found a perfect balance or old and new. You are directly in the middle of older, traditional buildings/grounds/architecture, but has the same amount of updated technology and resources. It makes for a perfectly balanced experience. While the campus is smaller than many other schools, there is no shortage of activities and social scenes (both alcohol and non) surrounding the area. It has the perfect mix of students: young/older, traditional/non-traditional, day/evening, and a wide variety of different backgrounds and lifestyles.

I love the one-on-one experience and assistance that I have received from the faculty and staff at Carlow University. The professors are extremely kind and fair, easy to communicate with, and make every attempt to help their students succeed. Of course you have some students who say same professors are horrible, but those are usually the ones who do not do their work. Personally, I could not attend a school where I'm one little seat in a big theater, and only 1 out our 300 students. I need the more personalized atmosphere and connections. I have complete 4 semesters at Carlow, and I would not change it for the world!"
College Sophomore,5,"With the smaller atmosphere, everybody knows everybody. I know that can create drama at times, but it also creates a larger amount of safety and accountability. As a female, I feel EXTREMELY SAFE at Carlow, and have never had any problems, day or night. Also, I have been there 2 years and have never heard of any incidents. They work hard to make sure that we have drills and precautions in place, in case of an emergency. In fact, I feel so safe that I have brought my daughter to campus many, many times, and will continue to do so."
College Sophomore,5,"Carlow is simply amazing. If you are looking for a personalized, one-on-one education, I highly suggest giving it a try. In addition, the school staff go out of their way to assist adult and returning students (which I am). They definitely do not neglect the younger population either! I personally know many people who have graduated from Carlow, and they all have said their degree was well worth it!!"
College Freshman,5,We have a couple of Greek life atmospheres here. We even have one that is totally dedicated to community service. Everyone gets along very well at Carlow University and the events are always opened to other students that are not even involved in Greek life.
College Freshman,5,"Here at Carlow University, they are very helpful in making sure you succeed. If you are struggling, your professors will actually sit down with you and figure out what you can do. We also have a very cool career center that helps you find job interviews and interneships. They even help with your resumes and over letter and will go over the interview process with you."
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on Campus, as Carlow has their own police force, which is always there to help. I don't know of any campus crimes of any kind. There are many security measures to keep students safe such as outsiders not being able to get into buildings and having regular fire drills. I feel like Carlow takes good safety precautions and I feel safe here."
College Freshman,5,"Graduates from this school receive many great career opportunities. There are also many internships and jobs opportunities available at Carlow. The alumni network is good and many employers recruit Carlow students. The quality of the career center is great also, as the people there are very helpful and knowledgeable."
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are the best. They are extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. All of the professors and advisers I have had have gone above and beyond to help me and pother students. There are a wide variety of courses offered. There are also many class styles including in person classes, labs, and online classes. There class size is small and personal."
College Freshman,5,I would say that my school is great. Professors and advisers are very knowledgeable and helpful. There is a wide variety of classes to take and clubs to join. The students are very friendly and the atmosphere is friendly. One of my favorite experiences at this school was during Orientation week when I was able to get frozen yogurt with my friends an walk around with them.
College Freshman,5,The health and safety at Carlow University are excellent. There are police on campus at all times to ensure safety of the students. There are over 50 emergency call boxes throughout the campus.
College Freshman,5,"Carlow University is an accomplished university in the center of activity in the neighborhood of Oakland of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The professors are all experts in their field and really motivated to teaching their students and helping them at all times. The campus is small, but offers so much to its students. Great academics, a friendly campus, plenty financial aid, and a place that I am happy to call my home. I would choose Carlow University again because of the amazing Nursing Program they offer here. Carlow currently has a 95.7% NCLEX score; the highest in Pittsburgh right now. Clinical groups are kept to a maximum of 6 students, really allowing me to be hands on and ask many questions. I love Carlow and I can honestly say I am happy that I didn't choose any where else."
College Freshman,5,They really care about your education and they will work you hard.
College Freshman,5,The forth floor has a nurse. A doctor comes in once a week. There are police on campus and they're located in the entrance of the dorms. There is never crime. You have to swipe your ID card everywhere besides the library. They have a texting service for emergencies.
College Junior,5,"I have not been aware of any of these events happening on campus but if one did, we are told about the services freshman year and you hear of people telling others if they need help to use the services. There are adequate signs around campus for them as well."
College Junior,5,"My personal experience I would rate the best. When I need help, I seek it and receive it. Some don't make as much effort and will complain about it. For nursing, we have a strict schedule, so it can be hard to pick the elective classes to work around it, but our nursing classes are priority."
College Junior,5,"There are always opportunities for networking. We have a career services office that help with resumes, internships and seeking a job after school."
College Junior,5,This was the only school I found to be the best Nursing wise in the Pittsburgh area. There are small classes and you receive one on one help if needed. All nursing programs are hard and you can't always blame faculty for that like most people do. I believe they help when you seek it. I feel that I am progressing like I should be and I love the opportunities we have with all of the hospitals around us. I do not regret attending this university. I also love the values implemented in us through the heritage of the school and the sisters of Mercy. We have a special community.
College Freshman,5,I love Carlow and thinks it's a great school. It is the perfect place for me.
College Sophomore,5,"I love it here! Although Carlow is a small campus and it does have it's problems like other schools, my overall experience has been great! Most of the professors are excellent and willing to help, and you can always strike up a conversation with the staff here as well. Although I wish there were more opportunities sports wise, I am so glad that I went to Carlow."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on Carlow's campus because there are a great amount of officers on campus, as well as the officers of the Oakland area of Pittsburgh."
College Sophomore,5,"Carlow has a strictness, but it in no way limits or hinders the overall student experience. It actually helps the students focus on their schooling instead of partying and partaking in other insane activities."
College Sophomore,5,"Getting a degree from Carlow will not only get you further in your career, it will put you at the top of the list. All of my previous professors at Community College of Beaver County instilled in my head how great of a school Carlow was and were thrilled when they found out this was the college I was attending."
College Freshman,5,"Oakland and Pittsburgh in general offers a HUGE variety of activities.  There are a TON of things to do near campus and a variety of busses that go throughout the entire Pittsburgh area.  You can get to anywhere.  Also, there are a lot of small businesses and specialty shops."
College Freshman,5,Oakland has a lot of options.  Anywhere from fast food up to fine dining (and a everything in between).  You have to be open to trying/experiencing new things and willing to look for them.
College Freshman,5,"I'm still waiting to get some scholarships.  I applied a little later than most, so I wasn't eligible.  However, the Financial Aid office is EXTREMELY helpful and will help you with anything they can."
College Freshman,5,"Carlow has amazing staff, everyone is so nice and helpful."
College Freshman,5,This doesn't seem to be a problem at Carlow.
College Freshman,5,"Carlow was definitely the best school for me.  Small University, big city, love it!"
College Freshman,5,"Carlow will throw money at anyone if it means they'll come here. In some ways it's bad because there are people who maybe didn't need to attend college but are still receiving financial aid, but for the most part I'm happy because I'm only paying room and board. It's saving me a lot of money."
College Freshman,5,"I would totally. The program is super helpful and is really preparing me for my field. I plan to either go in to medical social work or youth social work. Right now I am shadowing the director of the Early Learning Center on campus to get a feel for working with young children, and next semester I plan on interning at a hospital in order to grasp what the hospital environment is like."
College Junior,5,There is a very diverse group of students.  Lots of different beliefs and backgrounds and it's nice to have the differences to learn from in classes.
Junior,4,I like Carlow because of the small class sizes and very professional yet comical professors. It is a great mix of focused yet light study.
Junior,4,The best part of Carlow is the professors. They genuinely want to see you succeed and because the student to professor ratio is so low you actually get one on one opportunities to meet with them for help.
Sophomore,4,"because Carlow is a smaller school it has allowed me to make stronger relationships with the students but also with the faculty as well. I also really like the way the campus looks but not a fan of the big hill. While you are on campus it almost completely separates you from the noise of the city but walks a block over and your back in it. Something I would like to see done better would be tastier food options though they have been working on it. No big complaints, just things to improve on."
Freshman,4,I would like there to be more diversity the diversity ratio isn’t very good. Also I would like to see a increase in the amount of athletic scholarships I think a lot of guys go there for sports then end up transferring because they aren’t getting enough money to be able to afford the school so I would just give more scholarship money in general. Good school but just lacks few things
Sophomore,4,"Carlow University is a place that feels like school, but also a harmonic community.  With it being such a small, liberal arts university, it is easy to connect with other students and especially the professors. I personally believe that this enhances the academic standpoint within the university. It is easy to ask the professors and staff for assistance because it feels like you personally get to know them, and they get to know you. It is a great school for those who want to feel connected to others, and not be overwhelmed by a huge lecture hall with hundreds of students at a time."
Senior,4,"I liked the location. The professors are about 50/50. Very expensive for what u get I really like the student academic help center, but I shouldn't have to ask fellow students for help that I've emailed professors about. 
The student body involvement is very low it seems like a place that most locals go when they don't want to go away to school. I personally am from out of the area and it seems like I'm one of the only ones."
Freshman,4,"Carlow is a really great small school in a big city, so the best of both worlds. The professors are always willing to help and since it is so small, if a student wants to make something happen it is possible. The facilities in the newer buildings is great, some of the older buildings need some help. The food offered here is alright, but when you live on campus it gets old fast. Carlow is like home."
Sophomore,4,Carlow unversity accept all races and color people they believe in equality and giving equal right and freedom to each students with facilities. In future I would like to change computer systems because it’s very slow.
Alum,4,"Carlow is a good school to go to if you’re looking for a good academic program. If you are looking for a party scene go elsewhere. It is close to pitt, CMU, and Duquesne so you could always crash their party’s. I went to the nursing school. It is a tough program but if you pass you will most likely pass your nclex. Most area hospitals love Carlow nurses and you will not have a hard time finding a job."
Sophomore,4,Carlow is a great university for students looking for a more intimate experience. The small campus and class sizes allow you to create relationships easier with your peers and professors. There is only one dorm hall which would be nice to see expand to accommodate more students. Carlow is definitely growing and every program is top notch.
Freshman,4,I like the smaller class sizes and all of the professors I have met so far have made a good effort to get to know me so I feel like a name and not a number. I don’t start my freshman year till August but all my visits to campus have been positive so far.
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors are so nice to the students and helpful. I just finished my first year of the university and I liked most of it. I like how the school has tutors to help student in need. carlow is so great because most of the people the are nice it is not like high school were people are so childish. I love the school colors and how the buildings are set up. The is a science which makes things easier to find all the science classes. one thing I would like o see change at carlow is the food. I hate the food so much because it is just so tastless to me. Another thing I would like to see change at carlow is the for the school to give more scholarship or grants to students in need.
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Carlow University. One of the things I liked the most was how personal everyone was; we all knew each other, and everyone said hello to one another in passing. Additionally, the professors all knew who you were, and I think that helped me personally in each class.
One thing I did not like was the parking. I understand that for a city school, parking is always going to be limited. However, I feel that since they charge so much per student for a parking permit, they could invest in a parking garage or something"
Graduate Student,4,"Had a very good experience at Carlow during my four years of undergrad, that I even decided to come back to pursue my graduate degree here. Like that there is the option for traditional classes or online classes. The classes are small enough that professors are able to work one on one with you if you need it."
Senior,4,"I’ve been at Carlow for 4 years. The majority of the campus is located up on a hill. This university is great for students who are looking for smaller classes and want to build a good connection with their instructor and peers. There’s a lot of resources available as well when it comes to needing help with finding jobs, internships, and getting involved around the campus. The instructors at Carlow are great. They communicate well and are willing to assist you as need. The academics are good and well rounded, you learn about your major as well as, others that can connect to your major. The classes are used to help you in your academic career and personal life. The school is Catholic, and its morals, values are well respected and valuable. I would recommend Carlow to anyone who wants to be apart of a smaller campus and receive a great education at a private institute."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Carlow University ws a rather wonderful experience my freshman year. The school is perfect for being it’s  own small slice of pie. I love the fact that Carlow is small because it helps you to concentrate and stay focused and there are so many opportunities for tutoring or any type of academic experience you need.
Sophomore,4,"I love this school! The only con is that there is not off campus housing, but it is a very small college."
Senior,4,I definitely like a few things about Carlow. One main thing I like is the class size. I never have more than 25 people in my classes which allows me to have one on one time with the professor after class if needed. I also like how safe I feel living on campus.
Freshman,4,"The campus and administration at Carlow is what every first year student would want to experience. The community is welcoming and the classrooms aren't hard to find. The professors are always looking to help a student succeed. If a student is looking into a college that has a small community but has the city experience, Carlow University is where that student should apply. Carlow University has a new education system they follow which is called the COMPASS. The COMPASS lets the student take courses outside of their major and the reason Carlow does this is to help their students be more well rounded when it comes to the real world. I am currently going to be enrolled into the nursing program and I am still taking courses related to my major but I am also taking a writing and theology course which has made me more aware of the opportunities I have here at Carlow University. "
College Senior,4,Great small school with dedicated professors
College Freshman,4,Really nice and awesome! A few students really helped to improve campus security with our ideas of leaving the lights on more and increasing the amount of officers on campus as well. They definitely took our concerns into consideration.
College Freshman,4,Very spacious but homey feel to it. I love the new and old amenities mixed into the school.
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are pretty awesome, but of course there are always some that are lacking in any school. The administration needs serious improvement especially the guidance counselors. It's like they are never sure of anything they are doing or taking on way too much. The campus is very old and it does weigh on god a bit but it's a catholic school so it's expected but overall it's a really awesome school even if a bit pricey."
College Sophomore,4,Carlow University offers lots of support designed to help the student succeed.
College Freshman,4,"Security is wonderful and close by on campus. If they are needed, there will be someone available to help anyone in need. I have never felt unsafe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The school takes many intiatives to help students get jobs and even help with the application process. Anytime I mention Carlow to someone they respond with ""Wow! That is a great school!"""
College Freshman,4,I love this school! My classes are small and teachers are helpful and seem to care about students and their courses. My favorite thing is the liberal arts education because I have a wide range of interests so it fits me well.
College Sophomore,4,"There are not a lot of Greek organizations because Carlow is a smaller, more personal population. For students who want to be involved, there are options, but they do not include the party life. However, Carlow is in Oakland, and close to the other party areas in Pittsburgh, so it really is not needed."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are not the ""hallmark"" at Carlow, but they do offer a variety and are always adding more. When people make suggestions, Carlow is amazing at listening and helping the students with their suggestions. We definitely will not be in the Final Four any time soon, but for a smaller, more private school, they offer a good selection. There is a good amount of support for Carlow, and everyone who goes there loves to represent!"
College Freshman,4,"The housing is great. Everyone on your floor is like a huge family. The cost is decent for the dorms but you do automatically get a scholarships to help out with the costs. Depending on the floor you live on, depends on the furniture you have. Some rooms have lofted beds while others do not. Some rooms always have moveable furniture while others do not. The rooms do come with a mini fridge and a microwave which saves a lot of money."
College Freshman,4,"Even though Carlow University does not have many sports, we do take pride in going to the games and supporting our team. Carlow even has their own gym that is mainly for people who are in a sport to train. The facility is very helpful and very supportive too."
College Freshman,4,There are many sports to get involved with at Carlow. Many people participate in sports. I especially hear about people participating in basketball. Students are also eager to watch their sports teams play.
College Freshman,4,"Carlow University is a great place for resident students. The dorm building is extremely close to all of the buildings, allowing for a maximum 5 minute walk to class. Dorm life allows for building friendships with a roommate and those who live around you. The dorms are relatively spacious compared to many other universities and the RA's are pretty lax with rules."
College Senior,4,The professors are nice. They seem to provide well rounded education. When I'm struggling I stay after class if the have time to help me or go to their office.
College Freshman,4,They urge you from the start to start preparing for after school.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are shaped like a square with one missing side. I've made friends with the most people on my side. Nobody follows quiet hours especially on weekends. There are communal bathrooms but you get used to them quickly.
College Freshman,4,"The location, new technology, and class sizes are awesome. The cafeteria is buffet style but it gets old after a semester. It's a private Catholic school that doesn't make you take religious classes but they have a convent of nuns that founded the school. A tour of their home is required but it isn't terrible. It's still a small ratio of guys to girls but I've made great guy friends. If you're social, you meet most of the people at the school in your first semester because it's a small school."
College Freshman,4,All my professors really care about your education and I feel like I am getting a great education
College Junior,4,It's hard and demanding anywhere you go. I am getting my money's worth for the education I'm receiving and couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities I get here.
College Junior,4,"They provide air conditioning, heat, refrigerator/freezer. Some furnature needs updated. Sometimes you may end up on a flood with furnature you don't like such as a loft bed, but it's not awful"
Recent Alumnus,4,I' m consider to be a non traditional student.  I am enrolled in the Adult College Program at Carlow University and I think the program is great! The class schedule is flexible for my work schedule and family life.  The faculty and staff at Carlow University are great and I have met a lot of people and made friends too.
College Sophomore,4,Carlow University is a great school its small and very personal to your needs. I do love it there but it is very expensive.
College Freshman,4,It is a small school which is great because it provides a calm campus in the middle of a very busy city.
College Senior,4,my univsrity is unique for its degree programs and small class sizes.
College Freshman,4,The school policies work hand and hand with the roman catholic community
College Freshman,4,"They gave me a really good financial aid package, overing majority of my expenses for the year."
College Sophomore,4,On campus you are safe we have wonderful police but when you go down to Pitt be careful
College Freshman,4,"If you step off campus you will find typical college food and fast food pizza places and etc.. (ex: Subway, Panera, Chipotle, McDonald's, Jimmy John's, Pizza Romano, 5 guys, The O's, Noodles and Company)"
College Freshman,4,"The party scene is pretty nice. It is, what you make of it. My friends and I pretty much go out every other weekend or so. Carlow NEVER has any parties however, you can always find somthing at PITT."
College Freshman,4,There are a ton of people to help you with financial aid.
College Freshman,4,"Carlow is a dry campus, so you cannot party here, however, it's in the middle of Oakland so there are plenty of parties around the area."
College Freshman,4,"Carlow offers many opportunities to get involved in campus life, internships, volunteering, and job opportunies. However, the building is old so there have been issues with pipes bursting and the fire alarms are very sensitive. The faculty and staff are all very kind and caring. Overall it's like a comfy homely community. Very enjoyable."
College Freshman,4,I chose this school mostly by the scholarship offer. The financial aid office is very helpful.
College Junior,4,"If you like small classes and great professors, and dont mind crappy food, this place is for you."
College Junior,4,Classes are great small sizes and amazing Professors.
College Junior,4,"I Live on campus, can not really speak to this."
College Junior,4,They are very helpful and accommodating
College Junior,4,"I love going to parties on weekends, great way to meet new people and to get away from the daily drag of life."
College Sophomore,4,"Receiving financial aid at Carlow University was a breeze! Once I filled out my FAFSA and Carlow received the information, everything fell right into place. I received my award letter within one week of me scheduling my classes which gave me more than enough time to make any changes that were necessary before the Spring 2015 semester began."
College Freshman,4,"Since I don't live there, I can't rate housing.  However, the classrooms and buildings are excellent.  You get the charm of older buildings, but everything has been updated with computer labs/technology/etc.  They are also building a new library/student area."
Senior,2,"Attended Carlow for 3 years until I had to transfer to a different college. The professors were okay but they tend to read off the slide and not actually teach. The dorms were always dirty (showers and bathroom). The other residents do not respect the area they share. Met some wonderful people but the school doesn’t take care of its students and even athletes. Campus food is terrible. Tiernan Hall is terrible. When it gets two hours before it closes the staff gets lazy and doesn’t get enough food out to the students. Food choices are not good. Many students are forced to go out and eat fast food because of the bad taste or bad hours that the cafeteria is open. Tuition also got raised because a dramatic drop of students remained, or they decided to live off campus because the dorms were not the best. Do not attend. Many community colleges are better."
Senior,2,"The instructors are wonderful, but administration runs the school terribly. Also it is really expensive for very few amenities and little support."
College Freshman,2,"Our school has limited amount of sports. we do not have a football team which its a hamper on our schools school spirit. Also, we have about 5,000 students and majority of the students commute. there is little school spirit and because we have to travel to another location for every game, it is rare that majority of the students attend every game."
College Sophomore,2,If you want to party you have to walk to Pitt and it is hard to get in like you have to know some one
College Freshman,2,"The options of food choices are limited, the food is normal ""bad"" college food."
College Freshman,2,"There are only two places to use your meal plan here. In a cafe on campus, and in the dining hall on campus. I wish we could use our meal plans at restaurants off and around campus as well. The food on campus is likely to make you sick about half the time. I have gotten sick from the food at both places on campus, but I keep eating there because I don't feel like paying out of pocket to eat at restaurants when I'm already paying about 2K for a meal plan."
College Junior,2,"A lot of fried food and not a lot of variety, especially on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"Carlow is a dry campus so everyone either goes to a friends apartment, a Pitt party, or the bar."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of the same type of people here. The girls are high maintenance and wear a lot of make up and smoke, or are really into sports, or are really weird and into subculture stuff. The 15 guys who go here are socially awkward."
College Freshman,2,"You need to bring a computer and you need to bring an ethernet cord, otherwise any internet access will be an extreme hassle."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't like strict policies, Carlow is not for you. I appreciate it, but I can see why people would get annoyed."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not famillar with this at my area, but from previous transportation, it was bad."
College Senior,2,"A four year member of the soccer team, I have come to realize that this team is not a high priority to the athletic director. Not only was he unaware that our team went undefeated in our conference (KIAC) last season, he also has lacked to find us a consistent practice field in the past. Currently, as we are in season, we have no practice field and are on a day-by-day basis as to whether or not we can find a field and practice outdoors. It's hectic, unorganized and unprofessional. For those that wish to attend Carlow University and play other sports, be my guest. They seem to be more on the AD's radar than soccer, despite our success and improvement over four years. If you wish to play soccer at Carlow, be aware of the external shenanigans you will have to endure."
College Sophomore,2,I generally feel pretty safe on campus. At times I feel uneasy by a certain parking attendant because he tends to be a bit creepy when valleting my car. But other than that if it's during the day I tend to feel okay.
College Junior,2,No free parking and residents can only park 8 times
College Sophomore,2,"The parking on campus is almost non existent. Only commuter students are allowed to have parking permits and even when they get a permit they are not guaranteed a parking space. I go to school in the city so driving is not a necessity to most resident students, but some students like having the option of driving because the cost of bus fair is rising quickly. Also most of the parking spaces are located at the very top of our campus which is about a five to ten minute walk up hills, which makes it hard for any students with health problems."
College Junior,2,"Commuter With Opinons – Personally, I have never lived on campus nor will I ever. I have some control and freedom issues that would be very aggravated living on campus. I do not agree with many of their policies. Plus, I could spend 3,000 dollars a semester living on campus or I can pay my 240 dollars of rent each month."
College Sophomore,2,All I can say is the housing could stand to be renovated.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms and cafe could really use renovations.  The library is not bad, but is going to be redone soon.  There are two gyms on campus one could really stand to be done over and the other is very nice, but has limited hours.  There is nowhere to eat on campus at night if you are up studying or just want something to eat. You either end up spending money or hopefully you have something in your room to snack on."
College Senior,2,"The price is rather ridiculous and spots are hard to come by.  Some schools have higher prices than Carlow, but they are bigger schools. Carlow did expand a parking lot this past summer, but there still is limited parking."
Graduate Student,1,"I found that there was an undercurrent if favoritism in the psych depattment and a general dislike of students by the psych faculty. The relationships are contentious and the academics were very weak. Independent reading with no follow-up was the routine instructional practice. A total waste of money, and an unpleasant tone."
Graduate Student,1,"Very dangerous location where student lots abut the crime-ridden Hill District. The worst part is the unsophisticated program in counseling. Anyone gets in, so fellow grad students are academically weak and usually graduates of only Carlow. So, there's no diversity. Courses were so watered down, many grad students don't  learn very much. Staff does not collaborate with students; there is a broad divide between profs and students like in the olden days."
College Sophomore,1,We have a very small cafeteria that we share with the campus school so if you go during lunch time there are a ton of young school kids the food is gross and very few options
College Sophomore,1,Our housing is terrible the room are small the carpets are old and for the past two years I have not had a working heater. For how expensive the drums are it is no where near worth it
College Freshman,1,Are teams are Division III and they are just okay..
College Freshman,1,"Everything will make you sick and it doesn't even taste good. How do you feel after eating dining hall food from here? My roommate describes it as sad, fat and pale. (no, she is not fat or pale, but the food is depressing)"
College Freshman,1,There are only four small parking lots and it never seems as though there are enough. People drive around for what seems like hours just to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,"Pitt gives students bus passes. Carlow does not. We have to pay regular fare if we need to go anywhere, and parking is ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"I do not consider Carlow a party school. I have not witnessed any students planning or attending any parties on campus. There is a larger university nearby that has parties. I would assume if anyone wanted to partake in any of those activities it would be at the other school. Carlow is such an intimate university with a religious foundation, I couldn't fathom anyone throwing a wild party."
College Junior,1,"There is a diverse group of girls on campus, however there are maybe only about 20 guys that live on campus so with that ratio there isn't really any point in looking for someone to be in a stable heterosexual relationship with."
College Junior,1,"Greek life at Carlow University is generally nonexistent outside of Alpha Phi Omega, the service fraternity.  I believe the campus is apart of local city-wide chapters of different organizations, but there are only a handful of active members on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Off Campus housing is expensive and hard to find.  The safety of the surrounding areas is ambiguous.
College Junior,1,"Flex Dollars – Flex dollars are only usable at the campus dining halls and cafe. Most universities associate themselves with other restaurants off campus. Carlow University neighboring 2 other universities that allow their students to eat off campus using their ""flex dollars""."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus isn't the best.  Most of the time you'll have to park at the very top of the hill - unless you have early or late classes.  The price for parking is ridiculous considering most of my classes are two days a week... hardly worth $250 per semester!
College Freshman,1,"The parking here is terrible. Teachers have a hard time finding a spot. If you live on campus, there is no possibility of owning a parking apot. My roommate has to drive so many blocks away just to find a place that offers free parking."
College Freshman,1,"1. The school is not diverse AT ALL...
2. The dorms are nice sized, but are very strict
3. Best: Professor involvement, class size, convenience
4. Worst: Food, diversity, extracurricular activities, social activities"
College Sophomore,1,There is not Greek Life on campus. I think that by getting Greek life Carlow would be more of a 'real campus' as well as having students ineract more with each other.
College Sophomore,1,"If I had to do it all again, I would not be attending Carlow. They don't offer anything fun for their student, no activities or events that's interesting."
College Sophomore,1,Carlow is too strict as far as overnight and visiting guest hours are concerned.

Alum,5,"I loved Santa Cruz, the atmosphere was amazing and it felt like home. It was diverse which is what was really important to me. The professors were great and I felt like my education was not wasted there."
Freshman,5,The online experience was very well put together. I felt that it was thought out and well organized. Even though it was online I still learned a lot.
Freshman,5,Santa Cruz is an awesome school! I absolutely love the campus and all of my classes. Best choice I made for sure.
Junior,5,It was a fairly smooth transition for me and my professors were just as effective through zoom as they were in person. Always available for office hours. Really it’s the people you should be worried about either trolling in the chat or zoom-bombers
Alum,5,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Simply put, UCSC is the complete juxtaposition of a city life. Nature life is aplenty and for those who love the beach, a bike ride can get you there in no time! UCSC is beautiful, breathtaking, and the views are spectacular!"
Alum,5,"I never took any online classes because I prefer in-class learning. Nonetheless, I will defer to rating it five-stars because I loved UCSC dearly and can’t imagine it being mediocre."
Alum,5,UC Santa Cruz is an engaging school on a beautiful campus. A walk to class was always a serene walk through the towering trees. The professors were friendly and engaging. I had a wonderful internship that provided me with experience for my career. The Santa Cruz community is beautiful and peaceful.
Alum,5,"Attending UC Santa Cruz was a life-changing experience. I am an avid nature lover and so being amongst the trees while filling my head with valuable knowledge was a dream come true. While some institutional politics were frustrating, they were outweighed by the people I met, the curriculum I learned, and being able to get to know the town more. I was challenged yet encouraged and faced with adversity yet inspired but was always excited to go to lectures and contribute to the learning process."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes. However, my professors were super helpful with providing resources for every student and their office hours were helpful as well."
Alum,5,"This school has a great diversity of students. I love this school because it is very beautiful and also the academic counselor is super helpful. I really enjoyed my four years of college. I live in Los Angeles and being six hours away from my family was one of the most difficult things I had to do but also one of the greatest blessings in my life because it has taught me to be independent, responsible and stronger."
Alum,5,Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable.
Alum,5,"I'm so fortunate I got to attend UCSC, learn so much, and make incredible friendships that have lasted since graduation 6 years ago. The linguistics department is one of the best in the nation, the campus is peaceful and beautiful in an otherworldly way, and the people are down to earth. I wish I could repeat my 4 years here! My only complaint is the lack of diversity, especially among black students. I hope the campus makes an earnest effort to recruit and financially support more students of color in the future!"
Junior,5,"Given the circumstances, I think UC Santa Cruz has done a great job of adjusting to online learning. It would obviously be ideal to be able to return to regular classes, but I'm very aware that everyone is having to make sacrifices right now. Despite missing campus, I've had a successful online learning experience so far because my teachers have put together well organized classes and they have been easy to contact. I am even currently taking an outdoor painting class, and have managed to get great regular feedback from my professor."
Freshman,5,"I haven’t been there physically as i am starting school in the fall as a freshman, but from what I’ve seen they have been very attentive to making sure i have all submitted reports and they have easy access to any questions i have."
Freshman,5,I'm going to be attending this school in the fall and I've heard many good things about it. The campus is only an hour away from the city I live so it is more convenient than other schools.
Niche User,5,This school has an amazing campus. The professors care a lot about the education of their students. The students there care a lot about their education. The area is really nice and there are a lot of activities and clubs to join.
Freshman,5,"This school is great if you like hiking and being in nature. The walk to commute to classes is beautiful and refreshing. I love this school, it's the perfect fit. I highly recommend attending here. The difficulty of academics depends on your major.  I'm a chemistry major and I find the classes to be intense, but doable. I'd say that diversity is average because though there are many transfer students, the population isn't super diverse."
Junior,5,The beach is a good place to read a book. Campus can be a little hectic at times what with 17 students getting arrested during a strike. I suppose it is a bit crazy that admin who own property in the area lobby against rent control but whateva!
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at UCSC right now and I'm loving it here! To me the best part about this place is the campus itself. Ever since day one, I'm in love with the redwoods. Walking around campus has become my favorite thing to do. The quarter system can get a bit hectic, but since you are limited to taking 3-4 classes per quarter that's a relief. Some of the professors are really good, and some not so much. However, there are several TA's and tutors for each class, and all of them have multiple sessions and conduct office hours. That is a great opportunity for students to clarify their doubts. The dorms are pretty cool. The food though not always great is pretty much always decent. For the most part, they atleast have a variety of cuisine. Overall, it's a great college. Very student-friendly!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment and atmosphere Santa Cruz has to offer. When in doubt, take a walk! So refreshing to be in the redwoods while studying."
Sophomore,5,"Very nice to have an accepting environment. Everyone is loving, no hate, but yes protest for what is right."
Sophomore,5,Absolutely amazing! A large college with a small college feel because of the unique residential colleges.
Niche User,5,"I have not attended UC Santa Cruz yet, but it is my first choice University and upon being accepted, it is extremely likely that I attend. From my tour, I saw the absolute beauty of the campus and how much promise it holds for all types of people pursuing unique futures."
Graduate Student,5,A great place to live and experience for people who love nature and are devoted to their field of study. You’ll find the resources you need to succeed here.
Freshman,5,"You could not pick a more scenic and beautiful place to go to college. UCSC makes a large student population feel small. With its 10 college system spread out over a large campus, interspersed with dense redwoods, one does not feel like they are on a 20,000 student campus. On top of its wonderful views, there is always something to do at UCSC. There are countless athletic, interest based, and academic opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"UCSC campus is amazing. I come from the busy city of Los Angeles and there’s always crowds and traffic but in Santa Cruz, it’s nothing but peace and fresh air. I also like how amazing staff is. During my first year I visited many counselors and they all showed interest on me wanting to succeed. They were very helpful. What should change is the housing crisis. The university accepts more students than they can house. Many student are homeless."
Niche User,5,"I visited the college and my friend attends the school. I really hope to get to UC Santa Cruz because of how much fun I had when I visited. I wish to excel in that college of I do get in. Lastly, I hope students who are already in are having a blast at the college. I know my friend loves the location, studies, and environment she is living in. I wish all the students nothing but the best and I really hope I can get in soon.  Santa Cruz is known for their beaches and the college is right next to one which sounds amazing to me. You can stroll around with your friends whenever you are free or alone."
Niche User,5,"Last spring I visited the University of California- Santa Cruz and was able to visit the campus and learn more about the school. I really liked the environment even though it was way different from where I am from. Everyone gets along so well that I felt welcomed when I first got there. I connected well and felt the good vibe of it. Overall, it was a really nice campus where you could be yourself and get judge by people. Also, something that stood out to me was that they have the major I want to study which is biology because I'm really interested in science and want to become a doctor in the future."
Junior,5,Santa Cruz is a friendly campus where students encourage and push each other to strive for greatness. There is always someone willing to lend a helping hand.
Senior,5,This school has a very friendly environment. Very easy to feel welcomed and comfortable. The staff is all very helpful and there are a ton of resources that can help any issue.
Sophomore,5,"I first came to UCSC with no intention of staying. My plan was to be here for 2 years then transfer. However, my love for UCSC grew and continues to grow. There is such a great environment and amazing people here. I genuinely love UCSC!"
Freshman,5,"It is absolutely beautiful up here at Santa Cruz and it is just amazing to be able to wake up and take a nice walk outside. The people and alumni here are very supportive and nice to one another, it makes it feel like Santa Cruz is my second home. It's amazing to be able to connect with your professors and get 1 on 1's with them from time to time to catch up on material or to have an overall nice conversation."
Sophomore,5,"Santa Cruz has a very beautiful campus with overall very kind and cool people. I lived in Stevenson college my first year and I had a really great experience there. It is very close to the gym which was nice and a good stress reliever at the end of the day. All of my classes were relatively close by, with the farthest being a 20 minute walk or 10 min bus ride. There is a really great sense of community in the college that you are affiliated with."
Junior,5,"By far the most unique campus culture and the most beautiful campuses out of all of the UC schools. This campus and its students have a very specific character, people who attend will know exactly what I am talking about. Extremely laid back, most people are extremely kind, understanding, passionate about social issues, and approachable. Santa Cruz cares so much about the state of the world <3"
Junior,5,I like that the student body is very involved in the college through social justice and economic development.
Niche User,5,I like the scenery and the connection that I feel with nature. Being surrounded by all the trees and seeing the sky so close is great. The students are all very nice and welcoming. the campus is overall great.
Alum,5,"I appreciated my time in Santa Cruz. I was there for 4 years and earned 
 my bachelors in History. I came for a town in the San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles area and the entire environment was different for me. There were a lot of redwood trees, a lot of diversity, it was near the ocean, the town was fairly small, the nightlife was okay, and there was a lot to explore with nature. If there was one thing I would change it would be to increase the importance of sports for a more unified university."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming 'frosh' (freshman) at UCSC, what attracted me most was the people and the location. The campus is in the heart of a redwood forest surrounded by beautiful nature and only a few miles from the beach. The people are known to be some of the nicest people and are incredibly open minded and curious and kind. Although I haven't had much experience with professors, but the little that I have had has been great and very helpful and pleasant. It is known to be a research school, so there is a lot of room for personal curiosity and exploration and support."
Freshman,5,"I really like the area that the campus is on. It's all forest and its a beautiful place to live in. It honestly invigorates me and it promotes a space of positivity that you won't be able to find anywhere else. I have had wonderful teachers so far, with the exception of one in particular. Something that I would like to see change is a stricter viewpoint on drug usage. I signed up for a drug-free dorm, and a lot of people smoked anyways. Aside from that, I don't really have any other complaints."
Sophomore,5,UCSC is a wonderful campus full of diversity. The campus is located in a forest separate from the city itself. Being on campus is a separate lifestyle than being downtown or by the beach and there is free bus use going here allowing one to go almost anywhere with a little bit of walking.
Junior,5,"Campus is beautiful, people take some getting used to but ultimately they are all super accepting and nice. Bring a rain jacket. Weather is generally really nice, lots to explore. Teachers care."
Freshman,5,There are a lot of things to do there. It has a pretty bad reputation but i think it has the best undergraduate program out of all the schools in the University of California system.
Sophomore,5,The campus is spectacular and their is no shortage of hiking trails. The faculty I have encountered through class and extra-curricular activities are known for their helpfulness and knowledge in their respective fields.
Freshman,5,"I like almost everything about this school. Some professors are less than satisfactory, however. It feels very safe here and there is always something to do. I was easily able to create a diverse friend group and find people with similar interests due to UCSC's unique housing system."
Niche User,5,I like how the college is surrounded by nature and other cool things. Also another cool thing is that you are allowed to meet a whole new type of people and there is a whole lot of new people.
Niche User,5,The scenery made me feel like home! Everyone that is a student there is so friendly and helpful! The tutor guides here are very open minded and they were so helpful and informative in their guide that it makes me want to apply here !
Senior,5,"Great school to attend, wonderful location but life can be expensive. It is a Bay Area after all. School has great location in redwood forrest, great selection of majors and proximity to everything a student may need."
Junior,5,"Everyone seems friendly. The campus is beautiful as there are deer, turkeys, and many squirrels. The RAs are also kind and always willing to lend a hand. Professors have been good so far. The Coastal Campus is unique and fairly new to UCSC."
Senior,5,The community at UC Santa Cruz is unlike any I have experienced. Professors are very welcoming and want students to succeed. The students at UC Santa Cruz are open minded and open hearted. The campus is gorgeous and provides ample opportunity to breath in fresh air while walking to classes.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus. It was huge and gorgeous and felt like you could be alone and surrounded by people all at once.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and believe it is very diverse. I really enjoy how the campus is full of nature and there are also deer on the campus. I went to visit Santa Cruz with my teachers and other students as a trip which I thought was a really good opportunity.
Sophomore,5,I've loved my experience here so far. I feel like I've learned so much about myself and the people around me. It's a beautiful campus with great academics.
Alum,5,"Santa Cruz was the perfect place for me to develop as an adult and provided me all the opportunities I could ever dream of. Not only did I receive an excellent education, but also learned about life and learning in general."
Junior,5,"This university is in an amazing location, half in the redwoods and half with ocean views. I feel blessed everyday walking in between classes. Their public bus transportation to and from the university is prompt and sufficient. The professors are extremely nice and are willing to help you succeed as a student and future professional. The school offers many outdoor and recreational activities, as well as support groups for diverse communities. Inclusion and diversity are the main goals within UCSC and I can’t think of a better educational system that can say as much."
Graduate Student,5,"I earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from UC Santa Cruz this last summer, and now I am in the computer engineering masters program. I think that many people don't hold UCSC in very high regard, but I think that will change very soon as the university has been getting serious about boosting all of its academic programs in recent years.  I think that our engineering programs/courses are all excellent hands on learning experiences with real world applications. The campus is also beautiful; it sits in the middle of a redwood forest with plenty of hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking opportunities, and it is a 10 minute drive away from some of the best surfing spots in the world."
Sophomore,5,"So far, UCSC has been an amazing experience. It’s not a city college but more so a natural experience as it is enveloped my nature. With so many professors loving their subject, each class welcomes new students into joining the rigorous curriculum set by the administrators. All in all, every student and faculty in UCSC is welcoming and friendly towards each individual."
Niche User,5,The thing I found interesting about this university is that its located in a very beautiful place. I think that this is a very nice campus I would love to be there I like these type of places where it looks so scary but it really is not and am really in love with the campus . I would not change anything about this campus because its really beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"UC Santa Cruz has provided me with a beautiful, inspiring, and welcoming place to learn. The campus and surrounding city has so much to offer in terms of educational opportunities, outreach, clubs, and hobbies and activities."
Senior,5,"This is the place where I've done most of my growing up. I can't believe it's almost over. Honestly, to find yourself, and if you're a nature fanatic, getting lost in the trees isn't such a bad place to find yourself."
Sophomore,5,"UC Santa Cruz was very welcoming to me when I first arrived. The faculty's accommodation to my needs helped me make a decision on what I wanted to study. The campus itself is also very beautiful, with hills that keep going on and on- makes you a bit stronger as well. I am very excited to continue the last three years of higher education at this institution."
Freshman,4,"With online learning, professors utilize online platforms such as Zoom and Canvas to communicate and teach students. Both professors and students are especially welcoming and accommodating to new students."
Freshman,4,"As a liberal school, UC Santa Cruz creates a very friendly atmosphere and the student body is accepting regardless of a student's personal background. Though school buildings are somewhat far apart, the campus nature makes a very scenic view wherever you go. However, it is rather difficult to go through UC Santa Cruz without getting tied up in political views and occasional protests from what I've heard."
Freshman,4,My experience was virtual but overall it was very exciting and thrilling. This is my first year and all the professors and faculty helped me find the best opportunities for myself. I just wish that it wasn't virtual so that I can truly experience the campus life.
Freshman,4,Through my online experience I think it was a well thought out experience because it helped me realize that I need to take things more into consideration and use the time that I have to enrich my academics. My professors and faculty helped me along the way and were very understanding as well when i had many struggles. Also I was able to meet wonderful people who supported me along my frosh year and summer school made me become friends with people along the way.
Junior,4,"So far everything has been very top-notch when it comes to the transition of online learning. I put 4 stars because of the neglect to lower tuition, but I understand why this is not an easy option for the budget committee."
Junior,4,"Overall the school is great. The staff is very helpful and the atmosphere is unparalleled. However, I have little frame of reference. One thing that I believe could improve the school as a whole is a more organized approach to many of the formalities and processes that students have to go through in order to get something done on campus."
Freshman,4,"I came to enjoy my experience at UC Santa Cruz through the people I have met and become close friends with. In addition, the campus is beautiful and has a strong sense of unity within the environment in and around the campus."
Senior,4,"UCSC is a university of exploration, curiosity, and experience. The ten colleges dispersed throughout the campus have personalities of their own and incoming freshman and current students will have classes in these different colleges. Learning is an abundance at this university."
Sophomore,4,The campus is magical and beautiful. Great air quality because of all the trees. Lacks large school organized events though!
Sophomore,4,The professors are super kind and considerate! Really wants what's best for its students! A good place to grow without a cutthroat academic environment.
Alum,4,I liked UCSC most for the environment. I loved going to campus in the middle of the forest and I felt that students weren't as competitive and more focused on helping one another.
Alum,4,"Beautiful campus, amazing professors, but there is propensity for students to get lost in huge classes."
Alum,4,"I did not personally take any classes online, however with the organization of most professors I would assume that online courses would be manageable and as engaging as possible."
Senior,4,"UC Santa Cruz is definitely not given the credit it deserves. For starters, the campus is absolutely beautiful, there is no other campus like it. My particular departments are very well organized and I enjoy all of my classes. I think that the school needs to work on its diversity issue, as it can still improve. The professors are extremely nice and approachable; the housing situation is definitely needing the most improvement. There are plenty of areas to explore and have fun in town and lots of places to connect with other students. Overall, I do love my campus and my experiences here."
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes at UCSC but if I were to rate the portals and the online resources that were required or available for students to use, I would rate it 4 stars. Professors used online assets quite well and there was continuity between different classes and subjects."
Freshman,4,It is a great experience because the professors make the necessary adjustments to the curriculum to make it applicable to online learning. Quizzes and tests are not made difficult.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed pursuing my degree at UC Santa Cruz. It is a great campus, with many facilities and research opportunities."
Sophomore,4,My professors have made the best of the situation that has caused remote learning to be the primary mode of education. I have found the departments to be flexible in adapting their courses to ensure a positive experience for all.
Sophomore,4,I would say the school is nice. The scenery is great and the people there have their own groups and are willing to befriend you. You'll definitely get to enjoy the different colleges on-campus and the view of the beach. It has one of the highest ranked locations in the United States. The research here is amazing too. The Christian scene is pretty nice too.
Sophomore,4,I would say that because of the whole entire covid situation the online experience was not bad at all. I felt like the teachers understood that it was a first for everyone so they were very lenient.
Junior,4,"I have greatly enjoyed my classes in both economics and art, which have been more than beneficial. I've grown so much during my time at UC Santa Cruz, which has been helped along by kind and caring faculty and a well-designed enrollment system. It's undoubtedly a beautiful campus, and I have made lots of friends who I know I will have in my life forever. The only thing I wish UCSC had was a football team, or at least another sport that everyone would pay attention to. I believe having a shared team to root for is a great way to bond an entire community. Besides that, I love UCSC and Santa Cruz."
Junior,4,"I have taken several classes online, even before the virus, and for the most part the transition to online has been great. I believe most classes are taught well and most clubs are very inclusive, especially when new members are involved. I have made very good friends whom I hope to keep in touch with even after college."
Junior,4,"I have taken several classes online, even before the virus, and for the most part the transition to online has been great. My clubs have started meeting online as well and I find them to be very supportive."
Alum,4,Beautiful Campus and great people to meet. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 was because there could have been better options for food at the dining halls.
Junior,4,"The school is beautiful, classes are great, dorms are nice but some could use an update. The gym can be small and crowded. Overall, I've had a nice experience and have really liked my classes."
Alum,4,I loved living in the forest and the community of scholars who genuinely cared about each other's well-being. Affordability of housing and the cost of rent was really difficult and lack of support from the University for continuing students (post freshman year) was really frustrating.
Freshman,4,"Santa Cruz is a very fun campus.  The downtown area is kinda small, but it's got most of what you need.  The campus itself is beautiful.  If you want to find illegal stuff, you can, but if you want to stay away from that, it's not hard."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful, very kind people . However, living on campus can be a bit isolating as the separation from on and off campus is pretty wide. I was a part of Stevenson college which I really enjoyed their core program. The engineering department is improving but all engineering majors (except Electrical Engineering) are not ABET accredited."
Freshman,4,I love UCSC for the environment and the people. Classes are good depending on professors. Food is what you would find in an average dining hall and it's nice you are able to use any dining hall on campus.
Junior,4,"UC Santa Cruz has a very ""towny"" feel to it. So if you're looking for a campus town feel then UCSC is a great fit for you!"
Freshman,4,"UCSC is an epicenter for social empowerment and environmental awareness which I deeply appreciate. The education is very applicable and I would consider it to be high quality. I would like to see change in the school's treatment of graduate students, TA's, and part time lecturers because of the un-excusable decreases in pay."
Niche User,4,I visited this university two years ago with my family for my uncle’s orientation. I toured around the campus and met a few professors. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the students were all so kind to us. It is the perfect school for someone who loves being outdoors.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed pretty much being in nature while living on campus. Going for Walks/Hikes was as easy as walking a min from my Dorm and Apt. 
I liked the culture of acceptance at the place although at times it was taken in a direction that I personally don't agree with. However, pretty much every professor was great, the math department has some amazing Lectures and Professors and I am happy I was able to learn from them"
Junior,4,"Wasn't my first choice but it started to grow on me after my first year. The campus was what really made it enjoyable for me. Living in a forest is a crazy experience coming from LA. However, I do think there is plenty of room for improvement, especially the housing. Do your research before coming here and don't do it on a whim."
Freshman,4,loved it. Great school if you like being in nature. Nice people. Great professors can guide you in picking a major.
Sophomore,4,"My arrival at the University of California, Santa Cruz has been very interesting I meet interesting and fascinating people. The professors and student faculty encourages you to do your vary best in class and there if you need any help."
Freshman,4,"The accessibility on this campus is very poor, however it is easy to receive accommodations. The websites required to gain information on the school are very complicated and hard to navigate, they should definitely be changed. So far the academics are good and it is easy to get involved in extracurriculars."
Sophomore,4,"Like it is for most freshman, it was hard to adapt to the college life and it was a super difficult first year at UCSC. Now as a sophomore, I’m really enjoying UCSC so much more. I’ve learned to appreciate the nature, make more friends, make the most of my education and my resources so that I can continue my enjoyment at this university. I’m always excited to go back to school so, that’s a really good sign! UCSC has been very good to me, and I’m really happy there :)"
Senior,4,"The location of the campus is absolutely beautiful. The beach and the forest environment provides a lot of fun activities to hang out with college friends and provides a refreshing atmosphere. One thing I'd like to change is the housing crisis going on at UCSC, there's too little housing for the amount of students accepted yearly, causing many students to become homeless."
Freshman,4,"I personally really liked this school. The campus is beautiful, situated in a redwood forest, with many many very cool people. The party scene isn't too big but this makes the college have much more of a chill lowkey vibe. Also do not go to this school if you don't like walking because the campus is large. There are buses but they are mostly filled with upperclassmen trying to get on campus from downtown."
Sophomore,4,I love the positive atmosphere here at UCSC. The calming forest environment is so helpful with the stress that comes with classes and studying.  UCSC could definitely use more academic materials in its study spaces and libraries though!
Niche User,4,Some of my friends and I got sick from some of the food from Crown college once so I guess the food could be better.
Sophomore,4,"I met some great people, got out of my comfort zone and feel like 
I learn something new every day. I have learned to use new social skills I didn't think I needed to work on before."
Senior,4,"As a transfer student at UC Santa Cruz, the transition was pretty easy. Orientation made me feel very comfortable as a student that would be living on campus. Living on campus made my first year here very easy in adjusting to school and social life. Professors are definitely passionate about what they teach. TA's go above and beyond in helping you succeed. Something I would like to see change is more school spirt. Students being proud of UC Santa Cruz."
Niche User,4,"Gorgeous campus! A great place to be, especially once you've joined a campus group and have honed in on your major."
Junior,4,"University of Santa Cruz, California is a stunning campus. Located on a mountain overlooking the Pacific ocean, the campus is nestled into a redwood forest, along with various other ecologies. The student body seems relatively happy as we are deeply engrossed in nature. We have several vistas that look out to the massive Monterey bay. Many students engage in surfing, biking, hiking, and other fun activities during their free time."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the University of California Santa Cruz has been a rollercoaster. I am a first-generation college student from a low-income single-parent household and I felt completely alone in my first year at UCSC. The questions, comments, and concerns of mine where all different from my peers. It wasn't until I was linked up with certain resources around campus did I start to feel like I belonged. The trick for any University is finding and reaching out to resources some people do, others don't. Those that do have an advantage leading them to the support they need at a research University."
Freshman,4,"The campus at University of California, Santa Cruz is very beautiful. It is full of bus routes both throughout campus and in town around campus. Students are able to walk or bike to classes and are offered a large variety of classes for many different majors."
Senior,4,"First and foremost is how beautiful the campus is. When I first moved on campus I was overwhelmed but I was able to accomodate fast. The weather is fresh all the time and you are able to get in exercise since you have the option to walk anywhere on campus. I never felt like I was unable to walk alone on campus- I always felt safe. Everyone on campus is extremely helpful and welcoming too. The professors have always cared about the students understanding of lectures/topics discussed in class. As for the nightlife, there is not much to do. The area itself is more for outdoors type of people. There are many trails to hike and the beach is only about 5 minutes away from campus (this was my favorite part of Santa Cruz)- the convenience of being able to catch a bus and be in town/beach shortly after you hop on the bus. UCSC has been great and I am excited to go back Fall 2019."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and the teachers are very good. However, I wish the counselors were more helpful because it was hard to figure out which classes I needed to take for my major."
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the history of alternative & radical viewpoints is an important facet of the campus culture."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, a really great atmosphere! Everyone there is eager to learn, make new experiences, and create lasting friendships. School can be challenging and some professors are difficult in comparison to others, but this campus provides you with so much outside help like MSI, LSS, etc, (a bunch of tutoring). My first year was great!"
Alum,4,Liberal education with reviews and grading options available to students. Campus life is diverse and the campus itself is gorgeous.
Freshman,4,"UC Santa Cruz is not like other college campuses- from the moment that you see those towering pine trees, you know that you've found something special. Often times, it felt more like I was at summer camp than at college and being enveloped in those trees makes you forget that you go to school with nearly 20,000 other people. As for the atmosphere, students and faculty are very calm and uncompetitive, while still providing an excellent education."
Senior,4,"UC Santa Cruz has a great campus, views of the ocean and a nice location. Parking is hard to find, especially as a freshman or sophomore because parking permits are difficult to obtain. Great courses and majors offered. Check out the Human Genome Project !!"
Junior,4,"Love the environment of the campus but sometimes feels outdated in terms of structures. The professors can be hit or miss, but I've had a few really great classes. Not a ton of new things to do in Santa Cruz so it can be hard to keep it interesting on the weekends."
Junior,4,"The campus is quite literally in a forest, which makes for many fantastic hills, lawns, and groves to study and relax under. The climate is amazing and nearly always between 50 and 80 degrees during the school year. Santa Cruz itself is grimy in places, but still right on the Pacific coast and surrounded by beautiful beaches and forests.
Housing is in short supply both on and off campus. Don't be surprised to share a 100 sqft dorm room with two other people and pay a lot of money for it. Good parties are few and far between, and we have limited funding for sports (there's a reason our meme page is called UCSC football).
Class quality ranges depending on your major. Many STEM majors will encounter large or online classes and limited enrollment for necessary courses. Many good learning resources are made available for students.
There are a plethora of research opportunities here, but be warned you will not benefit from them unless you look for those opportunities yourself."
Sophomore,4,"The one thing I love the most about UCSC is it's beautiful campus. Being completely surrounded by nature and seeing wildlife, such as deer and turkey, really helps calm your mind after a long day."
Sophomore,4,"The school has so many resources to help students plan for their time at UCSC as well as after college and for their careers. The staff is very easy to talk to and very approachable. For the most part, the professors are understanding and want their students to succeed and provide their students with all the help they can get to help them."
Freshman,4,"My freshman year just ended and  I can say that the lecturers I've had so far have been invested and truly passionate about their area of study which made my learning experience that much more enjoyable. Of course, it depended on the level of effort I put in myself. Another great thing is the campus, it is truly beautiful. However, this is also an issue sometimes since it can be an intimidating undertaking to traverse the campus late at night after a long study session at the library."
Alum,2,"I have taken two classes online. Personally, I wasn't too much of a fan of it because it was easier to get distracted."
Junior,2,"Academics are good I mean it’s a college, it has to be decent. Socially you gotta be outgoing otherwise you won’t make any friends. Super clique-y here. Personally that affected me so much that I’ve been looking to transfer to somewhere closer to home. Otherwise academics are solid."
Alum,2,"As an educational facility, this school is phenomenal for research-orientated students. However, students who desire to pursue careers in the health industry would struggle to find the necessary prerequisite courses for post-grad health programs. I think the school administration does very little in order to recognize and allocate to the student's needs on and off the campus. The housing situation is extremely difficult and they are unable to continue housing for students after their first year. The administration continues to admit more students than they can house and there is a housing crisis for the upperclassmen or graduate students. Despite all the protests, the school administration does not seem to listen or attempt to accommodate the student's needs. Other than that, the student atmosphere and culture is the most significant factor I value till this day. Everyone is extremely helpful and supportive of each other."
Graduate Student,2,"If you're planning to major in STEM be aware that none of their departments cares about the student's success nor making professors liable for mistakes that affect your grades. The reason for this is that they rather have people fail in courses and change majors to get more money from you.  Also, over the last years, they have been oversaturating entry-level STEM courses that are needed to declare your major and take upper-division courses. Yet they have done nothing to improve this situation and ensure that you can enroll in them or finish in 4 years since they make more money by making you stay longer. If you have other UC or other options take them before considering UCSC."
Sophomore,2,"The school just wants your cash, they slap you with fees for just about anything from losing your keys to parking permits they will find any reason to get your money. Professors genuinely want you to pass their classes they don't try to deliberately fail you its just really hard to teach everything in less than 3 months. Some professors are just boring, however if they would establish basic definitions before just jumping into lecture then more students would likely be successful. Quarter system is awful, moves too fast for students to keep up."
Junior,2,"The food on campus is terrible and over priced especially the meal plans. The meal plans are a joke. Parking is horrible and over priced. Student life is boring. The classrooms and libraries are really dirty and there is never enough space or seating. There is no AC in the building. The only good thing is the nature. I love the trees, deer, and turkeys."
Niche User,2,"As you can expect from any  US college, professors want to instill their liberal ideology on you. The food is what you can expect from any college meal plan, except maybe the CIA, but that’s a cooking school. The housing programs aren’t much better. Everyone is really nice and all, so that’s a good. If you don’t get a dorm in x amount of time, you better find a nice park bench. With other great UC schools, like Berkeley and LA, don’t waste your time and money here"
Niche User,2,"University of California Santa Cruz is a second rate university with high administration costs per student, poor housing, subrate dining halls, terrible sports teams, 200+ student classroom sizes, and professors constantly more focused on their research rather than teaching classes even during office hours. Some departments display poor leadership and inconsistencies. For a liberal campus, the administration, especially Housing Discipline, will sweep sexual assault under the rug and resort to blaming the accuser rather than conduct an internal investigation. Do not go to this school. You're better off going to a CC and transferring to a university that cares about their students enough to have a competent administration for the outrageous tuition that they charge."
Senior,2,Not worth the cost of attendance. Psychology department very disappointing. Hard to make friends or connect with other students.
Senior,2,"If Had I known how much of a joke this college is before I decided to go I would not have gone. The college advisors are incompetent and the major advisors are not much help. There isn't anything to the city of Santa Cruz except tourist attractions, yes the beach is nice, but the trash, needles, and homeless crisis (that the city isn't addressing) detracts from the beauty.  IF YOU GET ACCEPTED INTO ANY OTHER SCHOOL, GO THERE."
Junior,2,"Very liberal drug filled environment. Despite the level of promise I showed with various staff, I was not helped or encouraged to be more involved on the campus. I will attempt to try again, partiularly because I have a strong academic background."
College Sophomore,2,We have some of the worst UC greek life
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life is very small at UCSC. There are only a couple fraternities and sororities and not too many people are a part of them. If I am not mistaken, one of the fraternities got shut down for something they did at one of the parties they threw, and one fraternity at a school that doesn't have many is already a large percentage, so fraternities are even less popular, to the point where they are almost unheard of. People don't really pay attention to them too much since they do not play a big role on campus. I believe there is at least one building for sororities and one for fraternities, possibly more, I just happen to be one of many who are uninformed on the topic."
College Freshman,2,"This year the school was actually thinking of removing all competitive sports simply for lack of involvement. It ended up getting voted not to do so meaning that there e are some people out there who care, but for the most part, people either don't do sports at all or they participate in intramural sports or clubs. Most of the varsity teams are not very competitive and the school spirit for sports in general is very weak. The only good competitive team UCSC has is for tennis.The facilities the campus has are not too bad but most other colleges have bigger and better ones."
College Student,2,We don't have many sports.
College Sophomore,2,The rooms are a bit small and they are expensive
College Senior,2,"Hippies everywhere! Public service announcement: if you need to be on psychedelics or smoke weed to have a better appreciation for the nature around you, you're doing something wrong! Nature is beautiful sober."
College Senior,2,"I feel as though I haven't learned all that much, and am not ready to go out into the world. My classes keep me so busy, since we only have 10 weeks to learn all of the information, while other schools on semester system get an extra month or two to learn the same things. I've never had time to actually look for an internship...I was in a research lab for an entire year, but in the end my mentor told me she couldn't write me a letter of recommendation for graduate school, so I did all that work for no money, no course credit, and no letter. It's like it didn't even happen."
College Senior,2,"All funding is being cut to our athletics, which are mostly self-funded to begin with."
Recent Alumnus,2,The housing system here at UCSC is pretty bad. It definitely doesn't help that they keep trying to pump in more and more freshmen each year.
College Sophomore,2,"UC Santa Cruz has an athletics facility for many sports and different athletics, although most of it is subpar. The gym is small and I usually only go in the early morning because otherwise there are lines for most machines because of lack of equipment and space. The field is beautiful and overlooks all of Santa Cruz. Overall, there are a variety of equipment, although, there needs to be more of it and also more space."
College Junior,2,I am not an athlete and don't have an interest in our sports teams
College Sophomore,2,"Bullard High has a very noticeable socioeconomic divide between students, which often times results in alienation of students from lower socioeconomic classes. Often times participation in events is outrageously expensive, adding to the feeling that the administration only cares about the rich white kids."
College Senior,2,There are hardly any lights in areas that are dangerous for anyone to be walking alone . We do not have many of the emergency push buttons around campus either.
College Senior,2,"We do not have a strong sense of pride when it comes to sports since we are not a school that is known for sports. Inter-murals are played but again, not widely attended."
College Sophomore,2,The athletic department is at risk of being cut.
College Freshman,2,"No varsity, no junior varsity. Only club and intramural. It kinda sucks."
College Freshman,2,"They might cut the funding for it so the NCAA teams would be gone, however there are a variety of intramurals and club sports that are available and are fun to be in."
College Sophomore,2,"They still have it and I do know quite a few people who participate in it (I'm in Stevenson). However, if you want to attend a school where greek life is prevalent, this is not the one."
College Sophomore,2,No one wants to support it because most people that choose to come here do not care about athletics. It is a struggle every year when voting season comes around and the athletes try to convince the student body to vote to save athletics-- it just isn't on the minds of the majority of the campus.
College Junior,2,Sports is not big at all on this campus
College Junior,2,"No sports are really available at the school, just get a surfboard"
College Junior,2,"There arent alot of frats or soroities to choose from, they dont market themselves very well, most of them dont have houses, and the few that do are like 3 miles away from campus and arent marked in any way."
College Freshman,2,Our athletic facilities are relatively small. The gym is always crowded and we don't have a football team.
College Senior,2,"Sexual assault is a long swept under the rug issue that is perpetuated by normative attitude that is only be addressed by an online, not in person, program. This needs to be discussed in person, in class rooms."
College Senior,2,"Not enough for number of students, unaffordable for most, myself included"
College Sophomore,2,People participate in the sports and clubs but majority are in division 3. Sports aren't taken seriously from what I have experienced.
College Junior,2,"Greek life, at UC Santa Cruz or anywhere else, has its positives and negatives. To name a few negatives, green organizations perpetuate systems of hierarchy. I dislike the cliquey nature that Greek organizations practice, whether it is a Latin or white sorority/fraternity."
College Junior,2,"I am an active student activist, organizer, artist and researcher. As a woman of color, I have found some of the UC Santa Cruz's staff very hostile. For example, I was shocked after I figured out (first-hand experience) the bureaucracy that exists in the dining halls, particularly with the head staff (like managers, and supervisors). Moreover, the school takes pride in teaching the areas of Feminist Studies, Community Studies, Environmental Studies (to name a few) where professors do not really deconstruct eurocentrism. Students end up reading white literature, which itself is an oppresive practice because it silences and invisibilizes the experiences of others."
College Senior,2,I really wished we had more of an athletics department presence on our campus. I feel like it would really improve school spirit & help students become more apart of the campus community.
College Senior,2,"No football, and very few good sports. I'm a senior and have never attended anything sports-related. No school spirit."
Recent Alumnus,2,We don't have big sports teams or events to bring the school together.
College Junior,2,School literally have no varsity team besides volleyball. School needs more encouragement toward sports
College Junior,2,Our mascot is a banana slug and we don't have a football team.
College Freshman,2,There is no type of athletic support from the students. Sports are not a huge part of campus life.
College Sophomore,2,The only comfort is knowing it only gets worse in the career market
College Junior,2,Very little quality ethnic cuisine. All bad American food.
College Junior,2,"Focus too much on student's having fun, not enough on important issues."
College Junior,2,I have not been able to receive any significant financial aid from the university/ government.
College Junior,2,The main problem is the horrible selection process and the ridiculous pricing.
College Freshman,2,Parties are basically not a thing unless you go off campus
College Sophomore,2,Scholarship is less than $900 for an entire year for freshman GPA over 3.85.  It's so little.
College Sophomore,2,Food was not well made.  The chefs don't even try after the parents are gone.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Our school has NO spirit whatsoever, it's sad."
Recent Alumnus,2,Finding affordable housing around the city of Santa Cruz is extremely hard! It's almost impossible at times. I know of friends who had to couch surf for a couple of months. I wish it could be more affordable especially for first-generation students.
College Freshman,2,Admin just focuses on the wrong things. Definitely pay attention to the news about the admin of the UC school system if any of the UC schools interest you.
College Freshman,2,These people don't enforce anything
College Freshman,2,"It's okay for the first couple of weeks as a freshman because you're excited about everything, including the fact that you get to choose what you eat. After a while, you stop looking through those rose-colored glasses and realize that the lettuce is limp, the main entrees too greasy, and even the desert makes your stomach roil instead of make your mouth salivate. By continuing to serve the same type of food, it makes me want to eat there less and less."
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus dining variety is horrible. There's an endless repetition of the same kind of foods. There's a surplus of sandwich, pizza, and coffee shops which serve almost the same kind of menu. It lacks ethnic food options and even fast food options. There's little to no student discounts and the cost of things can be pretty pricey if you're not eating fast food."
Recent Alumnus,2,Let's just say I got housing probation within my first month there...
Freshman,1,"Stay away from this school at all costs. I repeat, stay away. Terrible administration, overpopulation, housing crisis, constant class disruptions with strikes and protests, everyone is reclusive, boring, or a party freak, and the lectures are useless. CS major? Good luck getting into any of your classes. This school is not designed for 19,000+ people, everywhere you go it's crowded. The people here either never come out, have zero personality, or only care about partying. The professors here are terrible. People have trouble finding housing here and in the city itself, the management literally admits to sitting around all day and doing jack about the numerous issues. Overall, I regret wasting my first year here, hope to transfer."
Alum,1,"Do not go here if you want a social justice focus in your graduate education program. POC you will not receive support. They do not walk their talk. If you don't care about social justice, this is an average program, but don't be fooled by their rhetoric: they are hypocrites who use social justice to recruit people and then unapologetically don't follow through."
Senior,1,"They don’t have negative stars. Don’t come here. It’s a bad school. Please just go to a state school, you’ll be much happier I promise you. Just because it’s a UC, it’s not comparable to Berkeley or LA, don’t fool yourself. It’s a waste of money and you’ll hate it."
Senior,1,I love the school but the financial aid office is killing us. They never pick up the phone.  It is impossible to reach to a person and the website aid section often contains mistakes (happened all 4 years) and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you are out of state pick another school because unless you are within driving distance of the aid office you will never be able to make this work.  The only way to resolve all the problems are to show up to aid office in person every year often multiple times (parent and student)...this is impossible to do if you are not in the 95003 zip code. Students say they are understaffed and that is probably why they don't pick up the phone.
Alum,1,UC Santa Cruz is a joke.  I had better teachers in High School!!  Campus life is a terrible but the town of Santa Cruz is ok if you are a surfer. The universities' mascot is a banana slug.. 'nuf said.
College Senior,1,The athletic scene at UCSC is nearly non-existent unless you consider the casual games of volleyball or throwing a Frisbee across the Porter quad.
College Sophomore,1,My school has a very small athletic department. We don't have a gym for the basketball teams to have games in on campus so they would play in downtown. Barely any students go to games to support the team because we don't have that much school spirit not involvement in the athletics.
College Senior,1,"Honestly the school pretends that they care, but they start blaming the victim for what happened to them"
College Senior,1,I think it has a pretty negative impact on incoming freshmen and some poor choices they fall into. Its a disadvantage with test banks to students who aren't hard working but stand on the shoulders of those before them. It also causes the town to have a negative view of students due to their community disruption and pollution.
College Freshman,1,Athleticism here is terrible given that we don't even have a football team.
College Freshman,1,I really couldn't even tell there were sports teams......
College Junior,1,"I barely get enough financial aid. Im only able to attend because of loans and the middle class scholarship. Its terrible. Every quarter I have to wait a month after everyone else has gotten their financial aid, and something always go wrong. Absolute disaster."
College Freshman,1,"We don't hear about them, which is great. No one likes them unless they know someone in them."
College Freshman,1,Lol we literally don't care about sports at all. It's great.
College Freshman,1,"We don't really have any sports teams, expect for water polo and basketball which are not too popular."
College Sophomore,1,I did not receive any financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,1,I only got $7k during my whole time there (3 years and a quarter) and had to pay everything else out of pocket.
College Sophomore,1,You will have to do most everything by yourself!! The professors are doing their best but classes are huge
College Sophomore,1,People here are not very attractive.. If you take pride in your appearance you are in the minority
College Sophomore,1,"Outside of working in an on-campus lab, there's very little that the school has to offer. You very much get the feeling that you are isolated. It's not a particularly sought after place for job recruiters, nor do I think employers will think much of it."
College Sophomore,1,"Technology is definitely not a focus here at UCSC. The Wi-Fi is hit and miss almost everywhere on campus, and the professors integration of technology is behind the curve"
College Sophomore,1,Truly disgusting! Literally nothing is good. Every day you hope that it won't be AS bad but you know full well that it is not going to be good. By far some of the worst food I've ever had in my life
College Freshman,1,i was unable to obtain any financial aid
College Freshman,1,Quite hours are constantly being violated and no one respects them
College Junior,1,so many students did not find housing this year due to construction on campus
College Senior,1,Food sucks in Santa Cruz
College Senior,1,This campus needs more life
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Housing is the worst. It is unclean, and still under construction. The RAs don't do their job well and to get housing was such a hassle. They accepted too many freshmen leaving the sophomores to look for places off campus at the last minute. I know homeless students because of the bad job done at campus housing."
College Junior,1,"We're the Banana Slugs, there isn't a whole lot of team spirit surrounding our school mascot thats for sure. And sports, ones like college football or even basket ball aren't huge. I heard we have a rugby team though."
College Junior,1,Don't have a family/ be older.
College Junior,1,"A frat guy went to the hospital to get his stomach pumped from all of the alcohol that his frat made him consume, yet none of his 'brothers' accompanied him. He was alone at the hospital. Then a girl from a different sorority defended the frat because she didn't want it to get reported because it would 'make all greek life look bad'...... yet she hasn't done one single thing in her sorority besides drink."
College Senior,1,It's not that the Greek life is bad its that it is almost nonexistent.
College Junior,1,"Not the best, in my opinion."
College Junior,1,"I avoid going downtown, not a fan of the environment."
College Junior,1,I really find it unappealing.
College Senior,1,"Cheaper than on campus, but still stupidly expensive. I hate it but I have to do it."
College Sophomore,1,its bad if you have no money
College Sophomore,1,"none because my single mother works 3 jobs and my older brother is at another UC and we just can't get any aid due to how hard we work, but maybe if my mom just slacked off we could have."
College Sophomore,1,I'm transferring to a different school for business.
College Junior,1,VERY expensive and hard to find !
College Junior,1,Minority students are not taking care of. Luckily we have individual resource centers. We need more Ethnic spaces on campus
College Sophomore,1,4-20 is too popular at this campus
College Freshman,1,"The school does absolutely nothing to support the sports teams. All of our teams are D-III teams, and most of them aren't even good by D-III standards. They already downgraded some teams from D-III to club, and they might downgrade the rest in a few years. Because of all this, no one watches our sports teams. Many students on campus complain about the lack of fun games to go to, but the university seems uninterested in prioritizing athletics at all.

The gym facilities are generally not that crowded and are good enough, and they're free for students."
College Junior,1,"Santa Cruz has no big teams, and the school does not care for sports."
College Junior,1,There is hardly any school spirit here at UCSC. I myself have never been to a sports event and neither have any peers that I know. I'm not even sure how our team performances are.
College Freshman,1,"No one cares about Greek life until they start raping people. Yes, this happens more often than it should. I mostly steer clear of Greek parties, but they can be fun as long as they don't get too out of hand. The sorority girls are just obnoxious. No one here really takes Greek life seriously."
College Freshman,1,They dismiss complicated physical health problems and try to send you to the mental health center instead of helping you. 
College Freshman,1,Freshmen and sophomores are not allowed cars at all. 
College Freshman,1,"I don't smoke, but I don't have anything against people who do. I rated the campus badly for drug safety, because if there is an effort to not have students take drugs, they are doing a horrible job. Again this is totally up to you, you want to smoke (you probaby won't ever be caught…Ever) you don't want to smoke, don't. Pretty simple. "
College Sophomore,1,Things need to get a lot better with the parking 
College Sophomore,1,i think the school would be so much better if there would be more athletics offered at the school 
Recent Alumnus,1,UCSC doesn't really do sports. I mean... our mascot is the slugs. Slugs are not athletic. 
College Junior,1,Limited parking only available to upperclassmen.  
College Junior,1,Everyone just seems to accept the fact that students will party.
College Junior,1,Very liberal and atheist and not accepting of others.
College Junior,1,There isn't even a football team. No one really cares about sports.
College Junior,1,No one has spoken to me about internship opportunities. 
College Sophomore,1,"It is not possible to get a parking permit as a freshman or sophomore. Even when you are able to get one, the prices are outrageous and students are only able to park in lots that are far from classrooms."
College Junior,1,"Although the UCSC campus is generally safe, we have recently had some unpleasant occurrences.  A young woman was raped on campus during the day while visiting the school a few months ago and there was a shooting downtown last week.  During the same week that the rape happened there was an armed robbery nearby campus and a non-related shooting.  The UCSC campus has a lot of safety assurances such as campus police and procedures for admitting non-students onto campus but the town of Santa Cruz itself is not the safest place to live."
College Sophomore,1,"First of all both freshman and sophomores are not given any parking permits. If you are considering to have a car then you will have to rely on off campus alternatives. If you live off campus as a freshman or sophomore, then you are allowed to purchase a parking permit, but these are quite expensive. Weekends are the only time you are allowed to park your vehicle in campus, other than that parking is almost impossible. Temporary parking gives you a very limited time at a high price and is always packed."

Freshman,5,Morgan has great culture and you are able to be yourself at campus. The campus is extremely big and everyone there is willing to help out if you are confused.
Senior,5,My overall experience at Morgan State has been fulfilling and allowed to grown into a professional engineer and man.
Niche User,5,I have been in communication with Morgan State University for quite some time now and what they have been able to provide has been great. For those people looking to go to Morgan they should heavily consider because they really do help guide you in the process of applying to the college and they have no issue in contacting you if need be. I am very excited to apply to Morgan this year and I think anyone considering should do so as well.
Senior,5,"My online courses were self driven, meaning, I was responsible for making the best out of my learning experience. Luckily, the instructors were generous enough to record the sessions and provide detailed notes through it all."
Senior,5,"Great! Striving environment, where the staff and faculty accept you as family, making your learning experience greater. The opportunity to become dependent and ambitious, made my experience challenging, but without challenges, there would be no growth. The university offers ample opportunities for career and professional development, making students aware that there is opportunities through companies, entrepreneurship and investing."
Sophomore,5,Due to covid we were switched to online and at first it was very hard but with the help from our president and our teachers and faculty they made sure everything was okay.
Sophomore,5,I really love Morgan State. It is a very organized school they make sure no student is left in any way shape or form. The professors at the school were very professional and made sure their students were successful.
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Morgan, the mascot, the clothes, homecoming, games, food, on campus parties. EVERYTHING!"
Freshman,5,"professors make it a little more easier to learn and find answers, they are understanding of the current struggle if you're working a lot."
Sophomore,5,its a great school the buildings are beautiful their is so much love at this university go bears!!!!!
Sophomore,5,Nothing needs to change its perfect I love this school and never want to transfer go bears!!!!!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,"Professors are understanding of the huge change and know it is taking some students longer than others to adapt. Although online does not compare to the in-person experience, Morgan has done a good job of trying to accommodate and assist as many students as possible."
Sophomore,5,"Up to now, I have had an amazing experience with Morgan State University. I loved everything about the school except for their infestation issues and food issues. A lot of the food would be bad unless they were having visitors then they would try to spice it up with chicken wings. The learning experience was good the teachers I had cared about my learning. The people were just ordinary people like of course some had attitudes and others were friendly. Morgan's campus was pretty clean on a daily basis.  The dorms were as clean as the people that lived in them, so if the people were messy then the dorms and bathrooms were messy. Honestly, school is what you make it,  if you make it boring then it will be boring."
Freshman,5,I will be attending Morgan State University in the fall of 2020! It is my number pick I've wanted to attend the school since I was younger. I even on a high school field trip and the college was everything I thought it would be!
Senior,5,Everything I love everything about my university. Blah blah  nah  lab blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Senior,5,"Morgan State is an amazing University. My mother and my grandmother both graduated from Morgan and I hope to be the next in the family. I have learn so much about my history. Morgan State University is in my opinion the best historically black college because they teach you the importance of education, life skills, and following what makes you happy. I can say attending Morgan State University has made me a proud black man in America."
Sophomore,5,Great experience the staff really wants to see the students succeed. There are many different organizations to choose from no matter what type of personality you have there is an organization waiting to welcome you with open arms. This school offers institutional aid grants to further help with the cost. There are many different tutoring sessions study groups etc if you need extra help academically. The bookstore offers price match on books. There are always activities on campus whether it is a game or an organization hosting a fun event all students are welcome whether you are apart of that org or not and it is free fun for all. I would highly recommend this school for anyone interested in higher education!
Freshman,5,"Morgan State is a school where everyone is allowed to be themselves. It is a school where even if you live miles away, you will still feel at home. Everyone on the campus does their absolute best to make everyone feel comfortable, have a great time, all while receiving the best education from our teachers. I am a current freshman at Morgan State, soon to be sophomore, and Morgan is a school that is full of THE BEST students and staff, that want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,They really help you out out when its comes to academics. the teachers really stick with until you really  get it. the events the school host are safe and fun i love it.
Niche User,5,"It was a very greet experience great professors, staff, and pretty good food. The dorms were pretty comfortable. The area around the school is pretty nice and there is a few places where me and my friends  can hang out.  I really look forward to the next year."
Junior,5,I mostly like everything about Morgan State University. The campus is really big and nice and the teachers and staff are nice. There are a lot of fun activities that students can participate in. The only change I want them to do is to fix the parking problem or increase their parking space. The rest is fine.
Freshman,5,"During the summer my bestfriend and I did a college tour at Morgan state university, I love the school and how they were organized. The dorms her looked satisfying and there would be wonderful place to live in. Entering the university you can see that everyone is friendly and treat their peers with care and respect. While I was there I made friends with one the person that give us more information on Morgan state."
Junior,5,Great diversity with genuine staff on campus!Although I’m away from home Morgan State is my second home. I feel like the faculty really care for the students and they understand that many of us don’t come from royalty in the suburbs.  I love being a Morgan state bear
Freshman,5,"The connections you can make with the staff is amazing and also beneficial. Social life is great, it is easy and fun to communicate with like-minded people who all look the same. Morgan state has given me many opportunities and has opened a few a many more doors to come. I have established a personal connection with the president of my college and that has influenced me to strive for greatness. I am glad that Morgan State took a chance on me."
Niche User,5,"I visted Morgan State University in November 2019 and i can honeslty tell you it is the Best HBCU i have ever been to . Morgan has a energy like no other, it is so welcoming and open. There are wonderful people who attend that school and i can only hope that i can walk on that campus in the fall as a freshman in 2020."
Freshman,5,Amazing campus life very diverse! Friendly environment professors are helpful. Dorms could be better. But great campus to live on
Niche User,5,"I liKe the School and the campus is huge. The only problem is that it is too big. There is a lot of good places to see and the school seems great along with the teachers. The Classes are so far away from the classes the music, and drama programs seem so cool and so famous that it would be a good education from just going there. I would love to go there again just to experience it again."
Freshman,5,"So far my overall experience at Morgan State has been very adventurous, I've made relationships that will last a lifetime and I've found a place that I can truly call home. Morgan State is somewhere that I can truly be myself as well as find out the rest of who I want to be."
Junior,5,"It is a very diverse structure; the instructors are accommodating.  As a junior, I have seen many changes in just one semester. These changes have enhanced students' ability to succeed and make it to the next semester successful and string."
Sophomore,5,"Morgan is a great school there are people here who really want to see you prosper . But you have to put in the work you cannot expect to come to Morgan , sit and do nothing and then get where you want to be or get the best experience. I feel like for certain classes they need more than one  teacher"
Freshman,5,It has been life changing. I have made many new friends and i love my school. i am so happy i chose it as my top college and i cant wait to spend the next four years here. Morgan is very diverse and is a big family-like school environment.
Senior,5,This university promotes student growth and challenges you along your path to graduation. The university pushes for leadershp by having students develop clubs and participate university activities. It also has a great sense of community that allows stdents to feel at home.
Freshman,5,"I visited Morgan State when I was a junior in high school and I loved it the minute I stepped onto the campus! I just finished my first semester and I had a ball, I don't even want to go home for break!"
Freshman,5,"What I like about Morgan is that I can see other people around me, that look like me who want the same thing in this world. That being to change it for the better and be successful along the way. To be a Morganite is to be the best you can be and when you feel as if you're best keep striving for greater. Through Christ all things are possible, as well as when you shoot for the moon you still land amongst the stars."
Graduate Student,5,"The professors are very knowledgeable and understanding of the students. I can tell that they are really dedicated and what to see their students grow. In just the short time I have been in the graduate music program, I have been afforded many opportunities I in other circumstances may not have been able to experience. It has been a hard journey, but there has been someone always helpful and smiling along the way here in Baltimore, and at Morgan State University."
Junior,5,"Every school has their kinks, but I wouldn't trade my Morgan experience for anything in the world! This school has helped me find who I am and give me direction in my life. Thank you, Morgan State University!"
Alum,5,"The atmosphere was engaging and friendly, there was always something to do in regards of social life and hobbies."
Sophomore,5,In my experiences people are very helpful however sometimes you do have to be persistent to receive good help
Freshman,5,My experience so far is great! I really like this University because it's giving me a chance to go to school on a full football scholarship.  This was the only college that offered me this opportunity. that is a blessing. Only change I like to see is a little more diversity and more off campus housing and no party scene. Don't need it. Need to focus on studies.
Sophomore,5,I like the people at Morgan State University. I have met many interesting people that have come from all over the United States. It has been an unique experience to have.
Freshman,5,"It’s a very nice overall student body, very welcoming. As soon as I stepped foot on campus I felt as though I was able to connect with different people who had the same cultural background as me. Being able to adapt to a large group of people so quickly was very well needed for people like myself who aren’t used to making friends very easily."
Sophomore,5,My first year at Morgan State was a good year for me it let me experience a new look on life and realized that  there are a lot of ways to live life along with the different walks of live that people come from. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants a different view on life along with wanting to attend a HBCU. Morgan may not seem to be top tier but it is a national treasure and a great atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"I loved my first year at Morgan! I've experienced so much. New friends, good professors and a LIVE student body. There are so many opportunities here, so take full advantage of everything they give you. People are here to help, just ask and reach out!"
Freshman,5,There are various resources throughout the campus so many that if you need help with anything any one of those resources will be found on the campus.
Sophomore,5,It’s a great school and great environment. The student body is amazing and everyone is so driven. Everyone is a leader in their own way as well. The party scene is amazing. The food is pretty boring but what can you expect. Some of the staff is cool but some of them act like they don’t want to be there.
Junior,5,I really loved visiting Morgan State University because it made me as a first time college student going away to school feel like home.
Senior,5,"I love my HBCU!! Morgan State University has molded me into the woman I am today. It showed me that time wastes for no one. Time management is everything in college. It has helped me balance my work, school, and social life. I love that Morgan is so welcoming and will help you with whatever you need. Such as a tutor, guidance, medicine, resources, etc. The only thing I would change is the admissions building service. They’re rude but they do help you with what you need"
Sophomore,5,What I like most about Morgan is the fact that it gives everyone an opportunity to succeed regardless of your background. You get to see people that look like you do amazing things and it forces you to work and go even harder.
Freshman,5,"Morgan State University is an illustrious school, with amazing benefits and a welcoming environment."
Sophomore,5,"this school is not horrible but can be improved tremendously. the school lacks proper food, housing and everything in between. the only thing that is really saving them is the academics. The teaching professionals for the most part care enough to really invest time in their students. The curriculum is very informative for certain  majors other are not. I consider this the typical hbcu underfunded but worth the struggle."
Junior,5,Morgan is a very good school with a huge focus on academics. The culture at this HBCU is also very nice and the facilities and services are up to date
Senior,5,I love my HBCU and it has taught me a lot about growth and becoming a women. It has strengthened my academic skills and ability to strive for what I want in life.
Senior,5,"I’ve really enjoyed the last four years I’ve spent at Morgan State University. The campus has new facilities and buildings which add a nice touch to the already beautiful campus. In my field of study, my peers and I are like family so I’ve created a network and a home away from home there."
Sophomore,5,Morgan State University is a great institution. One of the best HBCUs I️ have ever seen and I️ am happy to say I️ attend there.
Junior,5,"Morgan overall is a good school. You must network in order to actually get the most out if it.  The food is not really good but the environment Is very welcoming , professors are bomb! Some of them are very personable. The students are cool but they  have to work on actually doing work and not  feeling entitled. Some students feel like because its an HBCU everything shold be even instead of earned."
Freshman,5,Morgan State University gives you the opportunity to be and love yourself. The ability to be expressive on and around campus is liberating and exactly what students need in college.
Freshman,5,It was a great experience. I would recommend this school to anyone who is looking for a school that you will be able to feel comfortable at meet new people. The academics are fantastic you are able to create personal relationships with you professor and there are plenty of resources to help you succeed academically.
Junior,5,LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU!LOVE MY HBCU!LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU! LOVE MY HBCU!
Freshman,5,"Morgan State University was a great experience. The people are so welcoming, the love you can feel in the atmosphere, and I just felt like a family here. The fun activities they had to interact with others were amazing."
Freshman,5,"My experience has been wonderful. I love the atmosphere Morgan State University offers. Everyone around campus greets one another and is involved in the campus. Morgan State offers an array of things and activities. The university offers more than 45 undergraduate, 32 master's, 16 doctoral, and 9 online programs. The university's academic schools and programs include the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Architecture and Planning, the Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management, the School of Community Health and Policy, the School of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, the School of Education and Urban Studies, the School of Engineering, the School of Global Journalism and Communication, the School of Graduate Studies, and the School of Social Work."
Freshman,4,"Yes, right now I am taking online classes. So far the online classes structure is very organized. The professors are easy to talk to and class is actually engaging."
Senior,4,It has a been a challenging experience because of Covid-19 but I was still grateful to be able to further my education.
Junior,4,"taken online course has been more effective on my end. would enjoy more offered online course. overall, if online course were offered more often, majority of full-time student would be able to attend the course. nevertheless, wish the college offered more grants without these stipulation based on trying to locate outside scholarships, because it hard to find external ones."
Junior,4,the professors are reliable and understand with all human issues. offer more online courses for full-time working students.
Junior,4,I would like Morgan to be safer by having more and better security guards. That are going to actually do something if anything was to happen
Sophomore,4,"my online experience was very different, I was able to finish all my classes online and be in the comfort of my own home. I was able to keep up with my professors and also ask them any questions i needed with the work. I was able to contact them easily and also be able to have my own time to complete my work when class was done and do it at my own pace and get the best grades for my work."
Sophomore,4,I like how Morgan State keeps you up to date with all the information and the different events that goes on around campus. They also keep me up to date with different emergency that happen around campus keep us alert.
Sophomore,4,I love being at Morgan especially coming from a PWI high school in suburban Philly. The energy and feeling of comfort here is unmatched imo. Morgan has it's faults and things to work on but there is no place I'd rather be.
Sophomore,4,"As I have said in my earlier review, I still have three more years to go. Based on my first year, I can say that their academics are above average as the classes do allow you to think in a literal sense. The only critique that I would give is that they get rid of the wrong teachers. I can definitely point out a couple of teachers who should be fired that the school is doing absolutely nothing about. Other than that, the academics are great!!! :)"
Freshman,4,"the campus life is  my favorite part about Morgan, they really make you feel like u belong and give you that extra push you may need to be your best self."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online classes. from what I have heard though from my upperclassmen who have taken these classes, they are very good. I've haven't heard any complaints about the workload and the teachers who have thought them try their best not to make the classes boring. they are also very easy to use which is always plus when you are doing anything online."
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate my schools ability to make everyone feel like they are ""family"" on campus , no one feels lonely because you have professors, faculty, and other student body throughout the university that are willing to help pave the way for you to have a great college experience. We support one another and want to see everyone succeed, you wont be left astray even if you're giving up on yourself."
Senior,4,Morgan State University is a great HBCU. There is so much student development there and there is so much progress being made within the academic programs to help the students become the best in what they are majoring in.
Sophomore,4,"Morgan State has it's good days. Being that It's a HBCU, I feel heard, welcomed and heard. When I leave outside of my dorm room, I know I will get the help I need from my professors because they were once in my exact shoes and they know what it takes to become the best you that you can be."
Sophomore,4,Well it was a rough transition but they tried their best to accommodate the students left. Morgan State University has been great but the professor obviously don’t have training for the situations like this.
Sophomore,4,My online learning has been one no better explained then a roller coaster. It’s been good and bad but overall a great learning experience  with getting to know my professors in a more personal setting.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Morgan State University. I enjoyed everything on campus, from the food, to the dorms, to the classes. It was just the hygiene I was a little disturbed by. I seen a couple mice, I seen a couple roaches etc... Besides that I love it at Morgan."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at Morgan. I’ve met great people and have grown so much. I stayed in Harper-Tubman my freshman year and It was so much fun. The dorm is old so there were many maintenance issues as you would expect. I worked on campus tutoring and it was also great. The students are great and there are many great faculty. Although I love Morgan there are some things behind the scenes that are not very good. Registering for classes has proven difficult on many occasions and you can be left out in the wind waiting for people to get you what you need. As to be expected at most HBCUs you will have to knock down doors and send many emails for certain issues. However, the head administrators in the school are very active and can be easily reached. I’m an athlete and the athletics department takes great care of it’s athletes. Needless to say, Morgan was not my first choice, but I was not disappointed. I wouldn’t trade my HBCU for anything."
Sophomore,4,"Morgan State provides a one of a kind experience. The staff really cares about each student. Like most universities, you get out of Morgan what you put in. Staying involved, and putting your best foot forward is very important. It is easy to have fun, and it is impossible to not find people you have something in common with. The only major con to Morgan is housing. After freshman year, you are forced to either commute from home, or live in off-campus housing, which can be inconvenient if someone does not have a car."
Sophomore,4,Love the people and the campus just wish the school was better with getting info out to the students.
Niche User,4,The atmosphere at MSU is absolutely incredible. You feel at home when you step on campus and that is incredibly important for incoming freshmen. The students are friendly and there are always new opportunities' to learn about the school and HBCU culture.
Freshman,4,My experience at Morgan State University has been fun. I miss being on campus since COVID-19 has started.  Academics are great.
Freshman,4,The school is beautiful and has a nice atmosphere but there could be better teachers and better service while talking to offices on the phone
Freshman,4,It is extremely family oriented. Lots of resources. Too many foreign professors which can be a challenge.
Freshman,4,"Morgan state is an exceptional school, i wake up everyday knowing that i am headed to greatness, although there are still some troubles that the school has but all in all it is a great environment, it is very diverse i meet a lot of new people here and expand my connections. In my opinion i feel like the student housing and the dorm life can be a lot better than what it is now but all in all morgan state is a great school and a national treasure"
Freshman,4,"“Growing the Future, Leading the World” ~Morgan State University 
Morgan State University is a school of their word. They will not let you fail. They will encourage and push you until you’re up to where you need to be. While closed mouths typically do not get fed, they will still manage to throw many opportunities in front of you. It’s up to you to take it and run with it. Morgan State has a family feeling to it. You will never feel out of place, there’s someone  for everybody. The location may not be suitable for everybody but as long as your on campus you’re safe. Overall, for less than 20 thousand a year, Morgan is definitely a bang for your buck."
Freshman,4,Overall I really like Morgan. It wasn't my first choice but I'm glad I decided to come here. The housing isn't the best but It's ok.
Freshman,4,Morgan is a very great college.  I have experienced nothing but good times there.  The changes that I would like is more food choices on campus for the students.
Sophomore,4,"Morgan Is one of the most interesting schools to me. The professor are there , the staff is there , but us students are still limited to help , most of the time professor may seem careless or almost as if they didn’t if we learned the material, but then there those professors who loves to teach and loves when a student understands their lesson, college is really what you make it so get out there and find mentors some can be your professor or some can be from a organization."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Morgan as a freshman is fairly okay, I commute so I wish I stayed on campus. Other than that I liked all my professors except for one due to the work. I like the campus but I wish there was more food options on campus and at the cafe."
Senior,4,"It is an amazing and helpful HBCU!! You feel at home, but it can be frustrating dealing with some professors, but there are a lot that are passionate about teaching you. I enjoy it fully and have enjoyed my peers that have been pushing me and assisting with my learning."
Junior,4,"Morgan State University is a very good school, with everything comes cons but it isn't anything that cant be fixed or that they haven't tried to fix, or fixed already. A perfect place to network, to connect with others, to get real life experience, and have the best four years of your life. Originally a HBCU, but very diverse, the professors care about you, campus is large but very inviting. I recommend it to anyone thinking about going!"
Senior,4,"Morgan is a wonderful organization, the teachers are excellent and there programs are affordable. This is a college that you would like to attend, there are classes for the working student, online classes and weekends as well. Morgan State University is affordable and convenient to get to, there is free parking which makes it easy for all student"
Senior,4,The professors are invested in the success of students. If you ask them questions they are eager to pour into you as much information as they have. There are a lot of networking opportunities. One downside of the school is the inefficiencies found writhing the administration. One department does not seem to talk to the other and their systems always seem to malfunction.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Morgan State University, I believe a lot needs to be improved for students to have a better college experience. That includes safety on campus, housing, and student life. The safety on campus is poor due to the area it is in and the fact that it's an open campus that allows outsiders access which can be and has been dangerous to the students that live on campus. Housing is also a problem because of poor communication amongst the residents in the buildings. Without communication, there is a lack of cleanliness around the building that shows on each floor. Lastly, when it comes to student life there is also a lack of communication when it comes to school events and by that I mean the school does not broadcast when there are social activities where all the students can mingle."
Junior,4,"Morgan State University is a good school.  Your college experience is something that you make it.  Join clubs and organizations, so you can get to know people."
Sophomore,4,Morgan State University is definitely a place where you can learn and grow as a young adult who is just starting out. You will benefit academically as well as mentally. I would change the process that students have to go through in terms of financial aid.
Junior,4,"Morgan State University is a good school. The student life is great and there are a lot of events that are hosted on campus. Morgan State also has a lot of organizations that students can join. Overall, the school is good, the work is fairly easy, and some professors are easy to work with."
Freshman,4,"I love the social aspect of Morgan State University, and the professors are spectacular. On the other hand, the campus food is not that great and the fact that there are only two dining halls which have certain times you are allowed to use your meal swipe calls for a waste of money since meal swipes don't transfer over to different meals or days."
Senior,4,"I love Morgan however it can use some work. they have great atmosphere, everyone is welcoming and open, the party  homecoming is the best"
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience has been the average experience. Sometimes it can be really fun, and sometimes it can be boring because you realized you’ve been procrastinating a lot and now you’re jammed up with upcoming assignments. I love my HBCU because there’s people from all over the world here and so I get to meet people from different backgrounds and learn new things as well."
Freshman,4,"I liked the atmosphere of the campus and it feels like home. Everyone here is friendly and the professor are kind. No parental curfews. You can finding passions you never knew you hadSome thing they could fix is the laundry room, shower heads, and the college food choices."
Senior,4,"Morgan State is an amazing HBCU! There's not much I would change however, there are always pros and cons with organizations."
Niche User,4,I recently took a tour of of Morgan State. It was honestly a campus that was better than I thought it would be. I sat and listened to presentations from many different professors and came to the conclusion that their academics was fairly well and they had much to offer. The campus was very clean and not to complicated to understand. The students were also very friendly and welcoming. Overall the tour was informative and is definitely one of my top picks for school in the fall.
Sophomore,4,"I love that Morgan State University is a friendly environment filled with helpful peers and teachers. When walking on this campus i never feel left out or alone, someone is always there with a smile. There are also many orginizations to join, which i have joined. I gained various connections through my org to help me with my future. this camous only gives out what you put in I give my all everyday in class and at home, therefore i get the best for my future in return."
Senior,4,"Morgan State is one of my top schools and I would be honored to attend there. I visited the campus in April and other than the tour guide, everything was great."
Freshman,4,"A wonderful school. I suggest visiting before committing as I would suggest with all institutions. I love my HBCU but,there is room for improvement."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Morgan State University has been good, my classes are great, the staff is helpful, but the financial aid staff is sometimes hard to get in touch with."
Freshman,4,Morgan is a great great school for learning but the students are not morally upright. The only thing Morgan as a school is lacking is discipline.
Freshman,4,"Morgan has a really pleasant and welcoming atmosphere, however the dorms, food, and safety can use a significant amount of improvement. Other than that, Morgan is still a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"If you want a challenge and a great education come to Morgan its amazing, the faculty and students are amazing the atmosphere is above compare. Also the buildings and campus layout is easy to get hang of."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus feel here. The people are outgoing, the professors (most of them) are kind and happy to be working with you. My only issue really is with the housing department. They take a very long time to get back to you on your housing assignment and I know some who didn't get housed until a week into the semester. I also wish the financial aid department was a bit more helpful."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Morgan state was good. I learned a lot about my HBCU. You can be involved with a lot of organizations and etc...  the sports team are decent and enjoyable to go to and watch.
Sophomore,4,"I love my Hbcu, but they need to fix their housing problems and security on campus could be way better than it is."
Junior,4,Morgan is a great school they only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there is always room for improvement and I feel Morgan doesn't do that to the best of its ability.
Senior,4,"I am from the West Coast, far way from home. Morgan has made it easy to be away from home , as well as so much fun."
Freshman,4,"When i firs came to Morgan State University I was under the impression that it was a low class school and more of a party scene then anything else. However, after i had attended the Open House my views completely changed. The campus and classrooms are very high tech and the teaches are relatively chill. Also, the athletics department is I believe a Division 1 which makes Morgan different than the rest. In addition to this the staff has a close connection with the students which makes living on campus a nice and friendly experience to have. So far the only complaint I have about the school is the lack of air conditioning in some of the rooms in the dorms and some of the classrooms."
Freshman,4,"Morgan State really gives you that ""HBCU Experience"" at a cheaper price than a place like Howard University."
Sophomore,4,Overall Morgan state was a good first year experience. The only issue I had was within my dorm. Most professors were very helpful in guiding me through my first year.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve always wanted to go to an HBCU and when I came to visit, I felt so welcomed and it felt like I was supposed to be there. It’s just one big happy family and everyone supports each other no matter what especially if you’re an entrepreneur! I love my HBCU for life!"
Freshman,2,"My freshman year wasn't so good. All of my teachers spoke with difficult accents, and my academic advisor wasn't much help. Getting help from professor was never an option and all of my classes the professor just talked instead of demonstrating."
Sophomore,2,My online learning experience was difficult because it was such a drastic change from classroom learning to online learning. Learning from home the teacher was able to only teach you but so much then you would have to teach yourself and not get distracted by your surroundings. Online classes from home was just overall not a good experience for me and definitely prefer classroom learning.
Freshman,2,The administration is extremely rude and isn't helpful whatsoever. The campus isn't as lively as the average college campus and there's only one dining hall. I don't think Morgan students get what we pay for.
Freshman,2,"As a current student at Morgan State University, I would have to say that I really don't like this school. This comes from the fact that the staff are unreliable, and never answer the phone when you need help, the security is not strong, and the area in which the school is in is just terrible. The dorms are disgusting, and aren't properly cleaned either. There's nothing other than the campus food for students to eat, and the dining hall closes early, leaving students hungry. I don't like how it is an open campus, and literally anyone can walk on, it's very unsafe. I honestly don't feel comfortable walking off campus to go to parties or anything of the matter due to the outside activities of violence. I wouldn't recommend attending this school."
Freshman,2,It is a bad school. Dont go. It is boring and not worth the hassle. Not great for academic either. Way to expensive for a terrible experience.
Graduate Student,2,"This school is outdated and is in desperate need of being revamped both physically and internally. The staff is outwardly lazy and rude. The professors are dime a dozen. Some care greatly, others seem to be there simply for a check and it shows."
Senior,2,I do love Morgan but they make it hard to get assistance financially I struggle as an out of state student to pay school. but there are many opportunities for net working
Freshman,2,"Financial aid office does not communicate well with students. They are not helpful whatsoever. For the amount of money they charge out of state students, the dorms need to be renovated really bad. Transportation for students that do not bring their own cars is very lacking and we won't even talk about the location."
Sophomore,2,Morgan is lackadaisical when it comes their students. They do not pay attention to all their students needs and the management is horrible. Some members of the staff are terrible. The school is unorganized.
Sophomore,2,"This school is an okay school. Me coming here, I expected it to be more fun with residents life and activities, but my assumption was false. My biggest concern with this school is definitely the financial aid department. I've has several encounters with them. They always seem like they have an attitude for servicing you, when that's their job. Overall my experience here is negative, hopefully it gets better thoguh"
Sophomore,2,"Morgan State University is a diverse campus. The main campus is beautiful. The students are friendly. However, their financial aid office is slow, the staff have attitudes and the food is horrible. the dorms are nasty."
Senior,2,The residence halls need improvement.  They are small and in desperate need of renovations.  The food options need to be improved and they should offer more places around the campus where our meal plan can be used.  Currently the meal plan can only be used in two places.  The campus is generally safe despite some incidents that occur once in a blue moon.
Sophomore,2,"Morgan State University is a great school overall, however it can be better. I feel like the surrounding area can be changed. It needs to be a little more secure because i don't feel safe on my campus. They need to close the campus a little because i dont like the fact that anyone can walk on the campus."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really have a secure opinion on this topic.
College Senior,2,Morgan had a unexpected downfall for me. I used to love Morgan until I got closer to graduation. I cannot wait to leave this place.
College Senior,2,Morgan is unorganized and poorly managed. I wouldn't choose Morgan all over again because it is drama filled.
College Freshman,2,people still continue to be robbed on campus. campus safety needs to be improved.
College Freshman,2,"the buildings are old and dirty, some have rats and/or bugs."
College Freshman,2,It is annoying to walk across the dorm to get to your dorm or your destination and have to hold you breath just to make it out or inside alive. Students smoke weed and are not even scared of the dangers and effects it has on their health. It is a bit sad but it is not something prayer can not solve.
College Junior,2,some of the professors teach for one type of crowd and if you do not get it they deem it your fault so you have to figure it out. Meanwhile some teachers like Steve Effe makes sure all of his students understand and takes time out to teach the students at different rates in order to ensure success of all of his students and not just a select few.
College Junior,2,"the rooms are way too small. The dorms are overpriced and you get nothing but broken equipment in the rooms especially the upperclassman homes. They don't make you feel homely at all because its just not up to par.the dorm options are very limited and they all suck especially when visiting other schools like university of eastern shore, Temple University, and University of Baltimore its shameful that we pay anything more than $400 a month for such poor ""homely"" conditions."
College Junior,2,The football team is always losing and there isn't any real time to go in the pool because there isn't much time students can go in the pool outside of class.
College Freshman,2,I recieve many emails about assults on campus
College Freshman,2,"I stayed on campus for the casa program and disliked some of the things with the housing, especially when i saw a roach."
College Sophomore,2,In my opinion the education does not match the tuition I'm paying for an instate student. Most of the professor that I've had speak with very strong accents and have bad teaching methods.
College Freshman,2,The career center is not the best help to me right now because I am still a freshman. Most if the internships and jobs dont become available until you are a sophmore.
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is not good at all. The building is very run down and need to be rebuilt in my oppion. Alot of things are messed up and I feel as if no one pays attention to it. The clealiness is not great. There is a cleaning lady who comes everyday but the students messes up what she cleans in about an hour. The dorms are an okay size , my dorm is a little bigger than most so I got lucky with that. The location is convient , I get to most of my classes in about 10 minutes. My dorm building is also a good distance from a shopping plaza. The housing process is pretty simple, moving in had to be the hardest part. Lastly the social atmosphere is the best part because a majority of the girls get along so its a great vibe. However I find myself wanting to live off campus next year."
College Student,2,"Many people, including the president hates our team."
College Freshman,2,"There happen to be a great deal of crimes that goes on in the school mainly because its an open campus and the part of Baltimore it is in. So I never go out alone when its dark, I always travel with a group of friends because anything can happen, and the so called security don't always be on their post."
College Freshman,2,"I wish I did not go to this school. Its really unorganized, the student are very ignorant, the food is nasty, and some of the teachers can't teach and are unable to assist in the way you need to understand the material, and the dorms are the worst. I would not refer this school to anyone especially my friends. Also my major is not even accredited, which makes it worse, and I can not wait until I leave this school."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't believe I am getting my money worth. If I could do it all over again, I would pick a different school even though this was my last choice."
College Freshman,2,"I have had a lot of issues with my housing, my room had multiple leaks, it flooded, and it took maintence forever to respond and at the end of the semester to finally attempt to fix it. The rooms are very small and stuffy."
College Freshman,2,"There are enough students to fill the athletic rosters. In 2014, Morgan football became MEAC co-champions. Now in 2015, Morgan football failed to make the playoffs. The basketball teams are not that good. Football attract the most people. By far, cheerleading is the most successful sport at Morgan State."
College Freshman,2,They should complete the process faster and notify students faster. They should offer more institutional help.
College Freshman,2,Needs more food options and healthier food. Bigger serving size.
College Junior,2,Morgan doesn't give money unless honors or athletics.
College Freshman,2,They barely give you anything
College Sophomore,2,I was given the wrong amount that I owed the school and I was unable to get ANY refund money
College Freshman,2,The people act like they don't want to help you and they send you on the run around.
College Junior,2,Not too many healthy options.
College Senior,2,"The financial aid process is not good here the staff are like puppets that are put in place to fake the system that there is financial help for the students. I mean the staff here have no more knowledge about the financial process than the students. They don't advise student well about how to find money other that loans and federal grants, so what if your money run out before graduation...well you are alone!"
College Senior,2,"I live in off campus apartment housing.  There are 4 people in my unit including me.  The apartment is old, so it does not look to clean.  It is cheaper for me to live off campus.  I don't have a car so that makes it hard to find a place to live.  The public transportation is not the safest."
College Freshman,2,I have gotten robbed on campus and have had guns put in my face at parties on campus
College Freshman,2,"Since the local area is near the city the crime rate is alot higer, and this could lead to a enviroment that isnt praised so much."
College Freshman,2,"The finaicial aid services runs really slow, and has some inefficiency with sorting things out."
College Junior,2,boring if you ask me
College Junior,2,"I relatively enjoy my program. however ive been on deans list twice and dont receive any additional aid. We have no money! and i just think its unfair because for the students who break their backs to do well, we feel like its pointless and not beneficial."
College Sophomore,2,"The office of financial aid at Morgan State University needs some real professional employees that have the right attitude and act like they actually want to help the students at Morgan State University. The professionalism and attitude of the staff at Morgan State University will make a student want to go just not go through the hassle of finding enough aid and not have enough money for school and just decide to leave. There is a few select number of employees that are actually helpful. Sometimes financial aid tells you different, inaccurate information in regards to your account. Some of them are known for losing paperwork and having attitudes when you ask too many questions."
College Freshman,2,"It is not very safe at all. Morgan State is an open campus and anyone can roam about as they please.  Every other week there is a crime incident and the suspects are always fleeing on foot, never being caught.  We are not allowed to have any personal protection such as pepper spray but, security is so far from some places that we have no other option.  We have no gates of fences to keep intruders out and proper security measures are not always taken."
College Sophomore,2,"If you have to have a meal plan eat in the canteen not the refac. Yes, some days the refac has good food and it buffet style but it's not worth the stomach ache afterward. Also the price to eat in the refac is outrageous. I don't have a meal plan but if I ever decide to eat on campus I also eat in the canteen. It's much more cost effective & the food is better. Also Auntie Ann's, Subway, and the Sweet Shoppe are good places to get food or snacks on the go."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid here isn't all that good. The people who work in the office always lose paperwork & try to blame it on the students. It is truly a headache dealing with the office of financial aid.
College Freshman,2,They take forever to approve you.
College Sophomore,2,The food isn't decent and it isn't open for long.
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus housing is not that good around my school.
College Senior,2,Not enough scholarships for students
College Junior,2,Dining options a very limited it's like jail food & if it's not jailing Ull eat it soo much it will feel like prison the hours are not good at all weekends u have from 4:30 to 6 to eat or else ur out of luck things like food preferences like vegan kosher vegetarian there are only few options & it's only a vegetarian option
College Junior,2,I guess because most places that are close to the school they feel the need to have high prices; rarely any discounts for college students
College Senior,2,"The locals can be troublesome, we are locating in East Baltimore, which is a ""hood"" more or less but at least its not as bad as Coppin State University"
College Senior,2,Not enough awareness or intake for new members. In reality the Greek life is better in the South or TWI
College Senior,2,"Campus dining is the worst, I believe the only thing keeping the dining service in business is the low-cost for the school. They prefer anything to keep money in their pockets it seems. The addition of Auntie Anne's is cool, but we need more variety."
Freshman,1,"The professors themselves do not know how to operate any online features, classes, or online assessments."
Freshman,1,"My online learning experience was terrible. A lot of my professors were already bad at communicating in the classroom; so online did not make the learning experience smoother. With classes being online, my professors gave even more work as if adjusting was not hard enough. I would not like to do this again. Zero stars; I do not recommend."
Niche User,1,"This school just sucks so bad. I have no idea why ms. Is still  a thing.  No one in ANY office does their jobs, the students and even the parents are so freaking rude. The website has literally little to NO information on it. I can literally go on and on. This school needs to close down for GOOD and never ever return. There is no reason for a school to operate the way that MSU does. At all."
Freshman,1,"The school is very dirty. By the time I become a junior or incoming senior (I will be graduating in 2022, so I am a freshman now in 2019) it will look different because of getting more funds, but right now it is disgusting. The school's campus is pretty small and there are a lot of snow days. The Swan program (screenwriting and animation) isn't technically a major yet, so they group us with English majors for the orientation class. 
It is an HBCU so it is nice seeing people like me walking around and trying their best, but the school does not have the proper resources. 
The financial aid office is a mess. No one knows how to answer questions or do their job. 
The teams are trash (mainly football, the lacrosse and basketball teams are...alright and we don't hear about the other teams...I think the bowling team is the best actually). 
open campus and it's very unsafe here in general. 
Come here if you want to party because there's always something you can get into."
Junior,1,Admissions building runs terribly. Financial aid office is not reliable. Engineering programs makes it hard to register for classes and does not have enough sections/classes for the number of students in the program. Going through a housing pandemic due to admitting more students than there is housing.
College Junior,1,Its a popularity thing .
College Senior,1,Morgan is always on the news for its unsafe conditions.
College Senior,1,Living on campus was the worst. The rooms were ridiculously small for the amount of money we pay to live there.
College Senior,1,Greeks are very haughty and condescending at Morgan State University. They are also drama filled.
College Freshman,1,It was a good experience. Very challenging to step out on your own.
College Junior,1,There's not enough variety of professors for the courses majority of the time there's one teacher and you'll be stuck
College Sophomore,1,"Avoiding living on campus at Morgan state University if you can. It is very unsanitary, mice infested, you're treated like a child, poor visitation hours, horrible RA's and RD's and small rooms."
College Junior,1,They pick certain people to join
College Freshman,1,I think that Morgan State University should have better dorms.
College Student,1,O'Connell Hall is the worst dorm on campus.
College Freshman,1,"I don't like it here, I can't wait to leave because I can not take another year at this school. Its just not the right fit for me."
College Freshman,1,My major is not accredited so its the worst and the teachers don't know how to teach.
College Freshman,1,"I hate living on campus especially in Blount, they have lady bugs infestations, dirty roommates,I had to share a room with three other people which was the worst mainly because I hate sharing a room, I like my own space.The bathroom can get dirty. Its just the worst experience ever!"
College Freshman,1,"Out of all the things I'd like to change about the campus, this is one of the things that is NEEDED to be changed."
College Sophomore,1,The  amount of money I am paying for the elevator to always be down makes no sense
College Freshman,1,They give you the run around
College Freshman,1,"The visitation rules and hours in most of the dorms is crazy. Monday to Thursday, visitation is from 4pm to 10pm.  Friday and Saturday visitation is from about 3pm to 12AM.  And on Sundays it's from 4pm-11Pm.  I might be off by a couple of hours but basically the rules are so strict when it comes to visitation."
College Sophomore,1,I have not received any financial aid from the school.
College Junior,1,They are cert stingy with Financial aid. They dont offer any money to students who attend
College Freshman,1,Not much but fast food chains.
College Freshman,1,I am not getting help
College Freshman,1,It is a big headache.  Everyone in the office acts like they hate their job and don't even want to be there.  They place calls on hold to handle personal business and do not offer the utmost help as they should.
College Sophomore,1,Never had an internship only a job
College Sophomore,1,The campus has police but they do not do their job
College Freshman,1,There areent really any nearby off campus places to go eat
College Senior,1,"The housing is sub-pr compared to other HBCU and campuses. The cleanliness is non existent, but thats not the real problem. Theyre just old"
College Freshman,1,Morgan Police are no good. Only when a great party is going on and they get jealous and shut it down cause they're too old to join. People get robbed and raped everyday.
College Freshman,1,I haven't started classes for my major yet so I wouldn't know.
College Freshman,1,The visitation hours currently held at Morgan are unreasonable. During the week we can have visitors from 4-10:30 and on the weekends 4-12. Students feel like they are being treated as children being restricted to when they can allow company in their rooms. and There are no 24 locations students can be to study without bothering their roommates. as a whole it is unfair and needs to be changed. Everything else would be better if this problem was fixed.
College Freshman,1,"Currently at Morgan State we only have two choices to find food at. The ""Canteen"" which is more of a food court type of setting with a nice selection of different foods, where most students eat and the ""Refac"" which is our buffet style dining area that gives out basically 2-3 option meals. The biggest concern students have about the dining is the way our meal plan is set up. You can have to the option of 14 meals a week but those meals are assigned by times. you can only eat breakfast from 8-10, lunch between 11-2 and dinner from 4-8 if you get hungry after 8 you have to find food in your room or go off campus to get food."
College Senior,1,Street parking is two hour parking and they are strict with towing
College Freshman,1,No overnight visitation. EVER! I would be fine with this policy if I went to a private school. This is the only school I applied to with such strict visitation. The latest guest can stay over on weekends is 12 p.m. Also there are no co-ed dorms.
College Freshman,1,Coming from a big city it is very hard for me to adapt. It is nothing to do nearby unless you find someone with a car.
College Freshman,1,Students have to fight to get on the shuttles to go to the shopping centers. Many times students who were at the bus stop first are unable to get on because other students cut the lines.
College Freshman,1,Wish we had a Starbucks on campus like most schools. Only two dining halls on campus. One serves the same food everyday and the other doesn't taste that good. On weekends it's only one dining hall. 
College Sophomore,1,Every semester there is a problem with financial aid.  
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is very sloppy and slow and students constantly have problems with the office and its employees. many students leave because of the process being too slow in getting them the needed funds to enroll
College Freshman,1,theres visitation hours and there are separate dorms for boys and girls. the dorms are also spreader apart very far from each other
College Freshman,1,the school is in Baltimore City
College Junior,1,"There are several computer labs throughout the campus, however, they and the networks are slow and unreliable. The printing quota is very limited, it is beyond a necessity to have your own fully functional computer."
College Junior,1,"Dirty, cheap buildings, poor maintenance, small, and needs updated services. "
College Freshman,1,Financial Aid at Morgan State is slow. The staff members aren't as effective as they could be. The office is always packed. They take forever to answer the phones and questions people have. They are literally a headache. I have had to call a many days to inquire on my refund check and class schedule.
College Junior,1,"the fact my mother make a contain amount,  the don't give me any money, when though their is a high volume of family members in my house"
College Junior,1,the price is too much for what the school is giving us
College Freshman,1,Floods when it rains heavily. Dorms are far from classes not smart for bad weather
College Freshman,1,Rats in dining area. Under and over cooked food 
College Sophomore,1,"If you are wondering about healthy, halal, kosher or vegan options for this school we do not posses them. Changes need to be made in that regard. "
College Freshman,1,"The dorms at Morgan State are really disgusting. The guys of the dorm don't clean up after themselves, they are very rowdy and just take no care of their living surroundings."
College Junior,1,"If you were a C or B student at a failing public high school, you will be extremely successful at Morgan. Everything is basic, simple, and elementary."
College Junior,1,No one in any office knows anything that could even remotely help anyone with their financial aid process.
College Junior,1,"I literally applied, did not finish my application, and was admitted. I only agreed to attend because my parents refused to let me go to the school I actually wanted to go to."
College Junior,1,"I have spent three semesters here at Morgan State University and have actually learned NOTHING. The curriculum is simpler than that of my High School and the students are inadequately being prepared for their future. Any student who intends to leave Morgan and go to graduate school, I bid you good luck as the average Morgan graduate can hardly construct a basic five-paragraph essay. The most complex piece of literature I have seen on my curriculum as an English Major was absolute garbage and was the most elementary text I have ever been asked to read let alone analyze."
College Freshman,1,It's an HBCU so there is mainly African Americans. There are a few white people and people from outside the US.
College Freshman,1,There are mostly african americans attending my school.
Recent Alumnus,1,Absolutely no variety in the area nearby. A car is very necessary if you get bored easily from the same foods.

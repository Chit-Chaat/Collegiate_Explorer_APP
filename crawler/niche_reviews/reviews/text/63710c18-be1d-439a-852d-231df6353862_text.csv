Alum,5,I don't understand why I have to fill this out...I never took an online course here....but thats cool so yeah...
Junior,5,"I have taken a hybrid class, The course is mainly online but meets once a week. The professors are very responsive to any questions and are willing to offer advice and help with the material."
Freshman,5,What I liked about the campus is that it is a small school so you will have a 1 on 1 conversation with your professor.
Freshman,5,I took an online class as SU and the professors were really helpful when their students were having trouble understanding the subject.
Sophomore,5,"Simpson University is an excellent school for those who are looking for a small, Christian university. The majority of students are athletes. Because of this, everyone will show up for home games. The classes are fantastic as their small, and you genuinely get to connect with your professors. The Dorms are fun-filled, and I've lived in two dorm buildings, and in each one, I had the same experience. Everyone makes sure nobody in the hall is a stranger; it makes living in the dorms so fun! At Simpson, you'll find yourself friends who will go to the bluffs with you, go on drives, and calls Jr. at 2 am."
Senior,5,The professors in the Nursing program care deeply about student engagement and success. There is a Christian undertone to the BSN program that is hard to find in the day and age that provides an excellent base for the nursing profession.
Sophomore,5,"Simpson University is located in Redding Ca. It is a Christian University, the have so many events that bring the students together.  The teachers ans staff are all very professional.  Having chapel on campus is helpful as well.  The area is great for hiking,  fishing,  camping, and snowboarding or skiing is only an hour north.  The school is very unified and like family."
Niche User,5,I love how the faculty and financial aid department have worked with me. I am in a pilot Tech program and they have answered any and all questions timely and thoroughly.
Senior,5,"Simpson University is a private school that truly cares about the well-being and education of each of their students. The professors there are committed to student success and invest time and energy into making sure that each student gets the classes they need on time and have all of the resources they may find useful to do well in class. In the Sciences and Music Department, as I have experienced, the professors are passionate, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable about their subject. If you are willing or interested in a faith focused school, I would highly recommend Simpson."
Niche User,5,"I will be attending Simpson University in the fall. I have attended several events on campus, and the school remains genuine and influential. The staff and students do their best to make the school body feel like a family. The school also provides a house for missionary and third culture kids, which allows there to be further diversity on campus. LIfe on campus is easy going, and the staff wants what is best for the students. Though the campus is small it is perfect for students who are readjusting to the United States of America. Simpson's friendly environment has allowed it to connect with the community of Redding and reach out to the people in need. The school is continuing to invest in international students. Simpson's accreditation is solid and assure that the school is right for each student who comes in to gain a higher education."
Freshman,5,"Simpson University is a small school. My overall experience so far is amazing. I love how personable the professors are with you, that Christian views are enforced, and how the campus is not impacted. Everyone here staff and students want you to succeed. The sports are very easy to be involved in and same things with other student activities."
Alum,5,"Not only is Simpson in a beautiful location, it maintains high standards in academic excellence, offers a low student to teacher ratio so there's a personal experience, has a new president with great vision and a welcoming personality, is growing in its athletic programs, and has a state-of-the-art science building and highly ranked nursing program. I'm proud to be an alum of SU!"
Senior,5,"This school is so welcoming. I thought I was in over my head but I'm not. If I can do this, anyone can. I love how small the classes are and how personalized everything is. So happy to be on board with my bachelors degree. It's a dream come true."
Niche User,5,I have been here for a camp and also have gone through the process of applying. They keep in contact with you and make sure everything is going smoothly for you.
Freshman,5,"So far the process of getting started has been very easy, and the staff are friendly, accommodating, and helpful."
Niche User,5,I am really enjoying my classes at Simpson. The professors are great and teach the courses well. The only thing I would like to change is that they provide scholarship programs for local businesses to give students.
Graduate Student,5,The atmosphere at Simpson University is unique and special.  An environment that enriches your relationship with others and fosters your growth through all phases. I was especially moved by getting to have educational conversations about Jesus.
Sophomore,5,"So far, my experience at Simpson University has been great. I have grown in my relationship with God and people more. I discovered my strengths and I am growing in my weaknesses. I love that class sizes are small because it creates a environment where significant relationships are built between faculty and students. Most professors are really passionate about doing their job well. Community is key at Simpson."
Freshman,5,"my experience with Simpson University was fun, and very interesting wish to be there once more, good communication skills within the student, good teaching skills"
Sophomore,5,It is a great university small but has a great community with the students and the professors. The campus is also very beautiful you can really see God's presence on the campus.
Freshman,5,Its a University that makes you feel like family. I love the people and the school. We are a small university which makes us that much closer.
Junior,5,the professors are helpful and the staff is accommodating with questions . classes are challenging but small and inclusive for all students.
College Senior,5,I'm very happy with the relationships one can easily build with the professors. They are all genuinely interested in the futures of the students and have always offered help and advice. Students should take more advantage of the aid that professors give.
College Junior,5,"I've had a very pleasant experience based on academics so far. The professors are all quite friendly, interesting, and professional. They know their subjects well and are helpful. The workload also isn't too heavy, which I appreciate, but there is always some form of work in most of my classes."
College Senior,5,Plenty of educational opportunities available for any major
College Freshman,5,"As a Christian university, we all have to sign a contract saying we won't drink or do drugs."
College Freshman,5,Our music department is absolutely incredible. All of the professors are intelligent and willing to help. They are all super helpful with finding jobs/careers after college.
College Freshman,5,People are just awesome here.
College Freshman,5,"They are all well taken care of. They are all very accessible. Gym, music room and library open until midnight. 24 hr weight room. We have lots of campus events."
College Freshman,5,I love it here. The students are all friendly. The teachers are very involved and go beyond what is expected. A very godly environment.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus safety is always there when you need them for anything, 24/7. There aren't many crimes that happen. It's very safe."
College Freshman,5,"The biology program is great! Teachers are helpful and very involved. The class is small, which makes the experience so much better. The curriculum does require constant work and weekly quizzes. Our facilities are awesome, but we are getting a new building so that should be awesome. They don't have any internships or job opportunities though."
College Sophomore,5,Mostly white or asian. Liberal and conservative. Only straight is acceptable socially.
College Sophomore,5,No drugs or alcohol on campus at all
College Sophomore,5,"The program is really great! It requires a ton of work, but the teachers are incredibly helpful making sure you don't just succeed but understand the topics as well."
College Sophomore,5,"The majors were all so good it was hard to choose, and the minors were even harder to decide. Criteria for addmission is straight forward, the only thing unusual was how easy it was!"
College Sophomore,5,No to little illegal activity but plenty of freedom!
College Sophomore,5,People and dorms are really nice!
College Freshman,5,"If one needs a computer to use, wifi, or needs to print something, there will always be something available."
College Freshman,5,"Considering my campus is quite small, there is no need for transportation to get around campus."
College Freshman,5,I never worry about being unsafe or that my health is compromised.
College Junior,5,There's never been any history of reported problems with sexual harassments.  Campus safety is easy to access and arrive within five minutes if you call them for assistance.  The campus safety number is one of the first numbers given to incoming students.
College Freshman,5,"Okay, Simpson is an alcohol-drug-free campus so the bar/club scene is out. However, there are tons of things to do on campus at night from game night in like every hall to learning salsa dancing to murder in the dark to capture the flag to big events like airband and exposure (movie festival) and Haunted Thompson and My Tie and GYRAD (Get Your Roommate a Date) and Clue and Stick 'Em. As previously mentioned, the town doesn't have much late night options and transportation sucks, but there is a swing-dance place on Saturday Nights and a pizza place that occasionally has karioke. And, of course, there's always Denny's. I like it because it keeps me from spending money I don't have but I still have a lot of fun. "
College Freshman,5,"I love Simpson. I love the on-campus activities and the atmosphere and the friendliness of the faculty and staff. The real reason I like it, however, is that they put Jesus at the center. "
College Freshman,5,"I love our financial aid department. They are very friendly and personable; they helped me alot and made it seem easy. It was all online, which was great since my home is several states away from the school. However, I was overseas, which made it all a bit of a hassle. I also applied late, which means I couldn't receive all of the financial aid I was elidgible for, creating more of a hassle. They were also willing to work with me through the payments when I was waiting for the money to come in. I would suggest to keep financial aid informed and go to them the moment you have any issues; they will help you through it. Also, get things in ASAP in order to get the best aid available. "
College Sophomore,5,They have a great amount of help offered but not a lot of majors choices. However the registration process in amazing they are very helpful.
College Freshman,5,"I love the weather at my school. During the winter, it is chilly. Most of the time I like to have the heater on in my dorm. During the spring, it is warm. It's a good time to go to the lake or be outside."
College Freshman,5,I am extremely happy with my program. I have learned a ton about subjects preparing me to become a nurse and I have only been in school for a year. If I could do it all over again I would. I want to become a pediatric nurse and work in a hospital close to home. I don't have too many concerns because I know that the profession that I have chosen will always be needed.
College Sophomore,5,"We are located in Northern California. The weather in the fall and spring is fantastic and there are a lot of people outdoors. It rains a good amount in the winter and it snows maybe once a year. None of the classes have ever been canceled because of the weather, but rain boots and an umbrella is great when you have to walk across campus to class in the rain."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are extremely knowledgeable in their given areas. Not only do they care about your education, they care about the development of your Christian faith."
College Freshman,5,"Being a small school, the class size for the average music class is about 8-10 students. Therefore, the professors are easily able to help any student needing one on one time. The music department is fairly small, but very beneficial."
College Freshman,5,"Because I attend a Christian institution, Simpson University, the drug scene does not even exist on campus. There are those who break code and become involved in activities off campus, but I have not heard of any incidents on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Redding has so many places to eat. There are cheap options and also expensive ones as well. Also, there are many different ethnic choices. Coffee shops are a big deal here as well."
College Junior,5,we have a policy against partaking alcohol on and off campus.  So you do not see alcohol or drugs on campus.  but are students still doing drugs and drinking? yes.
Recent Alumnus,5,Being a Christian University drug and alcohol use is pretty much zero on campus. Most students who are of legal drinking age occassionally do drink off campus but nothing excessive.
College Junior,5,"If you get caught drinking or doing drugs, as an athlete, you can either lose your scholarship or get suspended for 6 weeks. As a regular student, you get put under review for breaking contract. Nobody drinks, and when they do, they keep it very hush hush."
College Junior,5,"Since its a private christian university there is no drinking at all by any students, on or off campus. the same goes for drugs and while living on campus you are never aloud to have someone of the opposite gender in a room with the door closed. This is all for our own safety and reputation, Simpson students are known for being helpful, drug free, sober and studious young adults."
College Junior,5,"It went pretty smoothly but I was on top of my stuff with the help of the office. They will call you regularly and remind you that forms are do and what steps to take next. As long as you actually do what they say, when they say it, you'll have a very smooth experience with the financial aid office"
College Junior,5,"The guys at Simpson are a little annoying, it seems like there is always drama with them and guy will have drama over the same few girls. With everyone being around each other 24/7 it gets a little annoying. The girls are nice and friendly but they're teases, all they want to do is flirt with you and lead you on but most are athletic and pretty nice. All and all they guys and girls are pretty inviting but get annoying after a while"
College Sophomore,5,"Apartments are definitely affordable, even more so then where I moved from.  Most students have roommates which reduce their rent significantly, for example a few of my friends have a place together and they pay about 150 each."
Alum,4,"Decent liberal arts college.  You will get what you put in.  Professors are qualified and helpful, diverse group of people.  Definitely has a Christian emphasis (C&MA background), but not in some kind of close minded fundamentalist way.  You'll be happy if you go."
Junior,4,Simpson University is a strong Christian university that has helped me grow in my faith. As a biology major I have been able to develope a deeper appreciation the world around me and continue to see God's work. A huge positive for me is that I get to establish strong relationship with my professors and truly feel that I am a valued student. It is a university that is preparing me for both life challenges and joys.
Freshman,4,Great private christian school.  Nice clean and safe campus.  Good food at cafe!  Good hours for dining.  Lots of athletic teams with players from all over the world & amazing coaching staff.  New nice nursing program and facilities with nice expensive mannequins.
Sophomore,4,"I have some up and downs at Simpson University, I definitely grew as an individual. Most of my growth at Simpson was through the classroom setting and bad experiences with RA's (resident life Assistant). Some of these experiences include unfair treatment towards different students."
Sophomore,4,"Simpson University is a small Christian school in Redding, California. I am a member of the women's basketball team and I love my teammates and the coaching staff. Simpson's faculty are genuinely, good-hearted people who want the best for their students. Small class sizes allow for personal connections and real relationships with peers and professors. I am very thankful for Simpson University and its Christian environment which allows me to be submerged in a culture that I can thrive in and connects me with people who have similar values. I pray this school continues to grow financially and increase in students as I know we are coming out of a major slump from previous years. Overall, Simpson University provides an incredible environment if you are looking for a small, close knit Christian school to pursue your educational and/or athletic goals."
Freshman,4,Simpson has a beautiful campus and a wonderful group of people that fill the dorms and the classrooms. The teachers are very welcoming and open and easy to learn from.
Junior,4,At Simpson University I enjoy the community aspect. Because it is a small Christian college you get pretty close with your peers. I also play on the basketball team and am involved with two on campus jobs and other leader positions. I love that you can express your religion freely and talk about it in classes.
Junior,4,The nursing program has many gifted teachers that combine knowledge and experience with the grace that God wants us to walk in.
Sophomore,4,"As an international student, I feel that Simpson has been very welcoming to me and where I stand as a Christian.  The professors at Simpson are amazing and want to heavily invest in the lives of the students."
Alum,4,"Simpson University is located in Northern California. The university offers a variety of 4 year degrees including in Psychology, Business, Nursing, etc. Additionally, it boasts of a year, accelerated program for returning adult students, called  ASPIRE. The teachers are knowledgeable, and approachable. Moreover, tuition is remarkably affordable to any individual looking to further their academic success."
Niche User,4,What I like most about Simpson is that the classroom sizes are small and the teachers are more willing to help you with whatever you need. I also really liked the campus itself. The thing I dislike about Simpson is the lack of diversity.
Freshman,4,I like the quaintness of the campus and that fact that everything is realitively close together. The professors care about the students. The food needs some help.
Senior,4,"Community rich environment that is centered around Christ. Simpson University offers a variety of majors and minors for all. There is also a consistently low class ratio, so students receive one to one learning and have the opportunity to get the help they need in order for them to succeed."
College Senior,4,The great people out weigh the judgmental ones making it a great place to go to school.
College Junior,4,"I have yet to move into the dorms, but from what I have seen it seems like it will be a lot of fun. It will be different than what I am used to, but I am looking forward to change. What I liked most about what I saw is how the rooms are spacious enough for you to have your own space but also close so you have to interact with your roommates"
College Junior,4,"Only been in the gym twice at Simpson, but those two times have been great. I really like how the gym and all of the facilities are set up. And even though Simpson is an old school, the equipment is top notch. I like how all the athletes create a small family and welcome all newcomers."
College Junior,4,"I have visited Simpson twice and I love it. It is very welcoming. I felt accepted, and cared for while walking around. The smallness of the campus really provides a sense of community and family feel, unlike the huge campuses where no one knows anyone."
College Freshman,4,"Simpson University is a very inclusive school. The staff is inviting to all new entries and the students are glad to make new acquaintances. They have plenty of opportunities for students to enjoy their stay at the university, as well as learning to balance their personal lives with school work. The environment lets the students know that they are not alone in their endeavors."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security is consistently driving around campus making sure everything is safe. I always feel safe, even at two in the morning. If there are any concerns, we can call campus safety and they will come help."
College Freshman,4,Most graduates get a job right out of graduation.
College Freshman,4,My classes have been challenging and successful. The information that I've learned has been rich and useful. Class sizes are small and reasonable. Classes relate to the student's major choice. Each teacher has a different teaching style so every class the student is learning new ways to study and prepare for the course.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus encourages community and fellowship. I've developed relationships with people I'm proud to call sisters. It's always fun and easy-going. The RA's are sweet and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Simpson has made the transition from high school smooth and exciting. It's situated in such a beautiful area that provides numerous adventure opportunities. The classes are challenging and hands on. My professors have fostered and nurtured my love for Biology. I've developed some incredible relationships with people and I know that I have grown and improved as a person. Most importantly, I'm happy with the person I've become."
College Freshman,4,The school is relatively safe and have not came across any bad situations so far.
College Freshman,4,The recruiters at the school are very persuasive in getting individuals to attend the school.
College Freshman,4,"Can't complain about the housing here on campus, I am comfortable with my space and roommates."
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience at my school has been a great experience so far, in meeting new people and having a very supportive staff."
College Junior,4,"I've had a really good experience at Simpson so far. Students and professors here were very welcoming, and I made friends and got connected with different activities very quickly. The quality of education is good, the people are great, and the campus is beautiful."
College Senior,4,I have met people that I know have become life long friends. There is a strong community at Simpson. Professors take interest in you as a student.
College Sophomore,4,A fun way to get out and support your classmates!
College Sophomore,4,Good variety of healthy dining. Diverse options of cuisine
College Sophomore,4,Campus is firm in enforcing rules for the well being of the students.
College Sophomore,4,Very helpful personnel. Could not attend college without the amount of financial aid that I recieve
College Sophomore,4,"Clean, semi spacious, great community"
College Freshman,4,The dorms are fairly nice and we all have our own bathroom.
College Senior,4,Study hard and you will be rewarded. I got some scholarships at random from donors and there are several scholarships for academic merit and participation in school ensembles. They also provide info for outside scholarship information.
College Senior,4,The policies are helpful in maintaining a serious scholastic environment.
College Freshman,4,I haven't heard of any issues so far.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part students are nice. It is very common for people to make some gesture of ""hello"" with a smile when passing by on the sidewalks."
College Freshman,4,"It's a great town due to popular franchise restaurants and stores being in close proximity. Also, there are many things to do outside of the town that very close by.  The Sundial Bridge is a cool attraction and is beautiful at night."
College Junior,4,They really look out for and keep students safe.
College Junior,4,Redding is said to be one o the most depressing cities but I actually like it here. It is beautiful and there are a lot of tourist attractions like Whiskeytown and the Sundial Bridge. I feel like the safety isn't the best her but there are a lot of sports activities to get involved in here and Big League Dreams is a great place to have here for that. I feel like students at Shasta and Simpson are pretty friendly and nice people. A lot of Christian events go on at Simpson and I like that.
College Junior,4,The financial aid process went very well for me. I was given a cost estimate worksheet that was very easy to follow. The staff working at the school are knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to financial aid.
College Junior,4,"There are a variety of off-campus dining, albeit my school is located in a small town so there aren't too many places, but enough to satisfy. The cost is generally pretty average, and quite inexpensive compared to the dining near where I'm from."
College Senior,4,I love my home. It's not too pricey and very comfortable.
College Senior,4,I'm not sure as I am starting in the fall. I don't have an opinion yet
College Senior,4,"I've enjoyed the process, and am excited to start the school"
College Senior,4,"I love it here, so much fun. So much diversity. yay"
College Senior,4,Guidance counselors have been kind and very helpful
College Senior,4,"It's a Christian college, so you aren't going to get away with things you would at University."
College Senior,4,"Simpson is small, so there is a lot of opportunity to make lasting friendships"
College Senior,4,"I am starting Simpson in the fall, so I don't know much about the atmosphere."
College Senior,4,"Redding is a beautiful area, full of outdoor activities."
College Junior,4,The admissions counselors were very personable and very persistent. The really care about you as an incoming student and will do anything to get you into school. They are the very reason many of the students end up going to Simpson.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not sure how many students actually attend sports events. Some of my friends do, but personally, I don't. I would say a good amount watch the games, and the teamwork is pretty great. The school spirit is good, we have days where we wear the school colors all day to support the teams in a big match."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the Biology program at Simpson. It has great classes, with great teachers. My only complaint would be the minimal variety in the classes that Biology majors can have. Other than that it is perfect for me."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of things to do in Redding and the locals are always nice.
College Freshman,4,"It may be small and not as diverse as other schools, but the professors and students are great."
College Freshman,4,There's many different people who come here. We have some students all the way from China.
College Freshman,4,"Simpson does a great job at coming up with fun and appropriate activities for all students, commuters and residents alike."
Alum,2,"Simpson is just not set up to facilitate online classes very well. The program that they go through is very dated and not very interactive. But, to be honest, I don't really like online classes in general."
Niche User,2,"I am currently in the ASPIRE Adult Studies program at Simpson University. Schedule and workload are great for working adults who would like to finish their degrees while still maintaining a full-time job. HOWEVER, the administration and financial aid have been an absolute nightmare. I had to follow up many times before I was accepted to ensure that the process was moving along. It took 3 months to get the information that I needed. Documents and transcripts have been lost. Scholarships have not been applied. As an incoming student, I expected to be provided with much more information regarding aid applications, admission requirements, etc.. and did not receive the information until I was being penalized for not having it. It has been a very frustrating experience that I wish I would have known about prior to enrolling."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about the parties at this school, it isn't nearly as big of a thing as it would be at a state college."
College Freshman,2,"Because it is a small campus there isn't a lot to choose from. The cafeteria serves the same food over and over again, and doesn't always make the best stuff. However the exhibition is usually pretty good."
College Senior,2,Very hot in the summer. Very sparse so you need a vehicle. No nightlife at all. Good outdoors activities at lake Shasta.
College Senior,2,"We aren't a party school. There are dorm ""parties"" but there is nothing spectacular. Most of the students are more focused on school."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you have a car, or want to wait at the bus stop for a long time, there is no transportation."
College Freshman,2,They are extremely conservative and strict.
College Freshman,2,The food is better than high school but not something I want to live on.
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any financial aid.
College Freshman,2,It's difficult to live off campus. You have to be a senior or over 22 for the most part.
College Sophomore,2,Hot or cold most the year
College Sophomore,2,The programs are not helpful and neither are the counselors
College Sophomore,2,Bad.  Would not choose this school for achademics
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no options for financial aid unless received through state grants, athletic scholarships, and rarely academic aid. The financial aid is quite scarce and very few have their tuition covered in full."
College Freshman,2,"Well, there are parties within dorms and such, but they're all clean... I'm sure some people know more about this than I do, but I think generally these ""Nightlife parties"" don't happen very often (the rules are rather strict concerning them). 

We do have certain other events at night... we've had a schoolwide Karaoke night, Open-Mic Night, various games and activities at night, and there was a period when a guy dressed up in a gilly suit and ran around trying to scare night-strollers ( I was unaffected). I think that's about as exciting as it gets at night around here!"
College Freshman,2,"We really don't have any. I mean, there's a shuttle to church and a shuttle to the airport and trainstation on orientation and visiting weekends but not a whole lot of options. The bus stop is close but not very convienent because it stops running at about 7pm. "
College Sophomore,2,"I hate the parking situation. I am a commuter and their accomidations of parking for commuters is horrid. in addition, it is eighty dollars a semester for horrible parking which is completely unreasonable."
College Sophomore,2,"It is impossible to find an internship job around Redding, CA for dental hygiene so I have never had an internship."
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of options near the campus and the cost is average. but I have never asked about student discounts.
Alum,1,"While I had great experience with the professors and students at Simpson, the administration is terrible and has no idea how to run a university. Attendance rates are dropping every year, the school is completely bankrupt, more and more majors are getting cut, and all the good professors are jumping ship (I don't blame them). Overall, I definitely do not recommend this school."
Junior,1,i really did not like the school. It did not have a college vibe to it it felt more like a community college. They do not have many resources for students. The library hours did not meet with students needs. They also try to add extra fees to everything. The cafeteria food was not good and it looked like they reused a lot of the food .
College Senior,1,Nonexistent. We have an Alpha Chi honors society of which I am a part. We don't do anything.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,The school tries there very hardest to keep you on campus
College Sophomore,1,We dont have a greek life
College Freshman,1,There is like one bar.
College Freshman,1,There are very few social events and the city in which it is located does not have any late-night dance clubs and very few late-night dining options.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life on my campus.
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greeks or sororities or anything like that . . . so this seems kind of irrelevant. We do, however, have a special missionary house for missionary kids that works with the school, and we do not discriminate against any type of nationality, so Greeks are welcome. "
College Sophomore,1,No greek life available. There are enough cliques within the school.
College Sophomore,1,"Simpson's dorms don't quite match up to the quality students should be getting for how much they're paying. Students are also not allowed to live off campus, which is cheaper and far better, until they are at least 21. The dorms are very old, which means most have many problems such as things not working or bug infestations. There is a great staff to help fix these problems, but it still doesn't add up to getting the best for your money. I've seen the dorms at PSU and they are far more better and cheaper than what I'm paying to get here at Simpson."
College Sophomore,1,"There are rarely, if ever, ""parties"" at Simpson. It is a private Christian university, so there are some rules. If you want to go to Simpson and go to parties, befriend someone who lives off-campus who is the partying type and make plans with them. There is no action seen on campus other than after-parties for coordinated events."
College Junior,1,It's HOT!!! During the summer it gets up to 110 and very very dry. There are always fires during summer effecting the air quality as well. Winter gets really cold and rainy and occasionally snows.
College Junior,1,"If you live on campus, you get a special parking permit that allows you to park anywhere on campus. If you are a commuter, you have to pay $80 for a permit that only lets you park in the 2 worst parking lots on campus. Plus, they hand out tickets the first week. It is only $15 (unless you are parked in a handicapped zone) but they are still a hassle. Campus safety is also annoying because they ticket you if you're going over 20 mph. There isn't any crime on campus so I'm not even sure why we have a campus safety other than to give out tickets."
College Junior,1,"Because I play sports, I have a good group of friends that I love to death, but overall Simpson is not the place for me. I don't fit in well, it feels more like a church than a university, and it is overpriced for me not wanting to be here."
College Senior,1,There are no sororities or frats. Drinking is grounds for expulsion.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Options Are Slim – You're better off finding something at winco and making a good meal in the dorms or at home. There are the standard commercial restaurants, but not much else."
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife at our school. It is rather boring. The only thing to do is watch movies.

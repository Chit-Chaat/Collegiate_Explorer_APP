Senior,5,Great nursing program with easy online access to Canvas. Professors are very knowledgable and experienced. They give real-world experience to explain how to apply skills learned.

Freshman,5,"I will be attending Molloy College this September. I like the campus and their nursing program, which is why I will be going to this school. When I first visited the campus for the Open House, last year, I went on a tour with three Molloy students  who were Juniors and Seniors. They were all in the nursing school.
 I was very impressed. I liked the school,  it is not too large, there are security guards on campus and I think that I will feel safe. I am now in the new student orientation group and we teleconference every week. The incoming students have an opportunity to ask questions and discuss whatever we are concerned about.I like being able to speak with the other new students and I am looking forward to meeting them on campus. I plan to live on campus and the dorms seem to be taking precautions  regarding Covid19. I am excited."

Sophomore,5,So far I am having a great experience at Molloy. I have met many amazing people including the faculty who are supportive and here for us. I love our campus size.

Freshman,5,"I've been at Molloy College for almost a year now and I must say, I have nothing but good things to say. The school feels like a family friendly school. This is because all the students and faculty are so friendly and easy going people. the atmosphere is clean, cool, and relaxing. theirs always a place to hang with friends in the 2 cafeteria locations and classes are walking 5 min or less walking distant. think I made a great choice in deciding to go to Molloy."
Junior,5,"Molloy is a private Catholic College located in Rockville Centre  Long Island.There are very nice dorms but the school is convenient to commute to by car or train.The campus is small and very beautiful.All the buildings and classrooms are very well maintained.There are numerous majors to choose from.The enrollment is small and class size is small with a very low ratio of student to professor.They are dedicated and very knowledgeable as well as friendly and helpful.
Molloy has a very professional theatre and hosts many productions and concerts.It is a beautiful venue and the shows are always great.Molloy offers many clubs and sports team to participate in.
Kiplingers Magazine gave Molloy a very favorable rating labeling it ""the best bang for your buck"".I certainly feel that way too and I am enjoying everyday at Molloy.Be sure to include us in your college search."
Sophomore,5,Molloy College is a small yet challenging school. It's curriculum is very unique and challenging. The small classroom size makes easier for teachers to reach out to students and have a real student-teacher relationship. The campus is incredibly safe and clean and people are extraordinarily nice.
Junior,5,I am currently attending Molloy College to obtain my Bachelors of Science in Nursing. This school and the program in general have been absolutely fantastic. Every step of the way someone is available to help you. The professors that I have had so far have been great and I have obtained more knowledge in one semester than I thought possible. The way that the nursing program at Molloy is set up is beneficial to the learning process of the student. The courses are set up to build off of previous knowledge obtained by courses taken the semester before. This allows the student to understand the base of the topic entering the course and have the ability to comprehend information on a more detailed and complicated level. I have seen a considerable growth in myself as a student and healthcare professional because of my journey in Molloy colleges nursing program and I am excited to see where this journey continues to take me.
Alum,5,"The professors are excellent for the most part. High value education at a low cost. Overall, I had a great experience at Molloy."

College Senior,5,"Molloy meets the criteria for a perfect school in all different aspects. Everyone at the school is friendly, welcoming, caring, and supportive. All of the professors are extremely dedicated and make the learning experience enjoyable. Professors go out of their way to make sure students succeed. Since the class sizes at Molloy College are so small, professors are able to form relationships with the students and interact one-on-one with them."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Molloy college has been phenomenal. I am so blessed to have ended up here. Theres countless of opportunities for me. Also, the experience wouldn't be as great if it wasn't for the people that attend Molloy. I have met great people that have changed my life drastically. Those people push me to do my very best wether its a professor, friend, or peer. Everyones sincere and has a great heart. I have learned so much from only attending a year there and I can not wait where else Molloy will take me. The only negative part about Molloy is that it is very expensive and is going to be hard to continue to go there because of the high price. Other than that, the campus is always clean, theres always something to do, always a place to study at and theres aways a helping hand if you need it. The courses I have taken so far have been life changing. Such great information comes out of them. The class size is perfect for my learning ability because the class sizes are very small which makes it easier to get to know your professor. Its hard to say a bad thing about this school."
College Sophomore,5,"Public safety does a great job of keeping Molloy safe. There is little to no issues on campus. No sexual assaults, physical assaults or anything along those lines have ever happened as I been there. Theres always a place to go if you ever feel unsafe. Theres also these buttons around campus you can push if you ever feel unsafe. But feeling unsafe is never a feeling when your at Molloy College."
College Sophomore,5,"Our dorms are insanely clean. Also, the people that live in the dorm are great. I have so much fun living there with the people I live with. The bathrooms are ALWAYS clean and so are the hallways. The room sizes are the biggest I have ever seen at a college. Yes the dorms are very expensive and might be overpriced, but the experience is amazing. The social atmosphere is great. I could say hello to anyone that lives in the dorm. Sometimes we all get together to play games in the lobby."
College Sophomore,5,I truly enjoy and attending Molloy College. I have met amazing people that I will never forget. I play on the molloy soccer team and I also entered a few clubs. I love how its fairly small which makes the class sizes small. We really got to work one on one with the professors which I find it the best way for me to learn. I love the school and I can not picture myself going anywhere else but it is very high priced and its hard for me to pay for it. Molloy college helped me find myself in a way i never thought I could. The professors truly care about you in both academic and personal ways. I can't wait where else this school will take me with the rest of my years left.
College Freshman,5,Molloy opens up the door to many internships based on your major and walk you every step of the way which is very helpful.
College Freshman,5,Molloy is one of the best colleges out there in my opinion. I have a lot of pride being a student at Molloy College. This has been my dream school since I was in tenth grade.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe commuting back and forth to Molloy College. That is another reason why I chose to become a Molloy Lion.
College Freshman,5,"Molloy College is such an awesome school because everyone is very welcoming and they all treat you like family. The entire student body is able to work together to create new ideas for various clubs and just all have a good time regardless if we know each other personally or not. We all work together as one and that is how most colleges should be,  as oppose to everyone hanging out with their own little cliques like back in high school. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!"
College Freshman,5,I've loved every teacher I have had at Molloy and I would not trade the experience for anything. Every teacher is so friendly and approachable and no matter what the corse load is they will work WITH you to help get through.
College Freshman,5,I know that every single program has a ton of connections to the outside work field in many ways and they really really get students jobs. Some even have jobs lined up before senior year or graduation.
College Freshman,5,The buildings are so new and so beautiful. The RAs are always so amazing as well.
Junior,4,This college takes it's courses very seriously and wants the most from their students. This school also has a wonderful reputation that it lives up too. Their programs are definitely worth it. The professors are willing to work with you through everything.
Junior,4,I'm not a fan of online and zoom classes but my professors have made this a very pleasant experience.
Sophomore,4,"Molloy is a good school with decent people. The nursing program is no joke and really makes you have no time because theres always something you can do, especially sophmore year"
Junior,4,Molloy College is great if you are hard set on getting your major done. Campus life is good in relation to a majority commuter school.
Junior,4,I've taken part of a semester all online. The professors were all helpful and always assisted you with any problems that you had.
Freshman,4,I have not taken any online classes as yet. I know  that I have to take a math exam that I must pass; I will need to schedule the exam before classes start. If I do not pass this exam then I will need to  take a remedial math class and pass the class with a grade of 90. If I do not accomplish this then I will not be able to enroll in the nursing program.
Sophomore,4,"For the spring of 2020 after classes could not be continued in person, all classes were given online. While many students were new to this method of instruction all of my professors tried to make the transition smoother.  There were also many opportunities for extra credit given the circumstance that we were not used to online instruction."
Sophomore,4,Molloy always offers resources their students may need. The student solution center is home to many of the resources.
Sophomore,4,"Since COVID19 interrupted my freshman year, I have been online, and will continue online in the fall. All of my teachers did a fantastic job of transitioning to the new platform in such a short amount of time. Even performing arts done online were still beneficial."
Sophomore,4,"I am a student in the musical theatre program! Overall, I'd say that my experience at Molloy is just alright, but the theatre program makes it all worth it. Despite a slight disconnect between the rigor within my major and the rigor of the entire school, I find that I am always challenged, and have had a fantastic college experience thus far!"
Senior,4,I loved my experience at Molloy College. I am excited and sad that I will be a senior and graduating this year! One of the best parts about the school is that each student receives so much help to graduate and get a job in the field he/she received a degree in. There are many ways to get involved on campus even if you are a commuter student! Class sizes are optimal for allowing professors to know each student by name. I am very happy that I chose to complete my undergraduate degree here.
Senior,4,"I took a few online classes pre-COVID19, and all of my courses when COVID19 hit mid-spring semester of 2020. My professors were very organized and gave a reasonable format for online classes. Deadlines and workload was fair for the most part, and I feel like I got a quality education regardless of not being in person in the classroom. I like in person classes the best, but I was happy to be able to still take the required classes I needed to take in the midst of the pandemic. Aside from COVID19, my other online classes were also helpful and organized. They are also convenient because I can complete my work around clinical rotations and other internships."
Senior,4,Molloy set me up for success for my future career and graduate school endeavors. The faculty truly cares and wants the best for its students.
Junior,4,I would say my Molloy experience is very good so far. It is a very reputable school where you can gain many connections. The coast is very high so be ready for loans/scholarships applications
Niche User,4,Molloy College offers small class sizes so your professors get to know you. They have made improvements for campus life. It is a beautiful campus with state of the art new nursing equipment.
Junior,4,"more variation of class times, a lot of classes are right in the middle of the day, early morning would be better"
Junior,4,"Molloy is an amazing college. The student life is great, the education is amazing, and there are tons of opportunities. However it is a private school so it is expensive!"
Niche User,4,"Molloy College is very organized and diverse. In addition too , for the nursing dependent of the school it is very large and the teachers are extremely helpful. The campus its self its huge and very easy to navigate through. Also, all the employees were very kind and helpful with answering any questions i had. Molloy college is perfect who people want to commute."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience with Molloy so far has been pretty great. The teachers are very knowledgeable and truly seem to care about the success of their students. Being an education major, the only downside has been the field supervisors at this time. From my experience, they are not well prepared to walk students through field observations and EdTPA requirements."
Junior,4,Moloy college has an amazing academic program. The campus is small but very comfortable! The new hagan nursing building is beautiful and new! the nusing labs and simulations offer so much to the students. The student life is pretty dull but you come here to get a good education not for partying.
Junior,4,Molloy is a big family. Everyone here is so nice and always willing to help you out. The student life is pretty great because there’s always something fun happening on campus. The professors are serious about academics and at the same time they want you to succeed.
Junior,4,"Molloy College has such an excepting environment and the faculty always knows how to make you feel at home. I lived on campus for two years and had the best experience with the clean room and bathrooms, as well as the great food on campus! The professors are helpful and push you to succeed!"
Junior,4,"Molloy is a very small college, so one cannot get lost on campus. Most professors at Molloy are helpful and approchable. The nursing program is excellent and it truly prepares for the future. However, the clinical placement locations are not convenient. Most of the time, students have to travel very far, up to an hour. This is one of the bad aspects of Molloy.  The library is a good place to study and there are always computers available for use. Students can even choose isolated spots to study in the library or even reserve a room in another building. Another good aspect is that there are many oppurtunities to serve the community through Campus Ministries such as serving the poor, and fundraising programs. There are also tuition services,and free give-aways. Also, there is a free shuttle service from college to nearby train station and the bus terminal."
Junior,4,"I transferred to Molloy College to the social work program about two years or so ago. Since attending Molloy College, I have gained trustworthy, and beneficial relationships with my department's faculty and staff members. I must say the staff listen to each student's concerns and comments and work hard to continuing its success in the social work program. Here you will be able to meet colleagues that will work alongside you to make it through the program. In addition, this program also offers an internship during your senior year, which is extremely beneficial when deciding which population you would like to work with as you move on to graduate school!"
Freshman,4,"Molloy is great if you are looking for a small school with a caring community. If you want parties you either have to befriend athletes or theater kids (personally not my scene). The professors that I have had so far have been amazing, lectures can be a bit boring at times but sometimes they have very engaging stories or examples to tell the class. I find that I am doing a lot better academically and mentally here than I did in high school.  There is a bit of a problem with socialization because it is primarily a commuter campus, but student affairs puts on a lot of events and that's how I met some of my closest friends here. I feel like this campus has a very different environment than that of a bigger school, which can be good depending on your needs. The people and professors that I have met so far are full of a lot of love and care about trying to make sure you succeed."
Sophomore,4,Thus far I have had a great experience with Molloy. I commute every day via the LIRR and it's very convenient with their free shuttle service. The campus is always very clean and there's always something going on.
Junior,4,I love Molloy because it may be a smaller school compared to some around the area but it has so much to offer and is growing every single day. The students' best interests are always in mind and it is comforting to know that my success is taken seriously and truly desired by everyone on the faculty.
Junior,4,"Molloy College is a great school, if you aren't looking to go far away from home and interested in a little college. The academics are good especially if you want to become a nurse. You will get to know plenty of people. They are all so friendly."
Sophomore,4,"Molloy is a great school with wonderful academics. If you are looking for an affordable private college; then think of molloy college. However, there is no party at all in the school."
College Senior,4,It was a great experience transferring to this school
College Senior,4,"I really like the professors I have had so far. I feel like it's difficult to locate a place on campus where I can get my questions answered. I get more help calling the school and over the phone. There is easy access to professors and counsellors otherwise using email, phone and office visits. Many of the students are hard working and very determined to graduate and work. It provides a competitive environment and encourages me to try harder. It's very expensive but just as expensive as other private schools in the area. I feel like I am getting my money's worth with the small classes and a great school environment."
College Senior,4,"Professors are all excellent and dedicated. The small class sizes allows a more interactive relationship between professors and students. There is a wide range of courses to choose from and even if a class is full, it is not fully impossible to take that class."
College Sophomore,4,"I am always getting emails from my student solution center informing me that there is a job opportunity informing my major wether its an intern ship or a full job. I find that so helpful in the long run. Also, i know a lot of Molloy alumni say in touch with Molloy and help out with a lot of programs. If you ever have any questions about career opportunities or wanting to find a job, you could always count on student solution or the career services at Molloy college."
College Freshman,4,The housing on campus is great. The only downfall is that there is very limited dorm rooms for everybody.
College Freshman,4,Everyone who is a part of the sports team and even the supporters all work together as one. We are all in it together. The amount of pride a Molloy College student athlete holds is very high. I am most definitely proud to be a Molloy Lion.
College Freshman,4,I always feel the safe. Campus is like home and it is actually small enough to truly feel that way. Campus Safety is always here and the security for dorms and buildings is really good.
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is highly encouraged and accepted by the student body. It is ver relevant that everyone loves ""#molloylife"". Athletics are available and present but not a dominating factor on campus."
College Freshman,4,The location of the school is unbeatable. We are so close to the city and for Theatre we go into the city part time which is perfect. It is then so nice to go back to the beautiful Long Island campus. It is just small enough that every teacher knows your name and really cares about you individually.
College Junior,4,"There are always public safety walking around if you need anything from help with a flat tire, directions to a class or something personal that happened. The office is located below one of the dorms and has friendly staff!"
College Junior,4,"The career center services are great. For the most part, there are classes to partake in that will lead you to internship opportunities. As for the alumni, they come back a lot whether it's for graduate school or to visit."
College Junior,4,"The career center services are great. For the most part, there are classes to partake in that will lead you to internship opportunities. As for the alumni, they come back a lot whether it's for graduate school or to visit."
College Junior,4,"The dorms just added a brand new building however, they both look new! Always clean and friendly staff working the desk as well as RA's. It is very convenient to dorm because it's right next to all the building's including the dining hall."
College Junior,4,"The student involvement in athletics is great! The athletic department really makes tons of opportunities for each team to interact and help the school and community. Each game is usually packed out with fans and a great time. The athletic facilities are for the most part off campus, however great fields!"
College Junior,4,"It may be a small school but there are so many people that make it such a great experience from the students, professors or faculty. There are many events that help get interactive with other students and learn more about the school itself. From Mass to midnight runs to bbq's, Molloy really finds a way to become an active part of the community. If I could do the college process all over again, I would choose Molloy!"
College Freshman,4,You can easily get a job after you graduate and a internship
College Freshman,4,All of the professors are caring and the course are great
College Freshman,4,Everyone has a great time living on campus
College Freshman,4,The school has the best school spirit
College Freshman,4,"The college has been great, everyone is so friendly."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus and there hasn't been any crime
College Freshman,4,There are many wonderful programs to help you and are very useful
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus, they really try to get everyone involved, but the down side is how expensive it is and how as a freshman you can't take a low meal plan you are stuck having an expensive one and can't get the money back if there is any left over at the end of the spring semester"
College Freshman,4,"I would choose my school again because it makes me feel at home and everyone wants to help you. What the down side to this school is all the little fees we get, it really adds up!"
College Freshman,4,"Professors here at Molloy College are extremely friendly and very easy to approach. If you have an issue with an assignment or the class in itself, the professors are very accommodating."
College Freshman,4,"The school spirit at school sport's games is very lively. Almost everyone attends, especially the basketball games. Clubs and activities throughout the campus are extremely important to our school."
College Junior,4,"The price makes me regret it often. Plus students get much financial aid, but I know I'll get a job after graduation."
College Freshman,4,i always feel safe on campus we have a blue light system and the campus is really small so theres always a open buliding around. the public saftey are always around
College Freshman,4,My school has been good its pretty small which is something i love and hate. There are many activites to do in the school it has a little diversity but not alot . The program im in is very good and will help me get a job when i graduate. I like the fact that classes are small and a teacher can remeber your name and hoe your not just an number.I wasnt my first choice but im starting to like it. If i had the chance to do it all over i would not pick this college
College Junior,4,Molloy offers a variety of programs and majors/minors. There are a lot of classes to choose from. Registration is simple because you're given a designated time. Your advisor keeps you on track with your classes. The work load depends on how the student handles their time and what they are majoring in. I've never had a problem meeting a deadline.
College Junior,4,So far I haven't heard of any unsafe things happening on campus. The worst thing that's happened is that someone slipped on the ice in the parking lot. I generally feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Athletic department isn't up to date. The gym is very small and there's not enough room for the athletes and sports we have on campus. Even though it is a small school, almost 90% of people attend sporting events or are involved. They can do better."
College Freshman,2,Have to retake a class. Some teachers way off subject.
College Sophomore,2,There are hardly public transportation
College Sophomore,2,"There are strict rules that seem to be of importance and relative to student safety but rarely are followed! I personally wouldn't like random people entering the dorm building unnoticed as I've heard and witnessed! Also, underage drinking isn't really handled properly."
College Sophomore,2,There are great bars in the town of rockville centre but nobody ever really goes to them.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live on campus but to go into the dorms i have to sign in and even give my phone number, i have to leave by 11pm on weekdays "
College Sophomore,2,"i hate how strict they are, i feel like I'm still living with my mom"
College Junior,2,College has strict rules about attendance. No leniency with professors or staff if anything is missing from any files needed.
College Junior,2,Depends on the Time – Depending on when your class is the parking differs from each time
College Freshman,2,"It is a pain in the but to get financial aid information in the school. They lose everything. I sent in the same information at least 3 times. I also was shown that I would be awarded a scholarship, and I was not."
College Freshman,2,"parking on campus can be annoying on weekday mornings. You sometimes need to get there almost 30 minutes before your class starts just to find a parking spot. Sometimes when the lots are full, we are forced to park in the nearby field, than it takes a while to walk to class. The good thing is that parking is free at Molloy. You still need to register your car with public safety and get a parking sticker to put on your car otherwise you will get a ticket. You really don't need a car on campus, they have bus services if students need it, but classes are walking distance."
College Senior,2,"There is limited parking at Molloy College. If you don't get there early enough, you're stuck in no-man's land!"
Sophomore,1,Online experience has been horrible. No one has any answers. Tests are very distracting because you are able to see yourself while taking the test. Not many people willing to help
Works Here,1,Unless you are interested in nursing this is a crap school and the return on investment is low. Administration is the worst and they create a lot of unneeded stress for the non-unionized faculty. Avoid!
Works Here,1,Do NOT work here! You will be underpaid and unappreciated. Administration and faculty alike are too scared to stand up for themselves against the VP of Academic Affairs. She is cruel and unkind and is currently working to fire tenured faculty! The salary they pay faculty and staff are embarrassingly low and there is NO opportunity for growth. This college is an embarrassment to NY and Long Island and also lacks diversity and freedom of thought. Avoid at all costs! There are better alternatives. Also there is NO union for faculty and they just did away with the 403b match without faculty consult.
Sophomore,1,"Well my experience was average, no help when it comes to scholarships, they give to whoever, they waited last minute to tell you what your eligle for after begging..... if your BLACK it’s not for you!  Also the professors are very old and RUDE!"
College Freshman,1,im alway stressed theres so much work :(
College Freshman,1,no greek life at allllllllll
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life at my school
College Senior,1,"We had a pretty rough winter, with lots of snow days! BLAH!"
College Sophomore,1,we need more variety and more accessibility especially for those that dorm and can't make it to the lunchroom before it closes
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation in long island is horrible. Molloy provides shuttle buses but I do know the availability and time schedule.
"
College Junior,1,"theres not too much around, especially if you don't have a car"
College Junior,1,"Public transportation was reduce, so the bus comes once an hour, the campus used to provide free metro cards and cab rides, , we now have a campus bus, but there is a wait time, if your on a tight time schedule you will be late"
College Junior,1,"The larger race of  students and staff are Caucasians , there is probably 3 African American students , and 3 Hispanic students per class.  Although everyone is very friendly there is a sense of disconnect from minority students."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is free. You need a car if you are commuting which most students are. The parking lot is horrendous. It fills up really fast. There are a lot of pot holes. During lunch you will not get a spot or you will in the very back lot, and it is a pain to walk to and from. There are fees if you don't have a stick/permit on your car but they hardly give out fines. Make sure you get to school at least  15 min before class to find a parking spot. Fridays and night classes are easier to get spots because most people don't have class."
College Senior,1,Humanities Here Are EXTREMELY Ignored – It is very sad to see that the art department is a hallway. When the business departement is an entire floor and a half. The nursing is a building basically but that is because our school is primarily for nursing students. However this past two years a new building was introduced to our campus and it didnt seem to work in the favor of any of the humanities. It is making the students feel like their major is less than others and why would a college want to make its students feel like that.
College Sophomore,1,The parking situation at Molloy is terrible. There are way to many cars and not enough spaces. You have to get to school so early just to hopefully find a space. And don't even bother if its raining because it's even more impossible. then you can't even really park across the sreet because it's residential so you may get a ticket.

Freshman,5,"I don’t learn very well online, but the few classes I’ve had online due to COVID have been easy to navigate and learn from."
Junior,5,"Southeast Missouri was my first and only choice for college. I visited my junior year of high school because my cheer camp was held there. Automatically I loved the school. It is a big enough campus to always meet new people, but small enough that it only takes 10-15 minutes to walk across the entire campus. Neither my parents or older sister went to college, so I was so nervous. SEMO worked with me and gave me so many sources so I would feel more comfortable while on campus."
Junior,5,"I didn't take any online classes until COVID-19 happened, but the school did a phenomenal job transferring everyone online."
Freshman,5,I love attending southeast Missouri state. I feel my time and money is valued and I get the most out of it for my education

There are a ton of different clubs and organizations to be a part of, there are also great athletics, either to play at the Divison I level or to go watch and support your school.

It is an excellent school all around and one I definitely recommend."

The tutors they offer have helped me reach my goal on making the deans list. The food is good there is so much to choose from. Living in the dorm they mentors and RA's to help you and mine were awesome there were there for me a lot during stressful finals week and just a people there to listen to all of my problems If I had any. SEMO offers a lot of assistance as well the hold food banks and clothes drives for the students . They also have professional clothes that students can borrow if students cannot afford or do not have professional clothes for an interview.

Sophomore,5,"This school is amazing and they give students so many different options on how what they would like to do with their lives from computer science to Business to Dentistry to even Music Theater. The sports teams are great this is the first time since 2001 that the football, soccer and volleyball teams have won in their conference all at the same time."
Freshman,5,"I have taken dual credit through southeast since my junior year. I have found the price to be affordable, the facilities to be up to date and clean, the class sizes to my liking and the teachers to be very flexible. I appreciate how close it is to home while also giving me the college experience."
Freshman,5,I like Southeast because it offers a great education for a wonderful price.  I feel it is a good value and I am excited to continue my education here.

Sophomore,5,The academic advisors at my university have helped me figure out what I want to do for my major field in the future. This university is wonderful.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my time at SEMO! I am in the education program and it is really preparing me for my future as an elementary teacher. Campus life is great as well! I joined a sorority and made many new friends.
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere of this campus! I couldn't have asked for a better college. One thing that could probably use some improvement is the parking!
Junior,5,SEMO has a large community of friendly people who are more than willing to help you feel at home while you take your journey through getting your degree. I have absolutely loved my experience with this university so far.
Senior,5,SEMO is a great school that truly has its' student interests at heart. It's a flexible school with low tuition costs. I couldn't be happier to be attending this college!
Freshman,5,"I am enrolled for Fall of 2019, so I do not have the full experience of Southeast yet, but so far with going to orientation, and dealing with advisors and the rest of their staff, I have had a very smooth ride with SEMO so far."
Freshman,5,"Whenever I toured the campus, I had an amazing guide. I liked how its an average size college, and you can walk to classes easily. There are restaurants and bars near by that you can go to. The college is very diverse."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and the people, and I always felt supported. Academic wise I felt challenged in some courses, but not all, and the teachers are nice and smart."
Alum,5,"The best years of my life were spent at SEMO! So many academic areas, groups, clubs and more to choose from. Everyone can find a place to fit in. Cape Girardeau is an awesome town that is growing fast!"

SEMO is my home now and im looking forward to 2 more years at this school."
Graduate Student,5,"I doing my Masters Degree in Technology Management at Southeast Missouri State University. It's one of the cheapest and best quality university in the United States. There are many students from big cities who are graduating from this university. Very friendly professors and staffs are appreciatable. I think if the university implements online degree(Technology/Computer Science) for distance learners, it would be awesome. :)"
Senior,5,"I enjoy the campus. The professors are nice, friendly and always there to help. The student life is great. There are always campus activities going on. I enjoy going to the basketball and football games and their recreational center is great. The only thing I would like to see change would be more parking places but other than that Southeast Missouri State University is an awesome campus."
Freshman,5,I have had great experiences at Southeast Missouri State University. It is in a small enough town to have friends near by and big enough to make new ones! The teachers care about you and your grades and it is easy to get help when needed.
Sophomore,5,"SEMO is an amazing school that not only cares about you in the four years of being a Redhawk, but helps you after when looking for a job and a place in the community."
Niche User,5,"I have been taking duel credit classes while in high school, this is my second year.  They have reduce cost for all students wanting to take these courses offered.  The professors are always very helpful and reaching out to them online they always get back to me quickly.  The credits I earn are accepted at most other universities, which is great if at a later time I choose to transfer. Southeast Missouri State University offers so much to their students in education as well as extra curricular activities."
Senior,5,"I love SEMO.......family oriented, located in a beautiful place....and are very adamant about ALL students educational needs!"
Alum,5,"I loved Southeast because of its affordability and small school feel. With nearly 11,000 students, it's great having class ratios of 1:15; I made connections with professors and faculty that I would not have gotten at similar sized schools. The location was perfect too--not too far from home (St. Louis), but far enough that it was a different culture and lifestyle."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing first year at Southeast Missouri State, the teachers have been very helpful when questions were asked and always are willing to help you!"
Senior,5,I love SEMO they gave me the opportunity to finish my degree online. If this had not been an option I would not be graduating this fall! I am so grateful that I was given the opportunity to excel as a non traditional student!
Freshman,5,"The administrators here were very helpful and would offer assistance in any way they could. The classes are not usually over 45 to a class, which still provides a quality learning experience. They have an amazing library, and they offer great tutoring services."
Niche User,5,Southeast has a beautiful well put together campus. Even some amazing staff members especially in their music department. Also lots of new housing to choose from too!
Freshman,5,The party scene and food! They have amazing classes and easy to reach professors. All the classrooms are close by and within walking distance of downtown

Freshman,5,The faculty and staff are always available to help and want to help you.  It's easy to interact with them too.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy attending Southeast Missouri State University. It’s diversity is outstanding and the professors are great as well. The teachers always make sure you are doing well and never not care about you
Freshman,5,"I transfered to Southeast Missouri State my second semester of freshmen year, and I love it. I am not involved in greek life, although I still have a lot of fun and friends. There are so many opportunities for students at southeast, and your professors care about your future. The only down side of southeast is that it is a very hilly campus, so expect to be out of breathe when you get to class."
Niche User,5,SEMO was very great and when I went there I met so many people during the first few hours of being there it felt like home when I arrived on the campus.
Sophomore,5,I have met alot of friends here and have learned alot and feel confident to find a job in my field because of my professors.
Freshman,5,"Many different majors and minors to choose from, and a smaller school so easier to find my way around and be more comfortable"
Sophomore,5,"SEMO is everything I wanted in a college. I had access to facilities and professionals that would help me accomplish my goals. The atmosphere there is very productive and motivating, I would recommend it to anyone."
Freshman,5,"It’s a a great place to come if you have a wide variety of experiences, talents, and knowledge. They make going to college fun."
Freshman,5,"I love how welcoming everyone is to the incoming students. I also like the school spirit that everyone has. The parking could use a change, I feel that it is very unfair and unsafe."
Junior,5,I am an online student but live in Cape. I love going to school at SEMO! And the Cape Girardeau atmosphere makes me feel like I am home.
Sophomore,5,"SEMO is jokingly referred to as the school of second choice. I know for me I wasn't initially excited to attend. However, my experience here has been nothing but positive. The campus size is very ideal and compact. Organizations exist for all interests: club sports, greek life, pride, leadership and service organizations, professional fraternities, etc. Cape Girardeau is a smaller city but a great college town."
Freshman,5,"I had visited SEMO several times and fell in love with the campus. I have almost finished my first semester at Southeast Missouri State University and I am very satisfied with the education provided. I am learning what I need for my major, elementary education, and the professors are very helpful."
Freshman,5,The instructors are very effective at teaching. The facility is clean and well maintained. Affordable tuition.
Freshman,5,I am in love with the University I have chosen. They work with me very well and overall is just a beautiful campus to join. Everyone is nice and always out to help you.
Sophomore,5,When I came to Southeast I had never lived away from home but felt at ease right away.  The advisors really help you choose the correct classes and do not overload you!  The one thing I would change would be my first dorm room. Luis have been updated more - Towers North - the ventilation was bad and always seemed to hot in the rooms - I would have liked more control in our own rooms - I am in Towers West now and it's much better!
Freshman,5,My experience at Southeast Missouri State University is very family oriented. At Southeast I fell very welcome and feel like I made the best choice when picking my college .
Sophomore,5,"Although I am just now a sophomore, my experience so far with Southeast Missouri State University has been absolutely wonderful and eye opening. The thing about the SEMO campus is that when it comes to safety, DPS won't let you down. They are always around campus. There are loads of fun things to do from musicals to just having a lazy day at the River Campus, you truly won't be gloomy. The only thing that I would probably change is the amount of walking. There are just so many stairs."
Freshman,5,"Throughout the orientation process, they were very helpful. The River campus is absolutely beautiful and the dorms there are really big. Everyone I've met has been very friendly too."
Freshman,5,Southeast Missouri State University is one of the greatest college experiences that I have ever had. The campus is so diverse and the faculty and students are very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,"Southeast is a great place to learn. The instructors and all staff are very professional and courteous. The services, such as Learning Assistance Programs, including tutoring, College Success Seminar, Educational Access Programs, Management and Student success are so accomodating. All students are given every opportunity to take advantage of the programs available designed to foster a learning and earning a degree. I absolutely love it!"
Niche User,5,"Although I have no attended this college yet, it is my first pick. Through all the help I have needed they were great. I picked this school because of the beautiful campuses and the location."
Freshman,5,"So far, SEMO has been an amazing college to be a part of. There are SO many different resources for any assistance that a student could ever need. The campus is so welcoming to diversity and has so man different programs to make everyone feel at home. Professors are always willing to help out, and will work with you to set up an appointment to help you if you are struggling in class. The campus is very clean, and all the students are very kind and respectful. Dorm life is a great way to make new friends at  SEMO, and it has enhanced my experience more than I would have thought. Overall, SEMO is a great college."
Freshman,4,"I am loving everything about this school. I was very skeptical about it but turns out that this is a very good school with a very big campus. The staff is amazing, the campus is amazing, the food is pretty good and the halls are just way too good to be true. There is a sense  of community in this school. Smaller classroom sizes, more bonding time with the students and that is what makes this a great school. I love where I am going to school, and I am proud to be a redhawk!"
Sophomore,4,I love this school. However they love their money. Living off campus while trying to pay for everything on your own is very hard. Apply for scholarships and financial aid because you will need it.
Junior,4,I really love the diversity and how the business program is. Every professor is so nice and really try’s to help each student. There’s nothing I would change
Sophomore,4,The academics are good and I been exposed to many new experiences academically. The only issue I have with the school is the lack of diversity in staff and students.
Alum,4,Some truly phenomenal educators who genuinely care for their students. Also some creeps and people who do the bare minimum for a paycheck. Had a finance class in '19 that was using information from 2012. What's the point? Student involvement depends on the department. Seems as though some departments aren't faring too well due to cuts from the higher ups.
Senior,4,In most cases Southeast possesses very caring instructors and reasonable class sizes to accommodate each student. I felt cared for. They also have an abundance of resources on the cutting edge of education.
Sophomore,4,"I knew I wanted to go to Southeast Missouri State University before I even stepped on campus. When I finally took a tour, the summer before senior year, I knew this was the school for me. I am majoring in Agricultural Education . All of my professors in the agriculture department are amazing. They are so helpful and make lectures actually interesting. They take the time to get to know you and really what you want out of your classes and education here.  My advisor is the bomb.com, for real. He is one of those professors that you can see yourself being friends with. He is always so helpful when it comes to schedule planning and other such things. Southeast Missouri State University has a variety of dormitories in a variety of price ranges. This school really has something for everyone."
Sophomore,4,I love that there are so many different majors to choose from. I always have a strong sense of trust with my adviser. She truly wants the best for me and always answers any questions I may have. Professors respond to emails quickly for the most part. The classes can be challenging but you will learn a lot. The online program is amazing. I love my field and the professors teaching the classes want me to achieve.
Freshman,4,"I have almost finished my first year at Southeast Missouri State University, and it was a great year!  I attended almost every sporting event because they were so fun and you can earn points for going which can go towards purchasing prizes.  I had a blast meeting new people and trying all the food on campus.  There's something for everyone at SEMO and that's what I love about it.  The faculty are very personable and want the best for their students. 
 The classes are also fairly small so you have the opportunity to get to know the professors and can be offered lots of cool opportunities through them.  I wish there would have been more on campus events other than sports throughout the year though.  That would have given me more to do other than homework and being with friends inside since I do not party.  I cannot wait for my second year there!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Southeast Missouri State University has been great so far. I have not had any bad experience when it comes to SEMO in any aspect. I like how every professor does anything they can to help you succeed. I like how the campus is not too large making it very easy to get to class on time. Everyone on campus, wether it is staff or students, are very friendly and caring. If there was anything I could change about SEMO, it would be the food on campus. There is not a very big selection when it comes to food. All the food, except Subway, is located in the University Center causing it to be very packed during lunch and dinner hours."
Freshman,4,"I am only on my second semester at SEMO and I have to say that SEMO is a very welcoming college with many leadership and non leadership opportunities. Most of my teachers so far have been amazing. I have only had a couple teachers that which their teaching ways where not in my liking. Either way, all my teachers were willing to help me get the work done on time."
Senior,4,I have had a lot of good experiences here.  I have had amazing teachers that have pushed me to be a better student. SEMO has a beautiful campus and the city loves to help out the college students.  Homecoming is a holiday in Cape Girardeau and it is always so much fun. I would recommend this university.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy most of my classes at Southeast Missouri State University! I am an Accounting major, and I find that most of the professors in the college of business are very helpful and care about their subject matter! One thing that could definitely improve is safety on campus. I would suggest more cameras to improve this."
Senior,4,I liked the education program and the professors that taught for the education program. One thing I would change would be the parking services department and how they hand out parking tickets and parking passes
Alum,4,"I loved my time at SEMO! It's a beautiful campus full of many different people, majors, and activities."
Freshman,4,This college is high quality and affordable. They are focused on helping students receive a good education at a good price.
Sophomore,4,I appreciate the incorporation of the arts campus to the overall experience. I can still be a fine arts student while still getting an average education. It's like going to an arts school but the pond is smaller so I basically go to two schools for the price of one.
Freshman,4,"This is a beautiful campus with so many things to get involved in. You’ll have several resources to be able to succeed and it’s very hard to be bored while doing it. This school is very affordable, the people here make it seem like a home away from home. Just be careful riding the shuttles. The drivers are wack and the schedule is way off."
Niche User,4,the college itself is very good and offers departments that other schools dont necessarily have strong focus in. their arts program is outstanding and is backed by wonderful sponsors and professors.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful.  I have gone many times and It just feels like home.  I would recommend going to Southeast Missouri State University to anyone that wants a medium-sized university, but it is still small enough to feel homey."
Sophomore,4,"A successful and exciting institution great potential to prepare students for the future.  I highly recommend Greek life, as it made my first year of college so much more enjoyable, there are times when the university emits a mediocre vibe, but it is still an overall tolerable university to attend in all aspects of college life, both academic and social."
Freshman,4,"Since i'm an incoming freshman, theres not much I can say of what i don't like about Semp, rather than I wish my dorm had two seperate bathrooms for and me and my personal roomate nd the other for my other two roommates.  But overall, from what I seen, the campus is nice. The people were nice, and it seem like a nice school to attend!"
Junior,4,"SEMO is a great school to get a cheap, but meaningful, education. There is always some type of event going on on campus, and, if you know where to look, you can always find something to do. Cape Girardeau isn't much of a city so you have to learn to make your own fun and try something new."
Sophomore,4,"My experience here was a good one, I made lots of new friends, the classes were interesting and greek life is great."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy student life at SEMO and definitely recommend participating in activities on campus. The campus is the perfect size to feel at home and you will always know someone while on campus, but it is still big enough to where you can still meet plenty of new people. Most of the students and staff are extremely friendly and I couldn't imagine going to school anywhere else. The dorms and food selection aren't perfect for everyone, but attending and living at SEMO is affordable in comparison to most other universities."
Junior,4,SEMO is a diverse institution with great faculty and staff. It seems like everybody always has a smile on their face when walking around a campus. The school also has a great recreation center with personal trainers that are free for current students.
Freshman,4,So far the campus is fantastic. I had a nice tour around and seen the well-kept dorms. Southeast Missouri State University is not just a school its a family. All majors of the school get along with one another. I am happy to say I am a Redhawk!
Sophomore,4,"Southeast truly is a melting pot. On a short 5 minute walk, I have managed to hear 4 different languages and encounter many people from different parts of the globe. Diversity at southeast is something that I really do appreciate, since I’m from a small town I’ve never had the chance to be surrounded by so much culture. Though, no school is perfect. That being said, something I would like to see improved is the meal options on campus, because at times it feels like the school has no regard for student health in that respect, even though we pay money for our meal plans."
Freshman,4,"I  am a first year pre-med cellist. I really love my orchestra classes buy the others are harder and more expensive than expected. I do not live on campus because it is cheaper to rent. Luckily I found a nice place with a very short commute. There is nothing for lgbt students, such as myself."
Freshman,4,"Southeast Missouri State University is an average sized college in Cape Girardeau. The school population is not too big or too small, it's just in the middle. Southeast Missouri state university has good professors and they are available outside classrooms either during their office hours or by appointment."
Senior,4,"Small school with really small class sizes that make it easy to connect with professors and classmates. Fun nightlife and a good amount of things to do, but don't expect a big city. Definitely more of a small-town feel,  but you won't regret it!"
Niche User,4,"Like the area, and also the clubs and activities you're able to be apart of. The schooling is hard, but you do learn a lot. Able to make friends fairly easy. The food court has a varitey of things to choose from which is awesome."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed the dedication that my professors and other staff put into my education and towards me a person. There are endless ways to get involved on this campus, and all of them welcome new members with open arms. The sense of community at this university is like none other!"
Sophomore,4,I am halfway through my first year at SEMO and so far it is pretty good. Just writhing this review for money.
Junior,4,"You always hear that your years in high school will be the best you've ever had. For me, the few year I've spent at SEMO have been the best. I believe that's because of the well rounded university that it is."
Niche User,4,I like the fact that it's close to home and anyone who goes there can still see family as long as their not an off campus resident.
Niche User,4,"I haven't attended SEMO yet. I have lived in the same city my whole life. I have noticed that many people love it. Southeast Missouri State University has a beautiful campus. Although it seems great, I heard that the parking situation is tough for those attending."
Niche User,4,"The staff/professors at SEMO were friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed my time at the regional campus, the main campus, and the online courses were wonderful as well. SEMO has a lot to offer!!!!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Southeast Missouri State University. This school feels like home to me, and the campus is beautiful. I always feel welcome in every aspect of this school. Our president is very involved and supportive on this campus. This school is like a big family and everyone should alsways feel welcome here on this campus."
Niche User,4,The last Two years I visited the school for basketball camps and got to travel around and see the campus and where students dorms where. I enjoyed the time i had down there in the gym and I like the staff members. I didn't get too go too any classes or anything but I've been looking at the majors at this school and a lot of them have caught my eyes. I play sports and I really like how the players treat each other
Junior,4,"When first arriving at Southeast Missouri State University Fall 2016 for my freshman year, I was nervous and a tad bit skeptical. I didn't know anyone and barely had friends here. I made it my choice to stay inside of my dorm room because I figured that there was nothing for me to do. As I started going outside of my room more, I met new people and began to do new things. Everyone was very inviting and happy to have me here. The professors were great and didn't mind taking the extra step on helping me get through with anything that I may have needed help with. The campus as a whole is a pretty large campus with variety of things to do. Even though there are lot of great things about SEMO, there is a lot of things that can be fixed, such as the food options and the time classes are held . From being nervous and skeptical, I am now a generous and more outgoing student on campus. If you're considering SEMO as a option, just come take a tour and see the campus for yourself."
Freshman,4,Very clean campus. Very nice place .Easy to get around. Close to every thing you will need to get to. People are helpful and seem happy to be here. I have made a lot of new freinds and and happy I picked Southesat. They make it easy to get what you need and help you find the best fit for you. If you have any question they are more than happy to help you find and get the answers you are looking for. My family went here and I am following in the same foot steps hoping that I find the same out come they had or even better.
Alum,4,"Great experience! Small town with enough to do to have fun, but still remain focused. Teachers we’re well rounded within the campus as well as counterparts. Good food as well! Dorms were nice to live in as well."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, clean, local, and spacious. The Admmisions office is well informed and the staff communicate clearly. There is a variety of foods and students. The bathrooms are modern and clean. The advisors are patient and understanding. They are firm to guide you. Everyone you speak to on staff is helpful and very informative. Having been intimidated by the whole prospect of college the people at SEMO have been the best."
Junior,4,"I joined because they have an excellent psychology department, in both the bachelors and masters program. The campus is spread out, but they have public transport to help fix it."
Freshman,4,Southeast Missouri State University has such a wide range of diversity. I am able to meet people of different cultures and races. The professors make an effort and want to see their students succeed which is something hard to come by.
Graduate Student,4,I have enjoyed attending SEMO Unoversity. SEMO offers a variety of activities for individuals and truly cares about their students. Professors are always available for questions and tutoring. SEMO provides a well rounded education and degrees for all.
Senior,4,"The school is very affordable, and I feel that the education that I'm receiving is worth the time investment. I do feel, however, that the school, in particular the computer science department (my area of study) is somewhat behind the modern cutting edge technology that currently exists."
Sophomore,4,Semo is mostly a good school but their math department and professors in it are really bad and rude. I also wish the main campus still offered a minor in zoology.
Graduate Student,4,I would recommend the Online MBA program.  It was challenging and worth the reward.  Obtaining my MBA from SEMO has allowed me to continue my education and be accepted to Creighton University's DBA program.
Sophomore,4,"I'm an online student at SEMO. I wish there was more interaction with and campus clubs available to the online students so that we to can get a fulfilling college experience without physically being on campus. So far I have had pretty great teachers. My first class after getting married and going back to school I was going through a very traumatic point in my life and when I emotionally went into crisis mode, I simply couldn't focus or retain what I was learning. My teacher worked with me to explain what resources I had and what my options were. I ended up taking an incomplete for the class and so that I could finish it the following semester. I was able to earn a 4.0 in the class without dropping it and wasting tuition money by re-paying to re-take it. Most of the teachers truly want their students to succeed here."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy most things about the university and find that it is a welcoming place. I, personally, had a bad experience with a roommate but other than that my first year went without a hitch. The only thing I would change is the food in the UC. There aren't many vegetarian/vegan options and I'd liked to see that changed."
Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes which makes the student to professor ratio fairly small. This also helps with the professor's accessibility to meet your needs by being able to focus on a low number of students. Southeast Missouri State also contains emergency poles which immediately calls university police if you press the button in danger. If you are standing at one pole, it is guaranteed that you will be able to see another emergency pole with a blue light. There are minimal things I would like to change about this university, but I would like to see a change with the healthy food options. I enjoy eating fruits and vegetables as snacking food, but the ones available are not fresh nor appetizing. Overall a very good university with an effort to help students succeed."
Sophomore,4,I love how small the classes are. I feel that I have a very good connection with the professors and I've had a great time so far.
Sophomore,4,"I love that SEMO has many online classes to choose from and that you can have your textbooks shipped to and from your home. I also like that each textbook you rent from campus is only twenty five dollars instead of hundreds of dollars. I dislike that the advisers I have had at SEMO because they seemed very uninterested in my college path and were not very helpful with class section. So far, the teachers I have had are nice and very attentive when I have questions and need help. I would recommend SEMO to anyone who is looking to future their education."
Freshman,4,I like that it us close to home for me and that I have made so many friends that ill have a life time
Senior,4,"I love the university. The professors are okay overall, it is really hit or miss. My main problem is the food. There are no really healthy options, and the options that they do have are not that great."
Alum,4,"Southeast Missouri State University serves as a beacon of hope for a town that's struggling to keep up with the rest of the world. There are college towns and then there are towns with colleges. Cape Girardeau is the latter. The University has been here to help make It has a wonderful study-abroad program that brings in students from foreign countries like China. This exposure to other cultures allows Cape Girardeau to open its arms and forces the city to interact with people are different than themselves. The university has also provided a space for LGBTQ+, black, and Muslim communities to grow and lean on each other in a town where opportunities for minorities are lacking. “SEMO,” like all places, has its ups and downs – strengths and weaknesses. But it’s trailblazing the way into the future for Cape Girardeau, an otherwise average town in the Midwest. If it weren’t for the University, there’d be no culture, no diversity, and most importantly – no growth."
Alum,4,"I visited quite a few colleges before deciding on SEMO. As soon as I stepped on campus, I knew this was the college for me. Something about the place clicked. Most teachers are knowledgeable and helpful, and those which aren't just provide you with experience with dealing with difficult and distasteful individuals you'll meet throughout your life."
Sophomore,4,"One of the most important things I like about Southeast Missouri Statd is how they like to get people involved with things on campus. I love how they care about everyone’s academic by having programs that can help keep our grades up. They provide tutoring Session for any course taken, a writing lab to help with any form of writing, and SI sessions which is a extra helping class that helps you with material you not understanding during class."
Sophomore,2,I took online classes because of COVID-19 and it was not a very positive experience. I just ended up having to teach myself all the material.
Sophomore,2,"Most all of the professors are great and care about their students.  But is a commuter campus for sure.  Nothing to do on campus, even if there is something no one goes.  The only thing to get involved in is greek life, that's the only community you'll find there.  The dorms are disgusting and have mold.  The athletics are a joke and no one cares.  Food is terrible.  Everyone hates it there, feels like community college.  That would be a cheaper option."
Junior,2,"Southeast Missouri State University needs to focus more on financial aid to returning students. I’ve noticed that my freshman year I had so many scholarships and things to persuade me to attend the school but my second and third year I wasn’t given any scholarships and I had a well enough gpa that I should have received at least one. It seems to me that they focus more on getting students into the school than helping students get out of the school- which should be the ultimate goal. Also, I think the school should add more healthier options in the redhawks market and upgrade the salad bar instead of adding unhealthy restaurants. The good thing about semo would be the many resources that are available to you as a student. There are writing centers, most teachers are helpful, supplemental instruction, and tutors. All of which are free of charge. The only thing I would change is how you have to visit the tutor once a week instead of being able to go when you feel you need the help."
Junior,2,"Advisors not always helpful and can lead you down the wrong path, so don’t blindly follow them. Financial aid is terrible. Campus police do not tend to help when a student is assaulted, blaming the student. Very insensitive when it comes to people under stress"
College Freshman,2,"I had filed a report in January, they did not get back with me until April."
College Freshman,2,I have this annoying rattling in my room that FM said they could not fix.
College Freshman,2,"Not many people attend sports on my campus, recreational sports are a bigger part of campus-life. Most of us get together with a group of friends and will use the fields and courts on campus. Our teams do not have many fans, but we love our school and cheer them on if we hear about a game."
College Freshman,2,"The rec center is wonderful. However, our sports teams are terrible and should not be funded as much as they are."
College Sophomore,2,I think that semo is lacking in the internship opportunities department. I have found every internship that I have applied for so far. How am I expected to find an internship when I don't have help from the university as well as a job and career when I graduate?
College Sophomore,2,"Any time we try to contact financial aid, there is a very long wait period over the phone, and when you finally do get to speak with a representative, they may or may not be able to help you. The only sure fire way to get your problem solved is to physically go to the financial aid office located in Academic Hall."
College Freshman,2,"As an international student, there aren't many opportunities. They don't seem to want to help."
College Freshman,2,"There are parties every weekend put on by the Greek organizations. The amount of alcohol at those parties is astounding. This definitely has a negative impact on the student experience. Underage college students are able to drink as much as they want, which is causing harm to their health. Also, they could endanger themselves while being under the influence."
College Sophomore,2,I had to go to the president to finally receive aid from the financial aid office. But everything got sorted out and I got my financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,2,They live in dorms together instead of houses which I think takes away from the experience.
College Junior,2,My school offers little scholarships and you have to be the smartest of the smart in order to even be considered for a scholarship.  Which is unfortunate for some students because people don't know or understand someone's financial situation.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life stands for good causes, but the students they choose could act in a better way."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the food is awful
College Freshman,2,I never feel safe wherever I am. Not even in my dorm hall.
College Sophomore,2,"DO NOT LIVE IN DEARMONT! It is awful. It has good community, but the rooms are tiny and its old. And my freaking AC unit looks like something out of the late 80s"
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've heard, the health center is awful. Just go to the hospital right down the street. 

There isn't a lot of crime here and its a really safe area. There's also emergency buttons everywhere if you need them."
College Freshman,2,They are rude and disrespectful
College Senior,2,Worst part about the campus
College Junior,2,"SEMO does provide transportation around campus. I dont use it often, because it is far easier to hike up the hills than it is to use the bus system. Every time I do try to use the system, The drivers barely even stop. It definitely isnt reliable"
College Junior,2,"My problem with financial aid is mainly the people in charge of it. Everyone ive ever dealt with have been so unbelievably rude I try not to go there. Luckily the main office I deal with is VA, and the biggest hassle I ever had with them is that it wasnt electronic. This past semester they switched all the forms to be electronic. Again if they would fire everyone in the FA office and hire new people the whole campus would be a lot happier."
College Junior,2,"Pretty much all at the UC (ive never been to any of the places for dorms), so a whole side of campus is pretty much empty. They did just add a subway on the new side of campus, but it is so unbelievably slow it is easier to get in your car and go to a real subway. All the prices are pretty pricey, and dont have much variety at all it seems. "
College Junior,2,"hahahahahaha haha...well... Southeast Missouri weather..there isnt even a word to describe that. Here is a recent example for you: Beginning of the week was literally 70 degrees, then LITERALLY two days later we had an inch of ice, three inches of sleet, then 10 inches of snow. Southeast Missouri truly has very crazy weather, and teachers do understand the weather situation since so many people commute to school. "
College Junior,2,"Okay so I cannot say that I am active in school, so this almost isnt even fair to answer in a way. But on the academic side, I feel like I have in fact learned a lot. I was fortunate enough to have one wonderful teacher for all my science/medical classes, but for the maaaannnyyyy general education classes you need, the teachers are alright. The faculty really is terrible. Everyone I have had to deal with are so so rude!! If they fired everyone and rehired people who are actually pleasant, I would stay. "
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is SUCH a pain!!! The campus police have a division for students to have jobs by going around and giving people tickets if they do not have a permit for that area of campus. You may think you won't get caught....you will. With the campus being hilly the perimeter (furthest away from campus) is such a pain. Spots are constantly filled it seems. its always smart to show up about 20 minutes before class, to be safe just in case you have to park even further away than purchased or intended. There is VERY little free parking on campus, manly side streets. There arent even any open at 9pm on campus it seems. With SEMO, no matter what parking permit you got, make sure to have a good pair of shoes. you will be walking A LOT!!!"
College Freshman,2,Average Missouri weather I'd say.
College Senior,2,"Chartwells is the company in charge of the food on campus, and it is not very good. Luckily there is a Papa Johns, Chick Fil-A, Starbucks, and Subway."
College Senior,2,"Parkng on campus is not so good. The amount of students that attend Southeast Missouri State is drastically incresing, leaving lots of students without a place to park. Sometimes you have to park on a near by street which results in being late to class most of the time. The school board is not responding well to the issue. More parking spaces needs to be in construction."
College Senior,2,"There are many students on campus, who consume alcohol and smoke around Southeast. I'd be lying if I told you there were not students who drink inside their dorms, and you can actually see students smoking illegal substances outside of their dorms, and around campus. DPS and the police often catch students who do this, but Southeast also has designated smoking areas, so the school is lenient, for the most part."
College Senior,2,"I am still attempting to get into my Majors program.  It is very competitive and the requirements are not very fair, in my opinion."
College Senior,2,SEMO is trying to build a stronger math and science sector of academics.  It is mostly geared toward liberal arts.  The campus is small and parking is good.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is always better if you haven't had it in a while and you're hungry. Some of it isn't bad, but you don't want to eat the same thing to often!"
College Sophomore,2,"There parties aren't that great but they're something to do. No one really cares about the Greeks though, unless they are Greek or are seeking to date Greek."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life here is mostly revolving around parties and some other events at Southeast, but its not a big deal if you aren't a part of one. The only thing I like about Greek Life here is that they offer professional fraternity options such as Sigma Alpha Iota, which is the professional music fraternity."
College Sophomore,2,I only lived on campus for 1 year and it was in Dearmont.I do not suggest this dorm. The rooms were tiny and bathrooms were cleaned once a week. My RA never enforced quiet hours and was actually a major cause of noise disturbance on the floor.
College Senior,2,"There is not much to do in this town, other than drink. The casino is new, but not appealing to broke college students, such as myself. Campus occasionally holds activities. The town has rec teams though!"
College Freshman,2,The weather can change you in a minute. It's never really hot but it does get humid. And it's never really cold but the wind is crazy. It's best to keep a hoodie and hat at all times.
College Sophomore,2,"It seems like the drug scene is pretty big at SEMO.  When looking at the fraternity parties and the fact there is a club across the street from one of the Dorm areas is seems like a big deal.  Also with the river so close many people go down there and get involved with illegal activity.  I do believe the biggest issue though is the alcohol, it is everywhere."
College Junior,2,SEMO is very diverse and has lots of foreign students. They however seem to stay in groups on their own and to themselves.
College Junior,2,The parking at campus is very far away from most of the buildings. It can be very hard to find a spot in the mornings sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,"I have financial aid and I have scholarships, but it is not enough. It was supposed to be a lot cheaper than it is, but they ""deceived"" us because we though we were getting in state tuition. It is what they told us multiple times. Yet, a few weeks before freshman year started, they informed us we owed them way more than we had though and they said we did not have in state tuition. Therefore money and tuition is a struggle. 
Make sure you sit down and talk with the people until you have worn out the conversation. Every detail and aspect must be figured out."
College Freshman,2,The campus police see drunk people every where and just walk by them. they also dont control the niose at all.
College Junior,2,"Fast Food – The majority of your off-campus and affordable choices are going to be fast food! There are a number of restaurants with excellent cuisine, but if you're on a budget then you'll want to avoid them!"
College Senior,2,"Cape Girardeau Average at Best – Cape Girardeau is a medium sized town. Although it is right on the Mississippi River with a lot of historical background, there is minimal activities, shopping, and other events that take place here."
College Sophomore,2,Not Very Diverse – There are some international students but the campus is predominately white.
College Senior,2,Not Much to Do – There isnt really anything fun to do in Cape Girardeau. If you like going to the movies or a little mall thats about it. There are a few bars and one club if you like the nightlife.
College Freshman,2,"Not Impressive – People have some school spirit, but it's not a lot."
College Freshman,2,Not Too Strict – The campus only interferes when there's big issue.
College Junior,2,"Could Be Better – I used to think the food was really good. Until about two months into the semester, when the cooks apparently decided to get lazy. Still, I survive when I must eat there."
College Sophomore,2,"There Are Opportunities for Cultural Difference. There are many International students on our campus. Southeast wants us, as a student body, to be more accepting of different cultures. And as a whole, I feel that many of the students are very accepting of these different cultures. But, in an area known as the &amp;quot;bootheel&amp;quot;, we do have many white students. 
Since there are different religious centers around the campus, there is a wide variety of acceptance in this area, so there is more available to students of different beliefs, which becomes less of a challenge for many people."
College Freshman,2,"GOOD LUCK finding a good parking spot if your commuting. If your commuting to the main campus, i'd suggest leaving your house pretty early in order to give yourself plenty of time to make it to class."
College Freshman,2,"Its not bad. You do end up parking a far ways from your dorm which is kind of
Scary at night but it is always well lite. They have the housing and no actual parki g close. A parking garage 
Would be ideal I this situation."
College Freshman,2,"Pig Lot – Parking is awesome if you live in towers and have preferred parking. For everyone else though, it's quite a walk to get to your car."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few spots, and where there are lots of open spaces is the other side of campus. If you want to park near your dorm, you have to pay for the preferred parking, which is a lot of money. If you are not able to get preferred parking, you have to pay close to the same amount for perimeter parking."
College Sophomore,2,"Easy to Navigate...But Horrible for Drivers – While there are plenty of shuttle buses that run on Southeast, parking is always difficult as there are a small number of parking lots on campus and many students who would like to park there.  As a result, most students are forced to park on the far side of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Just Not That Important. When football is winning at Southeast, everyone cares what is going on.  Other than that, no one even talks about the sports teams.  I am a sophomore and did not even know until about a month ago that we had a track team.  The people who care really care, but most of us cannot be bothered to support teams that usually lose.  Attendance is low to games and even the players do not show much enthusiasm."
College Freshman,2,Campus Police/Need for a Car – There is definitely a need for a car on this campus. The police on campus are very strict on where you can park and where you cant. Last semester they made over 1 million dollars just on parking tickets alone
Niche User,1,"It sadden me that a school with such a great impact on students future would accept a student and turn around and decline someone for an offense that happened when they were 17 yrs old. I hate to think that the color of ones skin played a factor into that decision but it's hard to think otherwise when I was moving forward with class schedule, drug screen, and classes starting 2 days prior to receiving such notice. Now I bet you can look into that same class and not find one person with skin of color and I bet you can at least find one white student with some sort of background  on their record. But here I sit trying figure out my next move to make sure this never happens to a person of color again.
Aa"

Freshman,1,"Teacher's either didn't know how to teach or wouldn't, no food options were open on weekends, internet to do work was slow, 3/4 of the tuition is just dorm and food plan costs. I got 40+ credits in high school to save money as they said 57 were required to live off campus. Not until I was into a housing contract and paid in full for my first semester did they mention its 57 POST highschool credits. So they trap you away from home, keep you on a prison meal plan, charge you out the a** to pay for petty Ice Cream Socials and the like, and no one wants to socialize unless they're in Greek life with you. Both myself and a friend dropped out within 2 months if each other because it is terrible. If I'm gonna get a worse education for higher price than my local junior college 15 minutes away, I'm not going. Overall: don't go unless you have 57 post highschool credits to save you the ridiculous amount they charge for things you'll never use"
Niche User,1,I have not been to semo but I have heard good things about there campus. I feel like Southeast Missouri State University is a good Univeristy.
Alum,1,"Do not waste your time or money here.  The associate dean is racist and biased.  I have 5 years experience at this school.  Horrible professors.  Horrible staff. There's a reason it's 10 grand cheaper per year than other universities in MO.  You get what you pay for.  Pretty campus but don't leave campus.  Drug/shooting-infested area.  Not safe.  Poor education and the associate dean thinks he's a town sheriff.  His ego is as big as all outdoors and when you lead with racism, bias, and ego, everyone suffers."
Niche User,1,"Beware of their financial aide department. They are extremely rude. My last semester, I went to make sure all of my paperwork for FAFSA was filled out correctly. They told me everything was fine. I knew something wasn't right because I wasn't able to accept my loans. After a week of being told that all of my paperwork was correct and I just had to wait for it to be processed, I get an email saying that my classes are in danger of being cancelled. So I go back to the financial aid department and am told rather rudely that I failed to turn in a form. When I asked the woman why I wasn't told sooner, she told me that I should have known since this wasn't my first semester. I told her that I had been in there 6 or 7 times in the last week, asking if any other paperwork was needed and I was told no. The woman told me that I was just supposed to know and that I needed to be an adult. I would recommend looking elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,I don't participate in such activities.
College Sophomore,1,"We could use better professors. Teach for America, maybe?"
College Sophomore,1,All the students do is become alcoholics.
College Freshman,1,"Pardon my french, screw Greek life. It's nothing and you pay so much money to do nothing, lie about your service hours, and drink on a dry campus."
College Freshman,1,I just had difficulty with all the forms. make sure to fill them out correctly.
College Freshman,1,Most difficult thing for me on campus is parking. Just being a freshman it's hard.
College Senior,1,"If you get to campus at the wrong time, you may never find a spot for the lot your designated tag says you can park in. The ticket writers are hounds that will find you and give you a ticket or tickets. Tickets prices are ridiculous. "
College Junior,1,The computers are terribly slow and usually broken.
College Senior,1,The parking here is very poor.  Not only do you have to pay 100+ for a parking permit. But there is rarely a place to park.  It is honestly a nightmare and has made me late for class at times.  They keep building more buildings but do not supply more parking lots.
College Senior,1,"Not only does just about every significant sport here (such as basketball and football) not compete with higher qualified schools, there is no enthusiam to get to that level. We hardly ever win any games and they are completely a drag.  Honestly if it wasn't entertaining to watch the cheerleaders and the dancers at the games, I would give our athletics a F."
College Freshman,1,"It is terrible parking on campus. If you're looking for a good spot 5 minutes before class starts, you're doomed! Try leaving a good 30 minutes before class to get a good space and be on time. Freshman usually get the worst parking. But, it gets better."
College Junior,1,"There is not enough parking on campus. When permits are issued they issue them to more students than there are parking spots. If you have an early class it is easy to find a spot but if you have a later class you will be driving around for a while till one opens up, so get to class early so you will have time to find one. The campus does provide free shuttles available to all students. so if you live near a bus stop i would recommend using that instead of your car. You will save gas and money!"
College Junior,1,"There isn't any dinings halls on campus.  The only thing food related on campus is a vending machine.  I wish that our campus had a small place for us to eat, but since it doesn't we enjoy going home to eat or grabbing something from one of the local restaurants."
College Sophomore,1,Not understanding and have no personal connections

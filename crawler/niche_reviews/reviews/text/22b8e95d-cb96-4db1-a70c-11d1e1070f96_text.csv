College Sophomore,4,"I am happy with my financial aid, but I wish I could find scholarships for the summer semester."
College Student,4,"The Merit Scholarship I receive has helped me cover the costs of college life a lot, the financial aid staff was pretty helpful and kind. If you wish to have financial aid help at BC, you should first check your status as a student, for instance; if you're an athlete you should try your best to get a sport scholarship. If don't, you can always see if they have specific scholarships for your major, such as the fine arts scholarship. The other way is to study as hard as you can to get an academic scholarship."

Junior,2,When I was at Bluefield College it started out as a nice place to be. When you go to class the teachers will learn your name and make sure you do your work. the staff care about who you are. the people around you are not who they seem. Bluefield had a lot of drama because its such a small school. if  you hate drama don't go here but the academics are good.
Freshman,2,"At first I liked Bluefield college because it was a small school near home. I have grown to dislike it now due to personal reasons. The school is a good place to go if you're SUPER religious, you have to attend chapel 10 times a semester for credits like it's required. If you're the type of person that likes small colleges and colleges that give you that high school feel than Bluefield is a perfect choice for you."
Freshman,2,It's very small school and it honestly just feels like you're in high school all over again. Everyone is very immature and act like they're still in middle school. If you like a very small school it's okay. They also say they're a Christian school but they don't always act like it.
College Sophomore,2,I personally do not like that the school revolves around the athletes. There are other students too.
College Freshman,2,campus was small and kinda in an area where nothing went down...security drove around all night but only one car thats it
College Freshman,2,dont even recall having one
College Freshman,2,they were made up most of them.
College Sophomore,2,"It is a small school in a small town that doesn't have a nightlife. In order to have fun, the students organize their own party in their own houses, however it is always the same thing."
College Sophomore,2,I am not in to the Greek life stuff
College Freshman,2,There are quite a few rules that don't make sense and are pointless
College Freshman,2,Barely any operating hours of cafeteria. Other colleges' are open until 2 AM. Not much variety. Only starbucks is other option and that isn't even filling most of the time.
College Student,2,"When it comes to the cafeteria food, I'm glad that I don't have a meal plan. Whenever I eat there, the food served is not healthy or even good. It would be better if the food service provided good meals for the students of the college, because then the students wouldn't have to go to Starbucks to buy a slightly better food."
College Freshman,2,Their is alot of cheap place but their isn't a more variety of different restuaraunts.
College Sophomore,2,Mainly fast food options and hardly anything else.
College Senior,2,Not many places to go for nightlife.
College Senior,2,"The soccer, basketball, and baseball team all have their own party houses weekly as long as they're not traveling. Clubs around the Bluefield area tend to be a little on the sketchy side but if that doesn't bother you then party away. I have seen a town transit but have not personally used it. The town over-all however is more on the downlow and not much happens without friends."
College Sophomore,2,Visitation Hours â€“ Bluefield College is a liberal arts christian school so the visitation hours are very strict the girls and boys live in seperate dorms and visit hours during the week are from 6-11 pm and on the weekends there 4p.m to 1 a.m. if you dont follow the visitation rules you lose visitation for a certain amount of time
Recent Alumnus,2,Needs Improvment â€“ There were some professors who to put it plainly did not do their job.
College Freshman,2,"Here at Bluefield College there are 2 soroitites and 1 fraternity. All three are Christian-based but do not have really stong appeal to lots of incoming freshmen, not alot of things are hosted by the greek-life. we do noot have separate housing for the greek because we focus on unity."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly one of the worst experiences of my life, I was absolutely miserable at Bluefield college. I was paying 32,000 a year (was on a football scholarship) and was dreading every second there. I made a decision to give up my scholarship but still looking to pursue football. I want to attend to attend a college that will make me happy and I will enjoy and not feel like its a chore to wake up or breath air."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to do. It's a quiet Christian college in the mountains.
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife at all. Unless you know people off campus to drink or go to parties but that is at houses. Or you can travel a hour or two to another city
College Junior,1,I feel like the main administration is far from connecting with students. The increase of tuition is not effecting them it's us. And as many talks as they want to have at the end of the day a student is not coming back and they still have their job... Academic standards for students here are not bad except athletes. They are really given amazing scholarships and low goals and most drop out first semester while others would kill to have such luxuries awarded
College Junior,1,Not Good â€“ The food at this college is horrible. Everything is fried and unhealthy. They only serve fresh fruit in the mornings and the salad bar who knows how long that stuff has sat out.  There will be several meals where it looks to be leftovers from the prevous days.  The dinning hall hours are horrible also.  The cafe is only open at certain times.  I know not every student is concerned with how healthy the food is but when you're taking a nutrition class and expected to eat healthy it's impossible.

Graduate Student,5,The staff and professors are amazing and very supportive of the students. As a smaller private school I am able to receive the attention and help I was not able to get at a large public school. Everyone from the staff to the students are dedicated and it is a pleasure to be surrounded by people who care about quality education.
Graduate Student,5,Family environment. Supportive environment. Campus is beautiful with lots of places to relax and reflect.
Graduate Student,5,"I have had an amazing experience thus far at Alliant! The staff are amazing and always helpful. I enjoy that they use their own clinical experience to help students understand the material. The only thing i would change is the price, but it is still worth the great education!"
Niche User,5,Awesome response from the help desk and the rest of the policy makers of Alliant university. The online application form submission process is thoroughly international. This is recommended for all international students and teachers.
Alum,5,"I have POSITIVE comments about Alliant. I graduated with a PsyD from this school when it was formerly known as USIU, back in the 1990s. My professors were excellent and I completed my required pre-doctoral practicum/post-doc supervised hours with well-qualified PhDs. I might add: the comprehensive exam at that time was very thorough, detailed and challenging. If you didnt know the material, you did not pass the comp exam. Since passing the EPPP, I have been employed as a practicing clinician with a large hospital for many years, and also supervise PhD and PsyD Clinical Psychology students. Everyone has to pass the EPPP no matter where you go to school. Every psych program has its pros-and-cons. I was very happy with my education and training at USIU."
College Student,5,This school is very professional and caters to individual needs of their students.
Recent Alumnus,5,Love that then staff provides guidance along the way.
College Senior,5,Professors are very experienced and intelligent
Recent Alumnus,5,Enjoy the small class size allows for a better learning experience.
College Senior,5,"The school should be considered with UC San Diego and USD, because the faculty are very professional. The teachers are former Ivy League graduates, and posses extensive experience in their field, both practical application and scholarly research of information. The school does need to update it's campus, but from an education perspective. Theirs small class sizes, you get individual attention, which you don't get at USD or UC San Diego, the professors know you by your name. The school is an international university, which means it's exposed to people from every country in the world. So basically, the only difference between USD or UC San Diego and Alliant. Is the name recognition and the classrooms need to be updated."
College Student,5,The Financial Office always gives you quick replies and is a pleasure to work with. They go above and beyond to find you funding.
Recent Alumnus,5,Went well for me and I received the help I needed.
College Junior,5,"I love being a graduate student in my school of Marital and Family Therapy. The program is intense, but I feel prepared to go into my clinicals."
College Junior,5,My program is very involved. Small classroom sizes means more personalized attention.
College Junior,5,"I love my field of Marital and Family Therapy, and my school is very helpful concerning receiving internships."
College Junior,5,"I live in California, and it's sunny year round. I enjoy being outdoors, playing sports."
College Student,5,"There are great networking opportunities, I get to intern in the community and the workload is not terrible"
College Student,5,I had no issues with financial aid. The financial aid office is very helpful and answers questions by email quickly
College Student,5,There are no drug problems on campus. My cohort drinks socially.
College Student,5,There have never been any campus crimes or attacks.
College Student,5,I really enjoy the professors and classes.
College Sophomore,5,We have a huge parking lot with hundreds of spaces. It's amazing compared to my undergraduate school at the University of Washington.
College Sophomore,5,"There is no drug scene at my school. I am in a small graduate school in a doctoral program, where drugs are unheard of as far as being used by the students."
College Freshman,5,Living in Sacramento California the worst I've encountered is chilliness and rain and maybe the combo of both. Mainly a comfortable climate
College Freshman,5,Being in the Clinical Forensic Program is great. The classes are small so you get all the attention you may need from the Professors. The professors are very experienced in their field and very knowledgeable. The work load is tough but it is created in order to make this 6 year program a 4 year program so students get out in the field after their first semester of classes and continue on until they graduate.  There is also a great placement program for practicums as well as internships. Each student is assigned a doctoral chair when working on there dissertation as well as a co-chair.
College Junior,5,"San Francisco is the Best city in the US. You will never have a bad time here. It's a bit expensive sometimes. However, there are so many low cost or free events happening that you'll never be bored."
College Junior,5,The school just opened its doors to undergrad students and is offering scholarship opportunities to cover tuition cost in the amount of several thousand dollars simply for choosing Alliant International University. 
College Junior,5,San Diego is a beautiful 75 degrees year round. 
College Junior,5,Most students recognize that any drug use will result in loss of freedoms and willingly respect these boundaries. 
College Junior,5,"The campus operates much like a family or group of like-minded friends and therefore, the experience of living and working on campus is very casual and comfortable. "
College Junior,5,"This is an international University with many international students involved in campus events and classes.  Walking through campus,  you can hear many conversations happening all in different languages: French and German being very common. "
College Junior,5,The small campus allows for clear visibility and trust among a family like  community.  The only concern in the rural school's campus is an unwanted encounter with wildlife. 
College Junior,5,San Diego is known for its mediterranean climate which is ideal for getting around campus.  Good weather means less chances of classes and activities canceling and promotes outdoor socialization.
College Student,5,"It's always sunny and nice, which is why I love attending school in southern California!"
College Freshman,5,I do not know of anyone who partakes in it and have not received any peer pressure to do so.
Recent Alumnus,5,AIU is a school that prides itself on cultural diversity and boy do they live up that! There was someone from a different culture in almost all of my classes and I became friends with many people from all over the world.
College Junior,5,San Fransisco is a great town with lots to due great water front and city scape
College Sophomore,5,"Dissertation Class for Psyd's – My school has made our dissertation into a class, I am about to start class soon so I am excited to know that I will have a professor helping me out with the whole process."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The most diverse school you will find!!! If you are looking for diversity then this is the place to go.  I don't think I took any course at the school in which a few students or even a teacher is from another country.  There are many Asians, a few Africans, Europeans ( lot of French, German, and Easterners), and then of course there are many from Mexico and South America.  This school is excellent if you are in the International  Relations or Business program since most of your projects and classes you will have quite a bit of interaction with foreigners."
Recent Alumnus,5,Right in San Diego...Not too far from the beach and its always somewhere in the 70's.  What a place!
Graduate Student,4,The campus itself could use improvement (there's a new campus on the horizon). The faculty are very knowledgeable and really want their students to succeed.
Graduate Student,4,I love the simplicity of their program.  It is made easy to succeed.  The staff is friendly.  There are multiple people to reach out to for help.
Sophomore,4,AIU is multicultural diverse. The Professors truly care about the students success.  The students have a close cohort amongst each other.
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed all of my classes and my professors were approachable and accessible when needed. However, communication is lacking when it comes to things students need to know throughout our time here."
Graduate Student,4,"The professors in the MFT Master's program are very diverse and highly experienced in their field with a genuine interest in the students' success. Administration and staff are friendly, helpful, and always available within a timely manner."
Recent Alumnus,4,Like the small class size. Professors and material is appropriate for career path.
College Senior,4,They really help you find placements.
College Senior,4,great public safety team there
Recent Alumnus,4,"All of the faculty is very helpful and accomodating, and the students are friendly."
College Student,4,"Lots of Options from Downtown to Mission Valley, Scripps Ranch, Mira Mesa, Mission Bay, and La Jolla. If you're in a nice area, costs can get pretty high, but it's worth it because the bad areas are not somewhere you want to live."
College Sophomore,4,The school supports all greek programs so its easy to get involved.
College Sophomore,4,"The students are mixed in age and culture, dating is easy and not competitive."
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are spacious and inviting.
College Junior,4,The professors are very nice and helpful and the class sizes are small.

Recent Alumnus,4,I don't house of campus just rated on what I have heard.
Recent Alumnus,4,Importance of education and attendance is emphasized.
College Freshman,4,For the most part it's  less strict then other schools.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm in a grad program and the professors are friendly. However, in my school psychology program we usually lack feedback on our papers."
Recent Alumnus,4,I far I like it
Recent Alumnus,4,Came across different cultures that have been part of my learning experience
College Sophomore,4,"At Alliant, the PhD Clinical Psychology program is the cream of the crop."
College Sophomore,4,Just follow through with the instructions and mind the deadlines. They really push out a lot of information and have been helpful with any questions or issues.
College Sophomore,4,"I think that it depends on the program, but the clinical phd program has had great results!"
College Junior,4,I do not really see any presence of a drug scene in my graduate program cohorts.
College Junior,4,I have classmates from all over the world. It helps me to to be a culturally competent person because I learn from each individual.
College Student,4,The admissions process is not too bad. The admissions counselor is very helpful and there is a lot of information online.
College Student,4,The weather is usually sunny and around 70 degrees.
College Sophomore,4,There is always wi-fi available on campus and any technical help needed is easily resolved by the IT assistant.
College Junior,4,"Because the school is near many tourist attractions, there is a variety of restaurants near campus."
College Freshman,4,"The facility is on one floor of a building, the parking is great, right of the express way, I live across the street so I can walk to work (student fed work study) and to classes.  It has a decent kitchen/break room, the classes are equipped with SMART board technology and there is sufficient computer lap always available and never full. Professors have reasonable office hours but make themselves available phone, email or text. The SGA-Student government is working hard to get more students involve and I enjoy being a part of that. We also have gotten our veteran's together for support of mental health in the military. It has been very enjoyable attending Alliant International University at Sacramento so far."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid normally goes smoothly if you have enough funds coming to you. This is the first year that I didn't have enough funds and have to pay out of pocket...Hence, looking for scholarships."
College Freshman,4,"The over all program is great. However, we just got notice that the university is no longer accepting applicants and/or new students in the Forensic Filed at this location because of issues with gaining APA accreditation.  My career goal focus is to work in Corrections as a Forensic Psychologist so this decision doesn't effect me unless I wanted to practice outside the Forensic realm."
College Freshman,4,"Our small campus is very diverse. Being an International Student our school is very diverse in race, economic background, religion and sexual orientation. We have a staff and student organization that focuses on promotion diversity as well as cultural awareness."
College Junior,4,"If you want to, okay. If not, that's okay too"
College Junior,4,Downtown San Diego is very close with some of the best nightlife available in southern California. 
College Junior,4,Most parking is at the top of the hill with plentiful of spaces available even at the busiest times. 
College Junior,4,The student services are well known by the staff and clarified for any students who have questions or concerns. 
College Junior,4,"The small setting of Alliant International University allows for the development and growth of deep, lasting relationships. These relationships act as an extension of your own educational cheer leading team, offering expertise and guidance throughout your journey!"
College Junior,4,"My classmates and professors are diverse, approachable, and lively.  There is a cooperative stance with grad students in getting needs met and questions answered.  There is always someone there to point you in the right direction."
College Junior,4,"One aspect I considered when choosing Alliant, was that professors in the psychology programs must maintain a private practice as well as teach.  They have a pulse on the community and keep relevant in their practice and approach."
College Junior,4,"The M/CFT program at Alliant is well-planned.  There is a purpose to the scheduling of courses as each course overlaps and builds on each other.  Diversity awareness is stressed in every course.  The curriculum is vigorous, however, having Alliant on your CV/Resume puts you in the lead for internships and professional employment within the state and nationally."
College Junior,4,The M/CFT curriculum is leading-edge with regard to diversity awareness and preparing you for licensure and internships.
College Junior,4,Alliant is an intimate campus.  There is always plenty of parking and no need to park off-campus.
College Junior,4,Alliant is one of the few colleges that strive for multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity.  Diversity training is the goal rather than a ticked box that will bring in more revenue.  
College Junior,4,The weather there is nice and sunny.
College Senior,4,Lots of parking and a bus stop in the middle of the campus.
College Senior,4,The professors are working professional in the field and are excellent at what they do.
College Sophomore,4,You have to find apply early in order to get all the desired funds for school
College Sophomore,4,Its a very quite and safe college town kind of city

College Freshman,4,"The building is older, but there are no real issues with the facilities. Everything functions as it should and students do not complain about a lack in this area."
College Freshman,4,"Sacramento has nice weather for most of the year. Some rain and cold weather, but no snow and the spring and summer are perfect."
College Freshman,4,"The Sacramento campus is a small satellite campus, mainly for continuing education students so there is no need for school transportation."
Recent Alumnus,4,The small class sizes allowed my teachers to focus on all of their students and the evening courses made it very easy to be a working student! I really enjoyed the attention that professors where able to give each student and the classes were relevant to my goals. I am looking to return for graduate work now because I was so pleased and their unique cultural approach prepared me for the real world and got me a great job!
College Junior,4,Mostly higher education similar in age and social status
Recent Alumnus,4,"Tons of places to go all around San Diego, but there really isn't anything close by to school, it's all at least two fwy exits away. Very few chains a lot of great little holes in the wall."
College Junior,4,"Many buses, bikes, BART, some parking if you elect to drive"
College Junior,4,So far everyone is friendly and motivated to succeed and help
College Sophomore,2,"No career development, no help, no student organizations, no nothing. Under Alliant, San Francisco law school is on is last leg!"
College Sophomore,2,No career development. Very little student resourses
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to party, do not do it here. Other residents are 9/10 likely to call housing on you breaking up a party before it has even started. Overall, 2/10 Look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Food is consistently bad and on occasion good. The price is outrageous if you are not working with a meal plan. It is buffet style so at least that's an option. Nonetheless, there is a lack of nutrition in their food. Overall 4/10 I would avoid eating on campus"
College Sophomore,2,The school does not focus on athletics so sports are secondary.
College Student,2,They do not have enough working computers for students. It's necessary to bring  your own.
College Student,2,The public transportation is only good for locals. If you need to get outside the area it's difficult.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the students on campus are conservative, middle to upper class, cysgender, heterosexual, White students."
College Sophomore,2,"There are too many cliques and superficiality that make it unbearable, at times, to live here. I come from a much larger and diverse city and experienced culture shock for the first year of living in Sacramento, CA."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a variety of cuisines and restaurants located nearby school for off-campus dining, but the quality and taste is not up to par and I have had to complain before - something I never do in a restaurant having restaurant experience, myself."
College Junior,2,"The school's location in a tourist area does not allow for an ease of parking.  The parking is garage only, and is very expensive."
College Freshman,2,"The school/admission process is great and was smooth sailing however, my getting here from the state of Missouri to the state of California has been one disaster after another from broken down vehicle, having to rent a U-Haul to tow my car, with nothing in the U-Haul, my personal belongings are still in Missouri because it cost me 1500$ of extra expenses. But the school is great, I live across the street so I walk, its in a nice neighborhood, small classes, professors are very educated and experienced, I am apart of the SGA Student Government association, I work with other veterans to promote mental health in the military and veteran care. If you take out all the rough roads I've taken to get here to be apart of this program that focuses on my Passion of Clinical Forensic Psychology I would truck across the country and move from my family all over again!"
College Junior,2,California housing is very expensive.  Cost of living is average as compared to other California communities but very expensive as compared to other places within the country. 
College Junior,2,"I am not sure Alliant even has athletics anymore.  They used to have a stellar tennis team that toured internationally.  Beyond that, I cannot offer much of an opinion."
College Junior,2,It's the campus location that limits off-campus dining options.  For variety one must take a longer drive.
College Senior,2,very little help there and you are on your own there
College Junior,2,San fransisco campus is downtown market street mixed availability safety and price
College Freshman,2,"The ""off-campus"" housing is expensive; being from Ohio $650+ for a tiny 2 bedroom is unnecessary. Despite this, it may be possible to find a place that is nice though if you do you will need a car. Some students complained that the housing near campus has poor maintenance and amenities; one of the complexes has really tiny apartments for astronomical rates (though the apartment grounds are nice); it's relatively safe, or as safe as any medium sized city with some crime can possibly be."
College Senior,2,"There are no sports offered that I am aware of. However, the campus is in a beautiful safe location. Going out for walks, hikes, bike rides and runs is always popular!"
Graduate Student,1,"The classes are not challenging at all, which you would think would be fine, but as a prospective teacher, it is horrible. The professors give you next to no direction or support. If you ask for clarification, they will tell you to reread their convoluted directions. I have gotten straight As so far, I want to become a good teacher, and this program is absolute crap. You also cannot get assistance when necessary. DO NOT APPLY HERE."

Niche User,1,Run down dorm buildings that are abandoned and neglected. Unlocked windows and doors into empty and dirty dormitory rooms. Pools are filled up with dirt to avoid maintenance costs. Terrible Roads left unrepaired that make it impossible for cars to drive on. No road or building improvements for a few decades. Ghostly and eerie environment on campus as you rarely see students or people. Lack of security staff and safety of students living on campus extremely dangerous and high in risk of being a victim of a crime. The problems are visible on a self tour of the campus making it difficult to not to think of negative comments about the unhealthy school site.
College Senior,1,I haven't had housing but they are old and I've heard bad things
College Sophomore,1,Virtually Non-existent would probably the best word for it. The facilities that do exist on campus are constantly rented out to the community so students have very limited access to them.
College Junior,1,There's no athletic programs as far as I know.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no such thing as campus housing with Alliant International University: Sacramento Campus, making financing things very difficult because so much money goes towards private rent and bills."
College Junior,1,There are not athletics at the school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most places close at 9 or 10, not much to do unless you go to a bar, or a beach. Two saving graces are Lestats in Normal Heights, awesome coffee shop open 24 hrs, and The Living Room in La Jolla, open til midnight"
College Junior,1,"Not That Good – very few places.  Some are expensive, some are more reasonable but packed"
College Sophomore,1,"very expensive, and parking spots are mostly on dirt."

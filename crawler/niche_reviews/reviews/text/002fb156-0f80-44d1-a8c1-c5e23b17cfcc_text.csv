Senior,5,"I was not excited about the online experience at first, especially for a nursing school, but the educators helped tremendously in preparing the students for success. Digital modules are used for practice so that student nurses can still learn to care for patients."
Senior,5,Mount Carmel is one of the best nursing colleges in Ohio. The professors are helpful and engaging. Flexible hours. A lot of hands-on training.
Freshman,5,MCCN has amazing staff. They are all willing to help you with anything you need. The curriculum is all geared towards nursing. This makes everything that you learn have a practical use. I love this school.
Senior,5,"MCCN prepares you extremely well to become a competent and knowledgeable Nurse. Leadership of the college, and staff does change frequently. That is the only thing I would personally like to be changed."
Sophomore,5,I love the size of the classes. It’s smaller so there’s more chances to get to know your professors & they all take extra steps to ensure each student has what they need to succeed.
Freshman,5,"As a second semester freshmen, I am pleased to say Mount Carmel College of Nursing will prepare me for the real world of Nursing. Everyone of my professors is helpful and wishes for success throughout the program."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are determined and want to see you succeed.
College Junior,5,Every one scouts from my school
College Freshman,5,We're right in downtown Columbus - there are countless options!
College Freshman,5,"In my opinion, MCCN is the best of the best.  It's a tough school, but they know what they're doing."
College Freshman,5,"Our campus is connected to Mount Carmel West Hospital's campus.  The security is tight but not too overbearing and, after all, it is a nursing school next to a hospital - you are sure to get the health care that you need."
College Sophomore,5,"MCCN has an excellent, comprehensive program. It is focused to nursing and the professors are wonderful and clearly love their jobs!"
College Sophomore,5,"Right off the bat, the security team introduces themselves to the students and they insist that if we do not feel safe for any reason, they are more than happy to walk us to our cars and discuss safety measures with us. They stress that we are not a bother to them and to let them know if for any reason we do not feel safe. The parking garage has help buttons that the security team responds to quickly and they're an overall great team!"
College Freshman,5,Garage is right next door. Very nice.
College Freshman,5,"Good computers, PCs and Macs. Good wi-fi access."
College Sophomore,5,Mount Carmel is a college designed to be a nurse with a hospital attached to it. If you have goals to be a Nurse it is a great school. 
College Sophomore,5,"As a somewhat strict Catholic, private school attached to a hospital, Mount Carmel cracks down on substance abuse. Every incoming freshman and transfer student takes a drug test and goes through state and federal background checks. As most students commute, not much campus partying happen, but if it did a hospital is right next door, so there is nothing to worry about."
College Junior,5,"Nursing school has been very tough for me with 2 small kids and working 3t jobs, but my teachers are always there to help. They encourage me not to give up and keep pushing towards my goals. I love the small knit community and everyone is always there to help you. I work at osu and could go to school for free there but I dont want to because I feel as if I would just be another number and get lost in the crowd. I want to stay at mt. carmel I love the atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,"School Size and Faculty-Student Relationship – Being that Mount Carmel is a small school, all of the faculty and staff know who you are. When you make a phone call to the school, no matter if you are calling to speak with someone from financial aid, or someone in human resources, you always get a friendly and helpful voice on the other end of the phone. Your professors know you by name and even email you to check up on you if you have been absent from class."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy being a part of this college because everyone is super nice and helpful. The advisors and staff are great! They answer emails super fast, usually with a very detailed and thought out response, and sometimes I could just hug them! The instructors genuinely care about you and want to see you succeed. I've never been to a more friendly place. My only issue is that they advertise that tuition is $10,000 a year. Which is true for the first year... But then my tuition went up to $13,000 A SEMESTER."
Junior,4,"Mount carmel is a great school for students looking for a rigorous program. The classes here teach you exactly what you need to know. But there are some issues that arise, which of course happens with many schools. Also, make sure you consider the financial cost of the school."
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior at Mount Carmel College of Nursing in the 4 year BSN program and I barely could say anything bad about the program. The college is nursing focused and provides a wonderful and focused program. Basic classes like A&P and Microbiology are done in the first year, and sophomore year progresses to the foundational nursing classes. All of the instructors are very knowledgeable, pleasant, and helpful. The general atmosphere is very comfortable and they have many resources for students such as academic support, an open computer lab with printers, a library with excellent knowledgeable staff, a rec room with recliners, and even a coffee shop. I love being a part of the school and feel right at home there."
College Freshman,4,"I believe that if you go to Mount Carmel College of Nursing, staff tries their best to get you a job at Mount Carmel as soon as possible."
College Freshman,4,"I'm glad I chose this school. I love it overall, I believe I have met some life-long friends. Also the school is very rewarding and I'm not worried about getting a job after school. I believe the only downsides are the difficulty level and sometimes I feel as if I miss out on the traditional college experience."
College Freshman,4,"It is a very rewarding school. I feel like it is a little fast pace and that certain professors make the curriculum very hard, but it is very rewarding. I believe this is why it is a credited course and will help us out a lot in our careers."
College Junior,4,If security is called by pressing one of the blue lights they will come and escort you in someone ever feels uncomfortable when walking alone. The area that the school is in is a bad part of town and can be very unsatisfying at night or when alone. The parking garage can be very easy for someone to get into to either wait for someone or break into a car. People can walk into the school is they wanted with a weapon and possibly be a threat but security keeps a watch on it.
College Junior,4,Its been challenging but rewarding and hopeful
College Student,4,It is a challenging yet manageable work load and pushes you to strive in your field of study.
College Junior,4,"I love Mount Carmel College of Nursing. You get one on one education with RN, BSN holders. The classes are smaller and staff really prepares you for the Nursing role."
College Freshman,4,The parking garage is a little trick to maneuver sometimes but it's free and there are plenty of spots.
College Freshman,4,"The school does have a lot of rules, but they really are not that bad.  My advice would be that if you're looking for the ""college experience"" to involve a lot of partying, this is not the school for you."
College Sophomore,4,We have quite a diverse population of students.
College Sophomore,4,"Very good WiFi around campus and in the library and around campus there are several computers, printers, and copiers."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are challenging but the professors know that and try to make it more memorable with stories, pictures, and more interactive classes."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot to do in downtown Columbus but it is always safer to travel in groups (though that is normal no matter where you are).
College Sophomore,4,Since we are nurses in training we should not be doing drugs or excessive alcohol (or underage drinking for that matter) while on or around campus.  We have at least one random drug test during the semester and drugs are not very tolerated but students talk to the president and then it is in her hands.
College Sophomore,4,Almost every time that I am walking to classes I see the campus/hospital police around either in cars or on segways.
College Sophomore,4,I drive to school since it is very friendly to both commuters and to those who live on campus.  Most of us have cars to either go home everyday or during breaks and holidays.  We just cute little smart cars you can rent in front of campus.
College Sophomore,4,Depending on the side of town in Downtown Columbus depends on the local atmosphere but around the hospital that MCCN is next to the people are very nice and we try to help direct them toward whatever entrance they are trying to get to.
College Sophomore,4,Since transferring to MCCN I have had a wonderful experience with both the Business office and the Financial aid office.  Help isn't always there for a family that is middle class but I am able to get enough help to cover my classes!
College Sophomore,4,"It's true that campus is boring and there aren't a lot of student activities to do here. But OSU is very close and their campus is great for a good time for anyone because it has so much variety. MCCN has an excellent academic program and you're out in four years, so it's quick and you are almost guaranteed a job as an RN with a bachelors degree."
College Sophomore,4,"Again, OSU is about ten minutes away. OSU has TONS of unique shops and restaurants."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,They are nice and have a cool dog
College Freshman,4,"Lots of different backgrounds, countries"
College Freshman,4,It keeps students focused on what matters: learning
College Sophomore,4,"The process is not that difficult. The worst part is getting all the transcripts into them, but that is everywhere you go."
College Sophomore,4,"I think Columbus, OH is a great city and has a lot to offer everyone."
College Sophomore,4,Parking is not a problem on campus.  Every student receives a I.D badge which will get them in and out of the parking garage for free.  The parking garage is located across the street from the school.  The only way someone would get a ticket or a fine is if they parked somewhere outside the garage at a meter or other parking spot that had regulations.  Having a car on campus is a definite necessity because everything you need is mainly located off campus.
College Junior,4,We have active shooter training which is very helpful
College Sophomore,4,Farfield Medical Center Campus – The MCCN program at the Fairfield Medical Center is great. Our student lounge is awesome and has two new touch screen computers. We have great classrooms and great teachers! The academic program is great!
College Freshman,4,"Mount Carmel Is a Major Specific College – Being a Nursing major is the only thing you can be. Mount Carmel is a Nursing specific school. I enjoy it because everyone understands where you are at and the classes that you are in. It's a unique experience because you do not get to see other majors or other sorts of course work. I think it makes the professors more passionate about their work and where it may cause the workload to a bit more intensive the curriculum, facilities and job opportunities greatly benefit from it."
College Freshman,4,"The computers at Mount Carmel are very accessible and reliable. There are computers and printers located in the library and in both of the residents halls. The network is very reliable now that the school just installed all new wifi connections. There is no need for a personal computer or printer, but I would still recoment one"
College Freshman,4,"Mount Carmel is very strict when it comes to campus life and schooling. The biggest rule that we have is no smoking and drinking on campus grounds and on hospital grounds. As students attending Mount Carmel, we must act professionally, and look like professional students while in class or in the hospital. All students have badges that they must wear every day they come to school."
College Freshman,4,Greek Students – I honestly have never heard of Greek life before. We don't have many groups or sororities at Mount Carmel.
College Freshman,4,"Mount Carmel College of Nursind Food and Dining – At Mount Carmel College of Nursing our food and dining choices are either the hospital cafeteria or the restaurants around our campus. I don't go to the cafeteria much, but when I do the meals good and inexpensive. There is not an actual dining room for the students. However, the school provides a nice recreation room for students to eat their lunches in between classes."
College Freshman,4,"I came to Mount Carmel College of Nursing because I heard they had an excellent nursing program. All my professors have been great teachers and very helpful. So far the curriculum has been tough, but it is perfect for this course of study. This school is great because it is only for nursing so the small class rooms and set curriculum is more than helpful. Also getting right into nursing school helps you get started right away in your studies."
College Sophomore,4,"The school has been working very hard to increase the safety of it's students. They have security that will drive you to your car and a self defense class is offered. They also have a class to teach the procedure of an active shooter, which is helpful."
College Freshman,4,The computer labs are in great abundance and are rarely crowded. Even the campus dorms are supplied with a separate computer lab. The wireless service and the network reliability is slow from time to time.
College Junior,2,We don't do many sports
College Freshman,2,"Mount Carmel is mainly girls, so we do not have any varsity sports such as Football. I believe many people would be interested in have sport options through the school, but the school does provide a gym."
College Sophomore,2,There is one student parking garage and there isn't really anywhere else to park unless you want to park at the hospital.
College Sophomore,2,"The college does not get closed for bad weather! I was going to class in blizzards this year! Many other colleges closed, but puts stayed open and it was kind of frustrating when it was in the negatives and we were still going to class."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't anything on campus, but our campus is about ten minutes from OSU campus and there is tons to do there"
College Sophomore,2,The lady seems like she does not truly understand what she is doing which makes it difficult. 
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't have a car to get around, you must rely on Columbus' COTA bus system, or taxis. There is not campus bus system and walking is not all that safe, especially after dark. Most students commute and use the school's parking garage."
College Freshman,2,"Mount Carmel College of Nursing is located right out side of downtown Columbus. It is on the west side so the area that it is located in is very lower class but once you cross the bridge and are in the downtown area there is tons to do. There are a lot of activities, cultural events, shopping, sports and recreational activities. The locals around the school do not tend to have very pleasant attitudes in general. The area surrounding the school is not very safe and there is a bus stop located directly beside the college and right across the street from the student living facilities. The security office does all they can to ensure the safety of the students. We have emergency call boxes, secure badge accessed parking garage, apartments that have 3 sets of locked doors and constant security patrol that will escort you if you feel uneasy."
College Freshman,2,"We have some club sports at Mount Carmel College of Nursing, but the events do not take place at the college which is a problem for students who do not have a car. Not many people participate and I believe it is because of how far the practices and games take place."
College Sophomore,2,Snow and No Cancellation – Lots of snow. Classes never cancelled. Most commute so its hard to get to school most times.
Senior,1,"When I started, I liked this school overall, but they are now raising tuition costs, and they are also planning to send students back out into the clinical field starting in August of 2020, while the Covid-19 pandemic is still going strong. They have offered ""accomodations"" to students, but when requested, they reply that accommodations can not and will not be made. It seems like it doesn't matter if you or your loved ones are at risk, as long as they make their money. Please do all you can to find an alternative choice in colleges."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid and business office are not that great. They don't seem to care at all that you need financial help. If you can't make payments, you're kind of out of luck. You should get a job through mount Carmel health system, it will get you a 50% discount off tuition for your junior and senior year when tuition is he highest. You need to take matters into your own hands here when it comes to financial aid but there are opportunities if you look for them."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no sports available at Mount Carmel, as it is a small, private college. Recently, club sports have been made available, but only volleyball, basketball, dancing, yoga, and zumba. These are still in the progress of becoming a real part of campus life."
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely no Nightlife at Mount Carmel College of Nursing.  However, it is located close to downtown Columbus which is where most of the students go to experience Nightlife."

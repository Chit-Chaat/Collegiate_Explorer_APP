Senior,5,"I've taken classes at Indiana University, Bloomington; Purdue, West Lafayette; Rose-Holeman, Terre Haute and Ivy Tech. I will be honest the only difference between all of them are the professors. My Rose Professors were top notch. I've had some great Professors at PFW,Purdue,IU and Ivy Tech. Ivy Tech has really improved since the early 2000's. Overall though for the money PFW is a great school especially the CS, IST department."
Freshman,5,My online classes have been very simple and the teachers are there whenever you have a question or need to contact them. It is very easy to submit work and teachers will work with you if you do not have access to WIFI at the time.
Freshman,5,"Purdue University has a beautiful campus and all of the professors are in it for the kids. PFW really helps you adjust to college life and help you with any question you have about the future. What really interested me were the programs they offered, not just the classes but the free extracurricular activities. The financial aid office will help you with any questions and make sure that you are debt free by time you graduate. Overall PFW is a good fit for any type of student that is look to expand their knowledge after high school."
Sophomore,5,Purdue University Fort Wayne is a great environment for all types of people looking to further your education at the college level.
Sophomore,5,Purdue Fort Wayne did a great job transitioning to online school this spring. The professors are all excited to help you and always willing to working with you!

It's a great place to start the next step."

Graduate Student,5,"I have had an exceptional experience at Purdue University Fort Wayne. They offer campus events for all types of students, and there is a large variety of groups to join. It's easy to get connected, and the students all have been very friendly. All the professors I have had will push you to your best, and they are easy to work with. I would recommend Purdue Fort Wayne to anyone."
Senior,5,I like Purdue since it's an easy walk from my apartment and the people here are nice. It's not overly friendly so you can still keep to yourself if you want. The prices are bearable if you have a light course load so it's possible to work and goto school while paying for an apartment and school at the same time. I would highly recommend Purdue Fort Wayne!
Sophomore,5,"I love Purdue University Fort Wayne. They do a great job of making school fun and giving many opportunities to be successful. There are tons of programs for all sorts of activities and academic ventures. The campus also offers many sports, clubs, and organizations."

Freshman,5,"The professor were flexible and help us on stuff we don’t really know and when our grade are not the grade we wanted, we go and ask for advices on how we could improve our grade and because of that we were able to improve our grades."
Niche User,5,"I just applied to Purdue University Fort Wayne. I have lived in Fort Wayne for my entire life and the college has been part of my life in many ways. When I was younger, I attended volleyball games with friends. I even attended volleyball camps for multiple summers. The people were always super respectful and kind."
Sophomore,5,Really nice and clean campus! Professors are experts in their fields and want the students to succeed in every way possible! The community is great and the courses are interesting!
Freshman,5,"This university tailors my education to my needs.  They put the students first and work the courses to adjust for and help them to succeed.  I highly recommend this university for those who are interested in tight-knit, student oriented programs and wonderful campus facilities/resources."
Sophomore,5,Purdue Fort Wayne has given me the best experience I have ever had. All the teachers I had throughout my first semester were excellent and explained their teachings very well. I'm so glad I choose PFW and I hope to graduate from school as a mastodon.
Senior,5,"Great school, instructors are amazing and you will make a lot of friends. There is a lot to do on campus, with events and activities lots of food."
Niche User,5,Purdue Fort Wayne is a great environment with great people. There are many things to do around town.
Junior,5,"PFW is a very welcoming place where I could be myself and have a good time but there was also someone there to help with everything. Tutoring, scholarships, housing, and more."
Freshman,5,"I have only been here for a couple months so far, but its going really well. The staff are super nice and helpful, and the atmosphere is great. People are friendly and the buildings are nice and clean."
Freshman,5,"Support for new students is good. Orientation explains a lot about how campus life is, and the safety provided by campus police is reassuring."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy all of my teachers. They go out of their way to help me understand the topics. They all do a great job of teaching. I have always felt very safe on campus, and I feel like campus is the perfect size, not too big or too small."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student at Purdue University Fort Wayne, and the atmosphere makes you feel welcomed! When I was first applying to college, I had no clue where I wanted to attend and thought about taking a gap year. I applied to this campus without any thought, and eventually started classes at Purdue Fort Wayne majoring in Human Services. My department professors are truly wonderful as they help me with any questions or concerns I have regarding anything. It's a small diverse university that gives you a great education for a lot less than some other universities."
Sophomore,5,"My time at PFW is fantastic. Campus feels like a second home to me, and the staff is very nice. My professors have been fantastic and very helpful whenever I have found something difficult. They really care about your success and truly want to see you accomplish your goals."
Freshman,5,This year is my first year at Purdue Fort Wayne and I really enjoy the environment and spirits of everyone on campus. They are very welcoming and helpful in every way.
Sophomore,5,This is an amazing college to apply for because there is so much diversity and you can make amazing friends and you can get a degree in what ever you have a passion for here.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy that Purdue University Fort Wayne is a much smaller version of the main campus in West Lafayette but with an equal competitor in academics. The professors at Fort Wayne make learning much more student interactive and personal for all students rather than just upperclassmen.  I look for that kind of connection with my professors since I want to get the most out of my education in four years.
Niche User,5,I loved Purdue Fort Wayne the campus life and the people I met were some of the most kind and outgoing people. The campus is beautiful and I love the city of Fort Wayne.
Sophomore,5,My favorite thing about IPFW is that even though it's located in one of the largest cities in Indiana it still feels likes home. All of the professors truly want you to succeed and are always there to help.
Junior,5,"They are so helpful when you are applying, or transferring into their school like I did. Facility and classes are great for the most part too."
Niche User,5,I love the location of the university. One of the major factors that sold me on attending Purdue was the job placement rate. My field is almost 100%.   Another thing that sold me was the way the dorms were set up.  I love all the different options.  There is also free tutoring for your classes.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy this university. The professors are great, and the campus is very clean and safe. Lots of upgrades have been done to the campus since I started and it all looks very nice and well kept. They also offer many services for students such as tutoring, writing help, and much more. They also have great athletic teams."
Senior,5,"What most sparked my interest in Purdue Fort Wayne was there benefits for incoming freshman as well as their returning students. The dorms , so students would not have to drive to and from home, fast food and cafeteria on campus, keeps everything close so students don't even have to leave campus , and classes are not that far of  a walk. They help their students by providing federal aid. With the help of that it deducts cost of things significantly. The annual in"
Senior,5,I like Purdue Fort Wayne University because professors and staff members are very welcoming. The environment is very safe.
Niche User,5,The school was very well put together. Everyone I talked to always had good things to say about the school and they were all very nice. The campus was beautiful and I loved walking around. The student teacher ratio is a fantastic quality. They are so diverse and accepting of everyone. I like that their academics and majors are so different. They have a great variety.
Niche User,5,I like how the campus is in a very nice town lots of stuff to do if you ever get bored and need stuff to do. Its very close to home so I know I can go visit people when I have free time. The campus is very diverse so that is something I am greatly looking forward to. The dorm rooms are very nice and you feel like you are right at home. The class sizes are perfect size and the professors are very helpful and nice. The campus is beautiful and a perfect place to call home for four years of my life.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy being close to home and being able to work as well as being a full-time student.  Many students are in the same position that I am in so it makes connecting with others a lot easier. Although commuting can be difficult, PFW does a good job having parking that is available and places for people to be. The professors are great here and push me to be the best that I can be while juggling multiple things at the same time."
Niche User,5,"It's not that big compared to other universities, but it's very easy to get to places. The classroom size is fairly large and the outdoors are welcoming. The staff are really nice and help you find the way. The Mastodon really gives off a great vibe and cultural history of the school. The indoors are fairly nice, and the hallways are easy to get around. The library is connected to another building which makes it nice."
Junior,5,I enjoy the campus and the friendly people.  The professors are always willing to help and encourage you.
Freshman,5,I love the layout of the campus.  The staff there is very helpful to everyone.  The housing there has a lot of space which is perfect for any college student.  I cannot wait to start my college career there.
Graduate Student,5,"I like the small classes and excellent professors. I attended IPFW as a Freshman in College before transferring to Indiana University Bloomington, and am excited to go back this Fall 2018 as a graduate student."
Freshman,5,"It's got a wonderful campus, not too big but not too small. Dorms are apartment style, meaning everyone has their own room. It can be pricey but if you seek out everything the school has to offer it's worth it. There are several wonderful opportunities for enriching yourself. You can travel abroad, without having to pay more than current tuition. Several communities focused on helping out students with tutoring or daily needs. There are spacious updated gyms and weight rooms. Staff are mostly pleasant and some go out of their way to make you feel welcomed."
Senior,5,"The professors really care about their students and make sure they succeed. There is always someone there to help in anyway possible, as well as some kind of event for students to get free food and stuff."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy that the campus is so close to my family, the advisors are very helpful, and the professors are very easy to talk to."
Freshman,5,"The food is astonishingly delicious. I was amazed when I ordered my first meal in the cafeteria. It was fresh, the vegetables were crisp, and the wait time was minimal. The selection of food blew my mind. Wraps, burgers, pizza, salad bar, drinks, coffee, and the 2 daily specials are just the selections in the Walb cafeteria."
Senior,5,"I love this school because it helped me find a career that I love. I have met lifelong friends through this nursing program and I could not imagine being anywhere else. There are small classes, so I never feel like I am competing for my professor's attention. I also like that I am able to live at home and work full time while going to school locally."
Freshman,5,The teachers all work with you one on one. The class sizes are perfect and you have a lot of the same people in all of your classes so it’s easy to make friends!
Sophomore,5,I like the nursing program so far. It is a good environment for learning and the facilities are nice. I really enjoy the program and the teachers.
Junior,5,"This is a great school with good teachers. They care about the students that come into their classrooms, and are willing to help them outside of class."
Junior,5,IPFW has a great variety of online and on campus classes to fit any schedule.  The professors are very knowledgable on their classes because most have experience in the field. If I could change anything it would be to offer some classes more and group classes together that are similar.
Freshman,5,"IPFW is a very welcoming campus. They offer lots of clubs, and social events to get involved and to make new friends. The staff encourages you to meet new people, get involved in some way, and to do well on your academics. My experience with IPFW has been very great so far, the staff is very nice and willing to help you out in every way they can!"
Senior,5,"I love this school.  My only disappointment with it is that it recently merged completely with Purdue University, against the of the faculty and students."
Senior,5,"IPFW gave me the opportunity to find out who I wanted to be in life. It offers plenty of chances for everyone, including lower-middle class students like myself. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and a way forward, and if it was not for the wonderful people here offering me a chance to fulfill my dreams, I would not be able to earn my Bachelor's here."
Niche User,5,I liked how the staff and faculty were so involved with the students attending this college. I could tell that the students academics and involvement in the school was very important to the staff.
Niche User,5,My cousin went to Purdue and told me all about it. These are the things that I've discovered about the campus and things he has told me.
Niche User,5,This is a great school! It offers many degree programs and has multiple accessible labs. The teachers and students are great and there is a great sense of community!
Freshman,5,It is a small college with a great family oriented atmosphere. Professors and faculty are friendly and willing to help students succeed.
Freshman,5,"What I love the most about IPFW, is how spirited they are and also how their professors are so intrigued with each and every student that steps into their classrooms."
Senior,4,"I prefer how Blackboard was utilized. However,  Brightspace has potential.  Most professors have good communication and go above and beyond to help you when you need it. The only real problem I run into is the grading isn't kept up as much as I personally would like."
Sophomore,4,Professors enjoy their subjects and do everything to impart their experience to their students. Giving you the honest truth along the way.
Sophomore,4,I'm not going to fault the professors on this one. Most of my online classes were forced due to Covid-19 and not all the professors were ready for that. They did very well overall helping us understand the topics at hand.
Junior,4,The Student Housing is the best part of the entire University because they are style like that of apartments!
Junior,4,"Once the classes became online, the professors were very lenient and the possibility of filling those classes reduced for many students."
Niche User,4,"Purdue University Fort Wayne is a great school to attend. I love it because it is close to home so I do not have to pay out of school costs and housing costs, so it helps me save money. They have great ways to get connected as well."
Junior,4,I really loved the size and the environment of the Purdue University Fort Wayne Campus. I have enjoyed my experience in every aspect at this University.
Sophomore,4,Purdue Fort Wayne has been revitalizing their campus. It is very evident that the schools is moving away from being a strictly commuter college and becoming more welcoming for their students. There are a lot of great professors that are invested in their students efforts and goals.
Freshman,4,"In my college visit to Purdue Fort Wayne, I learned about how great the campus was. I saw the excellent dorms that are available, ranging from large to small dorm variations to accustom each student to their living space. The campus staff is very welcoming and helpful for soon to be Mastodons. I am proud to be a future Mastodon."
Sophomore,4,Very nice campus with everything very close. I love the way the dorms are set up and it makes it very comfortable. Easy to find places to study and get the help you need. I wish there was a cafeteria that was open for more than a few hours during the day. Teacher to student ratio is low so that's very nice. You can get one on one time when needed.
Senior,4,Decent amount of academic programs considering the smaller town compared to others. Could use more graduate level programs.
Junior,4,The campus is in an ideal location. It's close to my home and can easily be communicated to allowing me to save thousands on room and board every year. The low credit hour cost allows students to obtain an education for significantly less than a standard state school.
Freshman,4,Having more eating availability on campus and more activities on campus would be awesome. Campus is pretty generic and could use some additions to draw people to it.
Sophomore,4,I love the classes and the professors are great! Most of the classes are a pretty good size once you get into the classes pertaining to your major. The only complaint I have is the printing costs. I wish they'd reimburse the $60 or the amount you don't spend on printing.
Freshman,4,My time here has been great.  The professors are very helpful and the campus is very easy to navigate.
Niche User,4,I very much like the diversity the school has for everyone. I also like the housing where you are close together but yet you are separate because of the apartment like housing. I like how they give out shows and performances for the students.
Alum,4,The school is great for as local university in Northeast Indiana. Student housing is over priced. Professors are very knowledgeable.
Sophomore,4,"I have been at PFW for two years now, and have truly loved my experience. The professors are so engaged and committed to the success of their students. Everyone on campus is very kind and committed to their work. I love my majors!"
Freshman,4,"Purdue Fort Wayne is a small campus, which is great because most classes and resources are within a short walk of each other. The staff and student assistants are also very kind and helpful!"
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere and the culture. I wish that there would be more outreach to the fine arts programs including more advertisement and recognition around campus.
Senior,4,"I started here as an adult student, but people have gone out of their way to help me acclimate and make sure I am understanding the processes. I can't say enough about the weekend and online classes allowing me to work full time as well as raise my family."
Alum,4,"For the most part, I enjoyed my time on campus. Many of the professors were very sociable and helpful. I have been able to maintain relationships with them that have helped me further my networking as a graduate. I had wonderful research opportunities. I had a fun work-study position at the campus TV station. Overall, I enjoyed the campus."
Freshman,4,Indiana University-Purdue University has been a great experience so far. My days out on campus have been excitable and moving. The atmosphere this campus offers makes it feel safe and enjoyable at the same time. I go to my classes in high spirits when I am out there walking around campus.
Junior,4,The university over all is very good when it comes to teaching its students but when it comes to retaining them they lack a little. With little financial aid I doubt a lot of low income students will stay here.
Niche User,4,"I have taken now three duel credit classes through IPFW. Overall my experience has been nothing but good. I've never had a problem with admissions or any of my teachers. The classes were kind of hard, but I succeeded through them just fine.  The cost of taking the classes were relatively low and defiantly cheaper then a bigger school would have been."
Senior,4,"IPFW has a true connection to their students. The assortment of clubs and extracurriculars that the school offers gives an opportunity for every single student to find others and connect. The professors and staff are not only great teachers, they offer assistance in personal and professional aspects. The campus is beautifully laid out, and I could not be more happy with my choice to attend this university."
Alum,4,"IPFW, now Purdue Fort Wayne, is an amazing school for those who don't enjoy the thought of living in the typical ""college town"" or a big city. The professors are truly amazing and will do anything to help their students who show that they are willing to put in effort to succeed."
Niche User,4,"Professors were willing to provide help/answer questions between classes, beautiful campus, and plenty of student-run activities to take part in. My only complaint is that, in the afternoons when everyone schedules their classes, the campus can get claustrophobic."
Sophomore,4,I like the lower cost of being able to attend school while living at home.  I wish some of the professors didn't have hard to understand accents.  Some classes were very difficult because of the language barrier.
Junior,4,"IPFW is very affordable for the education provided. My department (Theatre) is small so I receive much individualized attention and guidance from professors and other faculty. In classes I’ve taken with other departments, it is not always the same, but overall I have had very good experiences with professors who really seem to care about my success. Other services provided by the school, such as the tutoring center or career services, have not always been helpful to me, and I often feel like I have to figure things out on my own. I don’t live in housing, so I cannot speak for that, but the environment on campus feels safe and there are countless convenient and comfortable places to study and hang out. I feel very welcomed and at home at this university overall, and I feel as if I am reaching my full potential."
Junior,4,"Faculty and staff work very closely with students, enhancing the learning experience. Many extracurricular activities, giving the opportunities to interact with others students and faculty out of the classroom."
Junior,4,IPFW is a great small campus college. Most of the faculty is very personable and great to work with. I have been there for 2 years now and couldn't be happier.
Sophomore,4,I am currently studying nursing here. I enjoy my classes  but life outside of the classroom and on campus can be kind of boring.
Senior,4,"There are a lot of changes going on at IPFW because it will be changing to Purdue FW in the fall. There has been a lot of updates on campus and there has been a lot of contractors marking areas that will be fixed or rebuilt. Each department will have their own good and bad aspects but as a whole, the campus is moving in a good direction."
Sophomore,4,"IPFW is a good school academically for a great price. I love that the teachers always make time for students' individual needs. I also love the small campus community with a large campus, well-respected name. My classes are great, and every staff member I meet wants only the best for me and every other student."
Sophomore,4,What I like about IPFW is that it is an affordable college that accommodates to what may be happening within each individual's life. I wish that there were more to do on campus or feel more like a college then just going to school and leaving.
Freshman,4,The teachers are very nice and care about the students. The other staff at the school are willing to help you as well and a lot of the students will help you if you reach out.
Sophomore,4,"Great sense of community at this university. You get a more individualised education since class sizes are small. Professors know you on a first name basis and are often involved beyond lectures. Ample opportunities to take advantage of, I am very happy at this university."
Sophomore,4,It was a good university. Campus was clean and had a lot to offer its students. There were a lot of degrees and classes to choose from.
Niche User,4,"This university is in a good part of Fort Wayne, along with being a very tight knit campus. The dorms are some of the nicest I've ever seen, and the teachers are also great. This is also one of the cheapest schools you can attend, and it's a great value."
Sophomore,4,My experience thus far at IPFW has been rather interesting. I started out as pre med and then switched to education. I then changed my major to general studies. I have met many of the staff and faculty and would recommend IPFW.
Freshman,4,"Nice small classes with lots of opportunities to get help with school work, for free. The academic programs are quite good, especially the engineering programs."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere it is relaxing and has a lot of resources. I wish there were more ways than a few fliers around campus, telling us what is going on and where."
Freshman,4,I’m a brand new freshman here at IPFW and I’m very glad I chose this college to pursue my degree. Every staff member is here to help you on your path and they really care about you and your grades.
Freshman,4,"The central location in Fort Wayne is nice. It is also very close to my high school, which helps when I commute. My professor is great and very helpful."
Senior,4,"There are multiple events for the students with lots of freebie and free food. I love the newly renovated library and Kettler Hall, which are very modern and inspirational. There is also a very nice path along the river bank that I can take a walk or just bring school stuff out to study under the shades. Academically, the ratio between professors and students is nice as well. All of my nursing professors are attentive to my needs and almost all of them answered my emails and concerns within my expected time.  The nursing professors and staffs do care about the students, academically and spiritually. There were numerous time my instructors checked on how I was doing with my clinical skills and guided and encouraged me to improve my skills and my understanding.  The only problem that I often complain about is that we do not have a cafeterria that has a meal plan. The food is good but pretty expensive."
Niche User,4,"The school is huge but you always have things to do. Athletics and party environment are great. The science coursework is challenging but tests your understanding and not just random knowledge. If you REALLY want to learn and not just get stuck in the diploma mill that the college experience has turned into, take advantage of the facilities such as the library, the career services building, and a bunch of other entities that I regret not taking advantage of."
Junior,4,The professors are there to help you succeed in classes. They are updating and remodeling the campus to make it student friendly. Some of the professors have thick accents that are hard to understand. The school is affordable and the degree you receive is from IU or Purdue making it a good deal and reputable.
Freshman,4,"IPFW is a college that wants to help their students succeed. They offer many resources for students to help improve their experience at IPFW. There are many clubs and sports to join and activities to participate in. Professor quality is where IPFW slacks in. Many professors hardly speak English, or don't provide good education quality, or even make class a time to speak about politics - yes politics. There are good professors here you just have to know which ones they are and make sure you sign up for their classes before they fill up. Food is alright where they have a wide selection. Parking can be a hassle at the beginning of the semester but usually thins out in the first month."
Freshman,4,This will be my first year there. What made me choose this school. Was that you get a degree from either school without actually got to their school. The one thing that i would like to see change is a better way to navigate thru the parking lot. it gets very hecked at times.
Freshman,4,"IPFW was a good fit for me because it was a local college and close to home. Some people don't consider it to be as nice as other colleges, some say that the academics aren't as good here but I don't consider that to be true. You are graduating with an Indiana degree or a Purdue degree. There is a lot of diversity on campus and that is  a good thing. Being diverse is important. Campus is nice and they want to do whatever they can to improve it and make it better for their students. The staff and professors are willing to do as much as they can to help you succeed and achieve the goals you want to achieve on time. Campus is without a doubt a safe place to be at all times. There are nice running trails on campus as well.  There is a lot to do in Fort Wayne if you have a break between classes you could go a few blocks away to go out to eat with friends. I am a freshman at IPFW this year and the first to go to college in my family so I was a little nervous, but I feel at home at IPFW."
Junior,4,"Fairly accessible for disabled people. Not a big campus, but not so small that there isn't anything to do. Athletics have their moments of success but are mediocre for a Division I school, same with academics."
Freshman,4,"I love this school so much. The campus so beautiful and I feel safe attending here. I'm never scared to walk in the dark alone because IPFW has made me feel welcomed and protected. I had a pretty rough first semester, but I knew I could get through it because of how great IPFW is."
Freshman,4,"IPFW may not be the biggest, brightest, or even the greatest college, but for someone looking for, ""the right fit,""  Its the college for you. It offers convenience in a large of Fort Wayne, friendship, being in a friendly community, and there is even a gym for those few who enjoy to workout after school."
Freshman,4,"I have not been at IPFW for long, but at this point I find it a nice school.  I have been unfortunate to come at a time of many big changes.  However, it has still been a good experience.  The teachers are interested in helping the students, and the classes seem to have a decent workload.  There's also usually something going on on the student union to occupy down time."
Senior,4,"I did my freshman year at Indiana University in Bloomington, but upon completion of that year I chose to transfer to my home town because the cost of IPFW is significantly cheaper.  Overall I have been enjoying my time at IPFW and am enrolled in the environmental policy degree. It will be interesting to see what happens with this campus because there has recently been an announcement of numerous programs/ degrees being cut."
Niche User,4,"I believe the programs at IPFW are phenomenal and give attention to students who are in dire need of it, but there are sometimes when the teachers and administrators are overlooked or overlook their students due to time constraints or budgetary issues that should be resolved before a student puts his all into a class. Each teacher should be given the drive by their bosses to do the best in their classes, but most of them are too afraid to be cut or replaced. Yet overall, the college is great and I look forward to attending there again."
College Junior,4,"So far, first semester of my second year in college, the professors I have been given have been good. I did have a math professor last spring semester that I was not thrilled with and did not feel he was very good at teaching. Other than that I have had a few I have come to really enjoy and I do know I can still email them if I need help in years to come."
College Junior,4,"This will be my second year here on IPFW's campus and I can say I have not once seen or heard of anything bad happening on campus. I do feel safe and I remember last year for the spring semester they had every student take a course on their black board about sexual assault. This included where to go, who to talk to, what to do and more. I personally found in informing and I thought it was good of the school to do so."
College Junior,4,"For IPFW I have found it to be a wonderful school when transferring from a high school setting to a college setting. I have liked class sizes, the layout and the overall fact that there is always a place and or person to go to when I have a question."
Junior,2,"Purdue University has not been very accommodating to commuting students. I did not have access to Wifi when everything shut down, but Purdue did not help in assisting me with gaining access to continue with school. Individual professors were more helpful than any offices available to students. Also, some professors were not understanding of the situation. I failed a class due to not having access and no leniency was given to me, rather I received no emails returning my questions."
Senior,2,"While the campus and teachers are amazing, I have had a considerable amount of issues with advising.  After being dropped by my original advisor without being told, my new advisor went on a 9 month sabbatical and did not notify her advisees.  After several issues, I was able to meet with the vice chancellor who was able to fulfill the promises that I had in writing from staff members.  I love my teachers and my school, but there is very poor communication from the communication department."
Sophomore,2,"Indiana University - Purdue University - Fort Wayne has just split to Purdue Fort Wayne and Indiana University Fort Wayne. IU is very challanging to get information back, and with it being so new, is not yet organized. With this spilt, IU has just taken control of the health care fields, including Nursing. The nursing program is a set schedule, meaning you can pick a bulk pack, instead of setting your schedule to best fit you. For this round students must be on campus for at least 4 days a week but could also be on campus all 5 days."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of things to choose from
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"When people ask me how I like IPFW, I tell them ""we've got really green grass"".... because that is actually the best part of the whole school. It's the grass. Shoutout to the IPFW lawn crew for keeping clean cuts, yo."
College Freshman,2,I do not understand why IPFW does not have a meal plan. Most college students do not enjoy/have the time to cook.
College Student,2,"I like having subway, but all of the other options are kind of useless to me personally. It's not that I don't like taco bell or pizza hut, but after eating those for even three days in a row, you just feel gross. A lot of the options here are extremely expensive and unhealthy. I wish that there was a meal plan or at least some healthier food options on campus."
College Student,2,It's pretty gross. Subway workers are the worst! and I just wish there were more options and healthier options on campus. I'd like some fruit.
College Senior,2,"This is a hard one... The places close to campus tend to be either really expensive or when they're not they're not usually that great in quality or safety. Most housing tends to be close to campus, though, in walking or biking distance if you have half an hour to an hour to spare. There's always availability, but turnover rates tend to be higher due to price or quality. parking totally depends on where you are, some is great and others are pretty poor. Safety tends to be an issue all over, though... these areas aren't well patrolled and thefts are a common concern."
College Senior,2,"Most of the food on campus is quite unhealthy, save for subway. Pizza hut does have a salad bar, but unless you want salad and subs every day the options for healthy food are extremely limited. Pizza hut's prices are quite high for their food, as well, though the others are average/normal price. Options for vegetarians are extremely limited and very poor."
College Freshman,2,There is no meal plan on campus which is very unusual as this university has more than just commuting students and should have a food program to feed non commuters.
College Freshman,2,They are incredibly strict and sometimes it is a little unnecessary. They need to let things go a little bit.
College Sophomore,2,There isnt much partying going on around IPFW
College Sophomore,2,I haven't had a internship in my degree feild because I am just a sophomore.
College Sophomore,2,Not many social involvement with students.. They come to class then leave.
College Senior,2,"The Financial Aid, Registrar, and Bursars offices are such a hassle. You will have MANY problems throughout your years here, but they will eventually get taken care of -- you will probably just be waiting a while. Everything is incredibly slow and drawn out."
College Freshman,2,I would love if we had a cafeteria or healthier options instead of fast food restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,I do not even know about Greek life at IPFW.
College Sophomore,2,It is really hard to get into the nursing program at IPFW. There are just so many students going to be nurses. I encountered difficulties with keeping my GPA high enough for the programs standards. The most important criteria for the nursing program is GPA and TEAS test scores. My program requires a lot of work to be put into the nursing application. I would advise students to keep an A average if they want to get into the program!
College Freshman,2,"There is little transportation to the rest of the city, but most people on campus have cars (even exchange students). There are shuttle buses between the housing and different parts of the campus."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is not very good. I was approved for a loan, but no scholarships. I have done well in both high school and college and maintain a strong GPA. I believe I should receive some sort of scholarship, but I have been offered nothing."
College Sophomore,2,You are required to take unnecessary classes
College Sophomore,2,Most kids that come to IPFW are commuters and are never available to hangout outside of class. At any sporting event or free food event attendance is well below average and it is hard to communicate and meet new people.
Recent Alumnus,2,"driving in snow was the worst this winter, many students could not make it to class."
Recent Alumnus,2,no smoking policy is unfair- no voting took place
Recent Alumnus,2,lack of transportation keeps costs low
College Senior,2,lots of ice and lack of cleared side walks
College Freshman,2,Mainly this winter- I have missed a full week of classes because campus was closed and another few days because I didn't want to risk the travel. the campus in the summer is quite pretty.
College Freshman,2,"There are kitchens in the campus dorms so there are only 3 food options on campus (Subway, Pizza Hut, and Taco bell). There are no nearby health fast food options but the cost is reasonable. There are no student discounts or much variety but campus is near downtown which has a good variety of food options."
College Sophomore,2,Campus barely shuts down under any conditions.
College Sophomore,2,Don't even feel like there is one.
College Freshman,2,See previous comment about extremely strict attendance policy. 
College Freshman,2,The classes I need to take for my major are never available.  
College Freshman,2,"IPFW's annoying attendance policy forces you to sit through all the classes or you will fail. We are all adults in college. If we personally feel like we need to show up, we will. NO need to babysit and keep attendance. Annoying."
College Freshman,2,"There is absolutely no cafeteria or meal plans to speak of on this campus. If you live on campus and want to eat, you have to do all your own grocery shopping and make all of your food out of your apartment. There is a Taco Bell, A Pizza Hut, a Subway, and a frozen yogurt place all located around campus, but this is a hardly a ""cafeteria"" and certainly not an every day meal option for students who live here. It is more for commuters to get quick, hot lunch (although NOT cheap or healthy) throughout the day in between classes. IPFW NEEDS a cafeteria. It's bad. "
College Sophomore,2,"It is always really hard to find a parking spot, whether it be in a parking garage or in one of the lots. If you are in a paid spot for even a couple minutes past the limit, you will be ticketed. "
College Junior,2,"There is no cafeteria on campus, just Taco Bell, Subway and Pizza Hut"
College Senior,2,"We only have three food restaurants on campus including a yogurt spot and a little convenient store. Subway stays open the latest, Pizza Hut and taco bell closes before 5pm. Yoyos is really good but only sells drinks or frozen yogurt. The convenient store prices are really expensive for it to have been a new source to help college students who live in campus.  "
College Sophomore,2,I know that people look for spots forever. I don't drive to school though so thats not a problem for me.
College Sophomore,2,"I love my program, I love psychology a lot and i love that my professor is very dedicated to the subject and passionate about teaching it. The work load is fair and the curriculum isnt too hard."
College Sophomore,2,"I really don't notice much. But i do live off campus. Friends of mine who live on campus say that often times people have alcohol in their rooms which is against housing policy, but that they dont force it upon anyone."
College Sophomore,2,"I didn't want to come here, its just that tuition in other places was outrageously unaffordable. The people seem friendly enough and there are some fun on campus activities from time to time. But not enough to make me want to stay. I would really want to go to purdue or BU in the coming year or so. "
College Sophomore,2,"Theres no dining hall, just a couple of restaurants like a small food court."
College Sophomore,2,There is honestly not much for anyone under the age of 21 to do.
College Sophomore,2,"More of an Apartment then a dorm, came with bathroom and full kitchen/living room."
College Sophomore,2,"You had your typical restaurants around the city, A few nice places downtown, but besides that a lot of mom & pop diners and fast food places."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not care at all about sports and never once went to an athletic event. However, I feel IPFW is a little too obsessed with volleyball and basketball. There are lot of members of the teams on student counsel and I wouldn't be surprised if they favor those involved in sports. The students around me seemed to enjoy talking basketball and volleyball and apparently we win some games. There were never very many active IM sports on campus that I noticed (no flyers or recruiters). If your looking for athletics I wouldn't choose IPFW. Most people on campus love sports but there is not enough variety to be interesting for the avid fan."
College Senior,2,"Little to do around town, but does have some local coffee places. Campus has an overbearing depressing feel about it."
College Freshman,2,"People park in two spots frequently in the parking garages making them fill up  faster and it takes forever to walk out, way more faculty & staff parking than needed."
College Freshman,2,Classes are almost never cancelled due to snow. This is bad because lots of teachers do have attendance that counts towards your grade.
College Freshman,2,"Not really sure, I am giving a C because I do not hear much about it. If i knew more it would get a better rating but since it is not that popular it is just average."
College Freshman,2,the price of student housing is outrageous. it is way more cost effective to live just half a mile down the road in the appartments there. there is a bus that takes students to and from for free.
College Freshman,2,"There are a few places on campus currently (early 2013). I think there are 5 places and you pay for them yourself. Higher Grounds (coffee), YoYo (Frozen Yogurt), Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and a Subway. Other than that there are lots of great places nearby but if you don't have a car it's difficult to get around."
College Senior,2,"Compared to other options, student housing is pricey!!! Also the rules and regulations are very strict, so if you're a party animal this isn't the place, on the other hand if your'e not soo much the party type and love peace and quiet 24/7 this is the place."
College Junior,2,They're all stuck up or only into getting high.
College Junior,2,The dining experiences off campus were average. The food is not that great the time and experience used to prepare it does not seem to be at a level where I am comfortable with.
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't much nightlife that is campus related. There are a few bars and clubs in the area, but there are no house parties (at least that I know of). There are a few coffee houses in the area that have live music at night and I know a few people who frequent those."
College Sophomore,2,Stay at Home – I don't actually go out with many people in college. I generally stay at home and play games with my partner and roommates. since we are all over 21 we can have a safe drink in the comfort of our own home.
College Sophomore,2,"There is one club for GLTB, and a multicultural affairs center, but I feel that IPFW really lacks in diversity."
Sophomore,1,"Loser, total loser. Teachers and students don't care. Like college Kmart. Better to go to any other college or none at all. It is cheap, but not even worth that. You can't get a job with this diploma."
College Freshman,1,There isn't a greek life.
College Freshman,1,IPFW doesn't have a Greek life
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,They are super stricked about everything
College Sophomore,1,"IPFW doesn't have a Greek life, I know some people have tried to get it started but the school is to stricked and wont allow it."
College Junior,1,I only know of 1 greek club
College Sophomore,1,Need more choices longer hours and cheaper prices
College Sophomore,1,Could have more things in the evenings
College Freshman,1,"IT'S HORRIBLE. It takes multiple attempts and multiple phone calls to the financial aid office just to get things smoothed out. In the end, they weren't even able to help me and now I'm struggling just to pay for school on my own."
College Freshman,1,"There is a Subway, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and a YoYo's (ice cream place). If it's warm there's a food truck but a lot of people bring their food. No flex dollars to earn."
College Sophomore,1,"For me, its honestly horrible. I have been on my own taxes and claiming myself, as well as living as an independent for 3 years. Unfortunately, my parents offer me zero support financially in my education or living situation, but I am not old enough to claim the FAFSA by myself. Thanks to their income, I receive zero financial aid and am forced to take loans or work extra hours in order to pay for it myself. I do not believe it is a fair set up."
College Sophomore,1,parking on campus in a nightmare I go to school an hour early so that i can find a spot to park in but I still always manage to be cutting it close to class time.
College Junior,1,There aren't many dining options on campus.  There are several chains that are within the Union that offer food.  Healthy eating options aren't easily available either.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time.
College Sophomore,1,"The drug scene is like any other average college, although it depends on who you hang out with. Drinking is a much more popular activity."
College Sophomore,1,"I've only seen the student housing once, and decided that I didn't want to live there. They were small and tacky. I opted to get my own apartment a few miles away from campus. It's much cheaper, bigger, and much more respectable. I've also heard horror stories about things that go in the student housing... It's not anything that I would want to be apart of."
College Sophomore,1,I have no idea what the nightlife is like. I chose not to associate with those types of people.
College Sophomore,1,"The summer and spring months are fine, but the winter is horrible! There's snow and ice almost everyday and campus never closes. It took me four hours (I only live 45mins away) to get to campus one day because of all the accidents and snow. They say individual professors have the right to cancel class if they feel the weather is bad enough, but most of them have adopted the attitude that they will only cancel if the campus closes. It's not safe to be on the roads in those conditions. I've had to miss three or four classes due to weather. They should have closed the campus on at least two of those days."
College Senior,1,"There are few choices of places to eat on campus, especially at night. As someone who has food restrictions due to health issues, I find it very difficult to find food available that I can eat. If I wish to grab food between classes, I have to drive off campus."

Sophomore,5,"Emerson College is at the center of the arts world in Boston, MA. They are a very collaborative school, both the faculty and the students.  Everybody is nice and supportive. The learning experience is thought out and there is easy access to everything!"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, many of my classes are more broad.  Looking forward to getting deeper as I go into my second year.  Teachers are passionate and energetic.  They get to most out of their student participation"
Freshman,5,Great classes.  Engaging teachers.  Motivated classmates.  Downtown Boston Commons location makes campus life easy.  Local security makes me feel incredibly safe. Championship Ultimate Frisbee team
Freshman,5,"Emerson College is love-it or hate-it, and I love it. Boston is amazing, everything is so accessible. Housing can be cramped, but the new freshman dorms are great. If you love theatre, there are performances happening all of the time from the different student groups. Many of them are completely free! Freshman year classes are easy, but I do admire the school's holistic approach to learning. If you're looking for a challenging academic experience, apply to the Honors program, worth the extra work. The school goes out of its way to accommodate student needs. Very open-minded and progressive. The food is hit or miss, can be bland. Basically no party scene and a very small sports scene, which I personally like. I will say that Emerson is very white and very liberal. I've never had a problem with this, just expect ""political correctness."" It's very expensive, even with scholarships. No school is perfect, and Emerson isn't for everyone, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere but here."
Freshman,5,"Honestly Emerson was my dream school since the seventh grade. And it did not disappoint. Yes the price is a bit steep but honestly I believe that your Emerson experience all depends on how involved you want to be. I applied to Emerson and I attend Emerson because it is considered the top journalism school in the country, and I found out why. It's amazing to see how many ways you can apply yourself, whether its helping to produce a show for Emerson Channel or going to New York Fashion Week for WEBN. I've been behind and in front of the camera and I've been able to write and draw for the Berkeley Beacon. I've learned so much over the past year alone and I've met some incredible people who I know I will be friends with until the end of time and for these reasons alone I'm still happy that I made the decision to go to college in the literal opposite side of the country. I miss my friends and I miss Emerson more than anything and I can't wait to go back."
Freshman,5,"I'm having a good time at Emerson. Lots of like-minded folks with a passion for the arts. I was able to settle in with some great friends and am thriving academically. The work is not too hard if you stay on top of it, and a lot of the professors know that Emerson students thrive on creativity, so many of the projects are somewhat open ended. The food has had massive improvements from last year, plenty of options for vegans and vegetarians. Living area can be small, but location (heart of Boston) is a great opportunity."
Sophomore,5,It is very good because It has the sense of an Ivy League and also allows the students tp express themselves. It is very important because it is extremely academically challenging but also demonstrates that they care about their students.
Niche User,5,I went to visit Emerson college just recently. I like that it is in the city and it is a small-medium sized campus. I loved that it is more teaching focused college rather than research. I like the small student teacher ratio.
Graduate Student,5,"I feel so supported by my professors, advisers and counselors. I have a huge support team that treats me with respect and sincerely cares about my well being. The content is pertinent to my field of study and I'm able to apply what I learn in my internships."
Freshman,5,"Everyone was so welcoming and warm and there's so much opportunity. It's the perfect place for a theatre major. Emerson is right in the heart of the theatre district in Boston. There's always a tour going through the opera house so you can always go see a show with friends. The Boston commons is also right across the street you can go there on your free time. There's also an amazing food selection there's food trucks all around and we have an amazing dining hall with accommodations for any type of person whether it be vegan, vegetarian, or  pescatarian."
Graduate Student,5,"Emerson College has been extremely welcoming. The professors, administrators and admissions team all go the extra mile to help students. They are dedicated and passionate about what they do. The campus is beautiful--you would be hard pressed to find a better setting. The Solstice MFA program is awesome."
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Emerson! The community of students and faculty is very positive and inclusive. The classes are challenging enough to keep me engaged, and the location is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"Being a smaller school in a big city has had no impact on my experience. As freshmen many of us are afraid of ""not fitting in"", well that is never a problem here at Emerson. This school is very diverse and welcoming and is basically one big family–you are honestly never 'lonely' no matter how far from home you may be. From the atmosphere, staff, peers, and school spirit, every day I wake up proud to be an Emerson Lion."
Alum,5,"Emerson is unique in the students that it draws. Incredibly creative, this is a school that is pushing boundaries while being respectful about it."
Graduate Student,5,Amazing school! Love everything about my experience at Emerson. Amazing staff! From the start everyone you encounter is so helpful and friendly. Teachers are very knowledgeable and easily accessible. Campus is gorgeous! I have even benefited from interaction with my diverse classmates! Love it here.
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Emerson is very passionate about their field and those who aren't quickly transfer out. Definitely a huge population of film students who fall into stereotypes, but you can find all kinds of people at Emerson. Almost everyone is very liberal and the LGBTQ+ population is huge. The school definitely struggles with racial and socioeconomic diversity. Finals are almost nonexistent here compared to other schools, but the workload is much more based on writing than exams anyway. Professors are mostly very good, but sometimes spacey because they're artists too. The dorms are also great, but a little overcrowded with the construction on the Little Building right now."
Graduate Student,5,"I graduated in Integrated Marketing Communication in 2015. It’s  the besr educational experience I have had so far. 
Professors were very competent and invariably responsive to students questions. 
Staff was also tremendously helpful and ready to address students issues/matters. 

I undoubtedly miss Emerson College."
Niche User,5,"When I visited Emerson College, I loved the experience. The students were extremely welcoming, as were the professors. The dorms were beautiful and the campus was wonderful!"
Niche User,5,"Emerson College has a warm, welcoming, and driven community. Upon touring, I immediately noticed the motivation and encouragement between both students and staff for success."
Sophomore,5,"As a journalism major, I love Emerson College for all the opportunities it gives me. The only downside to the school is the overwhelming price, but with financial aid it can be manageable. I highly recommend Emerson College."
Junior,5,The college is very welcoming to everyone and the people are wonderful. The only this I think they should have is dorms for all four years of college.
Freshman,5,The people at Emerson are so welcoming and are always there to help out. When I first visited I got endless amounts of smiles and I never felt out of place.
Niche User,5,Lovely campus in the heart of the city. Helpful and knowledgeable faculty. Lots of opportunities for students!
Freshman,5,"Emerson College is amazing if you want to expand your network. Essentially, you pay for your connections, not necessarily the education. While you do learn a lot her, it's not all academics. Much of our majors are trades and therefore we learn by doing. It's hard to sit in a classroom and learn about the history of journalism or the history of films and not create our own. We have a primitive location in downtown Boston that gives us access to so many opportunities as well as a great view from our dorm rooms. The faculty are very welcoming and want to help you succeed in your field."
Niche User,5,"When I visited, I knew immediately that it was where I wanted to spend the next 4 years of my life! The students there were so diverse and it seemed like such a tight-nit community. I attended a public relations class and it was extremely interactive and educational. Their athletics are not the best, but they made it clear that it was something that they were constantly trying to improve!"
Alum,5,"My four years at Emerson gave me great friends, helped shape my worldview, and greatly contributed to my career trajectory. The amount of opportunity there, both in and out of classes, is endless. The Emerson connections aren't a myth and the name is recognized outside the film/TV industry as well. I was a marketing communications major and I can't count how many times people in the marketing/advertising industry called out, recognized, and asked me about my school during internship interviews and networking events. After participating in an internship for credit at a Boston agency during my senior year, I received a job offer right before graduation, and I've been very happy there since!"
Freshman,5,"I am lucky and humbled to be a student of Emerson College, there is no other college like it. My major is only offered at Emerson with tremendous amount of opportunities to apply my recently taught information to real-world work. There are so many on-campus and off-campus co-curriculars  that I am happy to be a part of that I wouldn't get as elsewhere. Thanks, Emerson."
Niche User,5,"Emerson College is the ""hipster"" college of the northeast! The students are described as ""something else, not mainstream, not traditional, not following the current trends, but following the future trends, before they are trends."""
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Emerson. It is a supportive and encouraging creative community. There are so many excellent opportunities that aren't available anywhere else. Students are friendly and motivated and professors are supportive and knowledgeable. We have incredible co-curricular activities that prepare you for careers. Emerson was the perfect choice for me and I know that my education here will prepare me for my preferred career.
Niche User,5,"Emerson’s programs are especially enticing to me. An internship in the PR department of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, film marketing opportunities, and working with companies like Nokia and Zappos greatly appeals to me. Researching the growth of Emerson’s Marketing Communications Program over the last 10 years has made it one of the top ten Marketing Communications school in the country. These kinds of experience opportunities that provide professional development set people apart in the future workforce and that’s exactly why I want to get my Marketing Communications Degree at Emerson College."
Freshman,5,Emerson is a great school. The students are very accepting and easy to get along with. The professors care about you and your success. There are a lot of opportunities on campus to get involved with if you actively look for them. Theres something for everyone.
Junior,5,"The years I have spent at Emerson College in Boston have been the best years of my life! The Boston Campus gives you the opportunity to live right in the heart of Boston, across from Boston Common! All of my teachers have been engaging and are experienced in their field. Course offerings are plentiful and interesting and I have easily been able to shape my schedule so that it works around my preferences. The friends and the connections I have made, I know, will have great impact on my future career. The option to spend a semester abroad or at the Emerson LA campus is another huge plus for this college. I am very much looking forward to my semester in LA next year. I can not say enough good things about Emerson. I feel as though this school has truly set me on the path to a successful career."
Junior,5,"Emerson was my dream school. I love the location and the values the school upholds. Academics wise, professors are about average, but opportunities outside of the classroom are endless. With campuses in Boston, Los Angeles, and the Netherlands, Emerson students are given a chance to experience more than the average college student. There are weekly forums with filmmakers and entrepreneurs. There are shows and short films being made every single day, with casting calls being open to anyone regardless of major. The equipment the school provides is top notch. The worst thing about Emerson is the food. Fortunately, the school is aware of the issues and making improvements for the new Fall 2017 dining hall. The dorms are incredible spacious, many of them with amazing views of the Boston Common and Public Garden. Our alumnae network is also extremely close. Members of the ""Emerson Mafia"" watch out for each other no matter what, and that is something most other schools do not have."
College Sophomore,5,Just like a candle: lit.
College Sophomore,5,One of the few things this school will really help you with is getting a job after college and connecting you with alumni.
College Freshman,5,The model for success that the school follows as a whole is simply one of the best I've seen so far.
College Sophomore,5,The school feels pretty safe but they need to take sexual assault more seriously.
College Sophomore,5,They suits are amazing and clean and the buildings feel like apartments.
College Sophomore,5,"From what I've heard from peers in my major, they have been able to find internships and jobs. In fact, we are rated as the number 1 school for journalism in the nation!"
College Sophomore,5,Emerson is honestly the best thing to ever happen to me and I am so blessed to be here.
College Freshman,5,"From what I have seen on the Emerson Mafia facebook page, there seems to be tons of career opportunities available. Now, whether or not those opportunities are easily-made-realities, I wouldn't know."
College Freshman,5,I lived in Piano Row this year and absolutely loved it. The dorms were usually quiet and the rooms were HUGE. I loved my suite and I love PROW.
College Freshman,5,Emerson is known for getting their students jobs after graduation. Professors have to stay in their field to offer students recommendations that aren't outdated. Career services is invaluable.
College Freshman,5,"Emerson is not sports orientated, but those that play sports are very dedicated! I love working at the Athletics Department for my work study."
College Junior,5,It's almost guaranteed that you will get an internship. The alumni love to help each other and our employment rate I believe is around 85%.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are incredible. They genuinely want all of their students to excel, not only in the classroom but in their careers. Students are treated as peers."
College Freshman,5,Every single professor I've ever had has either been practicing in their field or retired after practicing in their field for many years. The professors are so knowledgeable and innovative.
College Freshman,5,"If you want to work in communications or the arts, Emerson is THE place to get your degree from. There is no doubt in my mind that every student who graduates from this school will find a job with ease."
College Freshman,5,"It is fairly well, cannot argue."
College Freshman,5,"I'm yet to have bloomed into it all, cannot say."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is driven, every wants to be something."
College Freshman,5,Everyone at this school is so friendly and so cool. I have had wonderful experiences with the staff and the people are all so accepting. I would choose my school every time because when you come here you get so much. There are so many opportunities presented to you and you are put in such a good position to be successful.
College Junior,5,Emerson College is my dream school in every way. It is an honor to attend and it feels like it is the beginning of the rest of my life.
College Freshman,5,"The environment of the campus, the relaxed atmosphere within social groups and the welcoming feeling from upperclassmen and faculty are what make Emerson so special (besides the top notch education you're recieving)"
College Junior,5,We live in downtown Boston so there are lots of food options. Everything that comes with living in the city.
College Senior,5,"Hands on experiences, real education, specialization, connections, extra curricular organizations, great professors, great location - all awesome!"
College Senior,5,Small classes with professors that actually teach well and care about forming relationships with students.
College Senior,5,Emerson is truly an amazing school--the professors and faculty are simply the best (so kind and helpful!) I've learned so much and have formed amazing relationships and connections. Very happy with my time here and would recommend it to anyone.
College Senior,5,A ton of options and variety. From gourmet restaurants to food trucks. Boston is definitely a food town!
College Sophomore,5,"We're right next to Chinatown, so there's an abundance of good food. If you're wondering what's good, just follow Yelp's advice."
Sophomore,4,I have taken online classes before so I am use to it. Emerson College in my experience has done a well job at balancing the online and in person learning experience especially in the covid era.
Alum,4,"In order to graduate on time, I had to make up credits whenever I could. I joined clubs for non-tuition credits and took one class online. The class I took was pretty chill. The teacher accepted late work and graded fairly."
Freshman,4,A great and diverse school. Perfect for anyone that wants to be surrounded with other creative individuals. Emerson pushing you to be the best and follow your dreams.
Sophomore,4,Emerson is a great place for liberal arts kids. There is a lot to do in the city and the surrounding Boston area. The housing options are nice and most students are kind and passionate.
Sophomore,4,"I like the classes a lot, some of them are pretty tough so be on the lookout for that, and make sure you choose wisely of what do you really want to learn."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school if you are very passionate in pursuing  pop culture in the career field. Yes, you will encounter some snobby kids that they think they are the best at anything! The food could be way better and I think that they should provide parking as well as I would want to drive my car to school!"
Sophomore,4,"Emerson is a great community, they really do know how to make it feel like home. I also met some great people and made some great friends. Professors are very good, classes are small so you can have a one to one if you need some help with the course."
Sophomore,4,"The best part of Emerson is the location. Boston is amazing and there are several T stops a block away or less. Several buildings have been nicely renovated in the last several years. As a film major with virtually no experience, I found it difficult to adapt to my foundations in production course. Some liberal arts classes have not been particularly challenging, but I do appreciate the liberal arts curriculum so the focus is not entirely on film. Dining Hall has been recently updated so the food is great in my opinion!! Plus there are so many places to eat nearby."
Alum,4,I loved the community at Emerson and the amazing campus. I had great opportunities that guided me to many different career options. I loved the social life on campus and the people I met. I had great professors. I disliked the cost and the pressure the school puts on career and entertainment.
Freshman,4,I love Emerson. I didn't know what to expect when I applied. It has a great reputation when it comes to diversity and as a black student I was looking for comfort. It has for the most part lived up to it. There's not a lot of students of color but the ones that are there are a community and I feel respected by everyone of my peers. Be ware it's a very expensive school but I'm yet to regret my decision to be here.
Freshman,4,"First off, I should tell you that I am a commuter, so I can't give a good insight into dorm life or campus food. I have only eaten at the dining hall three times and they were all good. Aside from those, the courses are actually quite fascinating. I've only taken a few but they were all really good. This school is also good about transfer credits; it took all of my community college transfer credits. The campus is really close together so if you want a small campus then Emerson is the place for you. If you have any questions about the college, they respond to emails relatively quickly."
Freshman,4,One of the only things I'd change about Emerson College is the price. Tuition and room and board are exorbitant.
Sophomore,4,"Emerson has a lot of really good professors and lots of programs for students to get involved in. They try to set up events like the organization fair where people can go and see all the clubs they can join. Emerson is also good about keeping students updated on events that happen around us, even if it is not about the college. There are also lots of resources to help the students in whatever they need such as the writing center or the advising center. Emerson also has fun events that happen in the Dining Hall throughout the year."
Sophomore,4,"I love the opportunities available at this college. The campus is one of my favorite parts about this school, it is very unique. Although, it is very expensive but I think it is worth it."
Sophomore,4,"I applied to Emerson College because it was recommended to me by a lot of my high school teachers as a great place for writing majors, which is what I plan to do. As a student here, I have had amazing professors who have encouraged my writing and have helped me make the most of my time here, and have also taught me more techniques to improve my writing."
Sophomore,4,Emerson College is full of opportunities for those who seek. You will meet people who are like minded and there to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Emerson is a great school, though it definitely caters to a specific type of student. It is a very liberal and progressive environment that can make you feel like your living in an isolated bubble without the opportunity to interact with people who have different perspectives.  Its small size allows you to truly feel a sense of community, especially within your department. The best part about Emerson is how much student lead activity there is and how proactive and productive your peers are. This can be intimidating to some, but it's also really inspirational and ensures that there is always something you can be doing outside your classes to further your education, and people to do it with. The teachers are, for the most part, very passionate about what they do, and the small class sizes really allow you to get the most out of your courses and form relationships with your teachers and classmates."
Junior,4,"The professors are good, for the most part. Classes are extremely cool and come in a very liberal variety. Literally. We're quirky, creative, accomplished, LGBTQ-friendly, and extremely passionate. Student pressure pushes me to be my best, abut also have fun. I've stared in a Berkley music video, styles multiple photoshoots, written for magazines, and gone to several theatre performances. The administration often doesn't listen and seems to be out for the money, the whole place rich and white and problematic, but I wouldn't trade my experience for the world. As a journalism major, I'm finding important subjects and opportunities to expand my career and the world around me."
Senior,4,"I would say Emerson is most known for its journalism, filmmaking, marketing, and theater performance majors. As a film major, I have found Emerson has an amazing culture for students like me to make a lot of content for their reels. I wish classes were a little more structured sometimes, but if you find the right course you can really learn a lot about the skills and the industry we're entering. Though Emerson has a lot to offer, it really takes a student with initiative to really take advantage of everything outside the classroom, where most film students actually learn."
Freshman,4,I really feel that Emerson has helped me become a better writer and given me a good fundamental basis of understanding how I can grow.
Sophomore,4,"Amazing environment for creative growth. Every college has its problems, but choosing to come to Emerson was honestly my best option and I would not want to go anywhere else to pursue the television field."
Alum,4,"Emerson is great, but only if you work for it. It is possible to just float through your 4 years and come out the other end with limited job prospects, personal connections, and $60,000 in debt, but if you have goals in mind you can reach them if you take the initiative."
Junior,4,Emerson has such an immersive community of like-minded people who are hard-working and passionate. It's easy to become involved and grow as an artist.
Junior,4,What you get out of Emerson is what you put into it. Get involved. Learn how to balance projects and social life. Professors are phenomenal - especially when you engage. Boston is an amazing town. It’s expensive to go here but I’m taking advantage of all the equipment/studios and what I’m learning in order to build a portfolio of work  I can be proud of.
Alum,4,"Emerson College has excellent professors, and unique arts programs, however the administration is controlling, disorganized, and insensitive to student needs: student facilities are in some cases fantastic and in others severely lacking. We had no student union for a whole year and a half, because the lease ran out. The theatre spaces are some of the best college theatres in the country, with the only broadway style theatre, and several other excellent performing spaces. However, the administration does not make it very easy to use the space. Our class tries to put on a senior showcase in NYC, and the administrators forbid it, because they are overly controlling of their image. Overall, it's worth putting up with them for the quality of the education, but be aware that there may be hurdles to jump."
Sophomore,4,"Emerson is an institution heavily weighted towards VMA and theatre majors. It flaunts its journalism program, but it's very lacking in that department. Many journalism majors cannot check out cameras or tripods and are instead given iPods and tripods for those iPods. Students in this journalism classes are very unmotivated sometimes, while in journalism organizations on campus are much more energetic about their profession. These organizations, as they already contain more motivated students, should receive more funding to entice more students to join them and produce greater work. There is much more diversity on campus this year, which is a step in the right direction as well."
Freshman,4,"The dining hall has definitely improved from previous years with the new service, although sometimes their options are weird. It's pretty hit or miss. I wish that there were more social space and a better campus center. The campus definitely feels a bit weird with all of the construction, but hopefully that will get better when the renovations are done."
Freshman,4,Emerson is an amazing liberal arts school that offers a unique and competitive academic atmosphere for students.
Freshman,4,"As a gender minority, it has been very easy for me to spend my time in Emerson College. I just wish that they give better accesses to filming equipment for all students."
Freshman,4,"I've only gone to visit the school and it was amazing, the students there are really nice and helped my way around the city."
Junior,4,"It's an amazing school for academics. I'm a broadcast journalism major, and the material I learn each and every class makes me confident in not only what I want to be but reminds me how lucky I am to go to a school that is ranked #1 for journalism. The social scene is the biggest con for me, it's not a party school- at all."
Junior,4,"Emerson is what you make of it. You either love it or hate it depending on your attitude. there is a lot of stuff to do outside of the campus physically and mentally. I've met a lot of cool people and grown as a person by going to Emerson. Everyone is very creative, independent, and driven. Sometimes people are fake and annoying but whatever just don't talk to them. Also, having on your resume that you went to Emerson is a huge bonus, people will most likely hire you even if you're dumb. expensive, but worth it if you're able to afford it. try to join as many orgs as you can, because that will be the best part of college. don't stay confined to the emerson bubble, go out and meet new people around the city, try to get a job that isn't close to campus, you will meet a lot of new, older people that way. overall, I had a good time at emerson but that's because I didn't stress about the politics and drama at school and just did my own thing."
Freshman,4,"Emerson is my dream school and it’s an amazing expirience! It’s in an amazing part of Boston with a number of things to do at all
times. I don’t think anything needs to change except for trivial things that every college has small issues with such as the size of dorms but they’re not uncomfortable! There’s a world of opportunities to be had outside of the school and great job oppurtinities for graduates! The study abroad is out of this world! I wouldn’t do school any other way"
Junior,4,Emerson College provides great education for careers in communication and the arts.  Students get hand-on experience in their respective fields that help to prepare them for the real world.  Professors are often working professionals who help to add a real-world perspective to many classes.
Niche User,4,"The staff are very eager to help with admission problems, and their website is very easy to navigate and shows exactly what you need to apply."
Sophomore,4,"While it seems like everyone is doing fifteen clubs and going to parties all the time, once you find your people it becomes considerably less overwhelming and you can find your groove."
Sophomore,4,"Because there's no actual campus and the population is very small, it's very difficult to find a community outside of your suite unless you're in a club or group. That was my serious struggle first semester. However, second semester of freshman year, I got into an a cappella group, and through them, was somehow connected to everyone else at school. Having this community makes everything feel better."
Junior,4,"Emerson is a great college for students who are passionate about the field of communication and know what they want from the school. There are many clubs, television channels, radio stations, theater productions and sports to join and it's very important to be involved with these activities and not only to go to class. The professors and students are very inclusive and creative people but I've had many problems with the college's student services such as housing, dining, and counseling. The school tends to be more concerned with profit rather than the wellbeing of its students, the support they offer does not live up to what they claim. Overall this school has many opportunities and is what you make of it."
Freshman,4,"Emerson College allows students to be the best that they can be from day one. They never stop our creativity, and they always strive to have students be as successful as possible. Overall, Emerson is and was my first choice."
Freshman,4,"The resources and academics at this school are great. Although since there isn't much of a campus it is hard to meet new people outside of classes. Also if you are a huge fan of sports and want to go watch games all the time don't plan on going to any for this school, they are not widely publisized."
Niche User,4,Emerson College is a very forward-thinking community which supports people of many diverse backgrounds. I recommend applying if you are very passionate about what you are looking to do with your college career.
Freshman,4,"Emerson's Film Culture is really strong! The major projects are very professionally run by upperclassmen. If you really want to work on set it's only a matter of time before the opportunity presents itself. Don't take any opportunity for granted. I only wish that Freshmen Foundations Production class challenged Freshmen to make more films and taught more skills of Production, such as editing for Premier."
Sophomore,4,Being in Boston is a fantastic experience. It's the perfect balance between populated city and college town environment. Emerson College gives students amazing opportunities to work in their fields or on student projects all around the city.
College Freshman,4,we are a campus in the midst of downtown Boston.  Of course there is crime in the city.  I feel secure in my dorm and with the building security and safety features in place.  Going places in a group  and being aware of your surroundings is just common sense.
College Freshman,4,"Paramount wasn't my first choice because it seems removed, but the quietness and closeness to pedestrian shopping make up for it.  The dorms are new and the common areas are useful with microwaves and water coolers."
College Freshman,4,"Being able to experience the real world and art just outside your dorm is amazing, just like Boston!"
College Sophomore,4,"The types of courses offered at this school are varied and can be very interesting. The teachers are ok, but it just depends on who you get, like any school."
College Sophomore,4,The connections this school has seem very good and they have plenty of internship opportunities.
College Senior,4,"There are lots of opportunities to network through professors and other students, especially through the FB group for current and past Emerson students."
College Senior,4,"I think the advising system works better here than at my old school, but still could use some developing as I don't have a strong relationship with my advisor. I like that it's a generally liberal campus because everyone is more open minded and we can talk about issues fairly."
College Senior,4,I transfered to Emerson from another art school (as a marketing major in both schools) and have found that my classes are more challenging (in a good way) and the professors and advising team are all super helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I have liked most of my professors and classes are small and intimate.
College Sophomore,4,We have pretty nice dorms.
College Sophomore,4,"My first year was pretty exciting. The school provides you with so many opportunities to get the experience you need in whatever career field you are pursuing. Plus, at Emerson they pretty much let you discover on your own. They let you grow a lot in that way."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, professors are great. Especially in the Performing Arts department, Emerson using a lot of adjunct professors who are still working out in their field and they bring that experience back to their students."
College Sophomore,4,"""The Emerson Mafia"" is literally everywhere in the entertainment industry, and Emerson students have access to Career Services for the rest of their lives which is really important and great."
College Sophomore,4,"Emerson does a lot during orientation to teach new students how to keep themselves well and safe, which is really great and important."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus can come with downsides, being in a confined space with your peers being one of them, but being so close to your classes and everything going on is an amazing deal."
College Sophomore,4,"Fraternity and Sorority Life is absolutely amazing for those involved, but it's not super important to the people who don't participate."
College Sophomore,4,Very accessible Health & Wellness center that is helpful both in terms of physical and emotional health.
Sophomore,2,"My situation with the transition to online classes was not the best. While it is difficult to do one's profession during a pandemic, a lot of the teachers sort of flaked out despite promising an interactive experience. None of my teachers actually used zoom consistently, contributing to an overall disconnected feeling. There was a lot of busy-work. And by this, I mean countless, pointless, exhaustive activities that I did not really learn from. Truly, all I got from my second semester (spring 2020) was even more stress. The pass/fail system was very thoughtful for students who were struggling through."
Alum,2,"Like many who apply and attend here; I identify as a creator and storyteller. I truly believe Emerson students are some of the most artistic, ambitious, and intelligent people out there. Emersonians are talented but one thing they aren’t is kind. The student body is inclusive yet cliquey; woke yet judgemental; accepting yet mean-spirited. 

I mostly enjoyed the classes.  Trying to get the classes you want is like being in the Hunger Games. Boston is also very small and you're going to have to really like it because Emerson doesn't have much of a campus. Boston will become your campus. I love nature and I love the beach so I didn't really think that through and that's on me. Parties don't exist at Emerson. Anyone who goes to parties attends them at the surrounding universities. One thing we can all agree on is that food here is trash. 

I never found my tribe despite being fairly involved in student life. But if you find a group of solid friends you should be fine."
Sophomore,2,Transitioning to online learning was particularly hard for me as a performing arts student but my professors tried their best. Just not an idea situation for anyone.
Freshman,2,"I took online classes for about half of my second semester, due to the Coronavirus. The transition was difficult. Emerson is, as others have said, a very hands-on school. It's hard to translate the in-person dynamic of an Emerson class to an online platform, especially for the performing arts students. If you're in the school of communication, it isn't as bad. I would still recommend against online classes if you have the option."
Sophomore,2,"Emerson is a lively school with a creative learning environment. However, the faculty does not listen to their students and money is very suspicious. The food could have been MUCH better, the school ignores social, racial, and sexual assault issues, and most of my teachers were bullies. 
I was there two semesters. Go for theatre, film, journalism, or nothing at all ESPECIALLY if you want to climb up the corporate ladder."
Sophomore,2,"I'm a second-year student at Emerson with a Communication Sciences and Disorders major. While major-specific classes are well-taught, our tuition is overly high since only 60% of what we pay for tuition is actually used for classes. The other 40% is for fun stuff and clubs for only 3 of all the majors at Emerson - film, theatre, and journalism. It's resources are only given to students in these majors, all other students have little-to-no resources other than classes themselves. There are very few clubs or opportunities for other students, and with an extreme lack of a real campus the school has no real place for students not involved in the three top majors. Also, while accepting of LBGQT students, Emerson has no diversity regarding people of color. In addition, it's food is terrible - several students have gotten food poisoning, sometimes having to be hospitalized - and other than spending millions of dollars on a new dining facility, nothing has been done to improve the food."
Sophomore,2,"Emerson focuses more on networking than standard academics , but only if you are interested in media arts is it effective. I chose to attend as journalism major, and did not get the necessary lessons or connects that the school emphasizes. The professors are kind and will do a lot to help you, but the administration and advisors not so much."
College Sophomore,2,We need to break from Eurocentric patriarchal norm
College Sophomore,2,No sports community at Emerson. Little to no intramural sports.
College Junior,2,I love Emerson but unfortunately they do not give much financial aid as far as merit scholarships go.
College Freshman,2,Very small endowment and little opportunity for scholarships.
College Freshman,2,Personally I'm not a fan of living on campus because of the social atmosphere. I don't enjoy living in the same room as someone else as it gets cramped and doesn't allow for as much freedom as off-campus living.
College Sophomore,2,You have to hound the department to get their stuff done. Do what I did-nag them consistently until they do what they need to. Call them twice a week to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to. Don't let them push you around.
College Freshman,2,Doesn't play a significant role
College Freshman,2,"The party scene at Emerson is a real disappointment. Aside from small kickbacks in dorm rooms, there are no on-campus parties so you have to go to Allston, Brighton, or Revere to find anything fun. The problem with this is that it takes like 45 minutes to get to Allston on the T and since Freshmen and Sophomores are required to live on campus, you have to be in with the upperclassmen to even hear about anything. I've been to two great parties since being at Emerson while most weekends are spent trying to find a party only to end up roaming the streets of sketchy Allston in the freezing cold."
College Freshman,2,"I've never been to a sporting event at Emerson and I don't know how I would even go about doing so. There is a basketball gym on campus but other than that, I have no idea where any of our other teams even play. Sports are definitely not a big part of student life."
College Junior,2,"Fortunately, I have a decent merit scholarship, but I don't know how many students receive it and Emerson is hella expensive. It's a little ridiculous. They don't offer a ton of financial aid, and it's always a hassle because for some reason I have to submit extra forms and my taxes and it's annoying. I would be prepared to take out a loan."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone is all about their major here. Very close-minded in terms of majors. If you are undecided it is very rare.
College Sophomore,2,Emerson is primarily an art school and does not focus on its sports. While people participate they are not the best teams.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Scholarships? Basically non-existent, or at least not for me. I had zero luck with merit or financial based scholarships. My dad took out many loans. Which sucks because Emerson is a SMALL ARTS college with many opportunities to let students shine with writing or media merit scholarships. Nope."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is a DIII school so don't expect a huge athletic community at Emerson. They obviously have fun and play, but most students don't pay attention or care. This is an art school. We can't use the gyms for fun anyway. Regardless, it exists."
College Sophomore,2,"Not that easy to access on campus, have to go elsewhere normally"
College Junior,2,"Some policies are ridiculous.  I was stranded in Boston during spring break with nowhere to stay on the last day before school resumed, and went to the dorms, pleading to be let in from the cold, snowy street.  The dorms were open and there were people staying in them, but they refused to let me in and I slept on the street that night in 5 degree weather.  Come on, Emerson."
College Senior,2,"Being an arts school, we have a lot of vegetarians as well as many people with food allergies. The food choices at the dining hall and other on-campus restaurants are very minimal and typically unhealthy. The price of a meal plan here is outrageous but I never have a problem using it all up. There is a convenience store on campus, but unfortunately they only offer unhealthy junk food snacks for now. Luckily Sodexo is always taking suggestions and making improvements every semester."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is not very important at Emerson, but those who are in greek life are usually very invested in it. The professional frats and sororities are probably the most dedicated ones and are pretty cliquey. They only throw a few parties each semester."
College Junior,2,No one really cares about our sports teams which is really sad because they're not that bad. Most of the attention is placed on the big intramural sport on campus: Quidditch (of which I am a proud member).
College Junior,2,"Most places are overpriced. Look up 'Boston landlords' and you'll find a ton of information and articles about slumlords preying on students. If you get a decent realtor you'll be OK, but still not getting your money's worth. I'm from Philadelphia, and my boyfriends rents an entire detached house for $1500 a month, three bedrooms. I'm looking at lofts for $2000 a month in decent neighborhoods. Crappy neighborhoods get you more, but then you're farther away from campus and in less safe areas."
College Freshman,2,I applied and hardly received any money at all.
College Freshman,2,Greek life at Emerson is very small and often forgotten about. There are only a few Greek organizations on campus and none of the chapters are terribly impressive.
College Freshman,2,It's bad. You can eat as much as you want in the Dining Hall but would you really want to? At least every building has it's own food source except for Colonial.
College Freshman,2,"The school itself is not that great. The extracurriculars, connections and opportunities are pretty impressive and is what I'm here for. But the school's education system and its policies on everything else could be improved. It's also insanely overpriced with not enough financial aid."
College Freshman,2,Emerson needs to give more financial aid.
College Junior,2,7% of the school is in greek life and it's pretty lame.
College Junior,2,"The conduct coordinator is really rude and disrespectful. They are quick to give out alcohol violations, even if you didn't deserve it."
College Junior,2,"Diverse sexual orientation's are widely accepted across the campus. However, liberal mindedness is the norm of most. Also, in terms of campus ethnic diversity, it is severely lacking. An article was just published about how there are less Black students enrolled in the 2012 Freshman class than in 1969 when they decided to increase the amount they would accept per year."
College Freshman,2,"If you are looking for a school that's really into sports, this isn't the one. Although a lot of people participate in Quidditch"
College Freshman,2,"This isn't a sports school. People don't come here to play sports. We have Quidditch, and we talk about it a lot."
College Freshman,2,It's a pretty challenging school to get into because there is an audition process in addition to the general selectivity for the acting and musical theatre programs. There is also a cut program at the end of sophomore year.
College Sophomore,2,"Racial diversity: sort of, economic diversity: no"
College Sophomore,2,There is not much financial aid to go around.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life doesn't have any presence on campus
College Freshman,2,We don't have parking and city parking is very pricey. 
College Junior,2,"So the guest policies are actually pretty good, you can have up to 5 guests in your dorm at a time. But we have to tap in everywhere we go because the college is tracking us at every waking moment. The guest check-in policy is pretty annoying. We have to give the desk assistants IDs to they can copy the info into their computer. I guess this isn't a big deal because we're in the middle of Boston where a lot of crazies live, but we have to ""check out"" our guest and they have to be present while you do it. The strictness for guests is just stupid. If I don't have to sign out of my building then why does my guest? Attendance is super strict in every class I've ever had here. You get 4 absences and then you fail the class. As for the alcohol/drug/noise policies, they're super strict if you live in Little Building, but they're lenient everywhere else (depending on how chill your RA's are) so just don't live in Little Building. Also, the Honor Code is ridiculous. Even if you're 21 at a bar, you're not allowed to say you're from Emerson because being at a bar LEGALLY ""represents the college negatively"". Get a grip on that one, Emerson."
College Junior,2,"The winters are cold and snowy. It's gonna suck, but you have to deal with it. Especially in the hub of the city with tall buildings surrounding you, the wind tunnels become unbearable come mid-February. The only solution is to not live in Paramount. This is the only dorm building not on Boylston Street and to get to the rest of campus you have to walk down the windiest street in the entire city. Fortunately, the rest of campus is essentially one block, so at least you don't have to walk across campus for 20 minutes to get to class!"
College Freshman,2,"The new dining service puts way too much oil in everything. I heard they were sued for serving horse meat at another school. I always feel sick after eating in the dining hall. The cafe's are alright, but service is SO SLOW. sdaz"
College Sophomore,2,"People smoke pot in the dorms and don't get in trouble for it unless they're caught by the RD.  It negatively affects everyone on their floor and they do it over and over again, without a care in the world.  The only worse thing is that I have a roommate who blasts the tv all the time.  Really.  During the day while she's sleeping on the couch in front of it, whenever her computer is on with a video game and skype (all three noises at the same time for a long time), and ridiculously late into the night.  We're supposed to have quiet hours that start at 11pm Sunday night through Thursday night, but she insists (no matter how much we ask / tell her to turn down or off the tv) on doing it well past 2am.  I have classes in the morning.  It's the worst experience I've had living on campus so far."
College Sophomore,2,"Typical New England weather. If you are accustomed to sunny, mild and predictable California weather, it will be a bit of an adjustment. If you don't mind snow in the Winter and muggy Summers then you will love Boston. "
College Sophomore,2,Bring an ethernet. Wireless usually doesn't work very well and you'll definitely need it. 
College Sophomore,2,"Parking garages cost a lot of money, and meters only get you a few hours and fill up quickly"
College Sophomore,2,"It's flippin cold. 

....and windy"
College Sophomore,2,"Cliquey, pretentious student body...dining facilities are poor quality, especially for the amount of money students are spending to go here...the academics and study abroad opportunities are the only things keeping me here currently. "
College Senior,2,No one cares about greek life unless youre in it.
College Freshman,2,"Our school doesn't have school spirit. I sometimes forget that our school's mascot is a lion.

"
College Freshman,2,"It's a small school so don't expect to see big stadiums or big green areas. It's very metropolitan and everything is cramped together. It's nice but at the same time, it can feel a bit claustrophobic. "
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've been told, Greek life isn't very fun to be a part of."
College Sophomore,2,It is ridiculous getting any decent scholarship or financial aid money from Emerson College.
College Sophomore,2,"They don't give very many scholarships, unless you get into their very tiny honors program."
College Sophomore,2,"There are several sports teams, but absolutely nobody goes to the games. People turn out for their parties, but that's about it. The most popular sport is probably quidditch, and even those games have tiny turnouts. The school doesn't promote the teams, either."
College Sophomore,2,"The athletes aren't bad, but we aren't exactly a huge sports school. We're bigger on Quidditch than on more traditional sports."
College Junior,2,"Parking at Emerson is really hard to find because the college is located right in downtown Boston. My friends who do own cars park less than a block away, however, it is really expensive to park there."
Alum,1,Wouldn't recommend taking courses online here. They have a very poor online set up but I don't know how its changed since covid
Alum,1,I graduated Emerson a few years ago. I transferred in and it was the biggest mistake I ever made. Either you love or hate it. I transferred in with 76 credits and they cut it to 32 meaning I had to repeat 1.5 years of school. They let me know 2 weeks before my first semester that I wouldn't be able to live on campus because I had family in the area so I had to stay with them through the rest of the year. It cost a lot of money with no return and the professors are either really good but most are terrible.
Freshman,1,"So glad I transferred out of this dump. There is an extremist, hive-mind mentality among every student that discourages civil discourse. There is very little diversity of race, background, or thought and it shows. Worse yet, I didn't feel like I was developing artistically, academically, or professionally at all."
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you know that your chosen field is 110% what you want to do for the rest of your life and willing to fight tooth and nail to make it work, don't look at Emerson. Students are white,privileged, snobby and unfriendly. No sense of community at the school. Many emerson students describe it as a ""summer camp"" because of the pathetically easy classes and homework assignments."
College Freshman,1,"I became a part of the Greek Life and had a horrible experience. They said that they don't haze, but they just renamed the hazing part to initiation."
College Freshman,1,"Fortunately for me I'm an athlete so I can go to the parties, but the only parties are a 25 minute T ride off campus at one of the sport houses (men's baseball, lacrosse, soccer, or volleyball) in either Allston or JP and they're almost always athletes only."
College Freshman,1,"I play varsity softball at Emerson. No one outside of the athletics department gives a crap about student athletes or our needs. The gym doesn't even have bleachers or seating. The softball field is also the soccer/lacrosse field (wtf?!) and it's turf.  It's also 1.5 miles from school, which is understandable since we're in downtown Boston, but we have to WALK to and from practices and games! Student athletes aren't given the option to register for class early to fit our sport schedule, like most other schools."
College Freshman,1,Not nutritious and processed garbage. We get our food from factory farms that torture animals and raise/breed them in unnatural ways.
College Freshman,1,Terrible quality food that is not prepared well.
College Freshman,1,"Too expensive, barely any options."
College Freshman,1,"Not enough options, terrible options, overpriced."
College Freshman,1,People don't come to emerson to play sports.
College Freshman,1,"Super weird about drinking in dorms. You'd think RAs would be chill, but they're psycho."
College Freshman,1,"Parties are always cramped. No attractive guys. Girls have to lower their standards, and there is never any alcohol at the parties. Go to other schools to have a good time."
College Freshman,1,"The straight guys are ABSOLUTE assholes. Whatever you do, stay as far away from the straight athletes at the school. Any guy who is remotely attractive will automatically think they're the coolest thing since sliced bread. I have had such a difficult time making non-gay guy friends, simply because they're so pretentious and pompous. If you're a girl relying on getting a boyfriend here, GIVE IT UP. The guys are douches, except for the gay ones."
College Freshman,1,"Don't park, just take the T."
College Freshman,1,Scholarships are few and far between. Emerson relies on tuition for most of their funding. Your only hope is to get into the Honors Program because then you only have to pay half tuition.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing nearby. You have to work for it.
College Junior,1,"Don't bring a car, parking is Boston is impossible unless you want to spend more money on a space than you did your car."
College Junior,1,"The school does not have any off-campus housing. After sophomore year, students are on their own to find apartments as well as roommates. Unless you can afford to pay $2,000+ a month to actually live relatively close, you're looking at about $800 a month to live in Allston/Brighton which is about an hour commute on the T (because the green line is NEVER reliable. That's rule #1.)"
College Junior,1,I've never heard of Emerson having its own parking lot. I think the only parking available is the public parking or if you're lucky you can find a meter spot on the Common. Really don't bother with a car.
College Sophomore,1,"Gross!  So gross!  I eat at the Dining Hall and it usually makes me feel sick.  The Max (a food place in Piano Row) started spraying their pizzas with pan spray this semester, as in, they actually liberally spray it on the entire finished pizza before it goes in the oven.  Yuck!"
College Sophomore,1,Emerson doesn't have scholarships or any in-house financial aid.  I'm drowning in student loans.
College Sophomore,1,"The rooms are small, the lottery is unreasonable, and everything is so awful that I'm not surprised students ""have to live on campus"" for their first two years.  It's soooo not worth $15k a year.  I'm living off campus as soon as I'm allowed."
College Sophomore,1,"So we need computers.  As in, laptops.  Some of the teachers require you to bring them to class and some forbid them.  (Some don't care, but they're harder to find.)  If you need to print on campus, you should do it the day or night before you need the physical document.  There will always be a problem - long lines, incapable computers, no paper, no ink, frozen something-or-other, ANYTHING - if you try to print it same-day.

Not to mention that the WiFi is so bad that it drains my laptops battery in two hours flat, just from the amount of times it has to reconnect because the signal is so poor.  It's a campus-wide issue, so don't expect it to ever be ""working""."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is located in  the middle of the city, and does not offer any parking specifically for students. If you live on campus, keeping a car is almost impossible and ridiculously expensive, luckily it's also very unnecessary as public transportation is easily accessible and it's Boston so almost everything you could need is within walking distance."
College Sophomore,1,"Not great. The dining hall has limited options and not the best quality. If you want good food, either go off campus or choose one of the cafes around campus"
College Sophomore,1,"The guys are very into either film, smoking, pot, or all three.  Most of them are below average-looking, so the few average ones are viewed as ""super hot"" in comparison.  Almost all of them are douches.  As for the girls, most of them are rude.  Almost all of them dress up all the time - full hair, makeup, and overdone clothes for class.  Most of the theatre majors are difficult to talk to in their idiocy."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a city, you shouldn't use a car and we have no parking lots except for the paid hourly ones. It's extremely easy to commute via subway though."
College Freshman,1,"There is NO parking. No one really brings a car to the Boston campus because of the readily accessible public transit, but when family comes to visit there is no where for them to park for cheap."
College Freshman,1,"I despise the limited nature of the campus meal plan. While most of the dining options on campus are fairly good, the ones you use campus money called ""Board Bucks"" to buy things from, the one place you use your meals, the Dining Hall, is absolutely disgusting. I don't know anyone who hasn't gotten food poisoning there at least once, and there are really limited options for people with dietary restrictions. Plus it tastes bad and there aren't many healthy options. Unfortunately there is no way to transfer meals into more Board Bucks, so if you don't want to suffer, you end up spending a lot of real money by the end of the semester."
Recent Alumnus,1,Emerson is located in downtown Boston so there is almost no parking. Meter parking is hard to get and if you do the time limits are short and very strict.
College Freshman,1,Don't drive here unless you want to pay 25 dollars a day to park in a parking garage in central Boston.
College Freshman,1,"This school is very, very indiverse. In terms of racial diversity, most students are white. There is a semi-substantial Asian population and other minority populations, although small. There is an even smaller black community-- I have met Emersonians who are uncomfortable around black people. 

In terms of socioeconomic diversity, most students tend to be a part of the upper-middle class, although they would almost never admit it (it is fashionable to complain here). Emerson's financial aid is notorious for not being all that great, although there are many students who are here on great academic merit scholarships or large grants. 

There are ""typical"" Emerson stereotypes, which can be very true, although there are people that defy these stereotypes. In general, I find the student body to be very much the same, in terms of race, socioeconomic status, interest, and personality. Sometimes, discussions in classes scream of privilege-- students tend to not have a good scope of reality when it comes to poverty, racial issues, etc. Nevertheless, Emerson tries very hard to be socially just, so there is not flat-out racism usually, just lack of ""exposure."""
College Sophomore,1,Very few guys. Most are gay. Those who aren't are usually not very attractive. The few who are attractive are cocky about it because there are so few of them to go around.
College Sophomore,1,"There are parking garages around, but they cost a lot and they're tough to navigate. Just plan on not having a car while you're living on campus. Take advantage of the public transportation. When your parents visit, encourage them to take the bus (South Station is less than fifteen minute walk away) and if they're bringing a car warn them about the parking situations."
College Junior,1,"Parking isn't easy at Emerson. There are a lot of parking garages, but it's not really worth it have a car at Emerson. The T (our public transit system) and the commuter rail could take you just about anywhere you need to be and you could rent a Zip Car if you needed a vehicle for something. Public transit is your friend in Boston!"
College Freshman,1,"Don't Bother Bringing a Car – Parking in Boston is vicious, territorial, and expensive. Use the MBTA instead."
College Junior,1,"What scholarships?
I haven't gotten, nor heard of anyone else getting scholarships unless they're a senior...and there's only about four scholarships offered to seniors.
Financial aid is awful. I get next to nothing. I receive veteran benefits, but Emerson won't even pay half of the full amount I should be getting. Some people don't even get financial aid at all. I'm relying on loans and external scholarships."
College Junior,1,"Essentially there is no parking at Emerson College since it is in the heart of downtown Boston. All of the parking is extremely expensive on account of all the tourist. It's best to just ride a bike, take a walk, or take the T (MBTA)."

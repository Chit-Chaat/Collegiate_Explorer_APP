Sophomore,5,"Attending Shasta College is what you make of it-- the opportunities are endless, all you have to do is ask one of the many supportive staff to connect you to the resources to get you where you want to go or to someone who knows how to help."
Junior,5,"I have taken many Of my classes online. It is a decent experience, although I Prefer in person classes"
Sophomore,5,"The online programs are fantastic. Classes are very easy to find and manage threw the canvas application. I am really enjoying my classes and professors. 
My rating for the on line program at Shasta College is five stars. I have no complaints."
Sophomore,5,"I am starting my second year at Shasta College, and I have not one complaint. I am in the online business program to get my Associates Degree. The instructors are all amazing so far. The financial aide assistance was kind, prompt, and very helpful.  The front office and councelor were all of equally amazing. 
I am very impressed so far. My rating for Shasta College is five stars."
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience has been wonderful! all the classes I have taken online I have earned high grades in. I'm disciplined in organizing my schedule for work to fit my courses I have taken here. However, online is not as easy as something you do need to plan and take time out of your day to get what you need accomplished I have run into many friends who struggle with online classes because they don't hold themselves accountable for the work they need to get done. Therefore, I advise people who are looking or going to take Shasta College online courses to set time aside and life to make time for your homework and studying for finals. It will help you organize in class and help keep you functional in life."
Freshman,5,"I can't really tell you about anything for on campus because I'm an online college student, but the online structure and setup is great. The only complaints I could have are that it's super fast paced and you can't make-up assignments it missed. Then again you shouldn't have any missed assignments because from the time they are posted to when they are do is like a 3 day"
Freshman,5,"The canvas online class format is easy to navigate and fun. The assignments are well organized and are set up in such a way that they naturally flow. There is a ton of good tech support that goes alone with it, and problems are quickly resolved. I give it two thumbs up!"
Freshman,5,"Shasta college is an excellent institution that has been very supportive of my education in every way I can think of. During this covid pandemic, they have really gone to bat for us students, coming through with retooled online formats for the completion of this last semester. Shasta college has one of the only heavy equipment operators programs in the country, and it's truly one of the best. I'm extremely grateful to be going to college here."
Sophomore,5,"Teachers and other school officials are very helpful, patient and kind. They provide excellent information in an easy to understand way. I especially commend their counseling center for providing a safe space for students who need someone to talk to when times are tough."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have loved all my teachers. They have been super kind and helpful. Sometimes, they have even believed in me more than I believe in me. The science are hard work, but you learn a lot. There are also a lot of programs that you can get into that provide the resources you need to be successful."
Sophomore,5,"Love the professors, for the most part, I've only had one bad experience. They don't get paid enough though."
Freshman,5,"Shasta College rocks. The professors care, they’re good at their job, and they will help you succeed. Shasta is the perfect bridge from high school to a 4 year university if that is what you are interested in."
Sophomore,5,"I have been attending Shasta College since I was a Junior in high school, and have loved every moment. All the teachers and professors are excellent and always willing to work with students to achieve understanding. The college offers free on-site and in-class tutoring. The attitude from the professors and staff at Shasta College is that of encouragement and productivity. I would highly recommend this college to anyone either starting or going back to college."
Senior,5,"For a community college, Shasta College has amazing professors and academic counselors that are willing to genuinely help you achieve your goals and set you up for success."
Freshman,5,Love being apart of this school. It has brought me a lot of purpose and love for my home town. So amazing to have found a close college who’s many purpose is to help it’s students. My tuition is completely free and I’m able to live at home so there’s no reason for me to worry about anything else besides being a good student. I love learning and have found a new passion for it after being suppressed by high school for so long.
Senior,5,"Shasta College is a great school with many courses that are perfect for veterans. At first, going back to school seemed daunting, but after some adjustments, it became the second home. I like the campus, and although the class size is small, you can get the time you need more easily. Without the counseling program of the Learning Center, I will not survive."
Sophomore,5,"Shasta College is a great school with many programs and great for veterans. At first, it seemed daunting returning to school but after some adjustment, it became a second home. I love campus although small the class sizes make it easier to get time you need. I would not have survived without the learning centers tutoring program."
Freshman,5,"I am a returning Shasta College student. To be completely honest, the first time around I wasn’t very successful with my academics but now I have more faith and confidence that I did before. I am prepared to achieve my dreams and slash my goals. The sole reason I applied to Shasta College wasn’t because it was the closest College near me but because the campus and professors. The professors give information while being available to answer any questions you may have, they’re more than willing to help."
Sophomore,5,"The thing I enjoy most about Shasta College is the online courses, and the ACE program. The online courses work very well for those with busy lives or full time jobs, which is my case. The professors that teach online courses take their time to really listen to what the student may write in a discussion and make sure they adapt their class to fit students' needs. As well as staying active checking their emails to be sure to respond to students questions."
Sophomore,5,I have been at Shasta College for three years. The campus is very green and integrated into nature. It is a good community college for science and other related majors because of this.
Sophomore,5,"For a community college, the teachers are amazing and over qualified for what they teach. Class sizes are small so you get to know your teacher and they can use student feedback to improve their teaching abilities or the learning environment. The only thing I don't like about Shasta is their book store. The people who work there are rude and they overcharge you for books you could get on amazon for a quarter of the price. Other than that, the cafeteria serves great food, the people are friendly, and the teachers are absolutely amazing and top quality."
Sophomore,5,I love my college. Everyone is trying to help each department. It can be a little overwhelming because there is SO MUCH to try to u defat and at once. But as you go through the motions you begin to see where you need to go to get different tasks done.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is clean and beautiful. The staff is professional and helpful. The teachers have so far been great and encouraging. Overall, this is a wonderful community college to attend."
Sophomore,5,Love the teachers and campus. The staff is always very helpful and give student assistance in all of the resources they offer
Junior,5,I graduated from Shasta College quite a few years ago and I loved it then and I still love it now.  They have expanded their classes now to also include some 4 year degrees.  That is how accommodating they truly are.  The office staff is super friendly and the instructors really work with you.  The campus is very laid back and the food available on campus is great.  Whether you want more upscale or casual fare. They have it all.  What I love most that they have changed over the years is how they have added online learning.  This has made it easier for me as an adult working student to be able to do my studies on my own time.  I will be earning another degree/certificate without having to set foot on campus unless I want or need to.  Talk about convenience!  I recommend going here if you have a chance.
Senior,5,"I have enjoyed Shasta College, the staff are amazing. From office, security, learning center, tutoring, counseling, and instructors, are fantabulous."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed Shasta College very much. Community Colleges often have a bad reputation of not being organized or having as many resources available to them. This is untrue of Shasta College. When you talk to your counselors they go above and beyond what they need to to make sure you the student succeed. 

They have a wonderful staff available for tutoring and if you can't make it to the main campus (I think they have 4 or 5 in Shasta County) they offer services online. 

The office staff offer a wide variety of information to make your college life easier. They have tons of flyers for campus and scholarship offerings."
Sophomore,5,Truly enjoy the college experience here. Everyone is really helpful and answers are answered in timely manner.
Senior,5,All staff and student body go out of their way to get you the help you need. It is an excellent school with a beautiful campus. It has amazing programs for students.
Sophomore,5,"Shasta college is an excellent school in regards to academics, safety, and campus. The staff are always there to help and the professors want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Great school, Extremely helpful and supportive towards their students. Students receive a great education and the chance to experience sports and several amazing clubs around the campus."
Sophomore,5,"Shasta College has been a wonderful experience. The campus is beautiful, located in northern California, it is surrounded by large trees and a great view of Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen. Every professor I have had, puts the students first and does everything in their power to help students succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"Printers to use at the downtown campus location for students to print from the computer lab and not just run copies.  So many students there have projects weekly that need that access.  As of right now, here is only one printer available for making copies and there are over 300 students that use the building."
Sophomore,5,"It has been a truly enriching experience,  and it is a perfect pathway for transferring to a four-year university at a fraction of the cost. The teachers are great, the campus is wonderful and the staff are always helpful in assisting students to the best of their ability. The Student Senate is a great place for student Services and to rent out free books for the semester. It has been a great few years for me and now I am finally ready to transfer to another school to obtain my bachelors. Will miss the school and the people in it."
Sophomore,5,Great school with great healthcare programs. Affordable! I love the downtown campus it is close to everything. Professors are great.
Junior,5,"Shasta College has been such a wonderful experience for me personally, Since i have been  In rolled the people who i have had the pleasure of meeting and who have helped me along the way have been nothing but kind. But someone who i think deserves to be mentioned the most is  Julie Fisher, Julie who works in the veterans service office has all ways been very kind to me and to anyone I've seen her help whenever I have had any question she is all ways willing to help me and put in as much effort as she can. And for that i am very grateful and i would defiantly recommend anyone to come to Shasta college weather that be for the Staff, the food, or the overall atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"I truly do love Shasta College, the professors are very helpful. The class sizes are very small and are not intimidating."
Sophomore,5,"Shasta College has really surprised me. I've never been to a community college before and am really impressed with the school. It offers a lot of great financial assistance, lots of great programs and the teachers are excellent. I'm really impressed with this school!"
Graduate Student,5,"Easy to navigate campus, friendly staff. Borrowing books and tutoring are always available. Quick and efficient counseling appointments. Campus is very diverse and security is available, the only downfall with security is they can take a long time to respond. The instructors are all very well informed and passionate about teaching, I have never taken a class with a bad instructor."
Junior,5,What I like about Shasta College was that there are very good teachers there that help out the students
Freshman,5,"I like the way  they care for the students and the dicipline that they practice everyday,teachers try their best for the students to understand the class the objective of the class and that working in groups increase your ability to make more friends and get controuble with your class"
College Sophomore,5,my experience at Shasta College is happening right now. I am in pursuit of a degree in welding and the instructors are there to help out all the way and answer all the questions asked. Im also in pursuit of a Spanish teaching degree and the teachers are great to get along with.
College Sophomore,5,I find if easy to navigate the online courses that I have taken here at shasta college.
College Sophomore,5,I really love this school. It has a great atmosphere and good professors. The price is great and the resources are impeccable.
College Sophomore,5,It's a great school for anyone entering the nursing career.
College Sophomore,5,There are many different types of people here and there is plenty of opportunity to make new friends.
College Junior,5,Everything went extremely smoothly. I couldn't have done it better.
College Junior,5,"They only offer one scholarship. They do help you take out the proper loans and get everything sorted out though. I need to get more scholarships to attend, but other than that its all excellent."
College Junior,5,The teachers go in depth on the key material before exams.
College Junior,5,The art staff host galleries and guest lectures from well known artists.
College Senior,5,The financial aid office is very helpful! And the process is very easy if you turn all your paperwork in on time. If you don't know what paperwork to turn in all the documents are online as well as a guide as where to start! Shasta college is definitely worth what you spend and it will save you a ton in loans if you go there to get general ed or your AA degree first.
College Junior,5,All professors that I have come in contact with have been phenomenal.
College Junior,5,"One thing I like most about my school is the resources. The science, math, and English centers are great assets to my school."
College Student,5,"This is easily the cheapest school on the west coast. But the classes aren't ""cheap"" even so."
College Junior,5,Definitely feel it was worth my time and money.
College Junior,5,"In my time in the early childhood education center I felt like I gained a second family. Such an amazing experience there! General ed classes were okay, a few of them had super professors, but most were detached or not completely on topic."
College Senior,5,"Financial aid office is professional.  The education vs the cost is probably higher than average, depending on the divisionof study and iinstructors."
College Junior,5,"I have met a lot of great people on campus. There are some who were not so great, but the majority of them were very nice."
College Junior,5,The resources on campus have really helped me. As a freshman I was lost and nervous but the staff was very friendly and the resources became a great part of my success.
College Junior,5,"I am very happy I chose this school, the experiences I have can not be explained. I have learned so much and have been able to have fun at the same time."
Sophomore,4,"While it may have been a rocky start, most teachers have adjusted and make use of online features as best they can."
Senior,4,This is my first year of online classes so far. Challenging at times but the professors are doing their best considering Covid has forced everyone to change their dynamics of college.
Sophomore,4,"Shasta college has a variety of online classes, and is a good and affordable option when just starting out your college career. Although you can only get an AA degree, it allows you to ease into college and be successful for the future."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience was very helpful, and all of the teachers are very friendly towards all of their students. If you need an extension most are willing to give it , and you just have to put your mind to the classes and be willing to learn even in the comfort of your own bed."
Junior,4,Before the pandemic it was really nice to be a part of the early childhood education classroom. In the recent years a lot of renovations have been completed making the school much more inviting. Safety On campus has improved as well.
Freshman,4,My experience in Shasta College has been very positive. The instructors I have had in my classes have been great and so dedicated in teaching and explaining the material thoroughly.
Junior,4,Shasta College is a great school to figure out the path you would like to take in life. The teachers are encouraging and the campus is getting renovated slowly. The best thing about Shasta is that there are not many students to faculty. Meaning classes are not too overwhelming and it's a great place to restart you're education. If you have already agreed on a major then stick to your major classes your teachers will be your greatest guide. Gen Ed is very poor but it is a good alternative to paying alot of money.
Sophomore,4,"Shasta College is a good school. The campus is clean, the academic advisors are helpful, and the opportunities are great. Although I'm sure this is not uncommon at public colleges, I noticed some of the teachers seem like they are there just to get paid and that they do not like their job nor want to be there."
Sophomore,4,"I think Shasta College is a great starting school to get your general ed done. Many people here go for 2 years and then transfer. There is a huge nursing program here so there are lots of bright minds and interesting people. The college is also in a super pretty part of California. It is surrounded by lakes and mountains. It is slowly getting bigger, and more funding is coming in from the nearby fires.  Coming here for 2 years is a great way to save money but also get a good education."
Freshman,4,A great community college! I haven’t had any negative experiences. Be willing to ask for help if you need it. Just don’t be afraid to ask. Everyone is so helpful.  It’s easy to fit in here!!
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful and they offer a wide range of classes that I've been able to take throughout my high school career!
Freshman,4,The college connection program they have here was one of the greatest thing to ever happen to me. It allowed me to take classes here while I was still in high school so I could get a head start. The professors are always there to help you and the campus is well maintained. The library is certainly my favorite place on campus with all it little study corners.
Niche User,4,"Overall the campus is beautiful, easy to navigate through. The staff and faculty are helpful. However, I wish they would have more teachers available for the science classes. There is primarily one teacher for each science class, and if you do not follow along with their teaching methods then you either have to push through or drive a couple hours out to a different college with a different teacher."
Junior,4,"Great experience, the professors are nice. The only thing I would like changed is that there should be more options in the bachelors degree programs. Due to the lack of this I'd have to tranfer to a four year university to finish the rest of my education. I would have liked to finish at Shasta College since I am used to the campus and the online learning systems. The best part that I liked the most was the bulk of the online classes if you chose that route as I did. But of course there are some exceptions like lab classes where you have to take that at the campus. Overall Great school and highly recommend."
Sophomore,4,"Shasta College campus is a very old school, but efforts are being made to improve and update. The back parking lot is covered 2ith solar panels which power much of the school. Faculty is generally acceptable, and when they aren't, admin handles it well. I sometimes feel that my education suffers because of low expectations for students. I could be learning much more."
Freshman,4,So far my experience with Shasta College has been overall good. All of the professors and counselors have been very understanding and helpful with any work or questions I have. The people at the college are all super friendly and are not afraid to become friends with you.
Niche User,4,Shasta College is a open campus that accepts people from multicultural backgrounds. The teachers are nice and are quite understanding with situations that come up.
Alum,4,Shasta college has great opportunities for agricultural studies and offers low cost classes for those intending to transfer to a 4 year.
Freshman,4,"Shasta is fairly good as a doorway into the professional world. Nearly all staff members are kind and friendly, and the main campus is nice. The branch campuses are very tiny and offer few resources, however, which makes it hard for people who live outside the city of Redding."
Niche User,4,"I liked Shasta College because of the campus atmosphere and the professors. I do think that the campus could be cleaner and there could be closer, basic amenities for the students."
Junior,4,I enjoy the diversity of subjects offered at Shasta College. The campus is beautiful and full of positive energy.
Sophomore,4,"Shasta College is a great college to start at. The professors are always willing to listen and answer any questions that the students have. Shasta College also helps students with counseling, financial aid, and any other student success help that we need."
Sophomore,4,I love that we have alot more programs to help students reach graduation. I would love to see more daycare availability on campus.
Freshman,4,"This school has helped me every step of the way, from financial aid, to education planning, it has helped tremendously! Having taken a ten year break from school, I was decidedly nervous, but only after a few days I felt right at home. The atmosphere is laid back, without discrimination or prejudice, and makes you feel like you have been there forever. The staff is friendly and capable, and there are many programs offered to help you along your collegiate path. The library is well stocked, with many private study rooms to choose from, as well as a textbook lending library that helped me the first couple of weeks in my Pysch 101 class. I recommend taking the college preparatory class, STU 1. This class is amazing in its ability to not only help with anything school related, but also a great way to focus on introspection. In this class I was able to gain a respect for myself and others I had once thought impossible. A great school all around, I highly recommend it."
Junior,4,"Every teacher I've had have been absolutely wonderful. Every part of campus is easy to locate and walk to. The only flaw I can think of is that some of the faculty that work in the offices can be a bit snarky towards you, even if you're asking perfectly valid questions."
Sophomore,4,"As a current student enrolled in Shasta College I can say that I am truly happy with the return on investment.  Shasta College offers a relatively low tuition rate, making each semester affordable.  Also, Shasta College offers many great trade options and certifications with a high success and accomplishment rate."
Junior,4,"I've really liked attending Shasta College a lot. Living at the dorms is extremely convenient, because it makes rolling out of bed and getting to classes simple, and you can't ever have the excuse of not being able to find a time to get help on campus or from a professor. I have met so many people at the dorms and in my classes who are very driven and help me to continue doing well in school. The imporvements that could be made would be a more diverse amount of clubs and organizations, and a musical during the school year instead of making it during the summer so students are less likely to participate."
Freshman,4,"I like the low class sizes, and from my experience the teachers have been  very nice and flexible.  They teach well and seem to know what they're doing."
Sophomore,4,"Over all, during my time at Shasta College, I found it to be an upbeat environment. They're rather accepting of many individuals there and they help you feel right at home."
Sophomore,4,This college is friendly. The only thing need to change probably just need a map in campus because it is quite complicate when the first time you walk in.
Sophomore,4,"Shasta College is a wonderful 2-year community college. It's been a pleasantly surprising experience overall. From the admissions department to the teaching staff, everyone is committed to their students. They are hardworking, dedicated, and passionate about what they are doing at Shasta College. There are students of all ages here, but that doesn't affect the attention each person gets from staff and faculty. Everyone matters and everyone is believed in. I can name a number of students who thought they would never leave Redding, CA. Yet, because of the care and attention given by their professors and counselor, they are now attending schools like Harvard, Columbia University and UCLA. I am proud that I was able to spend a few years here at Shasta College."
Senior,4,"Resources at this college are plenty, and the staff have provided excellent admissions and counselor support for me to achieve my academic goals. Scheduling of  courses is such that I'm typically able to cobble together a school schedule that fits into my life comfortably enough. I've had great experiences with most of the professors during school and office hours. I've learned something significant from every professor I've taken a course with--they've helped me to locate and direct areas of weakness in my study and help me to keep my GPA impressive."
Junior,4,"I have had a great experiences at this school over the last few years. I've made so many new friends, people that I hope to know for the rest of my life. The staff here, for the most part, is extremely nice, helpful, and understanding. There were a few occurrences that I've had with instructors that were not the best, but I feel that will happen wherever I go in life, you can never appease everyone. For the most part though, the staff is courteous and they want to help you to so your best and succeed in your life and help to achieve your dreams."
Niche User,4,"Overall, I enjoyed Shasta College. I liked the staff and was able to get my General Ed done while being involved with sports."
Freshman,4,Shasta College is a great college for high school graduates to start out at. Shasta College has a very simple website for anyone who is not extremely tech savvy it is okay! The things needed on the website are all clearly labeled and visible. The campus is also very easy to navigate! The whole campus is basically one big circle. The buildings are numbered according to the circle which makes it easy to find the building you are looking for. The staff is very friendly and are helpful. Shasta college also has a wide range of classes that helps students begin in the field of study they choose.
Freshman,4,"For a 2 year college, it's a wonderful place. It has good programs, and almost all of the teachers actually care actually about you as person. I have had negative experiences, but only with one teacher, and a few students. I have had an overall great experience here."
Freshman,4,Shasta college so far has been a great experience for me and I've met a lot of great people along the way including teachers and students. I'm just getting my general education for right now at a great and reasonable price.
Junior,4,Returned at 50 years old to take there heavy equipment operators  class going for my cert finish in 2 semesters. Getting a lic also crane cert
College Senior,4,"For me, Shasta College has been very convenient--not only close to my residence but I've  been able to get the classes I need at workable times."
College Senior,4,"I've been very happy with the quality of the courses I've taken, the classes offered, and impressed with the professionality of the professors."
College Senior,4,"It seems like there are a fair number of returning or older students like me who are coming to gain credentials for career opportunities, and a degree from Shasta is considered in the community as valid and positive."
College Senior,4,"The overall attitude at the college is positive--counselors, teachers, and staff are for the most part positive and really seem to care that students have success, and the professors I've had so far have been personable, caring, and willing to go the extra mile."
College Senior,4,It easy to find classes to fit with my busy schedule.
College Senior,4,Online classes here are simple to access and easy to complete.
College Senior,4,My professors have been just right. They have provided a great education without an overpowering work load.
College Senior,4,This school works hard in order to provide for their students and their financial needs. They do have many job programs within the campus for those interested.
College Senior,4,"There are millions of classes to support a specific major at this school. For instance my major is in Criminal Justice this school provides me with every required class I need. The criminal justice program even has thier own simulator in order to practice the real life experience.  The workload of each class varys widely from class to class, however it has yet to be too much for me to handle."
College Senior,4,My experience with Shasta College has been great. My favorite experiences revolve around being involved in school activities as well as the softball athletic program. This school is unique in that the students themselves come from all walks of life as well the professors. I would choose this school again because it is based in a great area and is full of great people.
College Sophomore,4,Learn a lot of new things about handling computers.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers have been supportive and friendly :)
College Student,4,"Overall I enjoy attending school. Favorite experience would have to be meeting many diverse people who come from different backgrounds and if possible learning about their culture and such being. If it could all be done all over again again, I would not have attended a junior college and would much rather have gone to a four year university."
College Student,4,My schedule was a be worked with so as to allow me to have family time as well as work with my work schedule. I have not yet transferred over credits.
College Student,4,"So far while attending Shasta college I have not heard or read anything about alumni network programs or services, for job prospects, I have heard of 2 that are Ag based, one was for a pesticide apprenticeship and the other doing some horticulture work for Disney. The student career center just helps students at the start of a semester to obtain a job on campus throughout their time here studying."
College Student,4,"My experience with a majority of my professors has been great, at least with those teachers that make an effort to make learning more enjoyable, unlike the teachers that are very monotone and make the experience of being in class very dreadful. The courses that are hands on and those that involve being in a classroom, are very well put together as well as structured, everything taught revolves around the courses main purpose as to what one is intended to walk away with having learned. Even from the teachers that are very boring and such, one still leaves having learned some sort of valuable credible information. Many classes that I have participated in have been relatively of normal size, at least 15-20 students, other classes just from having heard from peers can often range from 4 students to 80 in a class."
College Student,4,"Due to wanting to stay within the agriculture business, Shasta provides a great program that helps students who choose to stay involved in Ag or Ag based majors. The work is strenuous due to being hands on in some of my classes, and then having to go do homework after being in a three hour lab, yet in the end it will all pay off. Here at Shasta there are great facilities for students who choose to go into a more hands on field of study or work. There is; a mechanics auto body shop,welding metal shop, wood shop, culinary program, Ag farm (only 5 out of 112 junior colleges have hands on working farms). Some of these programs help students get in touch with local business around the area which allow students to work and further their experience within their field of study."
College Student,4,"For Shasta being a junior college it is really nice being here. The atmosphere of the place is amazing, many friendly people. One of the best experiences I have had here would be making many new friends and learning about where they come from and or learning about their culture. Shasta in it's football athletic program recently in 2015 won a section title being a junior college. If I could do it all over again having my feel for what college is like, I would have gone straight to a four year university."
College Junior,4,Business Managment major but this is only my second semester but everything is great so far
College Senior,4,"Over all, I have been able to transfer credit easily and any time I have needed to work the Admissions department it has gone very smoothly."
College Senior,4,"I love doing classes online, and at Shasta I have really enjoyed the online classes. The teachers have always responded quickly, the course is organized, we use Canvas for online classes and it is easy to use!"
College Senior,4,I feel like for the most part all of my teachers have been very knowledgeable and helpful. The courses are organized well and I love that I know what is expected of me.
Freshman,2,"The school isn't very interactive, but it is very beautiful. The teachers do a great job at their jobs, but nothing feels personal. The campus is insanely quiet in all places and at all times.An effort is made to put on several events, however the participation rate is very low. Therefore, there isn't much stimulus."
College Junior,2,The financial aid office did not tell me about several documents I was required to turn in before I could sign up for classes which led to led to a five month delay.
College Senior,2,"I have had a terrible experience with the counseling to setting up my classes and transferring my credits. I do not think there is anything that would set my school apart from anyone, I just take great pride in my education and feel that the school does not allow students to feel they can achieve to their fullest."
College Senior,2,"I feel that for the cost of living, and school materials such as supplies, courses and such is so expensive and feel that for the price I pay it is not worth it. The teachers are not well educated many are new, and have a limited number of students they can enroll into class. I have not received financial aid yet, and it has been a very difficult and long process."
College Senior,2,"As far as the academics are concerned for my school they do not have much to chose from, and many students do not seem happy. I did not feel welcomed during my class registration process and when I talked to the counselor about taking classes they did not seem to be interested to help me."
College Student,2,They don't give you classes that are challenging and up to your learning standards. I was put in an English class that was way too easy.
College Student,2,The counselor's there honestly do not listen to you. I set up a meeting and in the beginning I told the counselor I wanted online classes only and he ignored me and recommended campus classes.
College Junior,2,"I don't feel challenged at all. I felt more challenged taking AP classes in high-school. My work load is minimum though, so that's nice. There are few internship or job opportunities."
College Junior,2,"None of us are there for ""the college experience"" not many activities are put on at the campus. Everyone stays to themselves (unless they know people from high school). The sports games aren't that fun. It's not diverse at all because it's a junior college, so everyone is from the same area. Really Shasta is mostly used as a cheap segue way for a University."
College Junior,2,"There's nothing unique about it. They're just concrete building that just barely meet what they're required to do. The Tehama Campus was built next to a sewage plant, so when ever there's a wind, the smell invades campus."
College Senior,2,"I have had my fair share of horrible professors at Shasta College. There have been a few good eggs in the bunch, but mostly they are just bad. They do not know how to teach, they are probably still only around because they have tenure, and they do not care about their students. This school's professors and I just do not mix very well."
College Senior,2,"I am a fashion major student and the only class they provide with anything remotely like fashion is a theater lab, where you can work under their costume designer for their plays they put on. I took this class and it was mostly okay. However, Shasta College is a junior college and I do not expect them to provide much for arts classes other than the most general of education."
College Senior,2,"I have turned in a request for sending my transcript to my four-year college of choice as early as I could, because all I have heard about transferring from this college to another is ""nightmare."" I was denied when I turned it in, because it was something about having to wait until May, which could be horrendous. I have heard they are just very slow and they do not do as you ask them to. As far as flexibility goes, it is not bad and I have not had a hard time with my schedule."
College Student,2,The financial aid people are not helpful what so ever.
College Junior,2,Old and ugly interiors of buildings.
College Junior,2,Seems like the don't care since it's just a CCC.
College Junior,2,"I have attended several schools now and the Red Bluff Campus is very very small and not very many options for education. I like that I can do my classes online and not drive to Redding, but other than that I have nothing to say."
College Senior,2,"Shasta college does an okay job at creating flexible scheduling, but just okay. There have been times when I have had to put certain courses off as they're only offered in the fall/spring, and they're have been times that I had to wait a semester to take a course because it was conflicting with so many other courses I needed. Overall I give them a C grade. They're just about average here."
College Senior,2,"My school is what I would consider an average community college. About half the students have full time jobs and/or families and the other half seem to be fresh out of high school. Because of this the social interactions at school vary quite wildly. The professors at Shasta College are unfortunately, hit and miss. Some professors truly take an interest in teaching their students and enjoy what they do, while others seem to be bored or unhappy with their job. A teacher who is uninterested in their subject makes for a difficult class!"
College Senior,2,"The student body at Shasta College is very diverse. The age range is much larger than many schools. There are many students with disabilities, many returning students. It is much less ethnically diverse than some schools, but makes up for it with a diverse range of personalities. It is interesting being in a classroom with students straight out of high school trying to relate to 50 and 60 year old returning students. My only frustration is that there seems to be a large population of students that only show up because their parents required them to go to college after high school and they do not take their academics seriously."
College Senior,2,I have struggled with the courses I need being available. It seems like they are only available every couple semesters so when i am ready to take a class I end up having to wait for it to be open. My second complaint is that there are not enough counselors to help students register in courses they actually need. Many students just register online but there is little or no guidance as to whether or not the classes are needed or transferable.
Recent Alumnus,2,Average - did not use many of the resources. Worked and went to school so did not have much time other than class.
College Senior,2,The campus is very old and the maintenance workers need to actually do their jobs. They need to trim the bushes and not let stray cats live on the campus. The last classroom I was in recently started to suddenly smell horrible because it had not been cleaned the entire semester.
College Junior,2,I have not used the career options at the college so unfortunately i am unable to answer.
College Sophomore,2,"Everytime you go into the financial aid office, there is always something else that you need. It's so frustrating! I've had my income tax transcript done for weeks and it still hasn't updated on their website. As far as financial aid, I never qualify for much. I will be getting a lot of loans if I can't get any scholarships."
College Junior,2,"Shasta College is a commuter campus, meaning people leave immediately when their classes finish for the day. Therefore, there is not a whole lot of ways to meet new people on campus. The best way to meet new people is to live in a dorm or to join one of the student clubs on campus. Examples of student clubs include religious, political, special interest, or cultural clubs, although there is no gurantee that a particular club will be operating in a given semester. As well as the unreliability of a club being active or not, there is not a whole lot of clubs to choose from on campus. As for the student body itself, many of the students are unmotivated slackers who live by the saying ""C's get degrees"". While there are many mature, hardworking people on campus, the ones who are loud, obnoxious, and lazy are unfortunately the most visible during a walk on campus. There is also not a lot of diversity on campus - students tend to be white and middle class, but that also reflects the general diversity of the city of Redding itself. However, minorities such as African-Americans, Asians, and Latinos are also represented in relatively large numbers on campus, and they will have no problems with discrimination of any kind."
College Freshman,2,"It's a first come, first serve campus.  You can be waiting for hours before you even get to the front desk only to find you're in the wrong line or they are closed.  The computer labs are always packed and the staff isn't very helpful."
College Freshman,2,What sets shasta apart from other schools is the act that it is a junior college with dorms. The bus system should be more accessible more and come more often since everything is farther away from he school.
College Freshman,2,Here is not much diversity here coming from the school I used to go too. There are a lot of partying at this school.
College Sophomore,2,There are many teachers that should no longer be teaching. On the contrary many teachers are fantastic.
College Sophomore,2,"A majority of the teachers don't seem to care, or provide course material that is not up to the same standards as a university. I once had a math teacher who went off, from talking about rational expressions, to how his ''friend'' could not get pregnant because she ran 20 miles a day.. and such deviation is not uncommon for any of my teachers, although topics might not be so personal."
College Sophomore,2,"The athletic areas and services (i.e. athletic trainers, access to doctors via Shasta College, and the sports facilities) are all good. The spaces are clean and well maintained. The staff is helpful and considerate.

Not a single athlete I know, myself included, has found the athletic counselor helpful. If anything, the current counselor is a hindrance and sets people more off-track.

Library and tutor centers need more hours, but cutbacks do what they do. some nice scenery on campus."
College Junior,2,I'm going for a math and engineer major but the school doesn't exactly provide me with the information that would help me.
College Senior,2,It was so painful. I was told that online classes were exciting but i instead found myself trying to come up with essays every night in reply to the posts. It was such an ardous class
College Junior,2,"Its a very long process to get finacial aid here. Instead of saying everything thats needed when there, they send out things after a while of not reciving money say more papers are needed. The processing time for financial aid takes a very long time"
College Senior,2,"Bad Communication – I didnt receive word that I didnt qualify for the BOGG fee waiver that I was counting on and I went in to ask when I would receive it and thats when they told me I didnt qualify, which I have in previous semesters and my parents made less money last year than previous years so something was obviously messed up in the process."
College Sophomore,2,no one told me that if i got loans and defaulted on them that i would no longer be eligible for financial aid
College Sophomore,2,"Very Little Diversity – Although there is some diversity throughout the school, the majority are white. I believe this to be caused by the people in the area around the town that attend the school. There are many white farmers that live in our area, and as a result there is not a lot of diversity. Also, the peope that attend the school believe in their parents thoughts, and therefore change is not common. Majority have the same economic standings, same political and relgious views, as well as theie views on sexuality."
College Senior,2,"Career Center Unkown – I am not aware of where the career center is even located. There has been no talk about it in the classes I am taking. I am not sure if I will search for it to locate a job, instead I will probably go to one of my teachers that has a job hookup. I am sure the career center must be good though."
College Student,2,"The students at Shasta College usually just get their AA degree and then get a job in the local vicinity. They are unmotivated and their work ethic is lacking. Most of them just want to pass their classes with minimal effort. The student body is ethnically diverse. Other than race, the students are predominately straight and christian and have the same ideologies."
Sophomore,1,I would like there to be a lot more attention paid to how professors treat their students. They treat them as if they don't deserve to be in there class. I afraid to ask questions because I don't want to feel like an idiot.
College Junior,1,My school is only a junior college and does not have any degrees beyond an associate level.
College Sophomore,1,"They do not offer my major at this school, i am going to have to transfer."
College Senior,1,They want transcripts but the previous institution's credits are not assimilated.  Which effects overall  GPA.
College Senior,1,"my experience during business online courses was very disappointing. When the instructor uses online content that incorporates advertisements and pop-ups that not only subject a student to industrial profiteering but actually distracts a student from study, I must testify to the negative learning environment students may be subjected to."
College Senior,1,"Shasta College is in Redding, California. Redding is third most unhappy city in America, it is full of meth-heads, and it is where all the pedophiles of the nation are dropped off to live at once they're done with prison time. 

While Shasta College is not as extreme, it is unhappy, it is full of people who use drugs, and there are probably pedophiles there as well, even if they are not convicted. The people at this school are either schmucks who had nowhere else to go, or older people who realized their life was not on track like they thought, or poor college students who want to get out of this town. It is hard to find the latter, but pretty easy to find the first two mentioned. The student body is not great and it is hard to find likable people when everyone seems crazy here."
College Senior,1,"Within two semesters (Spring '13 & Fall '13) I felt cheated out of two math classes. I was supposed to have one professor because they were great at teaching the subject and another professor ended up teaching the class, who had no idea he was taking over the class until one week before the spring semester started. We started learning about two weeks after the semester began because of the unprepared professor. In the summer I was supposed to take a Precalculus course with one professor and the same thing happened except the replacement professor hadn't taught precalc in over a decade!!!"
College Senior,1,Nothing sets Shasta College apart from any other school.
College Senior,1,"Horrible campus activities, student centers, and athletics. There are so many sports on campus, but you never hear about them or who the players even are. Are there even any clubs on campus?"
College Senior,1,Unfortunately Biology is a difficult major to pursue at Shasta college. Their Biology program is split into three parts for what should be a two part class. For example: I want to transfer to CSU Chico. In order to do so I need to complete three semesters of biology based courses to get credit for two semesters at Chico. This is a bit frustrating.
College Senior,1,"I feel that it is pretty average. It has some great traits, but could use some modernization."
College Junior,1,"Basically for students who are still in school you have to have FASFA to get any sort of job on campus,"
College Sophomore,1,"This college gets you approved in good time; however, they change the disbursement dates quite frequently, so DO NOT plan bills around their schedule; it has changed on me twice in two months."
College Freshman,1,"I do not  receive financial aide and that cuts about 90% of the jobs on campus, which I am supporting myself and I also need the money."
College Sophomore,1,"Shasta College doesn't exactly help students in post-grad job placement.  Though they have a resource center all they are willing to do is show you some sites where you can hunt for jobs. They may look at your resume and give you some advice, but that's as far as they go into actually helping you out."
College Sophomore,1,"Students are typically either athletes, party-crazy (although the two often go hand in hand, coming from an athlete) or they have no motivation. I know a girl who has been at Shasta College for 6 years, and she is actually trying to get a degree and go to university, or so she says. There are also the few crazies, like I've had boys follow me to my car unwanted, and someone once told me ''some demons just want to help you'' in a completely serious conversation."
College Junior,1,Shasta college has made it extremely hard for me to receive financial aid.
College Junior,1,"They Don't Help – The career services don't help you find a job at all, if you need a job to stay in school they didn't help. They don't have the resources to be able to put you somewhere in your field."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Sub Parr – Sub Parr. The campus is broke, so it has few dollars for actual upgrades to the campus to keep up with the rest of the educational systems."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its a JR College – The library is a typical library. There is an athletics center though I never used it myself. Hardly any campus activities, other than the art department has art shows and the theater/music department has regular shows as well. The agriculture department has a ""Harvest Fest"" in the fall with a $30 cover charge. The Student Senate is in shambles and nothing but a kangaroo court system to make the student body believe the have a say in policies. The financial aide office is complete joke, missed payments, lost paperwork and strict ruling of the bureaucratic workers trying their best to put a student in financial probation.  The school is on accreditation probation for not fulfilling its allotted guidelines."

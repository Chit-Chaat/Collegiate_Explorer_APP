Junior,5,"Overall, Methodist College has a very supportive and exciting environment. The staff has been wonderful - supporting the transition to online learning, through any challenges we face, and providing support during finals week.  A helpful staff and faculty is very important to me, as it aides in my learning knowing that there is a large herd behind me to support me through any hardship. I am very lucky to call Methodist College my college of choice - one that has provided with me a wonderful learning experience that will shape my future career as a nurse. I have formed friendships that will last a lifetime, and this has been very helpful for me to have people who are in the same boat that I am: nursing school, working, and going through the same struggles that I do."
Sophomore,5,This upcoming spring semester I will be going into my second semester at Methodist. So far I have absolutely loved it! I transferred to Methodist from ICC and the transition was very smooth. I was really nervous but all the faculty and staff at Methodist made my transition so much easier! I was able to connect with other students right away. Everyone is so friendly and there is a very homey and friendly environment.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about my college. My instructor is loving and very helpful. There is nothing to change. It fees is expensive but it is worth every penny looking at the materials used and the knowledge aquired.
Niche User,5,"I have not yet started at Methodist college of Nursing, but I am getting excited to as the spring semester is approaching.  I love Methodist college because it is a smaller private school.  It focuses on what I want to do. I love that students have the opportunity to live right on campus too.  The only thing that I would like to see change is it's size.  I hope Methodist continues to grow and can add more master degree programs.  Overall, I absolutely loved visiting Methodist college."
College Sophomore,5,Never had any problems! Security is good
College Sophomore,5,Professors all care about the students.
College Sophomore,5,I have nothing but a great experience here! all of the faculty want us to succeed!
College Junior,5,General education courses are even made to be about nursing. So you really encompass nursing from day 1
College Junior,5,Since we're connected with the hospital it's great
College Junior,5,Class sizes are small and are well structured. You always know what's expected of you there no surprises
College Junior,5,There's always someone on security to walk you to you car should you feel unsafe. I've even had assistance unlocking my vehicle when I locked keys inside
College Sophomore,5,"school quite diverse from race, ethnic, to sexuality."
College Junior,5,I love where I'm at and I think it will prepare me greatly for my career in the medical field of nursing.
College Junior,5,Very helpful and engaged to individual.
College Junior,5,"I'm in an accelerated program and regardless of legal age, alcohol/drugs is prohibited on campus or in living units.  Strong zero tolerance."
Sophomore,4,The instructors give all that they can to make this work to the best it can. Now that they have added synchronized learning it has really helped with the online experience.
Sophomore,4,Great people who really help the students. Classes that are offered get canceled so you must be flexible with planning. It is a struggle getting prepared for one class only to find out that it wont happen and take this instead.
Freshman,4,very family oriented. Everyone on campus seems to care about one another. You should never feel alone when you have so many open arms to run into. The newly redone building is a plus too. I haven't actually started yet but I'm excited just off orientation itself
College Senior,4,Methodist hospital hires a lot of new grads!
College Junior,4,"I think there's ups and downs with every school, but I really enjoy the environment, teachers, and my peers."
College Freshman,4,I like how the financial staff are really helpful.
College Freshman,4,I really like that most of the residence halls are relatively close to the main campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I attended a vocational high school, there I was to in the Practical Nursing program. It's not an internship, but that program helped prepare me for a nursing a program. Being in that program and enhancing my skills through working has given me a tremendous amount of experience."
College Sophomore,4,With being a nursing college we get a lot of different people within the college. Everyone is welcoming and kind to everyone.
College Sophomore,4,Good selection of off campus housing.
College Sophomore,4,consult your financial advisor and be aware of your financial status while applying for classes and books
College Sophomore,4,The College is very strict.
College Sophomore,4,No one ever said Nursing would be easy.  This semester Methodist College implemented a Gerontology Program so as of the fall I will be majoring in Nursing while also taking class to get my Gerontology Certificate.
College Sophomore,4,advise to bring your own but if the classroom has a test online they provide the computer
College Sophomore,4,Nicks Deli is the only food place near. Great food and pricing but a variety of places and choices would be nice.
College Sophomore,4,the school is stressful. Lots of assignments and work however you learn a lot. Nothing worth having is easy.
College Junior,4,I do not have any issues.
College Junior,4,Care is noticed for students.
College Junior,4,I've not seen any bias.
College Junior,4,I don't have to worry about weather and getting to class.
Junior,2,Horrible colllege! I wasted a year and a half going part-time in the nursing program. A few instructors were good and convinced me to stay.Unfortunately the majority of the instructors were awful and barely taught us anything and showed favoritism. The nursing program is way overpriced and most of the staff are horrible instructors. Go to a school with a better program and save yourself  a lot of time and money. I feel like the program isn't ran professionally.  It seems like a scam.
College Senior,2,Everyone has to clean the kitchen on the floor regardless if you use it or not.
College Junior,2,"I know there is a security guard but I am not sure what they even do, they are here throughout the day but at night you rarely see them and they are not able to be found to walk you to your car since we are not in a good neighborhood.  Anyone can just walk into our school up until 5pm."
College Junior,2,"I feel that if I had to do it all again I would have picked a different school.  I understand inflation but the fees have went up drastically since I started and all to pay for a new school in which we were told would not happen.  It is 60.00 to park at the school and there is not enough adequate parking, they have expanded their program to include may others but can not adequately provide for what they have now.  If I could transfer I would."
College Sophomore,2,Nowhere close to here bc they are not in a good neighborhood.
College Sophomore,2,Worst school I've ever attended.
College Sophomore,2,"Our professors have started to work together.  Some still think students are taking only there class, so at times we are stuck in situations."
College Sophomore,2,"I always remind myself that I am blessed to have everything located in one building as far as my classes.  However, walking to the Hospital for clinicals in the morning is not pleasant at times.  We do have security but since they are associated with the hospital it could take them longer to get to the College."
College Sophomore,2,It is Illinois.  It can either be beautiful out or a gloomy nasty day.
College Sophomore,2,"Methodist College is located in a high crime rate part of town.  As a student who lives in the residential halls at Methodist College I strongly believe we are not in the safest part of town.  However, I do realize that there are far worse areas in which we could be located."
College Sophomore,2,The area is not the safest so i would suggest not to walk alobe
College Sophomore,2,my school has no sports teams we are a nursing school
College Junior,2,"I hate it, it is very slow."
College Junior,2,It has snowed a lot this year. I live 45 minutes away in a rural area and I worry a lot about getting to school when it is snowing and blowing outside.
College Freshman,2,I am a little concerned.  It costs so much to attend school and it seems that there is not enough financial aid to go around.
College Freshman,2,"I do not live on campus, but I do know that the people that do feel pretty comfortable.  They like the convenience of living there."
College Junior,2,"Nice Rooms – The rooms are old hotel rooms you share with a roommate.  They are spacious, but the elevators are slow and the general areas are run down.  It seems we should get more for all the money we pay for our education."
College Junior,2,"No Food Service – But, the college offers large kitchen areas on each dorm floor.  It is great if you like to cook.  There is also a good subshop across from campus.  The campus store has cold sandwiches, but I would avoid them."
Senior,1,"I would not recommend Methodist College to anybody. I transferred in 2018 and they told me I would graduate in May of 2020.. they then stopped accepting transfer credits and made me retake a bunch of classes (that I had already taken a previous institutions).  They then told me that I wouldn't graduate until May of 2021.  That was then changed to December of 2020 and they recently stopped accepting a few credits and now I'm back to graduating in May of 2021. As mentioned, I would not recommend this institution to ANYBODY.  The institution is a joke.  They are poorly ran and very money hungry.  You'd be better off at ICC, or ANY other school.  If I would have known this experience would have been so negative - I would have never transferred. They talk about how great their programs are and I haven't learned anything."
Graduate Student,1,"I have never been to a more disorganized school and I have attended many.  They change requirements in mid-course and raise tuition without warning.  They raised my tuition by $150 PER CREDIT HOUR  literally the Friday before classes started.  They changed clinical rotations the first day of class, which caused everyone who worked, which is almost all of us, to scramble to change their work schedule because our clinical hours were moved from weekends too Tuesdays.  They are making ATI software a huge part of the curriculum, which seems to be a way increase their NCLEX passing percentage without holding their faculty accountable.  They will fail you before you take the NCLEX if your ATI score drops too low, therefore taking you out of their NCLEX pass rate.  If I could do it over again I would definitely get a associates degree (saving myself about $60,000), pass the NCLEX, then take an online RN to BSN bridge program, which you can do in about a year while you are working."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't live on campus in the dorms. There is only vending machines for food and no silverware, plates, etc."
College Sophomore,1,Run away - do not go here - worst experience ever!
College Sophomore,1,Our WIFI is come or go.  It takes time to find a spot that will work.
College Sophomore,1,"There is never parking available throughout the day.  I reside on campus and have to park in different lots, then around 9 pm I move my car closer to the building."
College Sophomore,1,there is no campus transportation
College Junior,1,The student to parking space ratio is probably 600:1. We get emails all of the time about parking. There is not much parking and it continues to become a bigger issue every semester.
College Junior,1,Very Little – Off campus housing is not really available nearby.  You will have to drive awhile.
College Senior,1,"We don't have any sports, although we do have some intramurals."

Junior,5,I love nearly everything about my college and my experience with it thus far. We are a relatively small campus that is a connected community with a long history.
Niche User,5,"The important thing about Maryville College is that it is not too confusing to explore. Once you know which building is which, exploring campus becomes so easy. Every single person is so nice. Every one knows every one since the school is so small. This school is amazing!"
Niche User,5,"Maryville College is one of the nicest colleges I've applied to. Their admission office really takes the time to talk to the applicants, and are super kind. I cannot wait to start my freshman year here!!"
Sophomore,5,"Maryville College is very diverse in its students, and it offers many different clubs and organizations to accommodate those students. Maryville College has a variety of athletics such as football, basketball for men and women, cross country, volleyball, etc. The academics are amazing as they offer multiple different majors including ASL interpreting and deaf studies which is not offered in a lot of colleges."
Freshman,5,"I've spent a semester at Maryville so far, and it has been a really good one. The college is a small private university that really feels like home. It's a pretty campus 30 mins from the smokey's and 30 from Knoxville. The professors are nice and want you to do well. Overall I've had a good time."
Niche User,5,I love Maryville College! Great environment both inside and outside. Intelligent and kind people. Can't wait to continue my studies here.
Alum,5,"This liberal arts college has taught me to be a free-thinker. Upon entering college, I was a very narrow-minded individual focused on my area of study. Following my graduation I reflect on a life-changing 4 year experience."
Junior,5,"Maryville College is a wonderful college to be at. I absolutely love being in the choir program their. It's so fun and it makes me love singing even more. I also love the food at the Dining Hall. It's hard to get food there when you don't have a meal plan, but still great either way. The classes I'm taking right now are really cool and enjoy the majority of the teachers I have. The disabilities office there is amazing and the accommodations I have helped me so much. It really is a great college to go to. I highly recommend it."
Niche User,5,I loved the diversity scene at Maryville and everyone's open minds and hearts. I also love the quantity of the school.
Freshman,5,"I loved how friendly everyone is makes you feel included. There to help when needed, easy to make friends, easy to find yourself, and also helps challenges you to be a better as well as you academic knowledge."
Niche User,5,"This college is a Christian college in Knoxville, Tennessee. It has a beautiful campus view and beautiful classrooms as well. The student population is low, but the school spirit is high. Maryville College has a range of options for majors and many different classes to choose from. I would recommend a look into this school."
Sophomore,5,Unlock Maraval college for several reasons. One is the location and the community involvement and support that we have students receive. Secondly the professors and all of the administrative personnel are friendly and always willing to help.  It doesn’t hurt that you have a gorgeous views of  the mountains as well.
Junior,5,Maryville College is a great college. Academics will be strenuous because it's a Liberal Arts College.
Alum,5,"Wonderful college! Prepared me for the work force even though I chose a major that was not the best for ""preparing for the workforce"" (aka, religion). Great professors and staff who really cared about my success in life. Great culture on campus!"
Freshman,5,"I’m in my first year at Maryville College, and I have to say it’s my home away from home. The Professors have all been willing to help and answer questions.  The advisors and office staff are also amazing.  They have made my moving out on my own to campus an easy adjustment and making sure I stay on track with my classes.  Maryville College is a great College."
Freshman,5,What I liked about Maryville College is that working with them and contacting them is super easy. Also the staff and coaches are super personable. Plus the campus is amazing!
Alum,5,"While at times, the small size (1,100 students or so ) can feel like you're still in high school. I realized that it allowed for genuine relationships that I would not find at a large university. This goes for relationships with my peers and also the professors."
Junior,5,"Maryville College strives to create a indelible experience for students, faculty, and visitors alike. The campus is very safe, and students are encouraged to be active in various activities Maryville College has to offer. Students, professors, and staff all experience challenges that inspire growth in education, character, and self."
Freshman,5,For me Maryville College is a wonderful smaller college with a beautiful campus. I've greatly enjoyed all my time at Maryville and have had amazing instructors/professors. Maryville was my first choice college and it did not disappoint.
Freshman,5,"I love Maryville College.  It is a small, liberal arts college in Maryville, Tennessee right next to the Appalachian Mountains. There are multiple organizations on campus that are actively involved in the surrounding communities.  The class sizes are small, which has allowed for me to build meaningful relationships with my professors.  I also love how much Maryville College advocates for studying abroad.  The school offers multiple scholarships One thing that I would change about Maryville would be the foreign languages that are offered.  I would love to learn Italian, but that language is not currently offered."
Niche User,5,When i went to Maryville for a college visit I fell in love with this school.  Everything about it was beyond my expectations.  The cafeteria food was outstanding and the employees there are super friendly.  The campus it self is gorgeous.  My favorite thing about this college is that its a small town college and everyone is super friendly to everyone.
Sophomore,5,"Maryville College has small classroom sizes for those that like more individualized education.  It's a beautiful campus and feels like a community.  No matter if you are into sports or the arts, Maryville can provide opportunities to get involved.  I would highly recommend you coming to campus!"
Junior,5,"Maryville College is the perfect location if you're looking for a school with a community feel. All the professors are friendly and want to help in any way they can. The school also has student tutors for some classes if you need additional help. While the academics are great, the social events are also really fun. My favorite is the ""Finals Breakfast"" they have every semester before finals. A lot of the professors help out and they have a late-night breakfast to fuel the all-night studying. It definitely isn't a party school, but that's not what I wanted out of college anyway."
Sophomore,5,"I love MC. It is a school where classes are small enough that the professor has time to work with each student. Strong academics, love this school, however, it is very cultural despite the affiliation with the Presbyterian Church. Also, I am a commuter, so I can tell very little about life on campus."
Sophomore,5,Maryville College is a great campus filled with amazing people. The professors there really take the time to get to know you and to help you succeed.
College Freshman,5,"I don't party , I think partying would bring a negative outlook on our campus."
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy studying at Maryville, the teachers are very helpful, the workload is tuff. But it's good for me."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy being on a campus that sets standards for the young adult life here on campus
College Freshman,5,"The teachers do a great job, and if I need any help they will assist me. Some classes are larger than others but they are managed well."
College Freshman,5,"Security is good, we need better security for the laundry area. My clothing have been takin many times. but all in all the campus seems safe. I feel safe."
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed football, basketball and most of all enjoy cheering the other sports on and supporting Maryville in any of these sports. The activities director does an outstanding job ."
College Freshman,5,It took a while for me to get a handle on being a college student. The faculty really helped with the transition . I would absolutely choose this school again.
College Sophomore,5,"This school has been the most-willing school to work with me toward my graduate studies goal. They've explained all the degrees in my field on the undergraduate level and even explained, with a flow chart, how those degrees connected to a corresponding Masters and Doctoral degree. Had I not had this guidance, I would still be on the wrong degree path, doomed to follow a path of being unhappy and not helping as many people in the world in as many ways as I can during my life."
College Sophomore,5,"Our campus has many first in the country for diversity. My first on-campus experience was (before I was a student) a meeting to honor the first African-American graduate of MC, which she had been accepted and graduated long before most public schools (legally) had to desegregate."
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers care. You are no longer a number on a sheet of paper. A few years ago, I was at our local enormous university as a student and I hated being 1 body in a room of 200 and just being another number. At MC, you are a person and the professors will even email you and take time out of their day to meet with you, to check on you, and to make sure you're doing well. School can get stressful and they get that. I've actually had mental breakdowns with my advisor before because I was overwhelmed and he simply asked how I was doing and someone caring about my mental health in an educational environment was foreign to me until this point. They gave me back my drive to succeed and push myself."
College Sophomore,5,I've been working with the career center to help me find something part-time. We determined that I would be eligible for work study and have been able to get everything in order for me to have an on-campus job in my field. I could not be more happy to get my foot in the door!
College Sophomore,5,"Being a private school, I never thought I could afford it, nor would I fit in well, but the staff has been the most welcoming and has far exceeded my expectations based on any public university that I've previously attended. Not only that, but I was able to basically get a full ride based on merit and an audition. I could not make my dreams happen had I not had this opportunity."
College Freshman,5,"There has never been a time when I have felt unsafe on campus. Our campus security drives around campus quite a bit to make sure there's nothing suspicious. At the beginning of freshman year, they also provide every student the number of campus security so that if there ever is a time where we feel unsafe, we can call the number and they will come pick us up. Also, for each dorm building, there is a security system on it where the residents of that building can only get in with their i.d. We scan our i.d and the door will unlock. If the door is ever open for longer than 20 seconds, the alarm will go off until the door is shut. Whenever we have guests come over, they have to be within arm's length away so that they don't go wandering around the building."
College Freshman,5,"The student career center goes above and beyond what they should to make sure each student knows what options are available for jobs and internships. They also help with making a resume for each student, and it's required that each student start a resume their freshman year which is helpful for when they start applying for those jobs and internships.

Our alumni network is huge at Maryville College. Most everyone who graduates from Maryville College, are proud to be an alumni and they invest in the school even after they've graduated. We have a building on campus specifically for our alumni and they are there every so often dedicating their time to the school. Every year at the homecoming football game, the alumni come back and there are thousands of people there tailgating and showing their appreciation for the school."
College Freshman,5,"The courses can be quite challenging, but the professors are excellent at providing additional help outside of the classroom. The classes are usually no more than 20 people or so which provide great dialogue during class depending on the course. Almost every professor I have had so far wanted the students to talk during class to ask questions and provide feedback. They also wanted the students to interact during class times."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Maryville College. The campus is beautiful, and every professor I have had so far has been exceptional and willing to help me succeed. The people I have met here have been so wonderful and have expanded my views. The college is home to many international students, and I have had the privilege of getting to know a few of them. I love learning about other countries through the international students. Maryville College also encourages studying abroad which I hope to take part in within the next few years. If I had to choose which college to go to all over again, there is no doubt about it that I would choose Maryville College."
College Junior,5,"They try to keep the class room setting small with several people lined up to help if you don't understand anything. The professors all take great interest in the students and help every chance they get. They must have a great screening process or Maryville College just makes people better, because everyone there is great. Being from New York I never liked many people but this place sure has changed me!"
College Junior,5,Everyone here does a senior study so we leave with graduate school level knowledge of something before we leave here. On top of that every major has a certain class that you learn about all the avenues you can take in any given career and how to acquire any degree or certifications you need to get there. Then they have classes for the GRE and prepare you for life after college. I wish I had this opportunity when I was younger!
College Junior,5,"My husband is a veteran but I am paying for my own schooling, and the school not only gave me a scholarship that helped offset the cost but got me into the Student Veterans Association and now I am the vice president! It seems they do a phenomenal job picking out the staff because everyone from the president to the cleaning ladies are so welcoming and kind. They have made my transition from full time worker to full time student much easier than I expected, they even gave me a job (doesn't pay much but everything helps)."
College Junior,5,"Being a non-traditional student it is hard being in class with teenagers, however the school is very good at making us feel comfortable and I could not be more happy with the education I am receiving! The workload is demanding and you have to keep up or fall behind fast, but what you learn will last a lifetime."
College Sophomore,5,We have a whole day in orientation were they go over it. My freshmen year we all took a Stand Up Pledge
College Sophomore,5,The offer a lot of cool classes and its a small close knit school
College Sophomore,5,"Well, we have to keep it clean or we get fined. Maryville loves it fines. The RA's plan events every month. Very social"
College Freshman,5,I feel safe on campus and there is always security on duty you can call if any suspicious activities are seen. They also can pick you up in the golf cart and take you to across campus if you are scared to be alone at night.
College Freshman,5,A liberal arts education makes sure you are a well rounded person in your education and as a person.
College Freshman,5,Maryville college is an amazing place to spend you four years. Especially if you want to build a community of friendships! The school is so small you see everyone's faces very often!
College Freshman,5,"Maryville college gets 5 stars from me because the whole time I have been there all of the teachers and students have been extremely welcoming and friendly. They have nice dorms, great food, and amazing teachers. I would recommend this college to anyone!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love this place. It is not just my school, it is my home."
College Junior,5,lots of options for each type of student
College Freshman,5,"We have great teachers, who are some of the best in their fields. The classes are challenging, but fun."
College Freshman,5,"I didn't have a best SAT score, but i got accepted and got full tuition scholarship that i am happy about. 100% students receive some sort of financial aid. "
College Freshman,5,"I really like the classes that i take. Professors are engaging and ready to help. The registration process is not good because athletes get a chance to register earlier, and for other people it starts later than assigned time. Even some people can't get to their desired class because Iqweb won't go through for them. The core curriculum is really good. As it is liberal art college they try to prepare well rounded students. There are group tutoring groups that i found really helpful. And the writing center is a great source for editing papers.Popular area of study is ASL."
College Freshman,5,"I like college atmosphere. The classes are small, and there is no limit in printing. The officials care about wellness of students. The RAs are always there to help their residents. Professors do more than they should. The campus is small and it doesn't take a long time to get to classes. People are really friendly and the campus is pretty diverse. We got a lot of international students that organize activities related to their culture."
College Freshman,5,I really like professors are willing their students to do well in their classes. I like small size classes because you can individual attention from your instructor. The material is really challenging and i like it because it would prepare me better for Medical school. I really like my biology class because it is so interesting but it takes a lot of effort and time and i am ready for this. I love my chemistry professor. She is really nice and available to help students whenever she can. 
College Freshman,5,"I really like there so many international students in this campus. There are students with different religious backgrounds. There are students from every ethic backgrounds, and there are clubs almost for all of them like Latino student Alliance, Black student Alliance... You can meet people with different social backgrounds, but most students are middle class or higher.  "
Junior,4,the online classroom experience during the spring 2020 pandemic was a learning experience for all students that was unprecedented. however the school did a great job of aiding the students during the transition.
Junior,4,Wonderful small school experience with very personable relationships between professors and students. Professors really want to to succeed and will go out of there way to make sure you learn what you need too.
Freshman,4,"Maryville college has a really great community, and wonderful professors. The campus is beautiful. Kind of expensive but it's worth it for a great education."
Junior,4,A small college that feels like home! The professors and staff actually know students by name and care about their home life. The classes are hard but rewarding. It's not the easiest school to transition to if you are 23 and older. They could open up to older adults more instead of Students fresh out of High-school. The tuition is high since it is a private school but scholarships are available. The food is pretty good. The campus is beautiful and easy to walk. More parking would be nice.
Junior,4,Maryville college is the best college to attend if you want to feel like you truly matter. You are not just another pay check for them; they truly want you to succeed. All the professors encourage you to think outside of the box. The campus itself is small and beautiful. You are not another face in the crowd because most students will know you by name or face. The only thing they could change is the high tuition rates and building on their online classes option.
Senior,4,Maryville College is an intimate and small college. The small class sizes allow for a student-faculty relationship that transcends the classroom. The faculty are supportive and provide excellent guidance. There are also a lot of ways to get involved in community and campus activities.
Sophomore,4,"Since I have only been at this college for one year, I feel it necessary to only give it 4 stars since I haven't quite done all there is to do at this school. In my experience so far, this college is a wonderful place to be. The location is absolutely amazing, in my opinion. Right in the city, yet detached and half the campus is a trail filled wood that provides an escape from the struggles of college. I have only ever heard good things from this school."
Sophomore,4,Maryville College is a very good college that is small yet great at diversifying. The opportunities and events made available by Maryville College allows the student body to develop as the young adults they are. The college is also very academically successful in many areas.
Junior,4,"Overall it has been great!. The academics are fantastic, a lot of the teachers are professionals in there field allowing a great insight on ones future career. It is a very diverse campus with people from all sorts of backgrounds and ethnic groups, it is also a very liberal campus despite it being a christian college.  Never once have I felt unsafe on the campus. The only thing is the food is awful in the cafeteria but there is lots of cheap and cheap local food just 5 mins from the campus."
Junior,4,"The professors really care about the students and are willing to go the extra mile for them as long as the students are willing to meet them halfway. The administration seems, at times, to be less student friendly. Some of the housing policies and practices are out-dated or more complicated than necessary. I would love to see the option of living off campus be available for all students."
Sophomore,4,"Very safe campus, lots of good teachers. Financial aid is a bit frustrating to deal with, but it's worth the headache to be here. It's a small campus with a good community."
Freshman,4,"Maryville College has amazing academics and professors. My experience their has been wonderful, but one thing I would like to see be changed would be newer technology."
Sophomore,4,This school is amazing. You'll never meet staff and faculty members that care as much about the students as Maryville College's employees do. The campus is GORGEOUS and they are so outdoor and environmentally active. The students care about each other and love one another. The only way to describe this school is to call it my adopted family. Go Scots!
Freshman,4,"It's been pretty good so far. It's kinda expensive, and the food's not as good as it could be. It's also not a closed in campus, so even though I feel pretty safe, I still wish it was gated or something. The campus is also small, so you can wake up 15 minutes before class and still get there on time. Also, since it's a small college, you actually get to know your teachers, and you're not just another face in the crowd. Overall, it's a really good school."
College Freshman,4,I have not seen much drug activity or usage.
College Freshman,4,I have based my career on my subject of study. I would like more information on internships in my feild. The career services have been more than helpful .
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy living on campus.  I could be more cost efficient, but we have great dorms."
College Junior,4,"Maryville College has given me the opportunity to learn about myself. Not only has the academics from Maryville College given me the great knowledge, it has forced me to learn in a rigorous and competitive environment. By being in this competitiveness, it has given me the advantage over my peers from other colleges and universities. If I had to start all over again I would."
College Junior,4,Maryville College offers very challenging courses.
College Junior,4,We have a very diverse and accepting community here.
College Junior,4,I don't really know much about the parties on campus. I don't attend.
College Junior,4,My school connected me with the internship that I currently have. Opportunities are abundant if you work hard and get noticed by your professors.
College Junior,4,"Academically, I have thrived here with the help of my professors."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe when I'm on campus, but I'm a commuter so that's not very often."
College Junior,4,"It's a great school, staffed with great professors."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is better than living off campus in my opinion. Having to be in a dorm helped me make friends freshman year, and I would do it over again. The freshman dorms are the oldest meaning they aren't as nice. The dorms after freshman year though are absolutely beautiful. Also, the cleaning staff are exceptional in keeping the dorms clean. Housing process after freshman year though, is a pain to go through. It's great as far as effectively putting everyone in a dorm for the next year, but it's hard to get the exact building or layout that you may want."
College Freshman,4,"We have a lot of fan support for each of our athletic programs. Each sport is well respected in that they have done extremely well. A couple of our teams have gotten rings several times in the past. We also have a lot of school spirit, and most of the students attend the games for each sport. Our facilities for our sports teams are exceptional. The athletic center is one of the many beautiful buildings on campus."
College Freshman,4,I haven't started Maryville College yet but all my experiences on campus have been great.
College Junior,4,I only take classes during the day so I feel very safe. I have never heard of any wrong doings in the night life so I don't think it is a problem at my school. I know we have a lot of prevention such as classes so I assume the help would be readily available if an anything of that nature did occur.
College Sophomore,4,This school accepts you no matter who you are and where you come from
College Sophomore,4,"This school is hard. Not going to lie. They push you and the professors do care, but they do put a lot on yo sometimes"
College Sophomore,4,The alumni are fantastic and our new career center is very helpful. They have a site where employers can post jobs
College Sophomore,4,We have wonderful school spirit and we take great pride in everything that goes on here
College Sophomore,4,I cried when I found out I got in. It's a small school tucked away in the beautiful mountains. The buildings are beautiful and the people actually try to get to know you
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman so the dorms aren't the best, but the upper classmen dorms are really nice."
College Freshman,4,Some of the smaller sports don't get as much attention as basketball and football do.
College Freshman,4,"From the get go, Maryville College offered a very accepting and open community. Orientation week made sure everyone got involved and gave you many opportunities to ensure you would continue your involvement."
College Senior,4,"it's hard work but with the help of the professors, success is accessible.  there are many resources to help with acedemic success."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Maryville College. Though I wish my program was overall stronger and the advisor was more prepared and challenging. I made great friends, leaving me with great experiences!"
College Freshman,4,I love it here. Its so great!
College Freshman,4,Our school is very good at awarding scholarships.
College Freshman,4,Don't break the rules and everything is fine
College Freshman,4,Many options and no mold.
College Freshman,4,"All requirements met, never feeling cramped."
College Sophomore,4,There are many close restaurants and fast food chains within a close proximity of the college that are both tasteful and convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"Maryville College, located in Maryville, Tennessee is surrounded by beautiful scenery, a wonderful community, and is filled with excellent administrators, staff, and professors. The environment of Maryville College is one that promotes excellence and is full of support."
College Sophomore,4,Academics are awesome (the teachers are anyway).  And especially for the science majors there are tons of opportunities to get practical experience in your field.
College Junior,4,"theres not too much off campus houseing, but i live about 20 min away"
College Freshman,4,"It's a hit or miss with the teachers, great or bad"
College Freshman,4,"Very pretty, but there's nothing to do"
College Freshman,4,"The freshman buildings are decent but need improvements.  They are old and the rooms are very tiny, and the buildings do not have elevators.  The residence hall staff does try to build a great community for freshman within their residence halls. They hold lots of fun events."
College Freshman,4,"Each residence hall has designated lots they can park in.  Parking spots close to the buildings fill up very quickly and parking can be a hassle. The campus is very small though so even the farthest lots from your residence hall are not as far as they are at some schools. Many people who live on campus do not have cars. I personally would not want to be without my car, but it is not impossible to be without one."
College Freshman,4,"There a few fun places that are local, but it is still a relatively small city.  It is close to a big city though so there is plenty to do about 30 minutes away from campus."
College Freshman,4,The campus has great places to hang out outdoors.  Campus fitness centers need improvement. The library and student center are helpful spaces. The college has great traditions that really build a sense of community. The campus is absolutely beautiful.
College Freshman,4,"The weather is good in the area.  It changes frequently, but students enjoy spending time outside whenever the weather is nice, which is pretty often."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of students attend games and have fun doing so.  The team is improving and growing each year.  The dance team, cheerleaders, pep band, and other spirit groups are there to support the teams along with the students. The intramurals program is a great program for students to become involved in as well.  The athletics facilities are good, but facilities for the average student's athletic needs is decent but needs improvements."
College Freshman,4,I believe I am receiving a well-rounded education in my major. As a writing communications I will complete either an internship or practicum as part of my course work before I graduate. The school is very writing intensive and all students are required to write a senior thesis. One program I am most excited about is the Non-Profit Leadership Certification which is a recognized program that helps students learn the skills needed to work in the non-profit sector.
College Freshman,4,"I had a good experience with financial aid and I received an academic scholarship.  I also applied for another scholarship.  I was not chosen to receive the full scholarship, but I did receive a smaller amount for applying."
College Freshman,4,"I am very pleased with my program so far. However, I have not taken many of my major classes yet because I am still finishing general requirements.  I love my major adviser and am very excited to continue in my program. I am a Writing/Communications major and, as of right now, I plan to go into public relations/marketing in the non-profit sector."
College Freshman,4,"I simply applied to the school, was accepted, and then I chose my major."
College Sophomore,2,"I belong somewhere with a much more rigorous education. Plus, the students are just weird - antisocial."
College Freshman,2,"The food is alright... sometimes. I personally don't like it, though. A lot of times it's cold or has been sitting out for a while."
College Sophomore,2,There are almost no options.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is secret, as fraternities aren't allowed on campus.  Thus, it's via secret invite only."
College Freshman,2,Overpriced and with very limited options
College Freshman,2,What you'd expect on such a small campus
College Freshman,2,Mostly just fast food and you have to drive there
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of computers and printers for students to use, but the wireless network needs major improvement.  In some places the wireless works great, but in other places it works slowly or not at all. I would recommend bringing a computer. A printer is an added convenience for printing on short notice, but having your own is not necessary at all."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the common places to eat are Cookout, McDonalds, Taco Bell, and Sonic. There are a lot of local restaurants but many of the students do not eat there or they are not very good. They also are expensive on student budgets and only Salsaritas has student discounts."
College Freshman,2,Some days the weather is supposed to be sunny and warm but then it ends up being chilly outside. The rain and snow is almost always unpredictable. The humidity is okay for the South.
College Freshman,2,The freshmen RA's sometime do not make it feel comfortable to talk to and get to know. The residential programs are awful and low budget. The upperclassmen dorms are much better. The RA's do their job the right way and make their residents feel at home but also keep up with their duties. Most of the upperclassmen dorms are nice and are much better to live in.
College Freshman,2,No public transportation from campus
College Freshman,2,Too many empty beer cases and bottles laying around in public places
College Freshman,2,"The international house offers shopping trip to Wal-Mart every Wednesday, and i have lab that time. There are no other way get off campus, unless ask a friend to take you there. No public transportation in town at all. And the taxi is expensive."
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing isn't much better than on-campus.  There's almost no incentive to do it other than seclusion.
College Freshman,2,In town's okay. The best places are in Knoxville.
College Junior,2,Living on campus has its pros and cons. the ultimate pro is youre away from your parents nest. the biggest con is youre away from your parents nest.
College Junior,2,They are extremely strict on drinking policies and parking as well. Very unfair
College Senior,2,"Little Variety – At the beginning of the semester I thought it wasn't bad.  Guess it was the excitement of being away from home.  But at the term moved on, it got worse.  There's always salads and breakfast is actually pretty good.  But the dinner choices are sometimes quite different.  We have sausages frequently and I had ham once that definitely did not taste like ham.  My mom sends me food or I eat Mac &amp; Cheese for dinner."
College Sophomore,2,"We can barely find the public transportation in Maryville, so almost everyone drives and owns cars. We mostly have designated drivers when we go outside the campus to have fun, but there is an Knoxville Airport about 20 mins away from campus."
College Junior,1,There is no greek life on maryville college and is frowned upon because they believe that it destroys the community aspect of the campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The Vast Majority Is White – Though Maryville College is trying to get more diversity, the vast majority of people are white."
College Junior,1,"there are no transportation options in Maryville, unless you call a taxi."
College Freshman,1,Athletic Facilities – The facilities are very poor and look old. They could use all new facilities except the football field.
College Senior,1,hate having stupid rules in a building with stupid drunks

Sophomore,5,I actually attended the South Haven campus which is smaller than the Benton Harbor campus and is very accommodating of my work schedule.
Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small and this is a great school for high school students who want to participate in duel credit and duel enrollment programs. I am currently a sophomore attending, and my experience has been great, the faculty really seem like they want to help students learn and achieve their goals. You can't beat the tuition rate either, students can get a head start on their bachelors without breaking the bank. The library is currently being renovated and unavailable but it's supposed to be finished at the end of March 2020."
Alum,5,I love the professors and the athletic directors. They are always understanding and the school is VERY small.
Freshman,5,Love the college the professors are great really enjoying student life. Convenient location for myself as a mother to go back to school and get my degree. Class time makes it easy to work my family life around. Wish I would have went back to school sooner. Lake Michigan College makes you want to learn and be involved in the educational experience. Never miss out on any activities through their notifications and emails are extremely helpful for busy college students.
Senior,5,"Lake Michigan college is a great community of friendly people who are willing to  help out, work hard, and play hard when work is done. Lake Michigan College has a very relaxing environment, it's right be lake Michigan so when the whether is nice its not far to the beach. The Hawks Nest is a cool place to hang out on campus, there are lots of people and things to do. There are activities like ping pong and air hockey, and there are also tv's to watch and comfortable seating for relaxing on. I love being a student at Lake Michigan College, the teacher are all super nice and willing to help out. They also care about us, the students, as people and as individuals there willing to go the extra mile to help us. The small class sizes make for a close student body, and a friendly and supportive environment."
Senior,5,"Its been great! The proffessors are a great source of knowledge, the campus is beautiful, and everyones just super nice."
Freshman,5,I'm not yet a student fully but the college has given me a great experience with admissions and also just finding the right roommates. It is a smaller college and id in a very comfy environment. You can attend classes for majors and also do activities which are all organized when you start. The dorms are apartment style and are absolutely beautiful. I never wanted to go to college but I think my overall experience at lake Michigan will be my best experience.
Freshman,5,"What I like the most about Lake Michigan College is the dorms at the Benton Harbor location. The school is surrounded by an area where there is not much to do, but it does make a great place to study and keep a good gpa. When living in the dorms its a five minute walk to campus which is really beneficial."
Freshman,5,"Lake Michigan College is just a lot of new, yet somehow everything flows rather well so far.  The process for signing up for classes is rather straightforward, the campus is quite lovely, and the teachers are great. Looking forward to the rest of my college career."
Junior,5,"I love Lake Michigan College because it really made me open myself up to how important an education is, since then I've been pursing to become a registered nurse."
College Senior,5,"I was afraid at first, that if I attended this community college that I wouldn't be a part of a challenging curriculum, or that I wouldn't be prepared for university-level academics. However, all of the classes I have taken have been equally challenging as the classes that fellow friends have taken at other larger universities, so I definitely think that my courses have prepared me for transferring"
College Freshman,5,"I have taken a mathematics course and I absolutely fell in love with the instructor. I was a bit heartbroken when I progressed to the next course until I was made aware that the next course would be taught by the same instructor. She was a wonderful instructor, very hands on and always put her students needs first. In her course there was never one way of doing things. Even though I passed both of her courses I'm still able to contact her and receive help with any further courses. Shes absolutely wonderful and deserves an Emmy."
College Junior,5,I have not had any problems finding classes to work with my schedule. My program is very fixed but that is not a problem for my schedule.
College Junior,5,"My teachers genuinely care about our success in our career and our state boards. There are many opportunities for us to learn, grow and succeed."
College Junior,5,I am doing very well here
College Senior,5,There is always something that engages students on campus.  LMC really focuses on bringing the students together and showing that even though we are at a serious institution doesn't mean we can't have fun.
College Sophomore,5,It is very convenient for parents that are going back to school. Some of them are a waste of time though but are required
College Freshman,5,My paper work went through fairly quickly and without a problem. Financial aid office is also very helpful!
College Freshman,5,A lot of the students at my school are working and have families. They work hard at their goals while still raising a family or working hard for money.
College Freshman,5,Everything about my school is great. I have no complaints!
College Freshman,5,Love everything about the school. Facilities are great.
College Freshman,5,Computer network usually available for use. I don't really need to use it much because I have my own things. The other students find it handy though!
College Freshman,5,I took 1 online class so far. didn't think it would be too hard. It wasn't. Professor was quick to email me back a response to my questions.
College Freshman,5,Awesome school. I should have went here when I first started college. 
College Junior,5,All network related and online components are well designed and function well.
College Senior,5,"There are different cultures in our school and students respect each other. They help each other with study, very friendly and socializing."
College Junior,5,"Lake Michigan College has a very broad view of academic programs that I really couldn't find closer to home, I have a community college in my hometown, but I chose a 30min drive to LMC  because it offered my academic program, and the fact that our college has partnerships with top University's like Michigan State, Western Michigan, Sienna Heights makes it a lot easier for my academic achievement goals. The Lake Michigan College campus is by far the friendliest campus! Everyone I have met is so nice, students and instructors really take the time out to greet you and become your friend!"
College Sophomore,5,LMC tuition is good for students that's new and applying for FASFA. With FAFSA many people would be capable of attending LMC and that way that will be a great start to get a student going especially if that student is coming from a bigger institution such as a university and having money problems for that school he or she is attending and the education is far more worth the tuition that you pay for. My experience with the financial aid office was confusing for the first time I applied for it but then after while I've gotten use to it so it's like a piece of cake now. And the tips I had was applying for flex so that way it would hold my classes and keep my financial aid on track.
College Sophomore,5,"With the computer network at LMC it's very reliable. The labs there are fine, the printing is fine, the network reliability is on point and the speed is great as well. Most basically everything with the computer networking there is great."
College Freshman,5,"I spend most of my time in the theatre, so I am very familiar with the events and other activities that go on there. The theatre events are wonderful to be able to take part in and I enjoy every minute of it. In fact, My company will be filming the musical ""Aint Misbehaving"" This semester for the school so that everyone can see what a wonderful time it is to take part in the theatre program."
College Freshman,5,"I am a theatre and film major. I love the classes that I am involved in at my college. Being at the college has bought out my acting ability more than ever and I feel like the program there is great. On my website www.chopinproductions.co You can see all of the things that the college has allowed me to overcome. Everyone should love and accept their college experience, because you never know what might come out of it."
College Junior,5,i think the service is excellent because the people are well-mannered and have a good attitude towards you when they is helping you
College Junior,5,Scholarship Applications – There are a lot of scholarships/grants available to students and you submit one essay for all of them so you can focus on essays/papers for class and still apply for multiple scholarships.
College Senior,5,It Was Easy – The credits transferred easily. I couldn't have been happier. I am so glad I chose this college for my education.
College Senior,5,Lake Michigan College is a very diverse school ethnically and it is a wonderful experience. The students that I have come to know are very serious and dedicated to education. I find at this college that students are not timid when it comes to asking questions. And they ask some really great questions! It is amazing to see the interaction between the students and faculty. It seems many of the students are older and I believe this adds to the relaxed atmosphere. The younger students seem to pick up on this and become more relaxed themselves.
College Senior,5,"Everything Was Amazing! The professors are amazing, caring people. The environment was so much fun and engaging while still being able to learn something. If every college was like this, I would expect more people to comtinue with their college education. I wouldn't trade this experience for the world!"
College Senior,5,"A Wonderful Choice – Lake Michigan College was an amazing choice to start out with in my college education. The classes are small to ensure success, and the professors are very down to earth people. It was a very fun, education environment to be in."
College Senior,5,My major is very informative I have learned a lot since I started.  I had the opportunity to work with student by tutoring them.  Which will help me get my teaching skills in order.
College Senior,5,Always Pay Attentio to Your Paper Work When It Come to Tution. The financial aid staff is not helpful they make mistake.  I have had my financial aid reduced just last year for them making a mistake. Until I appeal their decision I glad I look over my paper work. If I would give anyone advice for getting financial aid it would be to make sure all your paper work is in. Also that you keep copies of papers that comes from Lake Michigan Fianacial Aid office just incase they make a mistke on you financial aid.  I grading it an A do to me loving my field and what Im learn and because most of the techers I have had have been helpful and caring.
College Junior,5,"The campus is not too big or small, it has just what you need, and a great Nursing department. There are many fields of interest that one can persue at Lake Michigan."
Senior,4,"I am reviewing Lake Michigan College in South Haven, MI. It is a nice and small community college. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Professors always stick to the syllabus, as best as they can and keep the class on the schedule."
Freshman,4,I love this college. I’m taking it for a trades program and the class is very hands on learning which I am better at.
Freshman,4,The campus is a little bit sketchy but it does give a decent beginning education at a low price. I have had some really good teachers and really bad teachers.
Niche User,4,"I have only taken a few classes here but I have loved my teachers and the classes where very easy. The people in the class where nice, and very helpful when I was having issues."
Freshman,4,Everyone is very helpful in person ut when you try to email people they don't really respond ever. So far I've taken two classes and everyone has been helpful. So far all of the course material is something I can use in everyday life.
Senior,4,"I am from San Antonio, Texas, and I have never been to Michigan before. On a very last second decision, I decided to come to Lake Michigan College and start a new journey for my academic career. This is my 3rd year here and I am currently in the Radiologic Technologist program. Thanks to the amazing staff I am here because of them. When I say a last-minute decision, I mean only 2 weeks to apply and prepare to move up here. They were very helpful with the process of everything and rushed to make sure I was able to make it on time and not have to wait another semester to come here. The professors here are so great, I’ve never once had a problem with any of them and have enjoyed my classes very much. It’s beautiful here also and have lots of activities and stuff to do. Also 10 minutes from the lake is great also! Only complaint here is the snow and financial aid advisers, but other than that I love it here!"
Alum,4,"My time at LMC was great! I went right after high school for a year, and then I completed my Associates Degree in Psychology 8 years later. Some of the professors are wonderful. The classes are smaller, allowing for a more personal experience, but not so small that it's weird. The campus is really nice too as long as you're careful not to step in the goose poop in the spring. :]"
Sophomore,4,Lake Michigan college is a very personable community college. All the staff there are very caring about every individual and do what they can and offer multiple sources to help every student succeed. The staff is always willing to answer any questions you have. The only issue I have is with the financial aid office. They are always taking there sweet time to get back to you. I wish they were better at communicating and getting back to the students. Other than that I would recommend this school. It's a great college to start off in. They also offer sports and clubs to join. It's a clean campus and I enjoyed my 2 years here.
Sophomore,4,"As a current and upcoming graduate, I reflect on my experience at Lake Michigan College as being good. As a member of the Honors Program at the school, I have a bias in that everyone should try to be involved in said program. Though there are many other programs and clubs available that offer a lot, honors is pretty awesome. As the school overall, cost is definitely low as financial aid offers a lot as well as the countless scholarships available (that many people don't take advantage of). They also offer a lot of opportunities in the Student Life center such as internships, jobs, volunteer opportunities and free tickets to events in the Mendel Center, such as a recent one featuring Joe Biden."
Niche User,4,I like that I was able to take classes close to home and that I could get a headstart on college credit. I would recommend LMC to other students.
Freshman,4,"I love that there is so much diversity here. I have met people from Brazil, China and a few other places as well as people who lived an hour away from me my whole life. The professor's that I have are all very helpful when I have questions. The dorms are another thing that I really like. They are more of an apartment style with each person having their own room and having our own kitchen and washer and dryer right in our room so we dint have to go to a laundromat or laundry room somewhere. The health sciences academic advisor is also so great. He knows of all of the health programs so well and makes sure that you are taking the right classes to get into your program, puts you on a great track to get there, and doesn't have you take fluff classes just because. It also has such a homey feeling because the student body is pretty small and so is the campus which is awesome if you're like me and don't like large schools."
Alum,4,"It’s a small community college, which is exactly what I needed right after high school since I’m a huge homebody. The people are kind and the teachers are usually available to help you in several ways."
Sophomore,4,"LMC has done a very good job being able to offer a variety of classes and times that they can be taken. This has worked great for me since I do work during the day. The professors can be a hit or miss though, I have had some amazing professors and then I have had some professors who don't much care about you"
Freshman,4,"As a current student at LMC, I think that it is a pretty good college. I love the food that they serve at their mosaic cafe. I also like how they are always doing special events like movie nights and drumming circle. They do need to be on it more about cleaning up the geese poop off the sidewalk and they do need to update certain areas of their campus."
Sophomore,4,"I felt that the teachers all knew what they were doing and knew their field very well. However, I feel like some teachers need to be better at putting in grades and having a way to contact them outside of the classroom. Some teachers do not update their grades on time, so it is impossible to know how you are doing in a particular class."
Freshman,4,It’s the perfect size for a starter and it’s set up really nicely and easy to understand. The professors are nice and the classes aren’t bad. I wish there were more groups and clubs open to everyone.
Sophomore,4,The school is a very great place to start before transferring to a University . I truly love everything about it and how less stressful it is to attend. Classes are close. And the Dorms are beautiful.
College Sophomore,4,You have plenty of class times and campuses to pick from.
College Sophomore,4,the online homework is easy to understand
College Sophomore,4,Glad i chose to save money and go to a good school with a good price.
College Senior,4,"One of the most incredible things I think that comes out of the CS program at Lake Michigan College, is how closely the faculty work with you. I know students who - simply after completing their first three programming classes - were accepted into internships paying upwards of $25 an hour. And the reason they got those scholarships was from the recommendation of the staff - they really do work closely with students and help them to ensure that they succeed."
College Junior,4,this is the only college i have attended so i have not had any problems with transferring credits.
College Junior,4,"from my understanding, degrees from my school is valued and respected."
College Junior,4,like the smaller class sizes! that part is definitely nice and great!
College Sophomore,4,We have quite a few job fairs
College Sophomore,4,This school does not have my program
College Sophomore,4,The class size is small so there are one on one's
College Senior,4,"I would choose this school again to ease into my college experience, it's really a great transition from a small high school to a community college instead of being overwhelmed with a university sized college right off the bat."
College Freshman,4,"With Lake Michigan College I am able to maneuver my class schedule around my personal life and any work schedule I may have. As a single parent of two, this is a wonderful opportunity that is provided for the students. I'm afraid that if I had not been given this opportunity that I would not have been able to further my education."
College Freshman,4,"I'm more of a hands on person. Lake Michigan College has that attitude that no student will ever be left behind. The instructors are very knowledgeable at what they teach and are always willing to walk their student through each course or problem step by step. I really appreciate that. The hands on opportunities, staff and student body make me happy that I chose Lake Michigan College as my two year college."
College Freshman,4,"The student body attending Lake Michigan College is wonderful. They are so generous and helpful any time day or night. It's really wonderful to have such a large group of people to turn to in any time of need. I have turned to several students that are more advanced in their studies than I, and I'm so glad I did. They broke down course work and explained every step of it to me in several ways to ensure that I fully understood the course."
College Freshman,4,"I personally have not taken part in these areas, but as I have heard from family members and friends that have attended Lake Michigan College, it is to my understanding that it is not an opportunity I would want to miss out on."
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, I have had wonderful instructors. I love and appreciate the smaller classes, hands on attention, and my classmates. I honestly could not have been happier any where else as a entry level school."
College Junior,4,The school is great and inexpensive. I would choose my school again if I could do it over because I have made amazing friends and got a great education to prepare me for my career.
College Junior,4,"Once into my program, the teachers have been great. Before the program it was hit or miss. Either an amazing teacher or the teacher wasn't so great."
College Junior,4,I have only taken a few online courses but all were easy to use and I learned at least some information from them.
College Junior,4,"If you seek help, you will get the help you need. The only issues I have ever had has been with financial aid in awarding scholarships to my account in a timely fashion but things have always been corrected once I seek help."
College Junior,4,I have had a great experience in the Nursing program at LMC. All of the teachers have been great in preparing us for our NCLEX and for the real world of nursing.
College Junior,4,I felt like the teachers cared.
College Junior,4,LMC has a lot of resources.
College Junior,4,It was great for me i was local and many people i know went there.
College Junior,4,Over all LMC is a good school for students starting out of trying to go back.
College Junior,4,It was easy and understandable.
College Junior,4,Very affordable if you can't afford paying 4 years of university costs
College Junior,4,I haven't ran into any issues at this point
College Junior,4,"I like the amount of work that I'm getting from each of my classes. Not too much, but not too little so I'm not bored all of the time"
College Junior,4,Not many of the students are friendly and seem to be there to make friends
College Senior,4,"I have only had one online course at LMC, but the course I had set me to work on different programs on the computer. It taught me a lot about computers and I hope I can take something taught by that professor again; she was excellent."
College Junior,4,"I think the resources on campus are great.  The student center is very helpful and also relaxing.  If I need help with anything I know there are trusted mentors to help me out.  If I am having a long day, I can always lounge in the student center. The library is wonderful.  There are so many different resources available to use."
College Junior,4,"The network at my school is great.  There has never been a time where I couldn't access the network. On the other hand, I do think accessing the printer is pretty difficult. To get papers printed, students have to enter their ID information and password onto a small device.  I think it takes too much time to print, especially since its so easy to enter the wrong information."
College Sophomore,4,LMC helps people find jobs and their nursing program is wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,I love it here!! The staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is great as well.
College Sophomore,4,"online learning for me is very easy, you have to be motivated and know how to utilize your time if you get stuck but it is definitely a full class load."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of student life events that happen, trying to get all students to be social with eachother.  Students are of all ages and come from different backgrounds and high schools and my college trys to get everyone to get to know other students. It is really nice to meet colleagues to keep you motivated and to study with."
College Sophomore,4,"Online classes, depending on the course, are more efficient for students with busy schedules. The workload I have experienced is less than the average courses. The registration process is the same as a regular course. I've noticed that there isn't as much peer-to-peer interaction in an online course, as a regular course."
College Sophomore,4,At LMC we have the ability of creating or own clubs. We have students of all ages and races. Almost everybody is friendly and willing to help others. The professors work hard to ensure that their students have all the information they need to succeed not only in the class but also in life. The professors and faculty also offer one on one time for any student that wants help.
College Student,4,There is a student center as the main campus  that is new!
College Student,4,"Being a community school, professors are supportive and would like students to accomplish their goals."
College Sophomore,4,Lake Michigan College is a community college and so the tuition is not out outrageous. They offer some scholarships and aids for students.
College Student,4,"Tuition is affordable, thus making the education worth the amount paid."
Sophomore,2,It was ok. I really did not enjoy the classes and it is too small for me. I wish there could be more diversity and events to attend. There are very few clubs to join. The campus could be improved as it is very dirty.
College Senior,2,"We don't really have that large of a career center, since the former director of it was let go."
College Sophomore,2,There are sports teams but hardly ever people show up. There is a gym for everybody to use and it is nice. Not really a whole lot of campus activities at least none that interest me.
College Sophomore,2,"The student body at the Bertrand Crossing campus consists of mostly middle-aged adults and smart High School Students. However, when you go to the Napier Campus there is a more ethnic mixture of cultures mostly just focusing on there careers."
College Junior,2,I'm unable to obtain financial aid.
College Freshman,2,The labs are always full and your papers are printed at the same time as other students and you have to sift through each others papers to make sure you have everything you want.  Very frustrating
College Freshman,2,"The athletic facilities are slightly better than what was available to me at my high school.  The library is very small compared to other colleges, in fact I use Andrew University's library more than LMC's  There is not any place for students to hang out and chill, at the moment.  They are building one currently."
College Freshman,2,The student body is not very diverse.  We all come from low income families.  There are basically only two ethnic groups on campus.  Compared to the ethnic diversity at other schools I have toured this is not diverse at all.
College Freshman,2,"This wasnt my top choice by any standards but i had no other choice to go to LMC. I was original at Western Michigan University for the first 1.5 years of college, then i got academically dismissed and i'm getting my grades back up to return there."
College Junior,2,Decent Resources but Would Rather Use My Own Computer. When I go into the library it is never a quiet setting. It is almost like it is a hangout for students to be loud and chat. I go into to the library looking for a computer to use and I see lots of people playing around on facebook and taking up computers that I could be doing my homework on. I am not very involved in the extra activities because they are always during my class times so I haven't really had a chance to participate in many of them.
College Senior,2,"Don't Procrastinate – Professors are usually really helpful online. If you have a question, depending on the course, it can take 24 hours to 72 hours for them to respond. In classes like Psychology or Economics it can be hard to understand the material. However, classes like Intro to Computers and Keyboarding are very simple and straight forward. You do end up turning in printed homework to the records office at the main campus. Very few classes are offered online as well. You have to set a pace and stick to a timeline. It's easy to procrastinate and fall behind."
College Senior,1,"It is hell getting in touch with teachers, even for online courses. I have waited days for responses to urgent questions. "
College Senior,1,"I am not a computer person but, am learning to deal with it. I still like people and the class room."
College Senior,1,"Beware The Geese! When you register for classes, do it in person. The online process is full of hassles and rather confusing. If you need advising schedule it ASAP! Once school starts you won't be able to see an advisor. Trust me, I waited, and got scheduled in 4 months later. Don't take online classes if you can help it. Professors are some what helpful. Very few professors will get involved, even though the class sizes are pretty good. I've never been in a class with more than 32 students. If you want to use the college computers, get to the library before noon. Otherwise they will all be in use, by teenagers on Facebook. There is a nice gym, but usually if you go in after 11 am it's full. Just an insider for you if you go during Winter Semester. When it comes to spring time watch out for the geese! Seriously the schools budget is an old man with two dogs. They nest near the school. They will chase and hiss at you."
College Senior,1,"Bring Your Own Laptop – There are few campus resources. They have added more computers in the library. If you go in trying to do work all of them will be occupied, by teenagers checking their Facebook. They have reliable wireless networks, unless your on the third floor in the B-Wing, which ironically is the Computer Information wing."
College Senior,1,"Type 1 or Type 2 – The student body isn't very diverse. They give you numbers about different ethnicities, ages, and life styles. When it comes down to it. Your average student is either a sports player or a middle-aged person with a full-time job and family. The sports players are favored by all professors. They have special services for their convenience. But you better play basketball or baseball/softball. Becuase those are really the only sports offered. Everyone else is out of luck."
College Senior,1,"Can't Find A Job? Not Their Problem. The career services offered by LMC are almost nonexistence. If you schedules an appointment, need to do this months before you need help, they will help you with your resume. The help they offer is the same that you could ""Google"" online."
College Senior,1,"Tough Luck – The school says it helps with post graduation. Services include resume building and interviewing help. Both services are horrible. They have one lady leading this. If you need to speak to her you need to schedule an appointment, and she's booked until next year. They don't help with your carrer. The alumni network as well is no good."
College Senior,1,"Type 1 or Type 2 – Most students are one of two types. Type one is the straight out of high school student who playes basketball and/or baseball/softball. The few events offered at LMC, are offered to them. Type two is middle aged adults with full-time jobs and families. If you aren't either of these getting to know people or become involved is very hard if not impossible. Overall the majority of the school is African American. Very few caucasion, hispanics, native americans, etc."
College Senior,1,"High School You Pay for – Overall I wouldn't suggest this college. Your problems start when you register with classes. They do have flex-pay which is convenient. The classes offered and flexibility of the classes are minimal. Professors are rarely involved, there are some that care. All the professors seem to know the subject they are teaching, just 30% of them don't know how to teach. If you don't play baseball or basketball you won't be playing sports. Also very few events are offered to students. If you aren't part of the sports teams you are made to feel very unwelcome. It feels like high school, except you have to pay for it."
College Senior,1,"False Flexibility – While signing up for classes I signed up for an OE/OE class. Which means it's a self paced course. I ended up recieving an email two weeks into the class saying that it was, in fact, not open exit. Certain classes that are required are only offered once a year or two years. My CIS class is only offered every other Winter semester. It is a required class and only offered at one time. LMC guarantee's your class are a go. But be careful, becuase you might be going no where fast."
College Senior,1,"Community College Let Down – The best way to describe LMC is high school you pay for. Few professors try to get involved, even though we have small class sizes. Most of the time if you have a question, they are able to get you an answer. The financial aid office, as well as other staff members, do very little to help you out. When registering for classes you need to go in, don't do it online becuase the system is broken. Also, you can't rely on Blackboard."

Junior,5,An amazing college. Everyone is super nice and respectful. I love this school so much and I’m very happy that I decided to come here.
Freshman,5,"I really liked the fact that Colorado State Universities Staff is friendly and willing to help however, their staff brush up on some stuff. When I was asking questions, some of the staff members had no idea what I was talking about or they did but didn't know how to answer."
Sophomore,5,Colorado State University is a wonderful school. it is very diverse with many different academic programs. The school is located in a beautiful area. I absolutely love the campus. The staff and professors are very friendly and helpful.
Alum,5,"Though I only attended a few online classes, all courses were very easy to navigate and the professors were extremely responsive when any questions had arose."
Alum,5,"As a transfer student and a first generation student attending an accredited school, Colorado State University provided me with a great amount of help in regard to all the necessary steps towards graduation. The school provided a great amount of resources to help me stay on track and provided me with necessary social clubs to not only build my educational knowledge but the networking skills to use outside of graduation."
Freshman,5,"My experience so far has been nothing but positive. The faculty and staff are all polite and considerate, as well as understanding of any issues that may arise due to the pandemic and affect schoolwork. The other students have also been nothing but kind and friendly. Attending CSU was definitely a great choice."

Senior,5,Such an excellent campus with wonderful students and faculty to help support your pursuits of your interests.
Junior,5,Colorado State is really inclusive and politically aware. They make it their mission to make sure all students feel welcome and motivated to learn.
Sophomore,5,"This is my first semester in a four year program. I have already completed 36 credits at a community college and Colorado State University has made the transition very smooth. Orientation gave me good expectations of what was in store my first year. We have had program specific meetings to help students like myself move forward.
My program is Natural Resources Management and so far the classes seem tailored for the end goal of working in that field. I am already able to see how the class content is applicable in the field and at feel confident that the program will allow me to find a satisfying career using the skills I've learned. 
As far as cost goes, I am able to use my GPA to earn scholarships so it helps lessen the blow. I don't care for the cost in general and despite the plethora of services I believe college should be very cost effective for every student."
Junior,5,This school is extremely inclusive and they always listen to the students. Everything is very up to date with this generations way of thinking and they make a positive experience every day.
Sophomore,5,"At CSU I felt that there were high expectations placed under students to be academically successful. While their expectations are high, they provide a lot of assistance to become academically successful, however, it's up to the student to take the initiative. While it's okay to relax and have fun, it's important to stay on top of school work!
  Diversity is on the low as CSU is predominantly Caucasian, however, as an Asian, I felt welcomed by my peers and that race did not matter. 
The Campus is very spacious and there's a lot offered. The Lory Student Center and CSU Rec Center are hotspots along with the Oval, and the plaza. 
    Many of my professors in the past year and this semester have been incredibly understanding either with unexpected situations or miscommunication. I realized this a bit late, but it's essential to reach out to your professors if you want to succeed in college.
  The local area is a college town and has a lot to offer. Definitely check it out!"
Junior,5,The minute you step on campus you feel that productive student vibe. The campus is well taken care of and has beautiful buildings and greenery. I've met life long friends and had enthusiastic teachers that make learning fun.
Junior,5,"I have not personally taken online courses yet, but I am going to this fall semester. The majority of my teachers have been very informative about what to expect, and friends who have taken online classes last semester were very positive about their experience."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with Colorado State University was excellent. When i went my freshman year I fell in love. It was the first I visited and the best I’ve experienced. I really enjoyed seeing everyone get along well with each other. Also, the scenery around me was spectacular."
Sophomore,5,"CSU has been an incredible school for me. All of my teachers have been very kind, engaging, and helpful. The environment is easy to catch yourself smiling in for no reason and the flourishing trees often make it easy to get distracted by the beauty of nature. There are great places to study alone or with groups and there are great resources all around campus. Life is easy to enjoy at CSU."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman, I could not be more excited to live on the beautiful campus and become a part of the family at CSU. When I visited the college I was extremely impressed with all of the facilities, staff, and students. The location and atmosphere is amazing and I can't wait for the fall semester."
Freshman,5,"Prior to starting classes, I have already been involved in plenty of learning experiences and opportunities online with CSU and so far everything has been super easy and smooth. With the help of my advisors and all of the staff of CSU, the transition from high school to college has been super great."
Junior,5,"During the 2019 COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) pandemic, CSU had moved all courses online at the end of spring break in March. Through this struggle, CSU had managed to successfully move all courses online within a matter of weeks. With over 33,000 students attending CSU, they had managed to transform their education with much success. Colorado State University strives to provide the best education they can for their students and have proven to excel. The staff at Colorado State University are very supportive, and helpful to try and meet each of their students needs. CSU continues to improvise and improve their learning, both in person and online."
Junior,5,"For anyone that is considering attending Colorado State University, I would highly recommend. Colorado State University, makes it a top priority to give each and every student an equal and fair opportunity to succeed.I suffer from a Traumatic Brain Injury, that caused Short and Long term memory loss. As being a student at CSU with a disability, I have felt that CSU has met my expectations for making sure I can succeed to the best of my ability."

Junior,5,The faculty is driven and wants students to succeed. The programs are diverse and theres something for everyone!

Alum,5,CSU online was very easy to use and the professors where there when I needed help with my assignments. I felt that this was a very organized online learning platform and I was never out of the loop.
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus and lovely staff. When I toured with my family, it was amazing to see so many students hanging outside and having fun. Also the staff was super helpful with all of our questions and concerns with enrollment. Not only was the campus buzzing with life but it was also super clean."
Junior,5,The professors are overall very well-educated on their subjects. The syllabuses are usually very straightforward and it is often very clear what is expected of you in each course. Most professors are accommodating and will work with a student to help them succeed in the class.
Sophomore,5,"I came to CSU from the other side of the country, but I quickly felt at home. The professors are usually very engaged with what they teach, and the expectations are clear and fair. There are also many diversity and activism centers on campus, and the Pride Resource Center brought me to my closest friends. There is sometimes a lot of noise in the residence halls, but the residence staff is very friendly and helpful in resolving problems. I absolutely love the food on and around campus; the dining halls have a wide variety of options that are all delicious, and there are dozens of cafes, burger joints, and other nice places to go out with friends and eat. The campus response to bias incidents and hate speech could be more active, as there is a routine problem of hateful demonstrators disrupting campus activity at the beginning of the year. There is an ongoing administrative effort to put such measures in place, so I hope that in the near future, this problem will be reduced."
Alum,5,"I graduated from CSU with honors with a Bachelors of Science in Human Development and Family Studies.  I like the opportunities that CSU has to offer.  I was able to write a grant, complete a thesis, and join many extracurricular activities.  I also traveled abroad to Spain to study art on a scholarship.  My college experience was wonderful."
Freshman,5,"Amazing community, beautiful outdoors, lots to do around the town and plenty of outdoor activities as well."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Colorado State University in the fall of 2019. I have felt welcome since the day I came into this community. Everyone is very sweet and kind up here. I have met some of my best friends and have met some amazing people. The professors all have stated they want ""me"" to succeed and with that they have offered office hours and their emails always opened."
Senior,5,Colorado State University provides so many opportunities for you to be successful. During my four years I have had so much support and resources to get through my classes. The campus is also beautiful and older buildings are starting to be renovated.
Freshman,5,"Friendly staff, everyone has been so helpful with answering my questions. All of this college stuff is new to my family but thanks to all of the people helping us it has made the process a lot easier."

Freshman,5,"CSU is inviting, caring, and has a lot of love for their students and campus. They have an aptitude for sustainability and trying to leave a small impact, for how large campus is. Greek life on campus is one of the best ways to make friends and are closely supported by the school itself."
Niche User,5,I have toured Colorado State University twice and stayed there for an entire week the third time and it was beautiful. The campus seemed so calm yet full of life given that there were so many opportunities around campus. The resources such as the library and tutoring center showed just how dedicated the University is to their students.
Sophomore,5,"Colorado State has excellent faculty that are committed to student success. Each teacher, especially within the University Center for the Arts, is personable, caring, and dedicated to each student. I have submitted multiple essays to nominate specific professors within the University Center for the Arts for awards in academic mentorship. I've never felt so at home as I do at CSU. The campus is inviting, the surrounding mountains are city are fantastic, and the community established at CSU is unmatched."

We are all in this together, and as a student here, you truly do feel the support of staff, students and professors all around campus.

Junior,5,"Through CSU I have met my good friends, found a job through the university, pushed myself academically more than I ever thought possible, and overall have grown immensely as a person. I would not be where I am and doing as well as I am in all aspects of my life if it wasn't for CSU."
Freshman,5,"I visited and absolutely loved it, and will be attending in 2020. I am excited  to live in a such a beautiful community in the great state of Colorado."
Freshman,5,CSU is a beautiful campus with many majors and friendly students. The dorm food and sustainability is amazing. The professors are passionate about their research and what they teach.
Alum,5,"The Warner College of Natural Resources at Colorado State University is great. There were lots of opportunities to take small size classes, work with professors, and get involved in research. CSU's location in Fort Collins is great for getting involved in field work along the front range and making connections with local businesses and government agencies."
Alum,5,"I went there for my undergraduate degree. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Technical Journalism. I am very glad  I went there because I had exceptional professors, classes and opportunities to grow."
Junior,5,"I have loved every minute I have spent at Colorado State! The campus is gorgeous, the people are so friendly and caring, and it is so easy to get involved and meet people who you can connect with. The area of Fort Collins is so fun and has so many different things to do. Classes here have provided me with so many opportunities as well, I have never felt more at home than I do here."
Sophomore,5,"So far my experience has been amazing. Everyone is very welcoming, the campus is beautiful, and if you need help there is always someone glad to help."
Alum,5,"At Colorado State University, the student population was so diverse that I was drawn to it. In addition, the scenery and the attentiveness of the students and faculty members made me eager to learn there."
Junior,5,"Overall great school, all of the professors I have had are great and the other employees are very helpful. Great mental health resources and a low price"
Niche User,5,"I won't be a student at this university yet until next fall, but I did visit the campus back in October for their Engineering Days. Both my parents and I were really impressed with the campus. It was very spread out and did not feel crowded at all. The Engineering Days Seminar was very helpful and I learned a lot about the Biomedical Engineering career I want to get into. They also introduced me to what life was like at CSU. I got to see where certain dorms were and I got to try their food which was really good. While walking around, I got to see many activities that were offered at CSU. There was an Ultimate Frisbee tournament going on as well as lots of advertising for different sports such as football, volleyball, and basketball.  After that visit, I am pretty set on attending this school because they have everything want and they offer so much."
Niche User,5,The campus staff is so amazing! They really care about their Native American students! I went there for a college tour and the campus was so beautiful. I can see how many students would choose this school. I loved the way they kept referring to the way students are all friends. I am very excited to start going to school there!
Niche User,5,"My experience at CSU has been amazing. Both of my brothers have graduated from there, and I have been visiting there so many times."
Sophomore,5,Amazing school with a wide variety of classes. Most professors are attentive and will work hard to see students succeed.
Sophomore,4,I am take some classes online and some in person. The online classes can be challenging sometimes but for the most part the teachers are very encouraging. They have many different office hours that make them easily accessible. They are quick to respond and return graded assignments.
Freshman,4,"A lot of my classes are online, and despite a few technological issues, things have gone pretty smoothly. The professors are understanding of any problems we may have and upload a recording of the lectures online for us to review."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the pandemic, we are using a hybrid learning model. I attend three of my six classes in person however the spacing is appropriate for the number of students in the room. I feel that my current semester of classes that have been moved online are not impacted in a negative way."
Junior,4,All of my teachers did a great job transferring to online. It would be great if a few learned how to organize online classes a little more.
Sophomore,4,"I took summer classes online and while it was challenging at first, I managed to acclimate to the situation fairly quickly. This fall semester, almost all of my classes (minus one lab that's every other week) is online! Some of my professors are very well situated with teaching online so the change wasn't too noticeable. However, some of my other classes have had a bit of trouble. Most of the trouble stemmed from audio issues and lag during zoom meetings. 
  In all honesty, I find that some of the classes lose little to no value by going online, and that the ones that do just need to be revised. As long as the professor knows how to use technology, I found that my online experience at CSU was very straight forward."
Alum,4,"Had a great community of first-generation students, staff and faculty who helped me be successful and enjoy the 3.5 years I was there!"
Alum,4,"I took 2 online classes, one was a psych class and I truly enjoyed learning about different disorders. The professor definitely made it a enjoyable experience!"
Junior,4,So far I have really enjoyed my experience at Colorado State University. When COVID-19 hit they quickly provided a plan for students. I was employed with CSU at a dining hall and they continued to pay me after we were sent home.
Junior,4,"I think CSU is a pretty good school. I feel that I have definitely learned a lot in my classes and have met some really great people. They have some administrative issues at the moment and have responded to some scandals poorly. However, I do feel that they are learning from their mistakes and trying to change."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning was a challenging transfer for both the students and the professors, but CSU did a great job of making the online schedule easily accessible and convenient for the students who may have moved home and been in a different time zone. My professors provided all the resources we needed on canvas, which made it easier to find the answers I was looking for without having to email my professor and made it easier for me to go over and make sure I understood the material.  CSU was very kind and understanding of the struggles we may have faced because of the transfer to online."
Junior,4,"A great place to study and to learn. The athletics are terrible, but the library has all the academic resources needed including renting books and laptops, a great research database system, and good food."
Senior,4,"I overall have really enjoyed my time at CSU and derived value from it, however as a returning adult student who lives off campus, I've frequently felt like I slipped through the cracks (for example, during the COVID crisis, students aren't allowed to eat indoors unless it's in their own dorms. I have nowhere to go which means in December I'll be stuck eating outside)."
Senior,4,"Online learning has been smooth, though the sudden transition from in-person to online during COVID was a little rough (but that's to be expected)."
Sophomore,4,There seems to be an overall welcoming environment and many students take pride in helping others in need. The professors are all adequate and the majority go beyond expectations because of their unique personalities and teaching styles. The professors are also very willing to work with you if you have an issue and this applies to other college staff as well. Student resources and help is everywhere.
Sophomore,4,"I had to take online courses because of the global pandemic but many professors were already prepared for switching to online courses. Even those who were not already teaching online, transition fairly smoothly to online teaching. There was a lot of understanding and great communication to make corrections and accommodations as well. Online learning was not a struggle."
Freshman,4,"My experience at CSU was so welcoming and inclusive. I created connections with advisors, students, and group leaders. The work ethic in the atmosphere is strong and diligent. I loved CSU because it creates a place for everyone!"
Sophomore,4,"I took classes online after the start of covid in the US, and my experience was mostly positive. Most of my teachers handled it incredibly well. One in particular did her absolute best to ensure we got our money's worth out of the class, and her effort to maintain a quality learning experience was amazing. She genuinely cared about our success and worked extremely hard to help us succeed. Additionally, I was taking a jewelry making class that was obviously dismantled by covid (there's only so much you can do without studio tools like torches and anvils), but that teacher also worked very hard for us and showed us how we could use common household items to complete projects, which was amazing. All in all my online experience was mostly positive. I did have some teachers that kind of stepped back after the transition and the quality of those classes quickly fell, but the majority of teachers worked incredibly hard to give me a complete college experience, which I really appreciated."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the location, and I really appreciate all the educational opportunities available to students (free tutors, friendly professors, internships, etc.) Campus life is really fun, the dining halls are great and I love going to the rec center. Fort Collins also has an amazing bus system that I've enjoyed using. I am, however, a little disappointed in how CSU has been handling the coronavirus and several racism related issues on campus, so that's why I didn't give it five stars."
Alum,4,"After Coronavirus, I had all my classes online.  While the circumstances were not great, they did their best to accommodate all our needs.  I give them a 4 for effort and willingness to compromise, but the overall experience of online classes  was not fun."
Junior,4,"With be required to utilize distance learning Spring 2020, our transition was easier than expected, at least from a student's perspective.  The college did everything possible to make the transition easy for the students and to continue to provide high quality instruction."
Junior,4,Professors adapted well with COVID and made sure we still met objectives. They took unique approaches to effectively ensure all students were comfortable with online learning.
Alum,4,"Beautiful, constantly-evolving campus in a perfect-sized city. Excellent balance of engaging professors, rigorous coursework, and extracurricular activities. Plenty of nightlife and typical Colorado outdoor activities. The time I spent CSU have"
Senior,4,"CSU has overall been great in terms of education, facilities, and campus. However, new administration could have handled the COVID-19 situation much better, as well as some rude students in the past."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time as CSU very much and I wish I could do it all over again! Fort Collins is an awesome town and I am so happy that I chose to come here to continue my education.
Junior,4,Teachers were very good about posting detailed video notes and responding to questions in a timely manner. Many also used conversation boards during class time to help answer questions.
Junior,4,Campus has a lot of resources for students. Lots of clubs and activities for students to get involved with. Undergraduate research is prioritized here. Fort Collins is a great town that provides a lot for college students.
Alum,4,I took classes online while I was in school. It was easy to log onto the portal and follow along with what was happening and hand write notes at the same time.
Junior,4,"Overall, the professors are very knowledgeable about their subjects. The student life is abundant, with many opportunities for clubs and get-togethers. There are also many welcoming resources for minority students  and for academic assistance, as well as financial aid help."
Alum,4,"Overall, my experience with Colorado State University was good. I was a pre-vet student, so CSU was my first choice. The coursework helped me prepare me well for applying to vet school."
Freshman,4,"Based on their website,  Colorado State University is the type of school that just brings people in. It's very inviting and the students love being there and being able to live their life to the fullest while maintaining their educational standards. Overall,  the school offers so much that even community may get involved."
Freshman,4,"Colorado State had always been my first choice once I began looking in high school. I chose this University because they have a lot of biology-based programs that no other school I was looking at have. The campus is very pretty, with a lot of green spaces to study and work in. The faculty and resources are all very helpful, with a strong sense of student support as their main goal."
Junior,4,The university has taught me an abundant amount of information that I will continue to use after college. The university is very professional and will help their students to the best of their ability. Overall I have had a good experience.
Junior,4,pretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty goodpretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty goodpretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty goodpretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty good.pretty good. pretty goodpretty good. pretty good.
Sophomore,4,"There are so many things that I love about CSU.  So far, my experience has been filled with incredible professors, and classes from a diverse range of subjects and interests.  I think that CSU has many efforts to be a community-involved school, and also offers many clubs and programs allowing students to get involved.
However, I think that CSU could use more training on diversity and tolerance, required for all students.  Although not true to my experience, I do know people who have struggled with this and I think that CSU should implement more measures to create a diverse, safe, accepting climate for ALL students."
Junior,4,CSU is very active in student learning and involvement with the school. I have had no trouble attending this school and the community is very supportive.
Sophomore,4,I like my college because the community is very welcoming and the teacher that I have meet thus far have been very helpful and want to help their students pass their classes.
Junior,4,My overall experience with Colorado State University has been very positive. It is located in a great town and has plenty of campus activities to participate in.
Niche User,4,"Beautiful Campus! I love the open mindedness, people are always critically thinking! I'm very excited to attend."
Sophomore,4,"I was a transfer student this past semester and I really like the school so far. You do have to get out there and really try to talk to people if you don't want to go to the transfer events.  Although, CSU could definitely offer a lot more opportunities in helping spring semester transfer students with housing for the next fall. Better roommate roundups and more information on how to go about signing the lease. Party scene is okay here but the police shut them down often and pretty early. And CSU needs to fix that parking system because I want to go out and explore but wasn't going to pay 800 for that."
Niche User,4,"For someone who hasn't been able to fly and visit from Indiana, I feel as if I can understand the environment and what CSU expects."
Junior,4,"Thanks to some amazing opportunities at Colorado State University and a supportive network of professors and academic officials, I've been able to hone my craft as a journalist, spend a semester abroad, and graduate within three years. As I prepare to graduate, I look back on everything I've done and none of that would've been possible without such a great network and environment. I've been involved with Key Communities during my entire time at CSU. Diversity is one of the biggest - if not the biggest - area Key focuses on, and I've had the privilege of spending the past three years in such a diverse environment in which I've developed some of my most prominent values. But outside of Key, CSU is not as diverse. I understand there has been at least some headway in focusing on diversity more at CSU, such as the creation of the Race, Bias and Equity Initiative. Overall, diversity is an aspect that needs to be improved upon at CSU, and my time here has been very rewarding."
Senior,4,"CSU is an amazing school. I have been able to learn so much, not only from my peers, but my professors. CSU strives for academic achievement, integrity, inclusion, and sustainability. The campus is beautiful, the people are nice, the professors care, and rams take care of rams."
Freshman,4,"CSU is a great school overall, it is expensive for out of staters such as myself though. Since the college town of Fort Collins is so amazing, all of the upper classman go to bars in old town and don't throw parties even though the freshman can't as they live in dorms. The dorms are pretty old, expensive but are at least mostly well located. The dining hall food is very good for a college, sports are solid and greek life is pretty poor here for the size of the school. My professors have all been AMAZING except for one in business calculus."
Alum,4,"Beautiful campus, great classrooms. A bit dated but any STEM is very welcomed and updated facilities for STEM courses."
Freshman,4,Colorado State University is diverse and offers many learning and community opportunities. The campus is beautiful with lots of space for activities and events always going on. The courses all try to be as interactive as possible. They strive to encourage creative and critical thinking in all their students. My experience here has been wonderful.
Junior,4,CSU is the best college in Colorado. There have a very inclusive campus that makes it being different easy. They also have the motto No Place 4 H8 which is nice because it keeps hate speech and hate activities from spreading across campus.
Freshman,4,"Colorado State Universitie's campus is absolutely stunning. I am starting my second semester and have not run into a bad teacher yet! The dorm food could definitely be improved, but overall I am really enjoying my time here."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus and am planning on attending next fall of 2020. For me this campus really felt like home. They had good hosting and made sure to rely all information. If they hadn’t answered all your questions they would be more than happy to answer any further questions. Great campus overall.
Senior,4,"Large and very nice looking campus with excellent facilities surrounding technology related learning. Very advanced equipment and study in robotics, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Senior and junior projects are highly involved and are paving the way toward new technology. The students are also highly diverse and come from all different kinds of backgrounds. It makes for creative working environments."
Sophomore,4,"Its a great school with a lot of very nice people and a welcoming community. They offer a lot of majors to choose from and the counselors were very helpful when I was switching my major and unsure what to do. Fort Collins' location isn't the best considering how flat and far away from the mountains it is for a place in Colorado. The town, however, is a ton of fun with a bunch of places to go and things to do."
Freshman,4,Colorado State University has extended countless opportunities to me in just the short amount of time that I have been on campus. The administration ensures that every single student feels like they have a chance to be a part of something bigger and something that interests them. I was completely blown away by the amount of genuinely great people willing to offer a hand to help you find a place.
Sophomore,4,I would love to see Financial Aid change to be more helpful. The school in general is fine with great advisors.
Niche User,4,My experience at the Colorado State university has been nothing but pleasant ever since I walked on to campus. There is a very diverse community there and its a very welcoming community. The people are very nice and helpful. I felt so at home there. There is a range of thing to there and you are never bored.  They facility is also very nice and equipped with ever thing you need to be successful.
Niche User,4,"I had a great time at CSU! I enjoyed my major classes better than I enjoyed many of the core classes, but that is to be expected. Even though it was a big university, I felt accepted here and the campus is absolutely gorgeous!"
Freshman,4,Colorado State University has an amazing campus with beautiful scenery. The academics are pretty good and there are resources all over campus to help in any way possible. The only reason to not give this institution the full 5 stars is due to the lack of diversity on campus.
Freshman,4,"Dream Come True. I have wanted to attend CSU since I was in 8th grade, and it is truly all I ever thought it would be."
Junior,4,"CSU is great mostly for the location.  Fort Collins is a great town with a thriving environment for college students.  Rent is high, but the college is worthwhile especially for anyone going for an engineering degree or other STEM field.  People are lining up to offer you a job for STEM and CSU is well worth the investment for those fields."
Freshman,4,"Colorado State University is a great choice for college. The academics are great, and if someone wants to study a major here,  there are many resources available to help make that happen. The campus life is great and very inclusive."
Junior,4,"While there may be some flaws at CSU and room for improvement, overall my experience here has been great. I have made many wonderful friends and has many wonderful opportunities."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the people and environment at CSU. The teachers are generally helpful if you make an effort to talk to them. It is very easy to balance school and activities in order to really enjoy the college experience. They have many clubs and activities one can join as well as, fun people attending the school. There are many resources for any problems a student could have and an all around supportive community. Fort Collins is a very fun town with many events to be a part of and is very easy to commute via bike."
Junior,2,"Do not go here. The administration is corrupt. The buildings have asbestos in them and the university refuses to do anything about it. I have never seen an institution where professors care less than they do at Colorado State University. They are not willing to help you, and you are very on your own. If you go here, you're paying for a worthless degree that you can wipe your butt with and that's about it."
Freshman,2,"Probably the worst decision i have made in my entire life. As a minority, I face serious social issues here at csu. People here are nothing more than stuck up suburbans. If i knew i would be coming to a large high school, i would’ve stayed in michigan. Biggest waste of time AND money. Cannot wait to get out of this hell hole second semester."
Freshman,2,"This school is not a challenge academically, and to be honest, not fun either. There is a very limited range of activities available; drinking, being an a**hole, and staying in your crappy, air-conditioning-less dorm all day. I came here to have fun, and achieve in school, and I have had no fun, and am paying an absurd amount for middle school-level classes. Wish i never wasted my time"
Sophomore,2,my first year there was super weird honestly. a lot of little hate crimes happening and I was also very homesick which made my experience a lot tougher ):
Senior,2,"There is a ridiculous amount of construction and the school doesn't seem to care what the students want (or don't want aka the monstrous stadium on campus). The academics are not that challenging and a lot of the professors don't care. The campus is ok, but not very nice compared to anything on the east coast."
Freshman,2,"It's a local school, so most people here are from Colorado. The dorms are awful and the weekends here are dead because most people go home. My clothes were stolen out of the dryer, the dorm food has made me sick,  and the campus is in the middle of nowhere. Won't be returning next semester."
College Junior,2,"I found my internship on my own, not with the help of the career center.  After experiencing the demands of real life vs. what college provides, I realized that going to college was a huge waste of money.  The value of the degree is low if you consider it by what you get over what you pay."
College Junior,2,You definitely do not get what you pay for.  I would recommend not going to college and self education to build a personal portfolio to impress potential employers.
College Sophomore,2,I really disliked living in the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"From what I have seen, people join Greek life to make friends and be invited to huge parties, not join for the purpose of community service projects. The prices are outrageous and it turns a lot of people away. Non-Greeks don't really notice those who are in Greek life, but some stand out and do not look approachable."
College Freshman,2,"A vegan, a crossfit athlete, and a CSU Tri-Delta pledge walk into a bar. Everybody there knows because they've already told everyone. Hardly anyone does Greek life here, but those that do never let you hear the end of it."
College Student,2,"I really don't much care for the athletics in the school, and don't think they are important, so i wouldn't know much."
College Sophomore,2,Too strict. I am dropping Gamma Phi Beta due to hazing.
College Sophomore,2,I did not rush a sorority but my suite mates did. Both decided not to pledge do to cost and time commitments. I prefer to have a wider range of friends and activities in college. I also work and participate in a club sports so I really don't have the time.
College Senior,2,"I have friends who have gone to parties here and gotten drugged, it's really scary, but the important think is to be careful and stay with friends"
College Senior,2,"I feel like this is such a big school it is hard to find your place here. Classes are huge, and the professors don't really make an effort to know anyone"
College Senior,2,They are very rude to people who are not in Greek life.
College Junior,2,"I would never choose my school again, nor would I recommend it. 

The university president refers to himself as ""President Frank""... barf. Sorry, Obama.

We get the e-mail that since the budget is just so tight, our tuition is going up by 5%. In the meantime, CSU built/is building an ENTIRE NEW CAMPUS IN MEXICO. And if that wasn't enough, they are crippling an entire indigenous population and decimating a whole beach front to do it. The epitome of earth-friendly, eh?

Parking passes are 450$. Enough said.

The university does not listen to the students. No one supports or wants the new multi-million dollar stadium they are building, yet they are pushing forward despite massive student, community, and alumni opposition.

The school buildings and classrooms are falling apart and practically fossilizing. But no budget for that nonsense - we have an unwanted stadium to build!

More than anything I find the lack of integrity and utter lack of effort to even moderately disguise the greed running rampant throughout the university just deplorable."
College Sophomore,2,It's basically a giant hassle and you won't get the amount of aid you need to survive at the school.
College Freshman,2,"The advice on receiving financial aid was practically non-existent for me. I had a 3.98 GPA, and yet I received such small financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,The social atmosphere of these dorms is extremely damaging to students. It is not as welcoming as the rest of the campus is.
College Freshman,2,"There's no amount of ""strictness"" at my school."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, the quality of the dining hall food isn't that bad.  However, it's very unhealthy and the lack of nutritional options and repetitiveness of the food they do offer is disappointing."
College Freshman,2,"One way or the other, you're going to get a ticket your first year here. Whether it's from the bike police, being busted for alcohol, or being busted for smoking, you'll pay a fine. Parking enforcement LOVES to hand out tickets. However, if you keep it down and to yourself, there will be little problems."
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, CSU is suitably lenient and reasonable about enforcing rules and administrating policies. However, their parking policies and enforcement are outrageous. The smallest infractions are punished with large fines, and it seems like the police are out en force to leech money from people who are already very low on money. It's ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,I received a scholarship for a pretty solid academic record that was rather small. Other schools gave me much larger scholarships (that were also larger percentages of my tuition) but CSU still ended up being cheaper. The scholarship was much smaller than expected.
College Senior,2,"The opportunity to apply for scholarships are a hit or miss...I only received the opportunity ONCE in my 4 years at CSU. It's not just a thing any student can apply for, it has to be done through a student website and the link is not visible; only if you are 'randomly chosen'.  

 Other sites such as FastWeb or Niche do offer scholarships, but the scholarships they offer are unfortunately, only listed through CSU and all list that they are for CSU. Other scholarships have such a wide range of applicants it's like winning the lottery. It's makes it very, very hard for students who work their way through school, especially older students such as myself who do not receive any familial aid."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports aren't very big here, you go to the Rocky Mountain Showdown and thats about it. Not many people go to the games, like the big schools."
College Freshman,2,I expected to receive a fairly large scholarship because I had very good scores in comparison to other students applying. However I initially received nothing. Upon asking the financial aid office and telling them that recieveing a scholarship would impact my final decision on whether or not I would attend they promptly offered me a fair scholarship. It was not as large as I was hoping for but it was enough to get me here. Another thing to take into consideration is that this is a state school and therefore will not offer as much money to students.
College Sophomore,2,The selection in my area is incredibly bad and the prices are unusually high.
College Senior,2,"You do not come to CSU for varsity sports, although we have a lot of fun IM sports that are pretty popular."
College Senior,2,There are so many students here so scholarships are competitive and not easy to get.
College Senior,2,"The Student gym is great and they have a very nice facilities. However, there are only a handful of teams that are any good and they want to build a new football stadium for a team that has not had a winning season in my lifetime. There are plenty of sports activities around, but the best opportunities are not for conventional sports, but cycling, volleyball and running."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a shortage of taxis in Fort Collins, and there is a limit to other public transportation. If you have a bike there are some great bike trails. The closest airport is Denver International Airport."
College Sophomore,2,"I like it, but there is a lot of whites"
College Junior,2,"Parking after 4pm is a breeze, but if you park for even 5 minutes without paying during the day, you will get ticketed. Very strict. On the other hand, class attendance for undergrad classes is extremely lenient in my department, for the classes I've taken. No attendance is taken, there are very few recitations with required attendance."
College Junior,2,"Unless you're looking for pizza or bad chinese food, there are few options close to campus. Old Town has a lot of nice restaurants, but they are expensive. And on College, there are just tons and tons of chains. As someone who has dietary restrictions (gluten, dairy) it is hard to find many good options expect for Whole Foods or expensive restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of Colorado State University is white males and females. Although not abundant, minorities do make up a decent percentage of the student body. Acceptance of other races is above average and there is much interest from the student body in ethnic/race classes offered by the university."
College Junior,2,There are too few buses for the number of students taking them. Pick up times on some routs are too infrequent and inconvenient.
College Freshman,2,"People often get alcohol poisoning. At some dorms there are ambulances outside almost every night. Peer pressure is very real, it's sad. Policies are strictly enforced. Marijuana is used heavily and I have heard the nick name ""Snort Collins"" in reference to Fort Collins' coke habits."
College Freshman,2,"Expect for dorm parking, there is very little parking space on campus. It's crowded, expensive and just not really worth buying the pass for. It's easier to just park off campus and either walk or bike to class which is usually faster and free but this is only good with good weather."
College Freshman,2,It is very expensive to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Without a car, it is hard to get around town."
College Freshman,2,Walking to class in cold snowy weather is awful.
College Freshman,2,It is to expensive to get a permit.
College Freshman,2,I think the attitude toward Greeks is pretty much the same as at an school in the north- they're there and its fine if you join one but also completely fine if you don't. Small presence on campus but the people who are in it love it and meet great friends. Everyone mixes together pretty well. 
College Sophomore,2,It's really difficult to find food that is low priced that doesn't come from a fast food chain.
College Freshman,2,Varsity sports aren't really that good. People only attend the big games. Sub par turn out at the rest of the games
College Freshman,2,Not much of a variety at all. Basic stuff and a bunch of ag related stuff.
College Freshman,2,"People know financial aid is there, but struggle to find it. "
College Freshman,2," Scholarships  are for those  in at and music,  minorities,  extremely destitute families,  and if you're average but can't pay for college alone,  you're out of luck and deep in debt."
College Freshman,2,"I have had a terrible experience at CSU. While I have made some good friends, and enjoy the organizations I have gotten involved with, I have not had the support I need from the faculty and administration. This school does a fantastic job of taking your money, without giving you the service you deserve in return. I have not had a good experience with the professors or advisers on a personal basis, and have had severe problems with administration in financial aid, housing and dining, and the registrars office. The Health Center has people that don't strike me as people that know what their doing, and are expensive for prescriptions or lab results. The students are inconsiderate and incredibly loud, which effects the sleep and work ethic of students that are here for an education. If you are looking for a school where you can party, this is the school for you. If you are looking for a school with faculty and administration that actually care and want to help you, you better get as far away from CSU as possible. I am looking to transfer as soon as I can, and cannot wait to be done with this school."
College Freshman,2,Its incredibly expensive to park on campus. I park at the university apartments because there was a $200 difference.
College Freshman,2,"The cost of permits are extremely over priced and sometimes it takes a while to find parking.  Although each residence hall has their own parking lot, they are strict in enforcing which lot you need to park in.  "
College Sophomore,2,The snow and ice here can cause for some serious trouble making it to class. With class rooms being vary spread out on campus when there is alot of snow and you can't bike to class it makes it more difficult. 
College Junior,2,"I am not having a very good time here. The staff are mostly nice, but I'm still struggling big time with certain classes and am not getting the proper support I should be. I am way too stressed and over worked to have any fun and I cannot ever seems to catch up with school work like reading. The pace is just too fast and I kind of hate most of the classes and professors I have there and this is only my first semester."
College Freshman,2,"The parking lot in right in front of the dorms, but the problem is that the parking lots are small and there are a lot of kids that bring their cars to school. There were times when the parking lot was full and I had to park at another dorm parking lot and walk back to my dorm. The parking permits are a lot, I think. Unless you have a job off campus then there really is no need to have a car because the bus system is free for full time students and buses come by campus often and can get you just about anywhere in town. A lot of eating and shopping places are within walking distance of campus. Now that I live off campus, I ride the bus to school. I have driven a few times now that they have metered parking on campus so I don't have to buy a parking permit."
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is strict on some things and lenient on others. The take academic dishonesty very seriously as they should, so some penalties are harsh. However they give you 3 repeat delete chances to replace a grade from a previous class."
College Freshman,2,It's average for a campus. They all tend to taste the same after a while.
College Junior,2,"There are different races on campus, however the vast majority are Caucasian."
Niche User,1,"I thouvht it was very unprofessional of the CSu adviser that just called me which it took over a week to get ahold of the. I told her that i have chose another college and she changed her tune. She proceeded to tell me i need to do my research about this college. To me this was a trashy way to get me to change my mind and enroll in csu. After just this one experience tells me i have chosen the other college. I am also 42 years old and am not stupid. Of course i did my research all this was is i chose a rival school in Colorado and that hit a nerve. Not all schools hve good reviews even CSU.My advice train your advisors on professionalism ,integrity and compassion. Most of all common courtesy"
Senior,1,Was told I should be able to graduate 3 different times. Now I owe them 8k and cannot register to complete ONE more credit. NOT HAPPY. WOULD NOT ADVICE ATTENDING THIS COLLEGE. WOULD NOT DO IT AGAIN
Alum,1,"I cannot express how miserable this university has made my life. Debt, starvation, and some of the worst people I have ever met. Don't come here if you're different. People who are different are treated like freaks here. I was. I still am. You'd think I was a normal person by the look of me. I want to burn my diploma. Jerks...

I don't want to pretend like there is an upside. The quality of education is horrendous. It's a self learn situation. A lot of students were getting lectures off YouTube from other universities because no one was teaching the material correctly. Just testing on it. 

If you just want the piece of paper for some job requirement then stay away from others and get in and out. It's your best chance. Don't bother taking any of the science majors. They're filled with go nowhere idiots who have never held a real job in their entire lives. It's the truth too. How can you get prepared for the job market by people who can't jobs themselves?"
Freshman,1,"Day 2. Missed all my classes that day because I had no idea how to get to this "" ARDEC"" farm place. No one said anything about when the bus gets there, when it leaves, or even where it will show up at. I asked around. I asked one of the people at the desk in Westfall Hall, as that was were my dorm was, and all he said was, "" I don't know"". Really? You work there, and you don't know? I had to go to the admin building to get a direct answer. A few day later, one of my professors emailed saying if we didn't sign a form, we weren't allowed to go with the group on a class trip. Thing is, they never gave out a form. The next week she emailed saying we had to write a one page essay on what we learned from the place, even if we weren't there. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING ""WE LEARNED"" IF WE WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO GO??? and that was the last straw. I packed my stuff up and left. I was purposely failed in middle and high school, I wasn't about to be purposely failed in college."
Junior,1,"I literally like nothing about this school except for the Oval and one or two cool teachers I had-and here's why; all this school wants is your money. In short, CSU is a glorified midwest suburban high school with standoffish administrators who seem to forget THEY are the first face new students meet. Multiple rounds of orientation is all a gimmick to lure students in to the ""Ramily."" I never made one single friend at this school; its definitely not the place for someone who wants to meet good people that work hard because this place is filled with social justice warriors (like most universities), but it makes it really uncomfortable for students who just want a normal day at school. I can't believe I've wasted so much time at CSU and haven't applied to other schools yet. I used to like college but CSU has made me hate the whole system down to its core bc they know how valuable a degree is and they just hold it over your head and make you a b#tch for four years."
Niche User,1,Stay away from this school.  All they are is social justice (which doesn't actually exist - there is only JUSTICE) warriors and victims.  They also manage their IT systems so they require your social media logins and passwords to get into their systems.  FAMWeb is the main example.  The State of Colorado needs to investigate constitutional violations at CSU.
Niche User,1,"The college seems almost too good to be true.  The campus is amazing and the academic center of the university is well focused.  However, the admissions office lacks a significant ability to properly guide students applying for residency and in-state tuition.  I moved from Michigan to Colorado and after the fact found out that the three admissions counselors I spoke to between January and moving there in August, neglected to mention the pertinent detail of Residency Orientation."
College Freshman,1,"The money expected in order to join and stay recognized is ridiculous, as well as the treatment before you even start, I don't see the worth in it."
College Freshman,1,The school does not offer any kind of loan or payment plan whatsoever. I did the FAFSA but was awarded very minimal amount because my parents just got divorced and my mom's income went up. I was forced to take out more government loans that I would have liked. Then my own bank would not offer me a loan to cover the rest of the tuition so I went to another bank that was not mine and was able to get a collegiate loan.
College Junior,1,"Greek life separates the greeks from the non greeks, fostering a hostile environment and clearly building social boundaries."
College Sophomore,1,"I was born in Texas, and while living there my parents set me up with the Texas Tomorrow Fund (TTF). After moving to Colorado and being enrolled at CSU, I went into the financial office multiple times, and was forced to push back tuition payment multiple times because CSU would not file my grant into billing. I talked to TTF on several occasions, which they told me they already sent the information to the school a couple times, and were yet to get a response. TTF even went far enough to tell me that they send out information to colleges several times a day, and rarely have as much trouble getting set up with a school as they did with my application."
College Freshman,1,School is run like a business. Taking your money is the first priority.
College Sophomore,1,I do not like the campus food!! It is very unhealthy and not good for you. The provide very cheep food and it is very expensive. The best places to ear is Durell and Brayden hall.
College Sophomore,1,Colorado weather is bipolar. It changes almost daily.
College Sophomore,1,The wireless at Colorado State is horrible. In the dorms it is consistently going out along with the wired internet and you can never count on them working which makes finding homework difficult considering everything is online.
College Senior,1,It's hard to find a spot and very expensive.
College Freshman,1,If your parents make any decent money you don't get any chance to get aid
College Freshman,1,Brace yourself as a freshman. Any party with music will get shutdown by 12. You will walk for miles on weekends in the cold trying to find a party that hasn't been busted. Every once in a while you'll find a good one that will last past 12 but the cops are everywhere.
College Freshman,1,Got nothing! Out of state tuition no financial aid...
College Junior,1,"I was awarded a scholarship upon my acceptance. Despite my grades improving since then, and qualifying me for a better scholarship, I have never received an upgrade for my hard work. Also, I complete the financial aid applications and never receive a thing. "
College Sophomore,1,everybody does it and no one is concerned with consequences
College Sophomore,1,The price is way too high and not sensible for college students. It already costs so much for us to go to school parking should cost so much.
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is a pain  making having a car almost not worth it.
College Junior,1,It is way too expensive to park at Colorado State University. I have to park over a mile away and walk in every day. I hate it. They need to really redo the entire thing and include a charge in our student fees and not charge hundreds of dollars extra for a permit.
College Freshman,1,300 for a year of parking in only certain lots which doesn't even guarantee you a spot near your dorm. It sucks.
College Senior,1,"Greek Life is a joke and only the people involved in Greek Life actually enjoy it (I believe). The Fraternities fulfill their stereotype as the yacht-riding, Sperry wearing, chauvinistic partiers, and the sororities are the women versions of the Fraternities with less brain capacity. If I had to think of the worst way to spend my college career, it would include living under the same roof as 20 other people, restricting my social network to buy my friends, and partying my days away with people who have no real interest in my being. Also, if you're not in a Frat or Sorority, you will never be able to attend their events."
College Freshman,1,"It's okay at first, but after a while of eating the same stuff over and over again it gets old."
College Freshman,1,"The cost for parking on campus is crazy, and half the time it's difficult to find one spot to park in. There are so many people at this school it is a nightmare to find a single spot to park in."
College Senior,1,"parking is horrible, especially if you do not have a parking pass, which costs several hundred dollars to purchase."
College Sophomore,1,"First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing or are kicked out. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to not to be obnoxious about it."
College Junior,1,CSU has many computer labs all created for different colleges. For example I can only use the Business lab because I am a Business major. This makes it easy to always find a computer when I am in the lab but it is unfortunate that you have to travel to your own computer lab. The wireless internet is unreliable and slow.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is terrible. Very expensive, and its hard to find a place you don't have to walk at least 20 minutes from. Park off campus, it's free and you have to walk just as far."
College Sophomore,1,No parking is free during school hours. Unless you have a parking pass or are there at 6-7AM and don't leave campus don't expect to have a space on campus.
College Junior,1,Bike Police – Campus is very strict regarding bikes. You must obey all of the street rules and register your bike with the police department or else you will get assessed fines. I have been pulled over many times for not obeying street signs.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Needs Improvement – There is a wide acceptance of different backgrounds, beliefs, sexual orientation etc. on the CSU campus but unfortunately there is not that much diversity. 
However, the school is trying hard to recruit more people from different backgrounds outside of the white middle-class."
College Freshman,1,"Not Awesome – Since it's a state school, there aren't a lot of scholarships to give out. I had a 3.9 GPA and a 29 ACT and didn't get any money in scholarships, which I think really sucks."
College Junior,1,"Not Informative – Although I was connected to an amazing financial aide counselor and took me under her wing. In general, I feel each and ever school should be more informative.  Especially when it comes down to the Adult learner we have different and possibly more financial need then the Traditional student. I'm struggling this semester, hoping next Fall will be better. 
Call and request talking to your financial aide counselor in person.  Ask to increase your budget if needed.  Financial Aide does not take into account if you have dependents.  They expect you to live off of what they project is enough for you not your family."
College Freshman,1,Night Life – Night life here isn't to exciting for me. The club scenery is very boring and not my style. The parties here get shut down before 12 so there is really no night life. A lot of the parties are full of white boys playing ping pong rather than a party full of people dancing or diversity.
College Junior,1,I don't receive any financial aid besides students loans even though I am financially dependent I do not qualify for any support because I am under 24 and still considered a dependent of my parents. I pay and work for everything I need and do not receive financial help from my parents. There needs to be more financial help for students like me who truly need it especially when there are students getting so much financial aid they can afford a down payment on a car.
College Freshman,1,"Internet Is Great Except in Dorms – The internet connection in the dorms isn't very good. It requires that you log in every time you turn on your computer, which is frustrating by itself, but then most of the time it doesn't connect or takes a really long time to do so."

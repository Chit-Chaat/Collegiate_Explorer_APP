Sophomore,5,"I actually did pretty well online, I took zoom for one of my classes in the morning which at first I wasn't used to it, but overtime I adjust to it and I was still able to learn. Though, to be honest I still prefer face to face for some classes I take like for example, French 122. But overall, I still miss hanging out with friends in one of my classes and be social,."
Sophomore,5,"Seattle Central College is my favorite school to attend, The teachers are amazing and my classmates are so welcoming and friendly that I loved it more than Highschool. I was nervous at first because it was my first year in college and I expect to stressful and strict since this is my final school and it supposed to help you in life. But over time, I learned a lot and become more independent and more knowledgeable which gave me more motivation to keep moving forward to my dream as a therapist"
Freshman,5,"Seattle Central is a great community College that offers a variety of programs and courses. I'm looking forward to apply into their Dental Hygiene Program in which is a field that I always wanted to do growing up. Not only that Seattle Central offers that program, but they offer it as a Bachelor degree. It is a hard field to get into, so it's a relief that the school offers many tutoring sessions and programs on campus that will help students to succeed their courses. The professors show care about their students success in their class that they are willing to work with students who are struggling during office hours or in class."
Sophomore,5,I liked the location of the campus. Very accessible. My favorite part about SCC is the diversity it contains.
Sophomore,5,"With the new transition to online and remote services, the registration office was very attentive and helpful when it came to helping me register for school and how to transfer all of my work from previous schools. The registration for classes was very easy and the time commitment was very straight forward. I appreciated how easy it was to get a hold of someone when I had questions or needed help."
Sophomore,5,Registering for my classes was very easy and degree requirements were very easy to access even without the help of an academic advisor.
Junior,5,I am a student in the respiratory care program. Our instructors are incredibly passionate and are working RTs.
Sophomore,5,One of my favorite parts about Seattle Central College is that is has a very diverse student body. They have teachers who genuinely care about their students.
Junior,5,I am current student of this college. This is my third years in prerequisite program of dental hygiene. I love this school because I feel the friendly and warmth from all people in school bring for me. Teachers or staff here were excellent and always welcome students. I get a knowledge and feel like a big family when I am in school.
Senior,5,Seattle Central changed my life for the better. I went to UW and graduated and wish I went straight to SCC instead. Cant wait to be the nurse Ive always wanted to be. Grateful to be a student there.
Junior,5,"Amazing!
I've completed 1 quarter so far and since day 1 I have loved the staff and atmosphere. The school is accepting of all individuals and the staff takes pride in student success. Proud to be apart of the Dental Hygiene program!"
Sophomore,5,The urban campus offers plenty of diversity with its student population along with the easy access to public transportation by way of the light rail.  The proximity of this urban campus to the Greater Seattle area makes it a desirable choice for those that rely on public transportation.
Sophomore,5,"Good place for an AA. Chemistry classes are extremely difficult. Smart staff. No housing, no school community."
Freshman,5,I love Seattle Central community college. It is super diverse and the teachers are really good and help us a lot. I am learning a lot here
Sophomore,5,"Great school with flexibility, large course options, and centrally located campus. Right in the heart of Seattle."
Junior,5,The small classrooms and friendly faculty allow any student to feel welcome at Seattle Central.  Classes are set up to prepare you for transfer to just about any college.  The college offers a wide range of courses to fit any kind of student.
Sophomore,5,I love how informative the teachers are! And I love all the staff that helps me so much. I learned Abot a subject that was so hard for me- humanities! I love this school
Freshman,5,"This is has been my first college and it was the best experience i have had so far. I am in my 20's and did not go to college right away after high school,but i ended up enrolling 5 years later and i have never felt so comfortable learning. My English Teacher Mrs.McClanahan is such a powerful and motivated speaker that she has helped me sharpen my writing and english skills. I was that kid who sat in the back and acted like  a clown, but going to this college and being with a huge diversity of people has changed my motive especially since there is a lot of running start students that want to graduate or go for a degree. It is truly the best choice i have ever done . The staff and advisor's are super helpful not to mention our on-campus security."
Niche User,5,Everyone is very helpful and supportive of my status of an adult student. The administrative and support staff for the program I am interested in have been nothing but amazing.
Freshman,5,I am currently a Seattle Central College student and I enjoy being at this school. This school has many resources to help students succeed in school. There are many places where students can sit and study and do homework. No changes at this time needed.
Freshman,5,Seattle Central is a very diverse and comfortable setting! The teachers really want to see you succeed and all the admin is so kind!
Freshman,5,"I love this school because of it's authenticity, helpful employees, diversity, and passionate instructors. It's noticeable that the school is dedicated to creating a safe and positive learning environment for every single person."
Sophomore,5,"Seattle Central College is an excellent college, the students in the school are full of energy and friendly. I always can see the library is full of students, and they put all their effort in their study. Also when I go to a class, some out-going students will say hi to me although we don't know each other. Students never have to worry about asking questions to professors, they will help you solve the problems patiently. And teachers in ESL are nice, it is easy to be their friends during the class time, but ESL teachers are so tired because they have to spend more time than college professors. Hope students can learn better, and better to not fail the classes. The life in Seattle Central College are awesome too. The gym has entire utilities, and the cafeteria has numbers of food from different countries. Also the utilities for Art students and Lab students are wonderful too."
Sophomore,5,"Seattle Central College has been a very pleasant experience thus far. The professors are knowledgable, the peers are friendly and helpful, and the location is excellent. It's near a lot of great restaurants and most importantly, near plenty of transportation to make the access much easier."
Junior,5,"As a first generation college student, I felt unsure what to expect entering Seattle Central College. Navigating the college system can be confusing and students at various colleges always spoke of being unsure of their path to their education goals and not having much help from their college to answer their questions. My experience with Seattle Central College from my first quarter until now, my 7th quarter, has left me feeling confident and empowered in my education decisions. At every opportunity I have found someone willing to help whether that be directing me to a class I had difficulties finding to offering input into what classes would make me a more competitive applicant to 4 year colleges. The library faculty is helpful and available for questions and guidance on essays and research. I feel confident that I am a better student and will be successful post transfer because of my strong start at Seattle Central."
Freshman,5,During my time here I had great teachers and had access to many helpful resources that made the experience work really well. My only complaint would be the time it takes to process paperwork and some of the directions on how to apply for financial aid were not clear. Other than that it was great.
Freshman,5,"It was very diverse with good teachers. Great location, good atmosphere. I learned a good deal while attending and the gym the provided to students was also pretty awesome."
Alum,5,I liked Seattle Central because they offered alternatives to a normal High school environment and helped me graduate on time. My classes were more diverse and smaller ensuring a more pleasant environment and attentiveness to my success.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Its a accredited school, so learn alot of knowledges and hands on"
Recent Alumnus,5,The best for this school. Great experience and short amount of time and easy to get job after.
College Junior,5,"Teachers who have at least two of the same course per quarter, will let you set in on the other class, if needed/  Also teachers have great office hours and work with you to find a time to meet."
College Junior,5,"There are great interfaces that make it easy to connect with other students,  Teachers also have real time office hours which makes it easy to have a face to face conversation"
College Junior,5,"Most teachers have at least 2 of the classes, at different times per quarter,  If you can't make your official class time, the professors will let you set in in the other.  Most professors have great office hours and usually can work with your time frame as well."
College Junior,5,"The professors mostly hold Ph.D's in their area of teaching, many still;l work in their current filed of expertise making the information you learn current and relevant.  The class sizes are between 20 - 30 students allowing lots of interaction with the professors and students.  The school also uses many PC based programs for Math assignments and testing as well as canvas, an internet based system for teachers to post assignments, grades, lectures and allows students to work at home as well as, in the classroom."
College Junior,5,"The College is located in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, the most diverse in Washington state. Many of the professors are also working in their field of expertise, therefore most classes are up to date and you are learning about current trends and ideas.  Not only is the teaching staff very diverse, the student body is comprised of many nationalities, religions, handicaps and genders.  You can learn so much from your classmates.  I never thought a community college would be so educational.  I thought it would just be a place to get through my general requirements.  It has turned out to be so much more."
College Junior,5,Everyone is helpful in school
College Junior,5,My teachers helped me a lot
Recent Alumnus,5,"My experience with the courses I took thus far has been really interesting as far as classrooms. The classrooms vary in size from big to small, sometimes if too many students applies for the same class and its over populated they move it to a bigger classroom to fit as many students as possible. However, professors are very dynamic and come from all different backgrounds and cultures and traditions they follow and it can be really interesting sometimes getting to know your professor on a personal level and getting to reslly understand why they colse to teach a certain class ect. In addition, the courses at Central are very wide ranged from LGBTQ equality course classes to Hip Hop courses."
College Junior,5,Career prospects are booming as Seattle is such a tech savvy place.  Students are getting picked out before they graduate the program.  Next year is looking good for me career wise.
College Junior,5,"Alumni network is amazing, job prospects are looking up.  Employers are seeking out students in my program when they graduate."
College Junior,5,"My curriculum, instructors, overall experience has been fantastic.  I am surrounded and learning from some of the best. Workload is insane, but I love the challenge."
College Junior,5,There is a lot of diversity and clubs at Seattle Central. There is always something going on in the hallways around campus. Lots of opportunities to get involved as well.
College Junior,5,"This school contains an extremely significant percentage of international students. The largest international cultural group  present in this school is the Asian group, next most notable is the African group, then maybe Middle Eastern. These are just my estimates from attending school. I really enjoy being submersed in a student body of varying cultures and backgrounds, it is a valuable experience and will help to develop my professional attitude on international relations."
College Junior,5,I have learned so much through Seattle community colleges and I'm extremely grateful for such a great and involved college system in my city.
College Freshman,5,Very generous with financial aid
College Junior,5,this program one of the best in the nation and our equipment shows and fantastic faculty 
College Senior,5,"sources were great the library was amazing they always had people to help you, same goes with the library center and the tutoring center."
Recent Alumnus,5,Great location surrounded by Broadway/Capitol Hill businesses.
Recent Alumnus,5,Private lessons with instrumental and composing teachers are available at very affordable rates.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Well equipped library, no problems so far."
College Sophomore,5,"I will be starting my Web Design program this coming school year, and I feel pretty excited about it. I love how the program is only 2 years and after that you can venture out into the career world! The school site gives you a set curriculum to follow if you want to finish within a 2 years. But the school does allow you to go over a few years because of their understanding on how busy our lives are. Also because they know that some of us can't really afford that much credits at one time. From what I hear from my fellow students, the IT program is one of the most successful programs in the school, and I feel pretty special and accomplished for even making such a decision!"
College Senior,5,I love the people I've met and taken classes with.
College Sophomore,5,"The financial aid process is easy to follow. Also, at the end of the taxable year sccc has a scholarship available (if you qualify) to receive back some of the amount you or who ever is paying for your school money back."
College Sophomore,5,"Student body is extremely diverse. The student body is very involved in the school, and most people seem to really enjoy the atmosphere there. I really like that there's people from all over the world at my college. It gives you a different aspect on things."
College Junior,5,The school has been amazingly helpful in both funding my education and in helping me navigate different financial aid forms.
College Senior,5,The computer program in my school is fine. There is no problems to use the computer at school. and one thing I really like about my school's computer lab is that they have perfect amount of computers. so everyone can work there very comfortably.
College Junior,5,library is great with plenty of books to choose from. Pretty much everything you need
College Senior,5,"I am pursuing a major in kinesiology/exercise science. I have had to take a lot of classes unrelated to my intended major because I must also fulfill all the requirements needed to earn my AA degree. The classes I'm taking that directly relate to my major are very challenging, but equally rewarding. The teachers push for a lot of hands on work in the class room. We are tested both on our memorization of the material and our ability to correctly apply it."
College Sophomore,5,There is an amazing diversity of students at this college from all places of the world. You can talk to a person from a different culture everyday if you choose to.
College Freshman,5,"This is only my second quarter at the school, but so far I have had no problems getting into the classes I needed with the professors I preferred.   It takes me about an hour to get to school every day and I was able to get all the classes I needed at times that were convenient for me."
Freshman,4,"I have not done any required online class sessions. However, my friends had expressed to me that they really enjoy taking online classes as it is a convenience to their work and personal life schedule."
Sophomore,4,"I'm not a fan of online learning but Seattle central college professors managed to teach the materials. I didn't face a lot of struggles, I didn't have a hard time learning the material."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve been in Seattle central college as a part time student for about two years and still counting. My first experience was an okay experience but I’m glad that I took the right classes for my major. Most professors know what they’re position and knowledge and some still don’t know their place or getting used to how teaching students from different places and different ages. It was a struggle for me to maintain my grades due to working full time.I enjoyed studying and making new friends, there were so many places in the building I could study. The MAC is where all SCC students go and enjoy what they like to be productive in their own way. There Is one change I want the school to realize, I believe the advisors can be more helpful in a way to find pathways for the student and to be considerate of their actions instead of choosing the fast way to graduate early and still have to take more classes after considering what major to take."
Junior,4,I love this college. The staffs here are very nice and the size of the classroom is good for study environment.
Junior,4,"The online learning is ok, need to give more tools to access online learning. For example, giving out computers or access to wifi."
Sophomore,4,"Instructors are very understanding and thoughtful, but the way of communication on Zoom is not so sufficient to transmit the lecture."
Niche User,4,"Online learning is difficult because each teacher has there own method, some use canvas some use wamap and some use connect but I think this is mostly due to COVID-19 and not an issue with the teachers. I feel like I get a lot more from in-person class. The teachers have been responsive though."
Niche User,4,"It was very good, I enjoyed the diversity as well as quality teaching. The biology classes I took there were fantastic and the price is unbeatable. There were teachers who were very passionate about what there were doing and there was true diversity."
Junior,4,I think safety is overall good however I think it can be improved around the main campus. It is such a central location there is always so much going around the school.
Freshman,4,"SCC is a great college with amazing and friendly professors and stuff. The classes are interactive, the professors are understanding, and there is a great diversity of students, so no one will feel strange in SCC. There are variety of clubs that can help you connect with people you share interest with. You can easily find amazing restaurants around the campus. Great library and different tutor centers you can ask for help for almost every class. There is a MAC center for athletic and other sport activities including pool, gym, basketball, and other sport activities. It is located in a great location for transportation. However, as the college has many students, the campus gets busy all the time , and it doesn't have enough space to hold all this students."
Niche User,4,"The college is very easy to commute to by the Light Rail which is very convenient and the neighborhood it is located in is nice. Professors at the college are caring and supportive of your education, offering tons of help during office hours. However, some professors can be more strict than others so looking them up beforehand will give you more of an idea of what the class will be like."
Sophomore,4,"Welcoming students and a prime location. If you're tired of being enrolled at a stuffy, overpriced college, this is a wonderful school and I guarantee you'll love it!"
Freshman,4,"They post a lot of opportunities to join clubs and variety of different way to get involved with leaderships, socializing, and learning around the school."
Niche User,4,"I like that Seattle Central has the most options of classes out of the Seattle Colleges. Most of the professors I've had have been very experienced and knowledgeable, however, there have been unfortunate classes where the professor is not up to my expectations."
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse place, which was totally helpful. I like being a part of the diversity.  I like teachers and opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"As a running start student at Seattle Central College, I really like the environment as there are lots of food shops around. The teachers at Central can be either good or bad. Some things I enjoy there is that it is affordable and there are lots of people around that can help you, you just need to seek them out. Some things I dislike there is that some teachers don't care about there jobs, and the environment at central is sketchy near the park as there have been shootings there before."
Sophomore,4,"The reason I like Seattle Central as a college is due to their kind and understanding staff, and useful resources such as the learning center and writing center. The teachers are relatively helpful and want to see you succeed, rather than see a student struggle and not pass their class. I would like to see Seattle Central include sports programs, and or inter-mural sports so the students can become more engaged with their peers and staff,"
Niche User,4,"Seattle Central College is located in Capitol Hill in Seattle. It's surrounded  by plenty of amazing restaurants from many different cultures. The college has students from all walks of life, which gives one the opportunity to enrich their social experience. Many international students attend but they are, unfortunately, quite difficult to interact with. As with almost every college, it is hard to judge the professors as a whole because everyone's experience really depends on the ones they get. Personally, most of my professors have a wealth of knowledge to share with their students and are very accessible."
Freshman,4,"Overall I am having a positive experience so far with Seattle Central College as a first-year student. I haven't started my classes yet, but all of the staff have been extremely helpful in making sure I have everything I need to be successful. I do think the financial aid process could be a little more updated/integrated into their online website, but overall I would highly recommend this college to any student, but especially returning students. The campus itself feels very welcoming and is easy to navigate."
Niche User,4,"Small but useful campus

Was there as a running star student and felt very accepted by others around me"
Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience with Seattle Central. I am currently living in a state work release facility, and coming here to aquire an education is one of the best things I could of done. The professors are amazing and the students are also helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Very accessible for continuing students with day jobs. Small class sizes. Good instructors. Poor, outdated facilities. Limited programs and staffing. Should work with the state government to be tuition-free if they want to actually provide equitable opportunity."
Freshman,4,"As an international student who started his program in Fall 2018, I consider Seattle Central College to be an adequate starting point for people in need of a landmark, who want to have an idea of what kind of career they would like to follow. 

This college provides general 2-years programs that are flexible enough to leave a student the freedom to customize them to their liking while gaining a better idea of what interest them. The admission is pretty easy and the tuition, even for out-of-state students, is rather affordable. Furthermore, the location is advantageous as it is in Downtown Seattle.

In terms of characteristics, it provides the resources and assistance necessary for students to thrive and develop their student life successfully. Some of these are the cafeteria, the computer lab, the local bookstore, and even the activity center among others. 

Even if some teachers can have a peculiar learning system, the atmosphere is pleasant enough and the education appropriate."
Niche User,4,"What I love about Central is the amount of diversity at this school, and I don't just mean race and ethnicity. Here at Central, we have groups of people of all different ages and identities. There are a plentiful of students like me who are running start students so we are on the younger side, while there may be people who are in their late 50s or even their 60s! I find it really cool that the school accepts people no matter their background or identity. I wouldn't say that I am entirely safe at this school as it is on Capitol Hill, but I have never been threatened or put into danger which I am tons thankful for."
Niche User,4,"All staff have been friendly and open, understanding, and helpful.  The location of the campus is right in Capitol Hill, a neighborhood with lots of restaurants and coffee shops of all types.  The rent in the area near campus is kinda high, but the campus isn't spread out all over the place so getting to your next class is very easy."
Sophomore,4,"Seattle Central is a good place to go before transferring to a 4 year. Professors are hit or miss, but the location and cost makes up for it. Classes are pretty limited compared to North or Bellevue College, so keep that in mind. Facilities are decent and well-maintained."
Junior,4,"I have had nothing but positive experiences and achievements with this institutions. The teachers and staff have been incredibly helpful and I will always cherish the friendships I have made. My only complaint is that the area is not always the safest, especially at night. Always need a buddy or some form of legal protection."
Sophomore,4,I attand seattle central for the pass 3 years and I had good experience. There are different type of color ( people from different country).
Niche User,4,"The professors are so passionate and willing to help you succeed. I enjoyed my 3 years here and it has helped get me ready for university/college life, I will never forget where I started."
Freshman,4,"I would like them to be more helpful toward international students. Seattle Central CC is one of the most diverse in the area, and the one with the highest number of exchange students: I think they should improve their services to help international students integrate and get involved in the community."
Sophomore,4,The teachers at this school will really go above and beyond to make sure you are successful here. Extremely helpful and open for counseling and assistance.
Sophomore,4,"When I started at Seattle Central College in the fall of 2016, I didn't know what to expect. I graduated high school a few months prior and I was anxious to see the opportunities college would give me. 

There are a couple of things I like about Seattle Central College. One thing is, the small classroom sizes. Being in a class with about  20-30 students makes it a lot easier for me to focus and learn. Another thing I like about Seattle Central College is the location of the school. The light rail train that is about two minutes from my home, goes straight to Seattle Central College. That makes my commute to Seattle Central College really easy. However, there are a lot of homeless people that live right next to the school. That can make safety a problem for some students. 

Overall, I think Seattle Central College is a good school, with a lot of good things to offer. In my years at Seattle Central College, I've met some good students and some good professors."
Freshman,4,"Seattle central is a small peaceful college. The cafeteria in school is expensive, but we have a lot of choices near school."
Freshman,4,"It's my first year. I have yet to truly be invoked in anything there yet as I start my course in the Fall. So far, I like the environment and everyone has been helpful that works there. I also like how diverse and small the campus is."
Sophomore,4,"I love this college, It is inviting and a part of Seattle's History. There are so many amazing programs to pick from and the choice in classes is phenomenal. I love the culture that you will find while attending this school. It is in a ""hip"" part of town and is always busy. Although we don't have dorms or a sports team, this school is great for people who are just starting out in college as well as returning students later in life. The atmosphere is calm yet you can tell that there is an air of busy minds all around you. Great choice of schools for several different lifestyles."
Freshman,4,"professors are very much a mixed bag. About a third are AMAZING a third meh and a third AWFUL. You can tell that they almost always try but they don't always succeed. Fellow students come from all backgrounds and are diverse racially, geographically, age-wise(I had one class with an age range from 15 yo-60yo), and in income/class. Good campus culture. People are generally friendly. Great location with excellent proximity to transit (better than even UW). overall, four out of five stars."
Sophomore,4,Great location for food and a great selection of courses. It's been easy for me to choose classes with my intended major
Freshman,4,I really like Seattle Central College. They have a very nice variety of teachers and classes as well as a lot of people from different countries and identities
Niche User,4,I like the school it was clean. the class sizes were small and the teachers were friendly....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Graduate Student,4,Seattle Central College not only has enabled my education experience. I learned a lot about myself and the community that surrounded me. I am honored to have graduated from a great local school that helped me learn about myself.
Alum,4,"It's a nice school. Most professors are there to help you if you show interest in learning. Many people transfer from Central to the University of Washington, which I believe is harder to get in if one applies as a freshman."
Freshman,4,"Seattle Central is a large neighborhood school. Progressive, inclusive and diverse. The real experience of this part of Seattle's many aspects lives here. Its extraordinary to have many different people learning together and benefiting from each other. I also appreciate how connected this school is with the state universities who many of us will eventually transfer to. To have an affordable community college that truly prepares you to compete with university students is nothing short of a blessing."
College Junior,4,the staff make everything easy to understand and easy to follow through with. they are very flexible.
College Junior,4,you can register for classes easily and the class sizes are much smaller making in easy to communicate with professors.
College Junior,4,there are several options for post grad at our school. Soon they will be expanding some of their programs.
College Junior,4,many of the professors are great. There is a wider range in diversity in the professors which is awesome.
College Junior,4,many careers to choose from. The staff at school are very helpful to the students
College Junior,4,Program is heavy in the work load but the program is well organized.
College Junior,4,Very diverse school. Great location. Good professors.
College Senior,4,The class sizes are a perfect! I've developed personal relationship with my favorite professors.
College Junior,4,"A degree from this school is crucial for the next steps one wants to make, either getting a professional job afterwards or transferring to a four year college."
College Junior,4,I have not yet started my first classes.
College Junior,4,"So far, so great. I have gotten a great amount of help with financial aid and signing up for classes from administrators who know exactly what they are doing. The administrators are very patient and helpful to all situations. This school has a unique variety of diversity; it really allows you to feel comfortable in this environment and be who you are."
College Sophomore,4,Advisors are very helpful with figuring out a plan of action when you desire to transfer.
College Sophomore,4,Professors take learning very seriously and are very skilled. Class sizes are not too big.
College Sophomore,4,Seattle Central is a great school to begin with if you want to transfer to UW.
College Sophomore,4,The science facilities are great & I truly feel like I'm being set up for success when I transfer to university.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the location of the school, and I love that it doesn't have the blase community college feel that some schools can. I trust that the staff and faculty are taking my education as seriously as I am."
College Junior,4,"There is a very large career services center as well as a large transfer department.  As many professors also work in their current field of teaching, they sometime let students know about jobs, internships or volunteer positions within their own company"
College Junior,4,"There are many job fairs on campus.  I believe many students transfer from my school into top rated colleges such as University of Washington, Notre Dame and my dream transfer school Yale.  The school also offers many study abroad programs"
Niche User,2,"Online experience is okay. I cannot say much because there is not much to compare to. When covid19 just started some of the courses obviously were undertaught, online classes were shorter than they're supposed to be; computer lab fees were never reimbursed as well."
Sophomore,2,"Even though I'm not qualified for fafsa on paper, I have my own story and reason for that. I thought I had done well enough in school, but when I applied for my school's foundation scholarship and told them the story, I still got rejected for no reason. I've been through a tough time during this pandemic, and the cold attitude from this college makes me feel frustrated."
Graduate Student,2,"Advisors are not helpful. In addition to that most of professors are not knowledgeable enough. The only great professor is Mr.Hubert, who taught Econ."
College Junior,2,"I have a quarter of zeroes on my transcript that have nothing to do with me that they won't fix, which damages scholarship opportunities. I cannot get into Phi Theta Kappa as a result, even though I'm a Dean's List and President's List student. This is the tip of the iceberg; while some staff are remarkably helpful and will forever have my gratitude, for the most part the administrative staff are a nightmare, and you will have to fight to get through this school unscathed by them."
College Sophomore,2,"This is a difficult question. I am a single woman who lives by herself. So, I tend to over-work myself. It can be difficult to balance all facets of my life.  But-worth it."
College Junior,2,"If you can afford a better school go for it.  The advisers are often rude and unhelpful.  And while some of the teaching staff is excellent, many of the professors are terrible and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a classroom."
College Junior,2,The human services department is filled with middle aged heterosexual woman who are burned out and lack creativity and engagement in the teaching process.  Many of the staff are not current on the latest research in the chemical dependency field and they have very narrow awareness of social justice issues.  The awareness of GLBTQ issues is abysmal in this department which is quite ironic considering their location.  If you can afford another option than take it because the human services dept. at this school is not very competent.
College Junior,2,"This is an underfunded community college, the library does a great job for having a small budget, they need to re-open the swimming pool.  The computer lab is usually quiet crowded and the woman with the Russian accent that works their is really a nasty piece of work."
College Junior,2,It's hard to interact with the students there because there isn't really anything connecting you other than the fact that you go to school together.
College Sophomore,2,I wish there was more instructions given so that I knew exactly what the instructor was looking for.
College Senior,2,"compare to another community college close to mine, they have more art program, bigger space, and more supplies. "
College Senior,2,"I'm an art major student and a lot of time I don't feel like the school can help me with it. Not a lot of option for art classes, and the advisor does not know how to help me.   "
College Senior,2,I included what I have to say in the other section referring to computer labs.
College Senior,2,"All I can say is that you have to be on the ball when it comes to knowing your financial rights because this school is awful at processing anything related to financial aid.  thanks goodness that I am a Veteran and can waive most of the fees but still, as I am experiencing this qtr., they are trying to find a way to get me to pay and to disqualify me from my financial aid."
College Senior,2,"Nothing sits the school apart except for the ""gay friendliness"" of the area where the school is located."
College Senior,2,"Although the school has been in the forefront (Seattle, WA) home of Bill Gates, they have mostly not taken advantage of the online resources in lieu of charging students to buy books and handouts that they sell at the school instead of using the online material directly.  "
College Sophomore,2,It is OK in community college. Cannot expect big football field here. Around 30 student organizations 
College Sophomore,2,"I did not have a really bad time here. everything's OK, not too bad. I enjoy the small size of each class, making me more opportunities interact with professors. In general, the academic is good. The transfer agreement guarantee is too limited. There is no top school, even UW. TA with UC is just pathways, not guarantee. "
College Sophomore,2,"It's fine. Sometimes, the network is so bad and crashed"
College Sophomore,2,Many kinds of students in this school
Niche User,1,"SCC services are very VERY bad. Advisors barely know what they're doing. God forbid if you know more than them and point out at their inconsistencies, they will deny advising by avoiding you by any means.
They are out of hand, especially during covid19, as there is no phone number I could call to (I literally need just 10 mins to clarify some things). Any zoom appointments get cancelled (cause they're too busy for you with new students). Excuse my language but it's a freaking sh*t show."
Graduate Student,1,"Advisors do not help at all. Also, low level of education. No athletic lfe at all except a small gym."
College Junior,1,"No one is helpful, no one knows what they are talking about.  It's the worst."
College Junior,1,Rarely do I have a good encounter with anyone in the office.
College Junior,1,The staff is really not interested in helping you find work at all. They just dont want to be bothered and will try to find any excuse to get you out of their office rather than help you.
College Junior,1,"Unhelpful, unprofessional, mean-spirited and just plain awful staff at this dept."
College Junior,1,"Horrible staffing problems in the career center.  I really wonder where they got the advisers from because they are rude, unprofessional and completely unhelpful"
College Senior,1,The school will not accept basic classes taken out of state.  they do not have the knowledge or research-ability on how to match classes.
College Senior,1,"and getting more worse....  It seemed that after Affirmative Action was voted down, the school thinks it's not their thing to offer certain resources for low income people, other than referring them outside to religious organizations.  there use to be women's program and housing for the campus, now they are mostly ran by the worksource office.  Compared to the school my son graduated from, I feel embarrassed that I even go here, but it's all I can do as a veteran, we are limited to community colleges."
College Senior,1,"The school sits in an area where mostly gay and lesbian people live (like myself) but yet there is no diversity at the school due to the fact that the city is gentrified.  There are tons of Asian students that outweigh the residents of the area and the school has managed to alienate all students of color (black and brown).  Most students are there for junior college and a few electives and then to transfer however, the school is basically discriminating against citizens of the US in order to take advantage of the international student (again mostly Asian).  Having worked at the school's district before, I have seen them play race games and they now have what they call a ""promise scholarship"" set up because most teachers here think that Asian students have better grades than their own neighbors and residents of the area.  Although the school tries to hire Presidents and Chancellors that are of color, they fail to hire those who are good and most of the upper level staff, look like the corporate elites and like their foundation members for the school which is white and clueless."
College Sophomore,1,Few scholarships. International students have a little chance
College Sophomore,1,I am not sure about the career center. I have not used it much. But I guess it not very highly standard.
College Sophomore,1,I don't recommend online course. Cannot be in touch with professors. Students and teachers don't even know each other
College Freshman,1,financial aid was a nightmare. I was judged on taxes from a year ago when I was married. Now divorced and unemployed I had made 12000 last year. How is that enough to survive and go to school. I ended up getting a part time job that has flexible hours and pays terrible. Now because I have this job and am responsible it counts against me receiving financial aid. Where if I sat around for a year in squalor I might receive it. The system is terrible.

Senior,5,Overall I think the transition from in class to online went very well. All of my professors did an excellent job with the switch. It was almost seamless.
Senior,5,I love UNH at Manchester! The faculty and staff are wonderful and incredibly helpful. The school is absolutely beautiful .
Senior,5,Staff and faculty are exceptional. The school has a comfortable feel while also being incredibly inviting and engaging.
Graduate Student,5,I have loved the MSW program here. It is very realistic with being a working professional and getting my degree.
Junior,5,"Understanding that this is a primarily a commuter campus, I wish there was more activities made aware to the students that we could participate in. I'll randomly come across a great thing that campus is offering, but the lack of talk/emails regarding the event often results in a poor outcome. If the school and the students were to increase their networking capabilities, I think a positive change would be seen."
Freshman,5,"The University of New Hampshire at Manchester is a place unlike an other to go to receive an education. The faculty and staff are there to help the students grow and they make themselves readily available when they notice any signs of struggle. The student population is extremely close as well. It is almost impossible to not turn a corner and see a group of students congregated in the hall taking about their academics, studying or simply relaxing together. UNHM is a place where one can feel at home and know that while they are receiving a quality education, they have people around them that are willing to help them reach their goals and succeed."
Junior,5,"I love it here, I started at the Durham campus and it was alright, but I never felt like I was reaching my full potential. At UNHM, I am a person. I am on a first name basis with all of my professor, instead of being known by my 9-digit student ID number. The class sizes are small, which provides a more engaging and intellectual environment. I definitely feel I get my money's worth from this institution. The only thing I would change is more parking."
College Junior,5,Students are encouraged to better their career with the help from professors
College Junior,5,The professors are very helpful and enthusiastic
College Junior,5,Great securities who offers to walk with student
College Junior,5,Living at home is the best!
College Sophomore,5,"UNHM has one of the best SLI programs in the country, career prospects are great"
College Sophomore,5,I like living so close to home and paying less than living on campus.
College Junior,5,The academic at UNHM is awesome. The professors are always willing to help you study. Many study groups are on campus as well in our academic center.
College Sophomore,5,"So Much Variety – There are so many close restaurants near UNH. Literally in every direction you go there are a ton of places to grab something to eat, and in all price ranges."
College Sophomore,5,"All I had to do was make an appointment with my advisor to decide my major. In the beginning, I started out as undeclared. Two biology classes later, and I knew what I wanted my major to be. My advisor was very supportive, and helped me decide what my plan was going to be from there."
College Sophomore,5,There are so many different races at UNH Manchester. We are growing in numbers every year. That is also what makes it a fun school to attend. You learn things about differend races and religions you never thought you would.
College Sophomore,5,Special Security Measures – UNH at Manchester does a great job protect students items that they have lost or forgotten. They make sure that you are the person when picking up your item
Junior,4,I really like the facilities on campus but I feel there are not many decent opportunities to socialize and build relationships with other students. The campus really lacks a decent community gathering area such as a cafeteria.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed attending UNHM. The class sizes are small and the professors are great. Even though it is a commuter school, student involvement does an awesome job at getting people to socialize and be involved."
Sophomore,4,"Academics, professors, diversity, safety: Awesome
What suffers at UNH Manchester is the lack of social life. It is unlike many universities, in that there is no social life! There is no athletics teams, no parties, so not much meeting new people. You WILL meet new people, but it's much more difficult to do at this college. The only thing that will make this college better is a solid social life paired with some college sports teams"
Freshman,4,"UNH Manchester is definitely for people who are more settled down, or for people who don’t really care about the party scene or student life. There are some clubs, and you can join Student Involvement which helps you meet new people. There’s a little café which sells Starbucks drinks, sandwhiches, parfaits, etc. If you don’t like any of the options there, Elm street is a minute away and there are a ton of restaurants and cafes there. The campus is in a single mill building, so you don’t have to go outside to get to class. I’m pretty sure athletics are none existent at UNH Manchester, although there is a running club if you count that. Finally, the teachers and classes I had my first semester were all fine. I liked the small size as opposed to the huge lecture style courses."
Senior,4,"Students definitely need to make their own experience at UNH Manchester. Those who aren't engaged in their learning will quickly realize why that won't work - but otherwise, this school can be a powerful tool for you to learn exactly what you want. It's small enough to work directly with professors and program directors to chart a custom course of study if that's what you want."
College Junior,4,The school has a lot of school spirit!
College Junior,4,"The school is so small, that most professors will remember the students' name"
College Sophomore,4,Campus is only 1 building so it's pretty safe
College Sophomore,4,Professors in my major are some of the best in the country
College Freshman,4,UNH Manchester excels at differentiating between a community college and a commuter school. The upbeat environment and various student-run activities promote a sense of community and inclusiveness.
College Sophomore,4,"We are located in the heart of Manchester, NH. Elm street is one block up and is loaded with a lot of delicious restaurants."
College Sophomore,4,We are a commuter school so we do not have residential life. Overall we are a dry campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I did receive my financial aid rather smoothly, I do not have too many complaints about the process."
College Sophomore,4,"Although UNHM is a commuter campus only, it has an excellent community. If students want to get involved their are endless opportunities."
College Freshman,4,The administration is great. You feel respected and at ease when on campus.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of apartments off campus close to campus but make sure your in the right neighborhood. There are some rough areas of Manchester.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of options within a close proximity and there are different styles of restaurants.
College Sophomore,4,I think our campus is very fair to all students
College Sophomore,4,The counselors were very helpful and knowledgeable.
College Junior,4,"I have not done an internship yet, I will be doing one next year but I have heard that students at UNH attend some of the best internships available and that they are required by every student before graduation which will give them an advantage in the job field after graduation."
College Junior,4,"The process of getting into my program wasn't bad at all, they do have a specific GPA requirement but other than that everything was really easy and the advisors make the transition very easy."
College Junior,4,Because the UNH-Manchester campus is located in downtown Manchester there are so many things to do. From local clubs and bars to caffe's and library's. Whichever way you turn there is something to do.
College Sophomore,4,"We have the Manchester Monarchs and Fischer Cats, there are a few local parks, the Currier Museum of Art, Zimmerman house, and Science Museum.  There are plenty of places to eat, drink, and dance, small shops within reach and a mall across town.  There are always people to see and plenty of places to go."
College Sophomore,4,"There's computers in the library and the computer lab, all new apple computers.  If the library is full there's always some available in the lab.  I've never had any issues with the computers or the network and if I do bring my own laptop to use in class I'm always able to connect and I have no issues with internet speed."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small campus it's a diverse population.  There's a wide age range, different ethnicity's , economic and social backgrounds etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Being in the city offers you a lot of choices.  There's a restaurant next door as well as a bar that serves food.  There's traditional American cuisine, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Pizza and sub shops, bakeries, and new age American right around the corner."
College Sophomore,4,"The application process was simple and easy.  I needed the basic things, application, HS transcript, a letter of recommendation, and an essay.  Being a non-traditional student going to college for the first time I was nervous but the process was easy."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the courses offered, I love all the instructors I've had so far.  They're all very helpful, available when you need them, the workload is manageable, and there's always job listings in our career/internship office."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of choices but the most affordable housing is only found in bad neighborhoods that aren't very safe.  You can sometimes find really nice places that are decently priced and if you have a roommate it's definitely doable.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, the courses offered for Psychology are great.  I've looked into transferring to another school to finish my degree but because of the courses offered and the professors I don't want to leave."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, it's a small city campus and I've never had any issues with the school."
College Freshman,4,Not sure yet haven't gone thru a semester yet
College Sophomore,4,"Typical New England weather, some snow storms "
College Sophomore,4,"American Sign Language Interpretation: Taught by two professors, one deaf, one hearing, which makes it difficult to schedule classes "
College Senior,4,"Computer labs at UNH Manchester are almost always open and there are computers in the library available for use too and they all conveniently run both mac and pc operating systems. There are also laptops for rent in the library for personal use and there is WiFi on campus. The only big downside is that printing isn't free, but you can use your student card to pay for printing."
College Junior,4,"The main UNH campus in Durham, NH, has greek like, but the manchester campus does not. However, I know many people involved in greek life in Durham and I know that it's an essential part of the school and student life. I think greek life can be very beneficial to a school."
College Junior,4,"I think the guys are very nice and respect girls, of course, I haven't met all the guys at my school, but the ones I have came across have been very nice. I have found the same thing with the girls. I was afraid they were going to be snobby when I first started college but I've made many great friends and have found the girls to have matured a lot since high school!"
College Junior,4,The financial aid process at my school is great and is the only reason I can afford to go there. The staff is so friendly and helpful and I've never felt dumb for walking in and having to lay out my financial situation and explain I need financial assistance. My tip for getting aid at my school is just to be honest about what your needs are and you are more likely to get the aid you require.
College Sophomore,4,Since the parking passes were free it was very convenient to get. Plus the parking is so close to the main door and near all my classes. It is great they have a parking lot for the Pandora building also.
College Sophomore,4,"Big Variety in Guys – There are so many different types of guys on campus. Some are nerdy, some preppy, cute, ugly really so much variety. There are guys ranging from 18-30+ and seem to be interested in all different kinds of things."
Sophomore,2,"Commuter school with no parking. Most professors are ok some are very unprofessional and horrible at teaching. You may luck out or you may not. Easy and a cheap school to get a degree. It’s ok, nothing amazing or special."
College Junior,2,"Not worth the time, money, or effort."
College Junior,2,"They may seem like they want to help but they don't have a clue on what they are doing. Most of the ""staff"" are work study students. It's like the blind leading the blind. Need help paying for college? Well, go to the financial aid department, they will give you a robotic response and send you to a different department that ""might know more about the answer to your question""."
College Junior,2,The security at this school is a joke.
College Junior,2,Commuter school = good luck with that
College Junior,2,No one takes notice in getting involved or starting athletic events. It's sad.
College Sophomore,2,We are a commuter school.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone lives in other areas, there is usually is nothing going on after class hours on campus besides concerts here and there but they consist of people from school. There are never any good events at school."
Junior,1,"This school is the equivalent to going back to high school but worse. There are only two small parking lots available for students to park at, which turns into a war zone for a spot every morning. It is impossible to make friends here. I've been here for 2 years and have not made a single friend, mostly because everyone here is strange. Everyone is quiet, keeps to themselves and leaves to go back home when class is over. They barely have any events to participate in, and the ones that are offered are painfully awkward. Not a friendly atmosphere whatsoever! Wouldn't recommend this school to anyone unless you enjoy having 0 friends."
College Sophomore,1,"No academics, if you want to play a sport, go to Durham campus "
College Sophomore,1,Junk. Slow Internet Connection – The computers at UNH:M are very outdated for the computer sciences lab. The computers at the other labs are all macintosh and also not very effective. The internet connection at UNH:M is very slow due to the shared connection with UNH:Durham. They do not provide enough bandwidth to support such a network.

Alum,5,I love Lehigh. It is a beautiful school located in South Bethlehem on a mountain overlooking the rest of the city. The professors are great and most of my classes were small so the professors knew who I was. I also met some of the best people there.
Alum,5,I haven't taken any online classes with lehigh but I've heard very mixed things about my peers experiences. Some of the classes became much harder without the in class experience and office hours.
Alum,5,"Lehigh is both fun and challenging. The university invests in a variety of fields and interdisciplinary  subjects, but career services is mostly catered to business and engineering students. Other than that, all departments offer numerous opportunities for extra- curricular involvement, and students have the freedom to take many different classes to become well rounded citizens."
Alum,5,I loved Lehigh. Built amazing friendships and the network still helps me land opportunities today. Would recommend to anyone.
Freshman,5,"Currently a student at Lehigh & I absolutely love it. Best decision of my life to come here. Academics are tough, but professors are amazing & always willing to help. Their passion shines through!"
Niche User,5,From my first initial research to stepping foot on campus. Lehigh has caught my attention early  on. The school embodies education at its finest. The campus is aesthetic at its core from the research department to its school of science.
Freshman,5,"I ended up choosing Lehigh because it was clear it was a place that has a great emphasis on undergraduate teaching, the campus is beautiful, and the students I met were very friendly. I always have great times here, whether its at Wingo, going to Chabad, parties, etc. 
The Linderman Library is truly special, too.

The academics are very good, and among me are very intelligent students. 
It is worth noting that Greek life is on a huge decline."
Freshman,5,"Lehigh is a great school and I would highly recommend investing four years here. All the people are great and the classes are better! You truly can't go wrong with the social life here, except when those pesky Lehigh Police are chomping at the bit to shut down any sprinkle of fun they see happening."
Freshman,5,"Lehigh offers rigorous courses and enforces the concept of interdisciplinary studies. The only downside of Lehigh University is the lack of a law school and med school. Other than that, Lehigh's STEM program and College of Business places one of the best in the country."
Sophomore,5,love it. amazing atmosphere beautiful campus. amazing people. amazing sports and academics so much school spirit
Alum,5,"Lehigh is an amazing school academically and has provided many opportunities to my peers, as well as myself. Almost all the professors are willing to sit with you and really help you understand the material, the administrative staff help complicated processes run smoothly, and overall everyone I encountered made me feel welcome and excited to be there. When not in classes or studying, Lehigh provided activities and events for students to attend, like concerts and trips to NYC and Phili. There are also several destress events around midterms and finals that are a fun way to take a break from studying. The surrounding community has been getting better and growing, with new restaurants and shoppes opening, so there are plenty of options for eating out within walking distance. Overall, I think if you are interested in a ""real campus"" feel, but still want to be close to major cities, and also be around really driven and fun people, Lehigh should definitely be at the top of your list."
Sophomore,5,"The professors really care about what they're teaching, and faculty is always helpful. Alumni connection is really good and the career center is really good at setting up jobs for graduating seniors. Overall amazing school."
Sophomore,5,"Professors at Lehigh really care about the students. Although the academics are excellent, there is definitely a large party scene. Greek life is big on campus, but I've been pleasantly surprised how little stigma is related to it. Students are overall relaxed and dedicated to working hard & forming friendships."
Sophomore,5,I love Lehigh University.  Currently a sophomore and definitely picked the perfect school for me.  Academics are very challenging.  Beautiful campus.  Dorms need some renovation.  Greek life was important to me and Lehigh has a great presence of Greek Life.
Freshman,5,"Lehigh has many fun and free events or their students such as free concerts (Halsey came here in fall 2018), so you will never have a boring day at Lehigh because there is always something going on. Also, Lehigh has rigorous academics taught by amazing professors who will help you as long as you put in the work. Everyone I have met here is very nice and (although it is a competitive college) classes and grades do not feel like a competition among your peers. All my classmates have helped me when I needed help on something and creating study groups was not difficult because of how friendly and sociable everyone is once you start talking to each other. I am only a freshman now and despite having difficult classes this year, I have been enjoying my 1st year with great friends and environment. I recommend anyone who is even slightly interested in Lehigh to come and see and research about the benefits Lehigh offers."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a student-athlete here. The academics and social scene are amazing here, and the campus is beautiful. In my opinion, the most important thing to consider in when looking at colleges is how well they prepare you for a future career, and the average Lehigh grad makes a starting salary of about 60k and a mid-career salary of over 130k. However, Lehigh's location in South Bethlehem is kind of sketchy, and the food isn't great. If you want a ""work hard, play hard"" college experience, Lehigh is a great fit."
Sophomore,5,"This is an awesome school with a lot of opportunity. Although some of the resources may not be easily visible, any student with the motivation to make the most of their college experience, getting the most out of the surroundings is sure to fall in love with this school and the faculty and students it is composed of!"
Alum,5,Good academics. you leave knowing what you're talking about. Greek life is big for lots of students but it doesn't have to be that way for you if you don't want it to be there's plenty of things to do. Its a beautiful campus. The students are polite. The teachers they're smart not all of them are great teachers but you figure it out on your own if you have to. Overall good experience would recommend it.
Freshman,5,"My first semester at Lehigh has been absolutely amazing. It was so much more than what I could have asked for. Lehigh is has a rich aura of academia and the classes and professors are top notch. The campus is so diverse and there are truly countless clubs and organizations to choose from and become involved there. Everyone there, both faculty and peers, wants to see you succeed."
Sophomore,5,Excellent education and rewarding division 1 athletics. It is the perfect place to go if you are the type of student that has good grades and wants to participate in athletics in college.
Freshman,5,I have only been at Lehigh for a semester thus far but enjoy almost every minute of it. It is a very challenging school but the help is there if you need it you just have to reach out.
Senior,5,It is a great engineering school. Professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The only down side was that Senior year was the most hands-on which is great but the other years lacked that aspect a bit so I would have preferred to have that experience earlier too.
Freshman,5,I just got accepted to Lehigh and I cant wait to begin my journey with y'all. I knew after my first tour that I belonged here and applied early decision 1. The building take you back in time and the interior designs have a sense of elegance and sophistication.
Niche User,5,A lovely campus and a great education. What more can I say. It will really feel like your home for 4 years.
Sophomore,5,"My experience as an undergraduate at Lehigh has been nothing but a great experience.  
I can't fathom why our campus has a ""B"" rating on Niche; the campus is one of the most beautiful that I've toured. Sure, it's on a mountain so sometimes you sweat before you reach your English class but honestly, the height differences around campus make the views stunning and also help keep off the Freshmen 15. 
The immediate local area isn't incredible, but North Bethlehem (only a 20-minute walk from Campus) is a ton of fun and actually attracts tourists to see Historic Bethlehem, especially during Christmas time. 
Overall I would 100% recommend Lehigh to any prospective high school student. The best thing that I could tell them is that besides a beautiful campus and great academics, is that Lehigh really provides you with great opportunities- which is something that I have come to value over anything else that a school can offer you."
Alum,5,"I graduated a few years ago and cannot say enough positive things about this school. For me, it was the perfect place to challenge me and enable me to really grow into a better person. Having now worked with colleagues who attended a variety of other schools(particularly large public schools), I have come to appreciate the Lehigh family and the feel of the small school. The classes are challenging, the campus is beautiful, there is a vivid social scene. However, if you aren't looking for a large school where you and your peers can spend your time cheering on your school's sports teams, this might not be the right fit."
Sophomore,5,Choosing Lehigh is easily my best decision to date. This University has a culture of intellect with professors that truly care about their students. There are many research opportunities and it is very easy to involved in all aspects of campus life.
Senior,5,Lehigh is an institution that is very challenging and brings out the very best in students. This school has allowed me to travel over the time of my undergraduate experience.
Alum,5,"Lehigh was a great experience. A ""medium"" sized school that feels small. Great relationships with professors and great opportunities for extra curricular activities. Top notch education on a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,5,Lehigh has incredibly strong academic programs that will challenge the student to think outside the box. The professors are all very motivating and helpful during office hours and in class time. 
College Sophomore,5,"Different companies come to the business center on a weekly basis, it is a fantastic place to make connectiosn. They really allow you to get the most of your education if you're willing to put the work in"
College Sophomore,5,This school has fantastic academic and connections to big firms. You are pretty much guarenteed to get a job after graduating from lehigh with the alumne connections that Lehigh has to offer.
College Senior,5,"I have loved Lehigh, and I am bittersweet abt going!"
College Senior,5,Did a great internship in Singapore; already offered a job!
College Freshman,5,Any night of the week
College Sophomore,5,There are many different job opportunities for Lehigh students. The grad network is loyal and loves to come back and help students find jobs
College Sophomore,5,Professor here are great and they really care about your education. They are helpful in getting students research positions or helping students pursue a variety of projects
College Sophomore,5,"Freshman dorms are fine; however, greek housing is a much better options with a variety of amenities"
College Sophomore,5,Its amazing being able to get a great education while having the opportunity to go out and party every night and be completely in the norm.
Recent Alumnus,5,Job placement is really high.
Recent Alumnus,5,Greek life is really big and really dominates the social scene.
College Freshman,5,"I am in a sorority here and I love it. As a girl you can still get into parties if you're not in a house but as a guy, you spend time doing nothing if you aren't in a greek house. Frat parties occur 5 nights a week and first semester you can go wherever you want as a girl but need a good ratio or a text as guys."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Lehigh. I am part of the Greek community and am enjoying myself very much in my opportunities as well as meeting new friends.
College Freshman,5,"Since getting here, I have been to a lot of parties and they are all amazing. A+."
College Freshman,5,"I feel incredibly safe on campus. I walk around by myself at night often, and i'm a girl, and i've never felt threatened whatsoever. There is a huge police presence, in my opinion too much at times. They hunt kids down to cite them and arrest them for underage drinking of for smoking weed. South Bethlehem may seem like not the best area, but at night there are so many kids walking around that you are never alone."
College Freshman,5,"I am a freshman, so I really am unsure, but I have heard there are incredible job opportunities that come from a Lehigh Degree. Very strong alumni network and as long as you have a decent GPA and are involved you are set."
College Freshman,5,"I am in a sorority on campus and it was one the best decisions i've made. It is very helpful in being able to get involved on campus and have a great group of friends. However, joining greek life does not mean you lose you original friends, you still can hang out with whoever you want and have a strong network."
College Freshman,5,"I am so happy I chose to attend Lehigh, I love it more than anything."
College Sophomore,5,Lehigh is a great school that will test your abilities to the max and reward you in the end for persevering through it all.
College Freshman,5,Lehigh is in the top 20 of students having jobs after graduation. Plain and simple.
College Freshman,5,"It's the best! The atmosphere is awesome, and there is something for everyone. The professors are overall very welcoming; I pursued an interest in research, and the professor was very accommodating. Our campus is beautiful and majestic. Our traditions are one-of-a-kind. There's simply something special about Lehigh."
College Freshman,5,Lehigh has a great alumni network that are all very successful and very willing to hire other Lehigh alums.
College Freshman,5,"Some of the best greek culture in the country, events and parties almost every day."
College Freshman,5,"Much better academics than almost every other ""party"" school which is great because the students are all smart and study hard but make it all worthwhile by partying like crazy every other day of the year."
College Freshman,5,"Lehigh's alumni network is extensive and they stay in touch with the institution. Check out its endowment. A degree from Lehigh is quite impressive, but I do feel that in some places in the country, it can go unnoticed."
College Freshman,5,"I'm not greek, but it is very prominent on campus. Thus, you can make the assumption that going greek is enjoyable for those that do take par. However, I am just not interested in joining."
College Freshman,5,The profs are always willing to help and they are understanding of everything.
College Freshman,5,Their programs are great and Lehigh has been ranked very highly in regards to return on investment.
College Freshman,5,"Love this school more than anything, couldn't see myself anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is huge, 60% of students are apart of it."
Sophomore,4,"so far, my experience at lehigh university has been rally good. Ive met intellectuals across all majors."
Sophomore,4,"Lehigh took innovative steps in helping its students get used to the online experience.  Personally, my experience was really good."
Alum,4,"Lehigh had great classes, a mixed batch of professors, a great social life mostly dependent on greek life, but very little diversity"
Alum,4,"Lehigh is a great school for those who find their place. For others, it can be a daily challenge. I was involved in various orgs across campus (frat, senate, club founder, misc. leadership positions) and therefore had an adequate understanding of how the ""Lehigh experience"" differed for different people. To preface, I am a white male. I received no financial aid. I was, and still am, privileged and fortunate to have had many valuable resources provided for me. That being said, many of my friends faced microagressions (and overt racism) daily. Greek life is vastly dominated by white kids, and many of these houses essentially act as a safe harbor for prejudice and racist acts. The Lehigh admin rarely takes impactful action when harmful acts occur; they usually send an email from the President who is largely removed from the lives of students. Regardless of this, change is coming. There are good people at Lehigh, but as an institution, their foundations must change. 

F**k parking"
Alum,4,"I took a few summer courses and finished my senior year online. It was what you'd expect at most universities. Some professors continue exerting effort, others simply post recorded videos and don't provide time for questions, office hours etc. On a positive note, most professors understand the technical and geographic challenges that ""diverse"" (for lack of a better term) students face. If you are an international student, time zones will be accounted for. If you cannot afford a computer/WiFi coverage, Lehigh will provide resources."
Freshman,4,Lehigh has great online learning. TAs and professors are always there for you and are always willing to help.
Freshman,4,"There should be better financial aid. They claim to fulfill 100% need, but do not and strain families. There could be more diversity, but the academics and night life is fantastic."
Junior,4,"My experience with online classes at Lehigh has somehow been better than my in-person experience. The teachers were very lenient and for the first time in my life, actually acted like they cared about me. Assignments were realistic and flexible to work with my adjustments."
Alum,4,Received a great education from very knowledgeable professors. Very easy to make friends and socialize.
Sophomore,4,I love the environment and support from the other students at Lehigh! Everyone is super involved on campus and very dedicated to their academics.
Alum,4,"Lehigh University is a great academic institution. It lacks diversity, campus community, and school spirit. Social groups are siloed based on your main ""interest"" (greek life, athletics, etc.). It is a great return on investment and I really did learn a lot."
Freshman,4,"Lehigh is one of the best schools in the US, yet the party scene is crazy. Most students smoke weed and/or drink. If you don't do that, it is somehow hard to socialize with people who do so. However, it is nice that you will always have a group of people who are similar to you and hence you will never be alone. the diversity is nice, and the school spirit is also very good. But, the drinking culture is shockingly unusual."
Senior,4,I've had an amazing experience. Got a stellar education and made great friends. The classes are difficult but through them you learn incredible amounts. Although known for engineer all departments are seemingly well funded and professors are dedicated and extremely willing to meet in office hours and go over material with their students. The campus at Lehigh is gorgeous. All of the old stone buildings seem like something that should be found in a storybook. The surrounding area is nice but not necessarily thrilled about the college students being around. It does not have a college town feel to it. The athletics are decent some sports obviously being better than others but Leigh is competitive in most if not all of their programs.
Freshman,4,"Great place, but has a bad rep for being a party/greek school; you BY NO MEANS need to be a party person to attend Lehigh. There are so many other opportunities here outside of partying and greek life, we even have an organization designed to plan events every weekend for students who choose not to partake in such activities. Food is good. Hill are annoying but manageable. Go MountainHawks!"
Alum,4,Administration is terrible. They do not care about the students - or at least don't appear to. Care more about the endowment and money since it is a private school. Heavily greek life oriented which can be good and bad.
Freshman,4,"Lehigh is one of the most underrated schools in the nation. The professors are fantastic, there are many opportunities that are given to each student that usually only occur at the state school level. Residences/Dining can be improved on."
Freshman,4,"The campus is amazing, there is always something to do whether it be studying or holiday/ social events or internships. The school provides multiple ways for the students to be connected to the community and ways to better their education. There merely has to be a balance of studies and social life, and asking around for opportunities you never know when one might pop up."
Niche User,4,"I take one course at Lehigh and I absolutely love my professor and the course content. The students are overall, very engaged in the course and it is a very positive learning environment."
Graduate Student,4,"Amazing school for business. Lots of connections especially through professors who have worked with big-named companies. The Big Four also recruits a large population from here. Most students get internships starting freshmen year and secured job offers by junior year. However, for Engineering Lehigh is ok. There is prestige and the curriculum is pretty robust. Job prospects are average. As for other majors, I've seen many students struggle post graduation."
Niche User,4,"Pros: Great President and administration, Gorgeous campus, Actively reigning in the party scene, Strong placement.

Cons
Still too party oriented, Need more active clubs on campus to provide better alternatives to greek life, Engineering has fallen in the rankings.

Overall
This President is doing everything right. You can already see the green shoots he came to foster. Lehigh will be truly great in 5-7 years. 

If I could suggest one thing to President Simon, it would be that he personally watch video of some of the lectures of the low-rated profs in engineering and science courses. Some of them are brilliant, but really need guidance on how to teach undergrads effectively. It should be the role of department heads, but many just don't care."
Sophomore,4,"Lehigh is quite the ride. I have absolutely fallen in love with some parts of this school... networking opportunities are everywhere, and the students you will meet are intellectuals, hardworking and supportive of each other (instead of the toxic-ly competitive environment I was afraid to encounter at a school of academically high achievers). On campus events are plentiful and exciting, and the size is big enough to meet new people every week but still bump into friends on the way to classes. Not to mention that the campus is absolutely gorgeous. What I don't like is the dominance of Greek life. Although it has helped some people make friends and find a community, I have witnessed it perpetuate issues of sexual assault and drug abuse on campus. It also creates a notable social divide between greeks and non-greeks. However, it's still possible to find communities outside of greek life."
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful, the students are compassionate, and there is a lot of school spirit. The students are proud to be a part of the Lehigh community."
Freshman,4,"The school offer excellent education and resources for students. I made many great friends as a student here and learned many things as a student. The school is particularly helpful in networking with alumni and some major companies. However, Lehigh University lack diversity and the student body is very segregated according to their race and similarities. Many students are close-minded and very party-orientated."
Sophomore,4,"Lehigh overall is an enjoyable place to be.  It keeps you really busy, but sometimes too much.  I feel that professors either care a lot about their classes or are bumbling and mediocre.  All of the professors I've met (aside from those in the math department) are very helpful."
Junior,4,"I play football here, but I am involved in various extracurriculars such as the Men of Color Alliance (MOCA), Center for Gender Equity, Black Student Union (BSU), and also a member of a fraternity. I have experienced pretty much everything Lehigh has to offer and have been satisfied with that experience so far."
Sophomore,4,"So far, being a student at Lehigh has been a really great experience. I can see the endless opportunities now and for the future."
Junior,4,"I really have been enjoying my time here at Lehigh. The campus is beautiful! I am in the engineering school here and I have really enjoyed my classes. Lehigh is a great school for research. In fact, in the engineering school every professor is carrying out some sort of research. The downside of all the research here at Lehigh is that some of the professors are not the greatest teachers."
Senior,4,"Like every University, Lehigh is what you make of it. I've been fortunate enough to have an amazing experience as a student athlete. As an engineering student, I know that the skills and network resources I have available to me are invaluable. I've made great friends and learned so much about myself throughout my time here. Plus it's a beautiful campus!"
Junior,4,Definitely a Greek-life dominating school and drinking is the central theme within the Greek community. Lehigh has a strong work-hard play-hard attitude and it can seem a little difficult at times when your interests don't align with the culture.
Alum,4,"The students at Lehigh University are friendly, and  the academics in Engineering are wonderful. I really liked the food that was offered on campus."
Niche User,4,"When I went to visit this school, it was a large community that seemed to be a  bit far from any big city. The students at the university were all very focused on their studies but did not lack any social skills. They all knew when was the time to socialize and enjoy themselves. The school spirit was present on any of the games they participated in, so it is a big supportive campus wit high academic success."
College Sophomore,4,"Lehigh is generally very safe, if you stay on the campus"
College Sophomore,4,I'm invovled in greek life on campus and it's changed my college experience for the better. I have found a lot of girls on campus that are just like me looking to have a great time but also work hard in school
College Senior,4,Campus Safety is located in the center of campus.
College Senior,4,"I am a varsity athlete, and I enjoy my teammates."
College Senior,4,"I have made some great friends, and I have learned much!"
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at my school is exhilarating. Every game I go to a game students rally up and support our school and the athletes representing it.
College Sophomore,4,"The overall experience at school as been invigorating at best since the school has a competitive aura about it. Every day I walk into a class it was always like a boxing match to see who can hit the other student with information that you have learned through your tireless studying overnight. As you step on campus, the school's environment resembles Harry Potter's school: Hogwarts. The architecture is ancient looking with many of the buildings featuring castle-like pedestals on top. The choice of the school was an easy one since this was my dream school since stepping on high school territory. I had many doubts if I was really good enough to be admitted into the school. As I got the acceptance letter in the mail, I was very excited to know that the next four years of my life would be some of my best. I would choose his school again if the process had to be done all over again."
College Senior,4,"The class sizes at Lehigh are generally small. Most professors are good at teaching and are experts at what they teach. That being said, I believe some professors have room to improve. I was able to learn a lot at Lehigh but most of which I can apply to my internships. What I did at my internships, I had to learn by myself. If we can focus more on major classes during freshmen year rather than junior/senior year, we will be a lot more competitive in the job search market."
College Senior,4,"Overall, Lehigh provides a very safe environment. Few times a year do we receive emails about sexual assault, robbery and break-ins. The school has a police station mid campus and just build a new one on lower campus. I think that will make our campus an even safer place."
College Senior,4,"Lehigh used to be known as a part school with huge Greek life. However, in the past 20 years or so, the party seen has died down quite a bit. Our new school president wants Lehigh to give off more of a study and academic vibe. That being said, most students participate in Greek life. Most parties are only open to people within the organization."
College Senior,4,"The overall experience at Lehigh is definitely enriching and challenging. The course curriculum is set at a very high bar so that it'd be challenging for everyone. Although I have struggled in certain classes, I was able to really grasp the materials through extra help during walk-in hours. Most of the professors are very good at what they do and are willing to help. I really like my Lehigh experience and would definitely remain one of my top choices if I were to go back in time. One thing that Lehigh falls short of is that it's located further away from cities, where more opportunities are. Being in a city would provide many more co-op or internship opportunities, both of which would enrich a student's experience and increase their competitiveness in the market."
College Sophomore,4,"The actual campus itself is very safe, but the area of Bethlehem we live in once you go off-campus is not someplace I would want to walk alone around. The police presence of campus is large though, which makes me feel better."
College Sophomore,4,"The freshman dorms are very average. They are small, but get cleaned very often. All of the freshman dorms are very close to the academic buildings and dining halls, which is great."
College Sophomore,4,"As a sorority member, Greek Life is a great way to meet people and get involved on campus. A very large percentage of students are Greek however, so I feel as if we are a bit disconnected from students who are not affiliated with a house."
College Sophomore,4,Lehigh provides students with a great college experience. The academics are wonderful and the party scene is a large part of campus culture.
College Sophomore,4,The Lehigh police department does a good job protecting students and although incoming students may have worries about the south side it has never been an issue for me even late at night.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek and non greek students get along very well; however, greeks dominate the social scene and living in a house is much better than the alternatives provided to non-greeks"
Recent Alumnus,4,My professor have been nothing but helpful and encouraging throughout my entire Lehigh career.
Recent Alumnus,4,I've had no issues on campus.
College Freshman,4,Alumni love lehigh. A frat alumni showed up to the Lehigh Lafayette and gave his expensive Porsche rv to his frat and let them party in it.
College Freshman,4,The make sure drugs are enforced on campus.  But they do treat everyone like criminals even for very very minor violations.
College Freshman,4,"First of all, I love the campus, the feel of it is amazing.  The one complaint is that it is built on a hill, but what can you do.  I'm a freshman, so I haven't had a lot of experiences with the classes but I don't have many complaints.  The one big complaint I have with the academics is the Math department.  For such a great university, I would rate the math department at a C-.  I have to rely on my TAs, which I have been lucky with, for help.  The biggest issue I have with the school is the administration.  They are completely useless with help on student projects and funding."
College Freshman,4,"Upper cents- Really close to Rathbone dining hall which is good, but farther from parties.

Lower cents- Close to off campus parties, close to most classes-lower on the hill. A pain to walk up to the greek houses on the hill but the bus is pretty good. also very close to gym.Very social, always something going on.

Richards- kinda irrelevant, mostly boys. near hawks nest.

Dravo-Next to richards, very high on the hill. Houses CHOICE.

M&M-higher on the hill, close to greek houses. Largest freshmen dorm. Very tight knit community."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not a big sports fan, however Le-Laf is very important. It is the long rivalry between Lehigh and Lafayette that gets everyone out for games. It is a huge part of life on campus and le-laf week is a huge deal"
College Freshman,4,"I'm definitely very happy with my choice to come to Lehigh! The academics are very difficult, so be prepared. The slogan work hard, play harder is very true. Everyone is very focused on studying but at the end of the day love to go out and have a good time. The dorms are all pretty nice, i've had no problems. Registration is pretty easy, overall good experience."
College Freshman,4,All the professors I've had either hold multiple degrees or advanced degrees in the field they teach. They are alwasy available and I've learned a lot so far.
College Freshman,4,"47% of the student body is involved in greek life, opposed to what admission will tell you is somewhere in the high 20's low 30 percent. It's not necessary to join greek life but they host all the parties, except on saturdays when the atheletes host."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is huge at lehigh. It is a great way to meet people and be involved on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Student interest in varsity sports isn't the best, but intramurals are abundant and thriving."
Freshman,2,"got friends in farrington, im in dravo, I had mad feeling of missing out because they practically have roomates and im all alone, feelsbad"
Sophomore,2,Lehigh has a fairly good reputation and you’ll get a fine education but nothing you can’t find anywhere else. It claims to have a solid alumni network which is true of majors like finance or anything in engineering but not so much anything else. Location is suboptimal; not much to do in Bethlehem and definitely no career opportunities. Party scene was ok but will definitely suck with new Greek life rules. Greek community is extremely small and will continue to get smaller as admin kicks more organizations off the hill for no reason. If you’re not in Greek life it should be an interesting time for you getting into parties especially if you’re not a girl. Sports are meaningless here so if you’re looking to go to tailgates and whatnot we don’t do that. It’s a fine school I’m having fun and I love my friends but I can’t think of one thing lehigh does better than any other school.
Alum,2,"Academically, as a graduate of both the Business and Arts & Sciences colleges I can honestly give Lehigh a 5/5, I’ve never respected and experienced a more brilliant lot of experts, intellectuals and academics than my four years’ worth of professors - to this day I still feel the inspiration I was bestowed as a student under Profs. Billie Watts and Ken Sinclair my jr/sr years - and if it wasn’t for the way they challenged, inspired and motivated me academically I would’ve left 2 weeks into my jr year.  I’ve made my share of mistakes and bad decisions in my 32 years alive, but there’s only one that still haunts me with unforgivable regret: choosing to be a collegiate athlete for Lehigh’s lax team. At 32 years old now, honestly I can say I’ve never dedicated more of my life, myself and spent time on anything still to this day than I did on lacrosse before I was 19. I threw out opportunities like playing for UMD, wasted my sports’ career’s final yrs playing for garbage"
Freshman,2,"Decentralized and too focused on making money, partying. There's no soul in this school. Academics are not worth it, only math/engineering is prioritized, while other majors are ignored and ridiculed. The administration does not support minority or low-income students, and it is not a good climate for young women. Overall rough, not worth the work I put in, I will be transferring. Too many hangups. If you want to major in binge drinking, this is the school for you"
Alum,2,"Pretty good academics. Not much going on culturally. Campus and area of country are pretty. Hard to survive without a car. Uneven gender distribution is bad for dating. University community is moderate or indifferent politically. “Diversity” here seems to means having blacks on the sports teams. They have a policy where they stop allowing you to use the internet, which can be frustrating if you’re trying to learn, at the university."
Sophomore,2,"For my fellow inner-city minority students. Return on investment is a solid 5 out of 5 because the school really helps us out financially and a degree from Lehigh University will surely get you far. However, while being here you will be miserable. Forget what you see in the movies. Lehigh is far from a happy place for me. Parties are difficult to get into and its rare to dance with people besides close friends. Im in engineering and the classes are freaking difficult. Coming from an inner-city school means that I was not properly prepared for most of the courses thrown at me, so I have to study significantly harder than my peers just to perform average on exams. There are few blacks and hispanics so you'll know them all being one yourself. Food: pasta, pasta, burgers. I'm lucky I met a girlfriend here who truly makes my college experience a bit less depressing. Overall the way I see it.. I'll be miserable for 4 years, but hopefully it'll land me a good job... only 2 more years to go."
College Senior,2,they give the word clique a new definition!
College Senior,2,"I think the career services can do a better job. In general, it is very hard to network with past alumni. The career center has very few job postings and that most are only open to US-residents. I would be great to see the career center bolster our alumni network and reach out to more companies to provide opportunities."
College Freshman,2,Alcohol is literally every where and so is weed if you know who to ask. Coke has a prescence on campus too but thats a bit more difficult to get. Adderall and ritalin are very present around finals as is xanax right after. You could really get anything you wanted if you knew who to ask but alcohol and weed are what you would see at parties typically.
College Freshman,2,"Just in my opinion, this is not the school for me. We are very Greek oriented, which is awesome fro some people, not for others. However, we are situated in one of the worst towns in America. Sorry Bethlehem, which has been renamed ""Sketchlehem"" by the students. I come from a very vibrant and lively hometown on the west coast with lots to do, so coming to Bethlehem was a bit of a culture shock. Lehigh is a great choice for some people. It is a beautiful campus with great academics, but the town itself proved to be a little dull for me. Some nights I would like to be able to go out and explore but really the only options are studying or partying in a sweaty frat basement. Again, a great choice for some people, but if you are looking for more out of your local area this is not the place."
College Freshman,2,"Most people I see are rich, white, rude snobs"
College Freshman,2,Lehigh lacks diversity as far as race and class.
College Freshman,2,"If you aren't in engineering you better have visited the school and loved it and thought it completely worth it for your non-engineering major. If you live far away and can't afford to fly out, tthe school is a depressing ghost town on the weekends and breaks."
College Freshman,2,"If you aren't someone who values greek life or wants to join don't go here. If you aren't from the northeast and don't like greek life, definitely don't go here."
College Freshman,2,"Very small rooms, and the cleaning people are not very good"
College Junior,2,The houses are mostly destroyed from someone who hosted parties. some of them become cheaper because of this. most houses don't get much or any free parking. There is always a few break ins and robberies in the area
College Junior,2,No one goes to the games. We all just get drunk at MoCos (morning cocktails) at 8am for football games then go back to bed. At least that is what most Greeks do which account for 40% of the school. The rest have a pretty poor turn out. The university does little to help with team spirit unfortunately.
College Junior,2,"Local atmosphere is honestly horrible.  Lehigh is situated in a very poor neighborhood and with most Lehigh students being wealthy white students the local demographic, blacks, (not to be racist) does not really like the students.  Many students get robbed right on campus and off campus houses are easily broken into.  There is no shopping within walking distance and probably 2 ok fast food places.  The parking is not bad and the nightlife is just a couple crappy bars and nothing else.  You get over it pretty easily though because most everyone who lives off campus lives next to each other, so parties and such are fairly close and most of your neighbors are other Lehigh students."
College Sophomore,2,The health center just gives you decongestants for everything.
College Sophomore,2,You have to be careful of the townies. It can be dangerous a bit off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Most Lehigh students are upper-middle class (or above), straight, white, Christians. we have had several instances of discrimination on campus that the school does everything they can to cover up and act like it didn't happen."
College Freshman,2,"There are buses that run up the mountain on weekdays when classes are running, but not on the weekend. If you live on the hill and want to go anywhere on the weekend, if you don't have a car you have to hike the mountain. No one wants to do that."
College Freshman,2,"Seriously, we are on a mountain. We get all the snow, and we have missed several days (including exam days!) because of snow and ice. It gets really slippery. If you are trying to walk up the hill when it is icy, you like don't even move. It's like your feet are moving but your not going anywhere."
College Freshman,2,There doesn't seem to be many.
College Freshman,2,The food here is not good at all.  On weekends only 1 of the dining halls are open and everyone goes there making it extremely crowded.  There are not many options for dinner and you are often going back to the dorm having eaten a lot of pizza or pasta
College Freshman,2,"The amount of financial aid that I am receiving from Lehigh was not enough to make me jump on the opportunity to go here, but instead made me seriously weigh the pros and cons before attending the school."
College Sophomore,2,"The registration process is so bad, but it's been getting better. Try to get the 15 extra minutes. Also, don't f up and lose 15 minutes."
College Sophomore,2,"You don't go to Lehigh to spend time in Bethlehem, that's for sure. Unless you have a car and can go further than South Bethlehem, there's nothing immediately nearby, but North Bethlehem's historic center is pretty cool. Other fun attractions can be found if you have a car and can spend the time looking for them."
College Sophomore,2,"Out of all the options, only a few houses are decent. The others are really a disgrace to the university. They're really only good for parties, but, even then, the parties tend to suck. Guys just want to get into girls' pants and girls try so hard to pretend they're having a good time with their ""friends."" Lame."
College Junior,2,A lot of people on campus are well off white kids.  A large population from NY and NJ.  There are very few black people on campus and sometimes hate is shown towards them.  There are a ton of Asians on campus though.
College Junior,2,"The girls are okay, if you find a really attractive girl she has been put on a pedestal because she is in the ""best, most attractive"" sorority and only will talk or hook-up with the ""cool"" guys in the ""best"" fraternities.  A.k.a. the attractive girls are usually the dumb ones that are stuck-up.  It is very hard to find a datable worthy girl here at Lehigh.  "
College Junior,2,"There are a few restaurants within walking distance and while they are all pretty cheap the quality isn't that great.  The most annoying thing is that the most convenient places, the ones you end up going to all the time, are the most mediocre places so it gets old very quick.  "
College Junior,2,"If you want a nice place your going to have to pay a lot.  You also have to look for off campus housing your sophomore year for living in senior year, at least if you want a choice.  Most houses like party houses are poorly kept and the landlords rarely care.  Off campus houses are starting to get better but in the end they aren't that safe in the neighborhood and most of the time you are paying way to much for the quality. "
College Freshman,2,"The campus is not very diverse at all.  I am personally not of a minority, but I have friends who are.  They don't all feel marginalized or unaccepted, but it is just a fact that Lehigh is not very diverse.  Most students are not prejudiced and are accepting, but the few who aren't make the whole community look bad.  The majority of students here are very wealthy and can throw money around like it's nothing.  It is hard to be a poorer student here, because you will always feel somewhat lesser than all the rich students."
College Freshman,2,"Most students drink or smoke and it's very evident.  Students smoke weed in the open and are never caught.  The drinking is very evident, especially at the start of the school year.  Students are all walking around East Fifth, party hopping, and the police just drive around.  They step in when someone is in trouble, but if nothing seems dangerous or happens, they don't do anything.  The policy enforcement for getting cited is very serious, and there are meetings and counseling sessions that students must attend."
College Senior,2,"There is a lot of underage drinking at this school.  Fraternities make alcohol very available, especially to females who don't wear a lot of clothing.  "
College Senior,2,There is not much of a local atmosphere at all.
College Freshman,2,"There is a huge presence of marijuana, and 95% of the student body drinks here. "
College Freshman,2,"Most of the off campus dining consists of pizza, chinese, and bar food. You can't get into the bars at night if you're under 21, so that definitely limits the options. There are only two late-night dining options, and they consist of one on-campus dining facility, and a convenience store."
College Senior,2,"The off campus houses are pretty much all the same, some nicer than others, but the rent therefore is more. A couple developers have come in and have started buying up a lot of the properties, running up the rent in the area. The safety in the area is very poor. Students living off campus are routinely mugged, or have their homes broken into by locals. "
College Sophomore,2,"As a non-greek, I am pretty indifferent about greek groups. They throw decent parties and certainly have a presence on campus, but I never felt pressured to join a chapter.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Although its a little sketchy at times, there are a few fun things off campus to do. A lot of good hole in the wall restaurants and what not."
College Sophomore,2,They don't give a ton of financial aid out - lots of work.
College Freshman,2,There is a very large Jewish population on campus and most of the students are from the Northeast.  However there are quite a few foreign students as well as a great mix of people from across the country.
College Sophomore,2,"Not much parking, expensive and not super gorgeous or big houses."
College Sophomore,2,"They have been cracking down way too much.  They bust parties now for no reason other than to not let any parties happen on campus, which is stupid because everybody has parties off campus instead and its a lot more dangerous because the local town is not exactly the safest when it comes to muggings, especially of drunk kids trying to walk home.  It's just becoming more and more strict."
College Sophomore,2,"If you think you can get away with parking in a meter spot or permit spot without paying/ having the permit for maybe even just 10 minutes and not get caught, you're unfortunately wrong. The parking guys here are super strict and parking in a permit spot without one will get you a $50 ticket. There is not a lot of parking available either, and freshmen do not get cars. However the campus is small enough that you can get away with walking everywhere you go."
College Sophomore,2,"They are not that bad, at least the ones in walking distance.  There is really no much variety close by and nobody really wants to walk anywhere.  There are a ton of food options if you have a car and either go to the Promenade (a series of outside malls) or go to Airport road mall area."
College Sophomore,2,"Really crappy town right outside of Lehigh, really bad neighborhood that has fallen into poverty pretty much because of the closing of the Beth steel mill.  There are a few good food options and the area where all the Seniors and such live off campus are great for partying and only contain Lehigh students which is good."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much diversity.  But we have plenty of groups and frats and clubs that increase the diversity on campus (UMOJA, LGBTQIA, etc.)."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman living on campus, you are not allowed to bring your car on campus. If you commute, you have to purchase a parking permit for $50 to park on mountaintop and take a bus back to campus. If you don't want to park up there you pay $250 to park at Zoellner. Ridiulous pricing...."
College Senior,2,Off Campus Is Dangerous – lehigh brownies do not do a good job of patrolling off campus and there are break ins often
College Sophomore,2,Just OK – If I could do it over again I dont know if I would.  Classes are miserable and you can never understand your professors as they are foreign.  The school administration is extremely out of touch and its impossible to try and get anything done.  The only good thing is the friends you make here and the great times you have with them and even at that its hard to find quality people here.
College Sophomore,2,Bethlehem PA – Most of what to do on or around campus is related to drinking.
College Freshman,2,"Dangerous neighborhoods, not very nice houses, and a lot of problems with townies (such a break-ins)."
College Sophomore,2,Get Ready to Get Tickets – Police are on top of giving tickets if you are parked somewhere you are not supposed to. You cannot get a parking pass legally until you are a sophomore with some exceptions. Otherwise if you park somewhere you are not supposed to be you will definitely get a ticket.
College Sophomore,2,Mostly rich white people from northern New Jersey.
College Sophomore,2,not a whole lot – mostly upper middle class white kids. not necessarily a bad thing but more diversity could make the community more interesting
College Freshman,2,"My least favorite part about Lehigh is the conformity. Everywhere you look, everyone looks the same. Our diversity level barley exists, and much of the campus consists of the rich, white kids who all join Greek life. As an athlete at Lehigh this is easy to see, because most students seem to either join a Fraternity/ Sorority, or join an athletic team. My favorite experiences all come from being a part of Lehigh Athletics."
College Junior,2,"I Think I'll Walk, I Don't Want a Ticket. Parking at Lehigh is a hot topic of discussion. It is very hard to understand the meter system and people often complain of officer being either beyond strict when giving tickets and sometimes not present. So you never know how it will turn out for your wallet when parking at Lehigh."
Sophomore,1,"Professors don’t care or understand how to use the resources the university boasts about, they also lie about the method of instruction"
Sophomore,1,"Literally do not come here, I am a tour guide, I know how they get you, but the administration does not care about the students, and they are systematically trying to destroy Greek life, including chapters who have done nothing wrong. Don’t listen to what they tell you, the name isn’t worth the torture of having an administration that only cares about money and not their students."
Freshman,1,"Lehigh did not provide a streamlined plan for online learning, leaving individual professors to figure it out for themselves. So some classes continued, and some classes pretty much stopped happening. Not ideal."
Freshman,1,"Do not attend this school if you do not plan to party! There is nothing to do if you don't drink, and even if you aren't a part of that culture it will hamper your ability to learn. It is that pervasive. 

Also, do not come here if you are disabled. Any kind of disabled, not just physically. They lie about what services they provide and deliberately force you out. 

Same for being LGBT+ or a person of color"
Niche User,1,"Where do I even begin. I went into this school thinking it would be an academic place where people cared about schoolwork, as they made it seem. I was in utter shock when I arrived to find that all anyone cares about is partying, drugs and alcohol. I am always open to a party and all that comes with it, but the way Lehigh University does it is disgusting. As a woman I was treated like an object constantly. My mental health was obliterated. I tried talking to a counselor and- after they TURNED me away after begging for an appointment- they finally let me see a counselor who was no help at all. I became so depressed I couldn't leave my bed and missed counseling sessions. There was no follow up or any care the faculty/ adults expressed when I was in a dangerous state. I had to leave and had nightmares about returning. Please please please think if this is the right environment for you. I would never want anyone to go through what I did. I wish someone would've waned me."
Freshman,1,"I came to Lehigh with high hopes but I'm miserable here. Never have I seen such snotty, rich, and rude students. Students drive $60,000 cars 40 MPH around the campus and practically run you down. The diversity is lacking, and overwhelmingly white (though I am white myself) and the campus is very conservative. Everyone looks and dresses the same, being different is simply frightening here. The surrounding town is run down and depressing. The only thing that most people talk about is parties... 80% of the students here drink (Campus Survey). Students are constantly in the hospital for drinking. If you do not drink or do not want to be involved in Greek life, do not come here, you will feel like an alien. I feel like a prisoner trapped on this campus since freshman cannot bring cars and I'm far from home. The dorms are too small. I have to deal with unfit conditions, such as mold in the showers, mold on my heating/AC unit, etc. Academics are good. I feel unsafe and miserable."
College Freshman,1,I am a big weightlifter and very into fitness and the one thing I have to say about the gym is that it sucks.  D- at best.  Everything at Taylor gym is awful.  The equiptment is old and outdated.
College Freshman,1,There's a clear divide between Greek and non-Greek
College Freshman,1,Bethlehem police ticket the cars if meters run out.  Metered parking
College Junior,1,"The campus has become so strict in the past 4 years, hardly no frat really party on the hill anymore.  BBQ's are so hard to host and have them last for more than an hour.  The school is so strict with stupid things like if you have a party you can't have any hard alcohol and if you get busted like once your already under probation."
College Senior,1,Parking is terrible and expensive.  There are never any spots and no matter where you are you usually get a ticket.  I was parked in a lto on a Saturday and got a 50 dollar ticket.  I didn't pay it.
College Freshman,1,"You can never find a spot, and if you do, it's pretty far away."
College Senior,1,Safety is a major concern. Living off campus in Bethlehem you have to be vigilant of your surroundings. Lehigh Police does all they can to curb the crime but Bethlehem Police are more worried about the underage drinking than the crime ridden area. 
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are really expensive, and even with them you need to pay for meter parking on campus. I never drive to class because I don't want to pay for parking"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lehigh Parking Services is out to get you. They charge a lot for permits and constant patrol to give tickets. If you need to park, pay and do it legally."
College Senior,1,"On-campus permits are unreasonably expensive and you still have to feed the meters which are only slightly different in color but somehow students are expected to know which one they can park at and between which hours. So I have to pay $3.00 to go to a three hour class that I'm already paying thousands of dollars for and there are very few parking spots to begin with, everything is reserved for staff and the Parking Authority is ruthless."
College Sophomore,1,"Life as an Engineer Is Crap – Imaging going to all scientific classes, but they are all the worst kind of science. 
Memorize equations and never learn what it is you are doing and you may be fine. The TAs, mostly all attendees of the same program,have very little clue of the logic behind the topic. And the professor seems adamantly against the teaching of anything more than what would be required to get a good grade on a standardized exam."
College Sophomore,1,"you definitely want a car on campus after freshman year, but it's expensive and people get ticketed all the time"
College Senior,1,"Police Need to Get to Work – We have an accredited police force, which is saying something for the small size of our campus. However, while the officers are nice and do care about the school, they need to stop focusing on the parties and start patrolling the campus. In the last couple of years, muggings have been increasing and moving farther and farther on to campus. The Greek houses have also had several break-ins recently, along with the off-campus houses. The student would rather see the cops spend money on hiring additional patrol officers than buying themselves new patrol cars and Segways. When going off campus, if you in a group, you're fine, but you need to be aware of your surroundings–the neighborhood around the school can get kinda sketchy. The health center is great. Make an appointment because walk-ins can take a while, but the nurses and doctors there are friendly and do an excellent job taking care of the students. They get an A."
College Freshman,1,"Danger in Winter! It snows here, and we rarely have class canceled. I understand we live close enough to all make it to class, but it is simply not safe, seeing that we have to walk up and down hills with ice and snow covering the ground."

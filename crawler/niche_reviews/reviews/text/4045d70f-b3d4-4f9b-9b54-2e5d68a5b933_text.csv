Sophomore,5,"My online experience at Bowling Green was interesting to say the less. When the pandemic started the transition from face to face classes to online classes was a smooth one.

Overall, the transition was amazing and seem to be ahead of everything that was going on."

Niche User,5,I will be an incoming freshman.  The staff was wonderful during our campus visit.  They provided a great overall view of the campus and housing.  The University offered a great President's Day event where you could talk to someone from every department.  It was a great place to have your questions answered about anything.  I actually got to talk with students and their experiences at the University.  This event had classes that you could go to that taught you about the different things involved in the college experience.  Transportation was provided throughout the campus which gave you a better idea of the entire campus and surrounding area.
Freshman,5,"Bowling Green has been an excellent college to visit. As a senior high school student who's dream college is to go to Bowling Green, I have seen such wonderful ways that Bowling Green has really made me push and decide to go there. One of the reasons is safety. It is one of the safest schools in Ohio. As a person of color, I appreciate the effort they put into advertising diversity. One way they prove this is the yearly diversity fair they offer during the second week of school at the beginning of the school year. The community is perfect for students who want to get away from home yet still have a home."
Freshman,5,"Good faculty, nice campus! Everyone is welcoming. Housing is good, and tuition is not bad for everything the university offers you."
Freshman,5,"I   liked feeling included my first semester as an incoming freshman it was very intimidating, but I   quickly made friends and felt very wanted there like I   was meant to be there."

Freshman,5,BGSU is a great university with a lot to offer to each student. Diversity and Equality is highly valued.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman transfer student at Bowling Green State University. I am a legacy to this school my grandma, mother, and sister all graduated from this University."

Niche User,5,Bowling Green State university is a beautiful campus. It was an awesome educational experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
Freshman,5,"From the visit I went on, I think Bowling Green State University is a fantastic place that offers a wide variety of opportunities for their students. There are so many different clubs and activities to keep students involved throughout their time at the University. I plan to attend main campus in the fall, but as of right now I attend the Firelands Campus, which has also been a great place for me to start my college journey."
Niche User,5,It felt at home and I felt safe within the campus and the classrooms were new and held so much potential for me in the next 4 years!
Niche User,5,As a high school student I took College Credit Plus classes here and was met with a very helpful staff and very kind professors. Scheduling was made stress free while the person who helped to schedule me was still helpful and understanding. I took General Education classes there and they transferred smoothly to another college and the transfer was completed online and for a small fee payable on a credit card.
Niche User,5,Bowling Green State University was great college visit. Everyone was so nice and welcoming and they made my experience more interesting.
Junior,5,BGSU is a great school for business and education majors. It is affordable and much more generous than other schools when it comes to the freshman academic scholarship. Campus is very pretty and everything is very centrally located.
Freshman,5,I am in the Inclusive Early Childhood Education major and I love how I  am introduced to various classroom settings as a first year. The faculty here at BGSU are always welcoming and available when I need assistance. I do wish that the groups and organizations at BGSU were more known in the beginning of the year; I am halfway through the first semester and I still do no know what organizations there are.
Senior,5,"I met with the counselor of Bowling Green! She was very sweet and did so well with making the school sound like a great place away from home! There is so many different activities and clubs to choose from! Who couldn't forget about Friday night light, as well!"
Freshman,5,"The tour guides were so open to any and all questions. They told you anything you needed to know and were honest with you. I loved the campus because it was not spread out at all and all the buildings had a meaning. For example, the library looks like a book shelf."
Alum,5,"I loved this place so much, I’m going back to get my masters. I honestly think this school was worth the $29,000 in debt I’m in. The schooling is great, campus life is great and the social life is great. Nothing better than -40 degrees in the winter and 95 in the summer. Seriously, a place worth going to."
Freshman,5,"Bowling Green State University is a fantastic experience for students. It has many amenities on campus, including two all-you-can-eat dining halls, a recreation center, and a huge library with many learning opportunities! I would recommend BGSU to anyone who wants to get a college degree and have an enjoyable time doing it. The campus is small, but gorgeous, and everyone is very kind and helpful. In conclusion, come to BGSU!"
Freshman,5,"When I took a tour to Bowling Green State University, I felt like I was a part of their community. I was tended to, and made feel like I was special among 1,000's of other students. I loved the size of the campus; not too big, not too small. They have a hospital right across the street in case of emergencies, and specific colleges for any interest you might have. Bowling Green State University feels like home."
Sophomore,5,"The faculty is super helpful towards any problem that may come up. My advisor helped me set up a four-year plan before I even started my first semester here to ensure that I graduated on time, and she helped me move it around when I told her I wanted to study abroad for a semester. I am still on track to graduate in four years!"
Freshman,5,It was great! Beautiful campus and amazing opportunities! The staff was extremely helpful with all questions and concerns that I had. The tour guide was enthusiastic and made visiting fun and easy. These were the best dorms that I have seen after visiting many schools. The campus life was amazing and I was impressed with how well kept the school was. This is a big school with a small time feel. It welcomes its students and makes sure they feel at home.
Sophomore,5,"After everything that I experienced in the past year, I couldn’t be more grateful for BGSU. I had to cancel my enrollment in 2018 due to health, but BG continued to connect with me and reach out regarding plans, deadlines, and my well being. Because of that, I am finally on campus and enrolled full time a year later. Not only do administrators and advisors go above and beyond, but President Rodgers, himself, makes an effort to be involved and engaged with students—he will be all over campus doing things from serving lunch at a picnic to watching a soccer game. Also, BGSU does a great job of taking intentional steps toward waste-reduction and having an increasingly green campus."
Junior,5,"Bowling Green State University has been great to me, and the professors have always gone above and beyond to help me when i needed it."
Junior,5,The only thing I would change about Bowling Green is how many trees they have planted so there can be more shade on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity of this campus. I originally started off at the Firelands branch and it saved me a ton of money. The staff was very engaging and genuinely concerned about my experience, education, and happiness there and it really impacted how much I enjoyed being there. It's definitely different from high school."
Freshman,5,"Bowling gives a tremendous feel of ease to the student while telling them they are safe when they study here. With the uses of the tremendous campus feel and the diverse student body, Bowling Green is no match for any nearby colleges."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community of Bowling Green, everyone is very supportive of the students, and is a very safe town. There is so much to do around the campus for free. We have many clubs, sports teams, and greek life. There is a lot of different food options and on and off campus, so you will never be left hungry."
Sophomore,5,I love BGSU! I have been taking CCP courses through BGSU since my sophomore year of high school and fell in love with the university. I am now a student studying Early Childhood Education and love my major!
Senior,5,Bowling Green State University is a beautiful and friendly campus with many opportunities for everyone to grow not only as a student but also as a person. I highly recommend this university to anyone!
Niche User,5,"I loved the tour that I had at BGSU. My tour guide was so nice and knowledgeable about the school. It was never a question that she didn’t know the answer to. The campus was beautiful, not too big and not too small."
Freshman,4,I honestly haven't had any problems with Bowling Green in the time that I've been here. The campus and staff overall are very nice. Granted with COVID-19 I haven't been able to be on campus for classes to meet new people but it's honestly and a great school with great teachers and students. I also feel that Bowling Green is doing a great job of enforcing the mask rules. The spread of COVID-19 has been kept at a minimum for the most part and our numbers are going down. It's been hard to make a whole lot of friends and get to know people for of the virus but Bowling Green has given us so many different ways and options to meet new people and a lot of them are virtual that way we don't even have to be around others if we don't want to. I don't live on campus but some of my friends do and they have said that the dorms are great and that all the RA's are nice and are doing a great job of not letting a bunch of people traveling in and out of dorms.
Freshman,4,I am currently taking most of my classes online and it is a learning experience for both students and teachers. I overall think everyone learning fairly easy and the professors and very easy to work with.
Freshman,4,"I chose this school because of the welcoming nature of it. Their art major really felt like home and even though it is online, I still happen to feel that way. Most professors are helpful and as long as you put in the work, you are likely to succeed. Everyone at this school really cares about students well being, offering free mental health counseling. Being in a learning community definitely helps with meeting more people and I am very thankful to be in Arts Village. When I first moved in it felt very isolating but with this learning community, I met more friends and felt more excited about what I was going to learn."
Alum,4,"I only took a couple online classes during my time at BGSU. Most of my classes were on campus and in person. However, I feel as though they were alright. Most of the work was busy work, so I don't feel as though I learned as much as in my in-person classes."
Alum,4,"well prepared online classes that meet the flexibility that students need to succeed, faculty accessible."
Alum,4,"great school with lots of tradition while meeting the future, different courses that challenge students"
Sophomore,4,Online classes are pretty easily navigated and lots of resources are available. Would recommend to friends who struggle with other online classes at other universities
Freshman,4,"I had to take all my classes in my last semester at BGSU online due to COVID-19. They were all transitioned to an online format relatively well. However, some teachers very clearly tried less than others to help their students through the transition."
Alum,4,The class sizes generally allow for a good ratio between faculty and students. The campus itself is beautiful and well-kept. There are plenty of organizations and activities on campus for people of any and all interests.
Freshman,4,The students and the staff are very welcoming and nice. They care very much for your well being and that you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"My overall online experience was satisfactory due to the faculty making the transition easier. While I might have struggled in the beginning, as time went on I was able to get right back on track and continue my learning experience. For the most part, my professors understood how students’ were feeling anxious and stressed during this time. I felt that they responded appropriately And adjusted to help accommodate us while also remaining steadfast in their own learning process. Just as it was a stressful and anxious time for the students, I’m sure the faculty were feeling the same, or at least somewhat similar feelings. 
I thought that the online learning experience was good so I continued to register for online summer classes and am currently taking them right now."
Junior,4,"I transferred to Bowling Green State University from Kent State University and it has been an outstanding experience. I feel more at home at BGSU and the university staff made the transfer a very easy process and before too long I felt like I'd been there for my entire college career. The professors are extremely helpful both in and out of class and create an atmosphere that makes you excited to learn and continue to learn. The student life is also excited, there's so many opportunities and ways to be involved on campus with your peers and there is plenty to do both academically and ""just for fun""."
Freshman,4,"I overall have great confidence in bowling green that I will graduate from there in four years. In good academic standing all four year , as well as the campus has really treated me well I feel like home there. I would say that I been having a very fun and enjoyable time at BG also being able to continue my studies at a high level. What I have learned at BG is not only good for the classroom but also teaching me in the real world skills. I really could say that BG is one of the best universities in the USA and I really value that I am able to attend this wonderful university."
Junior,4,It is a very open campus with friendly people. BGSU does spend a lot of money on other majors/sports rather than the Arts.
Freshman,4,"Bowling Green does a great job helping incoming freshman prepare for college, the only issue is with financial aid, they dont want to take the time to explain or work with students.  However, the bursars office is very helpful and takes time with students."
Freshman,4,I like all the different degrees they have for their student and how big the campus is. I love how they are respectful for minorities. I do wish they had more gender neutral bathrooms and more ways for the Queer community to get involved in campus activities.
Freshman,4,I love BGSU! The campus and town is the perfect size to meet new people but also run into people you know. Would recommend anyone who does not want a big city feel to come to BGSU.
Alum,4,"BGSU was definitely a good school to go to  as an undergraduate student. I majored in music, and I feel I received training on par with a private conservatory. The school was also affordable, and if you have good grades as a high school student, you will likely get a decent scholarship package."
Niche User,4,"Bowling Green caught my eye from the beginning of my college search. Compared to other universities I explored, they did a phenomenal job of presenting their university in the best light and of showing me what they can do for my education. I also fell in love with the Moore Music Hall and I have yet to have a negative experience with any of the staff. They location is a tad windy so you'll need to bundle up but even the cold cannot take away from the level of education the school will provide for you."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Bowling Green State University has been very positive. Most stores and restaurants are within walking distance from the campus so I don't have to travel very far. I also appreciate that the campus isn't too big so I don't get lost very easily. I also like the fact that we have our own food court consisting of Panda Express, Steak n Shake and a few others. The campus is very beautiful and well maintained. One of the downsides however, is housing. I live in one of the oldest dorms which is called Kreischer. this dorm does not have air conditioning so sometimes the summer heat can be unbearable. The rooms are also small but I don't have a problem with that. In fact, I prefer smaller rooms. Kreischer is also near where most of my classes are and I think it's the most conveniently placed dorm on campus."
Junior,4,"Faculty and Staff value the education of all undergraduate and graduate students. Class sizes can vary from small to large. Campus is incredibly convenient. Every building you will need to be at is within a three to five minute walk. Dorms are all very nice. Resources at the school are available for all students (internet, recreation center, computer labs, etc.). Downtown is very close to campus and has many different things for students to do. I would recommend BGSU to any students who are near the campus."
Sophomore,4,Math program. Get rid of Aleks and find a different way to teach math. Add more student parking. Have better food options and make the dining halls have simple foods instead of disgusting complicating foods.
Sophomore,4,"I am 100% at home at BGSU!
The Bowling Green community, both on and off campus, truly shows up when it is time for a local festival, homecoming celebration, or weekend hockey or football game (Talons up!) which brings so much life and belonging to campus! Additionally, the wide array of ways to get involved on campus mean that when the HW is done, there is usually going to be something that you can go do. The school is lower in cost, but that is NOT a reflection of the quality of education--if anything, it just means that students are getting a good value, because the instruction at BGSU is very good, and every year the campus integrates more and more student resources. For having as many students and programs as they do, I am also pleasantly surprised by the accessibility of faculty and staff. Usually, all it takes is an email or visit to office hours to have one-on-one communication. For me, that has made a particular impact on my success!"
Freshman,4,"Clean, safe, cold, but good professors and decent classes. Food is alright, meal plan is a rip off though and for first year students it’s even worse."
Freshman,4,"There is mold in Founders. The food in dining halls is okay, it is usually cold. The campus is sort of pretty, but really cold and windy.  Some teachers are better than others and some classes are better than others, but that happens on any campus. i am in the honors college and some of the classes required for that stink. Some critical thinking classes are good but mine is really boring. Also as an education major, I can't really take any classes outside of my major, because so many classes are required for my major. It is good that they are striving for academic excellence for teachers, but it would be nice to take an art class or political science class.  The athletic teams aren't very good, but Falcons After Dark every Friday is usually fun and a good alternative if you don't want to party."
Junior,4,"Bowling Green is a very pretty looking school with several buildings recently renovated or in the process of renovation. The education quality is great, especially for the low price. There are lots of activities going on for those who are interested. Overall, a great school and has something for everyone."
Freshman,4,"Very good school, Love it! It has its problems but overall, its a pretty good school. Academics are on point here. And the Dorms are very nice, you dont have to cross mainroads to get to classes everything is fit."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere of the university there is always something going on. I enjoy the professors I have and their willingness to work with students. They are really challenging classes that are hard but it really helps me connect it to the real world. I have never thought about transferring and I really have enjoyed my time here so far and I am excited to finish my degree here.
Freshman,4,"Very friendly, accommodating, and made me feel at home. Don't like that I live 30 minutes away (in Michigan) and have to pay an additional $8,000 for out-of-state tuition. University of Toledo is in-state for Monroe County, MI residents, why isn't BGSU?"
Junior,4,"Honest, helpful professors. Fun environment and is a small town feel while being a bigger college. You have a lot of options on what you want to do or joint because student life is a huge part of BG"
Freshman,4,"Bowling Green State Univeristy is a good college. The campus is pretty and there are quite a bit of things to do here. The sports teams are pretty good, especially hockey."
Niche User,4,"the campus tour was nice, the emails where very informational and not spam. they could have gave more personal phone calls to keep up with the students. They gave good letters and leaflits threw the mail."
Niche User,4,Bowling Green State University has a lot to offer for me with the ability to get me to my future job of being an airline pilot. Bowling Green has a great college town vibe where i can make new friends and open myself up to a new environment. I wish to go there but the student loans are a lot to look at and figure out how to pay for. My dream job is to fly airplanes and i believe Bowling Green can get me there.
Freshman,4,"It's true what everyone's saying-- this is definitely a party school. It may not seem like that at first, but if you make friends with certain people, the parties never stop. There's not a lot to do here except for drink and eat. There's like 30 bars downtown plus 30 restuarants so of course everyones partying every weekend. Most professors are pretty chill. So are other students. Even though we are lowkey in the middle of no where I think it's a pretty great school."
Freshman,4,The environment on campus is usually calm and study based. The library is my favorite place on campus because of how many diverse floors there are depending on a students need. The professors work with each student even in big lecture halls. Living on campus is helpful at least for the first year because of all the resources. There are convient stores throughout campus that you can pay with either a meal plan or money. Nothing is limited to a meal plan.
Freshman,4,"I like BGSU and it offers you many opportunities to get involved! The classes are understandable. The professors are nice to talk to. Walking to another class doesn't take much time. BGSU is very safe around. The only thing I would change if I had to is the school Wifi. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. If you don't have unlimited data, the school wifi makes you stressful, especially during the exam week! But other than that, BGSU makes your college lives great!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, Bowling Green State University is a great place. The students and staff are extremely friendly; everyone is willing to help each other. The academics are good for the most part. Some teachers can be hard to understand or may not know the material extremely well, but they still try to help you in whatever way they can and are typically very understanding. Bowling Green State University is located in a safe town and feels like home. Everyone is welcome no matter their race, class, or gender."
Freshman,4,"It is a very good school attend, with a wide selection of course that can be taken and activities that can be done. The people at the school are great to be around everyone is friend and everyone wants the other to succeed. When you become a Falcon you become part of a huge family."
Freshman,4,"i would like to see more diversity , the food is really good plus there are a lot of food places around the campus to eat at. the parties are fun"
Freshman,4,"My experience here at BGSU is amazing because the professors works one on one with students that needs more understanding. Also, everyone on campus are very friendly."
Junior,4,"I love the campus and atmosphere of the people. There are plenty of clubs, organizations, and opportunities for every kind of student. Nightlife is amazing, with the greatest people and service. The only downside to Bowling Green State University is that it is in the middle of corn fields, but once you get into town, there are plenty of new people to meet and plenty of new experiences to have. It is an amazing school that has provided me with the best education. I could not have asked for a better campus or town to base my education out of."
Sophomore,4,"The experience At bowling green was wonderful. I’ve learned How to be responsible and independent. The students and staff are very friendly , the campus is big but small it’s not hard finding classes once you walk around enough . I’m upset that I left and will be returning soon . “Once a falcon always a falcon”."
Senior,4,"It's a medium sized school, almost 20,000 students. 
Nice campus, not too big or small. 
In a small town with good food and bars. 
Most professors are great and really know their stuff. People are nice."
Sophomore,4,BGSU is a great college! It offers a wide variety of activities. I enjoy my classes and am learning a great deal toward my major. I believe that anyone would find that Bowling Green State University is an ideal place for anyone to get their college education. The cost is very reasonable and my program is one of a kind.
Junior,4,"BGSU has been a really great place to grow. I am really glad that I chose this school, it has a friendly environment and good people. I have learned a lot since I have moved here so far, the science department is great."
Senior,4,"I fell in love with BGSU when i first moved in as a freshman. It is a change of pace from growing up in a big city, but absolutely worth the experience."
Sophomore,4,"BGSU is a very good college for undergraduates who are looking for not only good academics, but also a good social life. The college of business is one of the best in the country, and it’s definitely one of the reasons why I love BG so much. There’s also so much to do on campus. Sure, there’s the Greek life, and the parties. But there’s also a ton of different clubs and intramurals you can join. Is the university perfect? No, there’s definitely some mild problems. The dining halls serve subpar food (but there are quite a few different food choices). And the guidance counselors should really try to be more helpful towards the first year students, who I’ve heard many complaints about not knowing about some key amenities. But besides those minor issues, Bowling Green State is definitely a top tier university."
Junior,4,Very fun college to go to and a great place to study. The college tuition can be up there in pricing but the community is great and the professors.
Graduate Student,4,"As a Fulbright student at BGSU (2010-2012), I enjoyed my student life and loved most of the seminars I took, if not all. The American Cultures Studies program from which I graduated was pivotal in my academic experience and development."
Sophomore,4,I really like the campus life of bowling green state. The campus is beautiful and the people who work there are friendly and helpful. There is a wide range of majors offered.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Bowling Green State University is a great school. The school caters to those majoring in Business. The campus is pretty safe, although there is not much to do for fun."
Senior,4,"Everything about this university is great, other than the administration.  They have taken out the bookstore, you know where you buy your textbooks for a class in order to succeed.  So unfortunately for students, you will be seen as merely a dollar sign to the administration of BGSU.  Other than that the university is great."
Junior,4,"This college has a beautiful campus and helpful staff. I would like to see a more student/ user-friendly website interface, especially when researching specific program and class requirements/details."
Freshman,4,"Bowling Green State University has a big campus but it is not overwhelming. After awhile, the whole campus starts to feel like home, and you feel like you belong."
Niche User,4,"When I visited earlier this year, it was a very open and warm welcome.  I honestly loved the set up of the campus.  Everyone welcomed me with open arms and the school from what I had heard was good.  I am not going to attend but it is definitely a very good school."
Niche User,4,"I enrolled at Bowling Green State University in the Fall of 2012. I originally planned to attend this school because of my best friend who was also accepted to BGSU, but she ended up not attending. I was scared to attend by myself - but my opening weekend group slowly immersed me into what would become my new home. Friendships formed, clubs were joined, and classes were attended (most of them) and I was able to grow into the person I am today. Joining a sorority helped give me leadership opportunities, such as being the Philanthropy chair and planning events to benefit Autism Speaks. This leadership opportunity was a key topic of discussion during my job interview for being a special educator. BGSU has so many opportunities to take advantage of."
Freshman,4,"It's great! There are no major complaints except in one dorm, Kreischer, there is no airconditioning and very little insulation. It gets very hot and very cold."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment of campus. The education in very good. I would love to see more students showing school spirit, but the University has a good atmosphere about it."
Senior,4,BGSU is a great school. My favorite part about this school was the close-knit community and recreation center.
Freshman,4,Bowling Green has a great student community. The campus itself is small so it's nice to be able to walk only 10 minutes to get to class.
Senior,2,"My professors at BGSU have been great.  I have never come across one that has not been exceptional.  The campus is we'll kept, if not always under construction and severely lacking in housing.  However the BGSU administration has been an absolute nightmare the entire time I have attended this university.  I had some confusion with my high school French courses which took three years to sort out.  In the mean time, I lost my love for the language and lost my desire to learn further.  In addition, it seems that the administration has actively worked against my graduation.  I have tried in vain to declare my minor for a year so that I could graduate at a certain time. I made sure they knew this, but still took so long that my graduation window closed and I may have to wait another semester to graduate.  So, if your circumstances are anything less than perfect, or you somehow plan to avoid all problems during your time in college, I highly recommend that you consider going somewhere else."
Freshman,2,"To start with the good, first of all, the campus and facilities are very nice and modern. Everything on campus including the outdoor areas are extremely well kept and all the computer technology on campus is modern and fast. All of the professors that I have had so far are passionate about what they teach and wanting the students to succeed as well as they can. The University is very money hungry and they do not react in any pleasant manner to attempts to save money or spend less time/money at the university. The food halls and meal plans are scarce and malnourished and the rooms cost too much for their size and quality. While there are less negative aspects to the university on a quantitative level, the negative aspects are ones that are interacted with daily making the experience at the university a very frustrating one."
Niche User,2,"Very easy school to succeed at. Easy classes, nice professors. Night life is lame and the same thing every weekend. People are boring and most of the time very unintelligent."
Alum,2,"I went to BG to become a teacher. In my Junior year, I had some issues with a Field placement. Come Senior year, I think everything is going just fine. I then have a meeting with Student Success team and out of nowhere, I am removed from the program and will be graduating a semester early. No  teaching license and no clue as to where it all went wrong. They were helpful in getting me through the process."
Senior,2,This was a terrible college for me to start at. My advisors were constantly changed and were never helpful. Staff is extremely difficult to stay in contact with because they all seem to be too busy to bother with their students whether they are trying to get ahead or just catch up. I wish I never would have gone here and I'm happy to say that I am transferring to a much more involved and helpful school.
Freshman,2,"It's an okay school nothing to brag about, though. There's really a lack of diversity they always talk about it but I see no proof of it. The first week I was here I was already thinking about transfering and still am. It's really boring here, and there's not much to do. Definetly would not choose this school again!"
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life does not seem to have a very positive look in BG. They post nasty things on social media towards each other, and their housing is currently under construction and greek students have been displaced unfairly. Some sororities have been kicked off campus due to lack of popularity and bias towards their physical appearances which I believe just feeds the negative stereotype."
College Junior,2,"BGSU might work for some people, but the school is very sub-par. Academics are average, campus is ugly, the people are not friendly, food is good though. Overall if your if you want a plain, cheap, college experience BGSU is for you. There are certainly better schools in Ohio, aesthetically and academically such as Miami or OSU. I knew within 5 minuets of being at the BGSU campus that this school is nothing special."
College Freshman,2,I think all The perspectives we need to take is a waste of money. They don't apply to my major nor do they teach me anything useful.
College Freshman,2,"I ran cross country at Bowling Green and the Coach I was recruited by took a new job somewhere else two weeks before the season started. They didn't hire anyone till 6 weeks later and they interview one person only, then hired him. The new coach said he took the job to make his resume look good. I now am no longer on the team, he cared little for my health and was verbal mean and awful."
College Freshman,2,"Around campus, some fraternities are notorious for nefarious things and give greek life a bad name. Otherwise there are some greek groups that do great things."
College Freshman,2,The noise level gets out of control. The bath rooms are gross and there isn't much space.
College Freshman,2,Lots of drinking in the dorms
College Freshman,2,I am not a part of it and the members are very snobby.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you are seeking a degree in business, education, or the medical field, recruitment and internship/job opportunities are pretty great. Any art-related fields barely have any recruitment, if any. Also, there isn't much help from the school in helping find an internship or job. Haven't heard much from alumni network either."
College Sophomore,2,The Oaks and Carillon are rarely good and some food options on campus are very expensive.
College Junior,2,"They offer very little scholarships, especially in the arts program. It is rather abysmal. Applying online seems easy, but they never email you back to tell your your application was received, no matter how many times I filled it out. I would email and call them, and they would just refer me to the website until it was too plate to apply. I never got the scholarships, never heard from them or knew if they received my application, even though I submitted the application and tried to talk with them."
College Freshman,2,"The swipes are a waste of money.  I didn't get to use them all because of the timing of classes versus the AYCE operating hours and needing to study.  Next year, I'm having an all Falcon Dollars plan.  It'll be worth it."
College Freshman,2,"The food at the AYCE places is often cold or not very good. The food in the Union is usually good but it is over priced and they don't offer enough healthy options. For the first year students, we should still be able to choose what meal plan we want because there is much wasted money from leftover swipes that many people don't use."
College Student,2,There is not really a very good program to help students find internships and jobs after completing the necessary requirements at BGSU.
College Student,2,"The school itself was not challenging in my first two semesters, and the coursework could be utilized to deal with more real world problems."
College Senior,2,There are very few options and two of the dining halls have gross buffet style. Meal plans are also super expensive
College Senior,2,"Unless you live in Centennial or Falcon Heights the dorms are awful. Greek housing provided a better community environment, but BGSU refused to fix them as they deteriorated. Now they are tearing down the Greek houses while planning to build a new Greek community. Those will be fantastic, IF they ever get built"
College Junior,2,Parking Pass is very expensive along with many rules to follow and can lead to some high parking bills in a very short amount of time.
College Sophomore,2,"For the price of the buildings, and the fact that we are required to live on-campus for two years, it is not at all worth it. Living off-campus costs half as much with three times as much space. The community is great in the older style dorms such as Harshman and Kriescher, however, conditions are worse and you have two bathrooms for the whole floor. Conditions are better in the suite-style dorms, but the community is not nearly as inviting."
College Freshman,2,"There are only a couple nice dorms, the rest are pretty terrible."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to eat off campus it's mainly just chain restaurants like Tim Hortons, Panera, McDonalds, etc."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't a whole lot to do in BG, if you want to go shopping or go to a nice grocery store you're better off going to Perrysburg or Maumee."
College Sophomore,2,"always windy ! hard to get used to, but doesn't change my view about the school itself"
College Junior,2,"Once October hits, Winter officially begins and doesn't end until April. The wind is horrid, and painful."
College Junior,2,They are old and need renovated. They need new dorms.
College Junior,2,"The weather is not very pleasant. The wind is constantly blowing and the winter, like everywhere else, was bad this year."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not many scholarships and it's very hard to find them.  I got one because of my grades, but that was it."
College Student,2,"The snow makes it super hard to do anything, and the wind makes it ridiculously hard to do a thing. But when its sunny and warm there are no issues"
College Sophomore,2,Not many computer labs. Network has lots of problems because too many students are accessing it.
College Freshman,2,"Right now, it's winter and it can get REALLY cold up here, so make sure you bundle up when you go outside. Also, it's all flat so wind is common (be aware). It can really suck, but just be prepared and you should be fine."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much diversity, although I think that has a lot to do with its location. Many students that I have come in contact with are not that accepting if you are different. It's a lot like southern Ohio just 20 minutes south of big city. It can be hard to deal with at times, but there are a lot of people who are very nice, and they usually tend to be apart of the clubs that promote progressive thinking."
College Freshman,2,"There are only two parking lots for students. They are on opposite sides of campus. One is very tiny and fills up very quickly. The other is huge and you practically have to walk through corn fields to get to it. The larger one takes a while to get to, but there is at least a bus stop."
College Junior,2,BGSU has a habit of lying; also consistently messes up financial aid. 
College Junior,2,"So cold! So windy! That's why our motto is ""Roll Along!"""
College Freshman,2,There is one main parking lot for on-campus students to park and it is relatively far from the rest of campus. The school provides a shuttle to the parking lot but it is still hard to find spots to park and is very inconvenient. 
College Freshman,2,It is freezing in the winter!
College Junior,2,Be able to help yourself when it comes to financial aid otherwise you are ol.
College Freshman,2,"It's northern Ohio so it's very cold, and since it's so flat up here it is VERY windy which is extremely unpleasant. "
College Freshman,2,"It was just a confusing process for me... I don't remember much of it, I think I blocked it out haha. But it was a pain and I thought (several times) that I wouldn't be able to pull it together and get here. I did get here, though. My roommate is actually moving out at the end of fall semester because she can't attend spring semester due to a financial aid issue."
College Freshman,2,I'm stressed about it all the time...
College Freshman,2,I don't care for Greek life at all. but it's pretty big here
College Freshman,2,"during the Summer months it is very nice at BG however it is quite hot in the dorms that don't have AC, but during the winter the dorms do come equipped with heat to keep students warm. However students should be prepared to face the cold weather when walking to classes. "
College Junior,2,"The wind and cold is awful, makes you want to stay in"
College Freshman,2,you rarely hear from the black greeks on campus
College Freshman,2,"It's a very small town, can suck if that's not what you're used to."
College Sophomore,2,"A majority of the on campus dining locations do not open until 11:00am on weekdays.  By that time I have missed breakfast and am still in class when they do open.  The weekends are even worse when the dining locations do not open until noon.  The dining locations are not accessible when they are needed.  The prices are off the charts.  When asking why that is they tell us that their products come from high quality vendors.  Last time I checked, processed chicken is processed chicken no matter how you look at it.  I would rather have spaghetti from the grocery store than have spaghetti that costs as much as if I were to go eat at a restaurant.  There are several good food items that I do enjoy regardless of the price.  However, most if not all of the food offered has mostly carbs and is not the healthiest.  Because of the limited hours of the food locations I feel as though I have been tricked into buying a meal plan that I am not able to spend at times which I should be able to.  I should be able to have breakfast before my early morning classes.  Instead I am forced to wait until 11:00 am every day.         "
College Senior,2,had a terrible selection for spring semeter biology courses for my major
College Sophomore,2,"If you live in Kohl, Centennial, or Founders get a parking services map and find Lot 15. Much closer than Lot 12. "
College Sophomore,2,The weather in BG is bi-polar as ever. But this is Northwest Ohio so I knew what to expect. Try not to get blown away. 
College Junior,2,They arent too strict but when it comes to parking services that a whole different story
College Senior,2,I hate that we pay for printing now. 
College Senior,2,I dont think campus is too strict. 
College Sophomore,2,"Parking sucks, but there are heated shuttles stops that students can wait at until the shuttle comes and  drops them in front of their dorms. "
College Sophomore,2,We have many computers and laptops available. You don't really need to buy your own unless you want to do homework in you room or a study spot. I have my own because sometimes the labs in the dorms are noisy. The wireless network runs differently based on your browser .
Sophomore,1,I felt as if the majority of my professors just added more busy work after classes switched to online. Communicating only over email with professors was also a problem I faced.
Graduate Student,1,I would not recommend it. The quality of teaching is so bad. I am international student from Egypt and I learned from my home country more than I learned in BGSU.
Junior,1,"Bowling Green takes advantage of the disabled and struggling for profit. 

I still cannot access my transcripts years later due to disabilites, ALL I HAVE IS DEBT with nothing to show for it, no job prospects.

NOBODY CARES, and if they do they have no authority to affect change.

This college will ruin your life and feed you lies to convince you to go into debt as long as it puts money in their pocket. Avoid if you value your future!"
Freshman,1,"I hated my experience at BGSU. I went here my freshman year . The freshman dorms are super small and no air conditioner. The guidance counselors are very unhelpful. Some good teachers depending on your major. Other than going to parties the campus is pretty boring and dead especially on the weekends since most people go home however the campus is nice, clean and kept up with well. The dining halls are not very good and they make a whole bunch of random food no one likes. The city of Bowling Green itself is very quaint and not much to do. You have to drive at least 30 mins to the nearest city. The police love pulling you over, writing tickets and searching rooms. I also became very sick and the hospital discharged me even though I was still in bad shape. I have now tranferred schools and it was the best decision I made. I could not have survived 4 years there. Highly wouldn't recommend going here."
College Freshman,1,Hall director is terrible and shouldn't have a job
College Sophomore,1,The way BGSU handle financial aid and helping it's students is ridiculous. All they care about is receiving their money!
College Sophomore,1,"In all honesty, the dining halls are really bad. Their quality of food is terrible, and are always making very unique dishes that college student do not want. Most of my meal plan is spent at the on campus stores, but even those prices are absolutely terrible."
College Sophomore,1,"For as many people the go to BG, you'd think they would have more parking. Living on campus isn't too bad because Lot 12 ALWAYS has spaces; however, it's a long walk unless you take the bus. If you're a commuter, you're basically screwed."
College Freshman,1,"Finacial aid is my worst enemy. I dread the day I have to do my finacial aid. At times, the bursar office said they didn't recieve certain documents that I had proof I did and I had to redue them, I met with the finacialmaid peoplemface-to-face to calulate my aid and they calculated wrong in which we didn't find out until later ( 3 days before deadline). This caused me to owe $3,000+ in which could have been paid off but the calculations were wrong and I am still dealing with finacial aid because there was a miscommunication on what the fee was for. Now I am scrambling up money to pay this fee I can enroll in classes. It's the worst and I wish they would help me out and tell me what I can do."
College Freshman,1,"If you come to BG, BE PREPARED TO FREEZE. The winters are miserable and having an 8am class in January will suck any way you look at it. There is no way to get around it, but if you live in Ohio you probably already know that."
College Freshman,1,BGSU is mainly white with very few minority or international students.
College Junior,1,They are stuck up and rude to each other as well as everyone else.
College Student,1,"I hate dealing with financial aid, its such a hassle"
College Freshman,1,It is extremely windy and the temperatures drop pretty low at night. 
College Sophomore,1,The Greek Life at BGSU is very close knit and rude.
College Junior,1,"TOO MUCH MONEY, too little spots close to campus. "
College Senior,1,Weather in BG is cold. 
College Sophomore,1,"There are 2 all you care to eat places, little expensive stores where one could get snacks and such and there are the union options. The quality depends on where you go on campus but everything is overpriced. The options get very tiring after a few weeks."
College Sophomore,1,It is VERY windy. It's either too cold or too hot. 
College Junior,1,You're guaranteed to come across drunk students as early as 6 pm on Thursday-Saturday. I hear stories all the time about RA's drinking with their residents or knowing about underage drinking and doing nothing about it. Over half of the underclassmen illegally drink in the dorms.
College Junior,1,"Cost of food is ridiculous, particularly at outtakes. It is less expensive to not be on meal plan and simply buy from the grocery store because you get way more for your money. Dorms range from horrible to okay. Harshman is horrible, and old, and had mold problems. Founders however is awesome, and clean."
College Sophomore,1,"Either SUPER hot, or SUPER cold. Always always always windy."
College Freshman,1,"The parking is very far away from resident halls, and it is over $100 for the year to park. Also, there are never spots open."
College Freshman,1,"Parking sucks! Sure, $100 a year may not seem like much, but good luck finding somewhere to park, as the school doesn't care about trying to guarantee a spot. There isn't nearly enough spaces for all the on-campus students, and parking officers give tickets like nazis. And when you do get a spot, it's nowhere near anything. If you go somewhere, make sure to bring someone so you're not alone late at night back there."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare!! on campus students have to park in lot 12...we like to call it ""lot Toledo"" because its just that freaking far! and on the weekends if you want to find a parking spot closer to your dorm good luck! the struggle is real!!"
College Freshman,1,The weather is easily one of the worst things about the school. It doesn't get much worse. But that's Ohio for ya.
College Freshman,1,"This university is very strict with policies about parking. There are only certain lots students are able to park at, even with having a parking pass for the entire school year. If a student or visitor parks in a lot that full-year parking passes are not valid for, the Parking Services of BGSU will give you a parking ticket. With a first offense, you get a warning. With a second offense, however, you receive a fine of $25. There are Parking Services workers working all day long, as the university is very strict about parking."
College Sophomore,1,it is terrible you have to be there super early in order to get a good spot
College Junior,1,"BG can have some horrible weather at times. It can get crazy at times. for me, the worse is when it either rains or snows. It does not snow here a lot but it gets super windy so you really have to bundle up."
College Freshman,1,"the financial aid process was not an easy one. we receiced one opportunity to reeive help the day of orientation and the line was so long, we would have been ther euntil 10 pm before they called out number. being that we had to leave at 4 am as it was to make it there on time, we had to leave. we have been unable to find assistance since then and are struggling to come up with the addtl cash our student loans didnt cover (although we were told they would)"
College Freshman,1,Alcohol is very prevelant and I've met multiple people here who do drugs.
College Sophomore,1,It Is So Bipolar – One minute the weather is 48 and the next it is 82
Recent Alumnus,1,Many apartment complexes close to campus tow often! Campus parking patrollers ticket often as well. The smartest move is to buy a campus pass. It will save you money!
College Freshman,1,"Holy Wind, Batman! It gets really hot during the beginning and end of the year, and during spring and fall the 30+ mph winds are ridiculous. The winters aren't bad snow-wise, but add the fast wind to a snow fall and it feels like you are getting hit in the face with small daggers. Sometimes you just can't win."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Bowling Green is absolutely horrible. There really isn't even a need to bother bringing your car because you have to park so far away and the parking services will fine you no matter where you park, unless it is in the parking lot that is at least a mile away from the actual campus."
College Freshman,1,"Check Ins – Bowling Green's check in systems are very strict within every dorm building. After midnight, students are required to check into the front desk with your student number and ID. This is a ridiculous requirement considering most students are over the age of 18 and are more than capable of being responsible for there own selves."
College Freshman,1,Drugs and Alcohol – Just about everybody drinks and/or smokes pot. Police don't enforce much unless it's going on in the dorms. I had a friend get busted with weed in his dorm and the cop told him that if it was legal he would roll up right with him.
College Freshman,1,"Theatre With an Specialization in Acting – Many of the people majoring in theatre don't seem to have any plans to work anywhere farther away than Toledo following graduation.  They also talk a TON about graduate school and not much at ALL about getting out into the world and auditioning and doing portfolio work.  They don't even start to talk to you about portfolios until your junior or senior year.  As an actor, having a good portfolio and resume are EXTREMELY important and anyone who wan't as lucky as I was and didn't go to a performing arts high school and didn't have to have a portfolio at the end of every school year wouldn't know the importance because it's hardly ever spoken of."
College Freshman,1,I kept having issues with my FAFSA and each correction would take days for them to register. Then I would have to go to the PIN site after every time the site registered the correction.
College Sophomore,1,Bowling Green has the worse weather and they never cancel classes.Spring is horrible because it rains so much and the streets always flood so bring your rain boots. The wind is so strong if it's raining or snowing it makes it ten times worse.

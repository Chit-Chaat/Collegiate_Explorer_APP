Sophomore,5,"Since this is the first year ATU has mainly went online for school, I can tell it has been pretty difficult for lots of professors and even students.  However, I feel like the teachers have done their best to accommodate and help students out as much as they can."
Freshman,5,I love Arkansas Tech. It's such a small campus and everyone I meet seems so friendly. Arkansas Tech makes me feel at home.
Sophomore,5,With every online class i have taken so far the professors are always helpful if needed and everything on blackboard is laid out to where you can understand what you need to do for assignments and test.
Sophomore,5,"Easy to apply, staff is always helpful and a friendly environment. The staff is always willing to help find ways to save you money by applying for grants and scholarships."
Sophomore,5,"Arkansas tech is a Beautiful school with many amazing programs such as the Cybersecurity program I am enrolled in! Arkansas Tech is also home to one of the best if not THE best marching band in Arkansas, the Arkansas tech Band of Distinction!"
Freshman,5,I never took online classes yet. I have heard about our online classes and some people say they are OK and others don't like online classes at all.
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman at Arkansas Tech. My experience have been great due to the friendly environment. You will always make a new friend. The sports games are amazing and the food there is out of this world.
Junior,5,"What I like about ATU is the support and diversity I see on campus. ATU's President, Dr. Bowen has sent out many statements that include the support towards each and every person on campus. ATU doesn't feel like a place where you go and become book smart, in fact it is also a place where you learn to support, help, and be kind to others."
Alum,5,"Yes, I did have a few online classes. Mostly over the summers, but the classes were more of a challenge. Getting a full semester of information into 6 weeks is hard on both faculty and students."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my 4 years at ATU. This is a great school, and has many top notch programs such as the nursing and engineering programs. Most professors are very out going and love to interact with students."
Junior,5,I am an undergraduate in the Physical Education Teaching/Coaching degree. I am a transfer student from Richland Junior College where I felt the teachers did not care about the students and would not go out of their way to help them; in result there were numerous students not caring and not making the grades they should have because the faculty did not seem to put in the extra effort. I got to Arkansas Tech and it was a completely different program. I noticed the professors wanted all students to succeed and even when my grades would drop the professors would email and talk in person about how to improve my grades. I have never felt distant from professors or felt like I am not in good hands at Arkansas Tech. The only thing I wish they would improve is adding places to park.
Niche User,5,"Arkansas Tech University is a medium-size college located in the heart of Russellville, Arkansas. The campus is beautiful and surrounded by trees and an abundance of chained and locally owned restaurants. There's a newly constructed nature trail right behind the campus, that allows active bodies to enjoy the peaceful scenery, while getting a workout in. The campus is very safe to walk around; as an 8th grader, I was competeing in a state history fair and had to use books from the Arkansas Tech library, so every weekend my time was spent on the campus and the students and facility members treated me as if I were one of its own."
Niche User,5,"They have helped me with registration and applications every step of the way and are very nice. I intend on going for a degree in music education and that was greatly inspired by my experiences at Tech Band Camp. They are the best priced school I have looked at and by far the kindest. Arkansas Tech would be my number one recommendation for anyone that asks. They are suited to help anyone that needs it. With a 3.0 and a 28 on the ACT they are offering me $9,000 a year on top of whatever I get for band and choir. They have been amazing to me and I can't wait to attend."
Niche User,5,"Great school!  Economic & cultural with lots of opportunities for every lifestyle & interest. Community , leadership, family, culture, team spirit, extracurricular, multicultural, advanced"

Niche User,5,The experience I've had with Arkansas Tech is that their professors there are so kind and generous. The dorms there are also very organized and sanitary.
Junior,5,"I absolutely going to Arkansas Tech. It feels like home and is very a comforting campus. It is small enough to were you know several people as you walk down the sidewalk, but big enough to where there are a bunch of new faces as well."
Freshman,5,"I think it's a good school. The free haircuts are awesome and the food isn't bad at all. It's very convenient when I need something quick to eat. I feel they should get some fresher water in the fountain. It's a little dirty, and it's such a beautiful fountain."
Freshman,5,I am the first person in my family to go to college. I did not know what to expect. This University and campus was easy to learn and get around. I made me comfortable with being away from my family.

And I don't think many people know but the resident halls are so nice and the staff in the halls cares about your well being. Another thing many people do not know is the food is amazing like I have no complaints at all. Arkansas Tech is the place to go even the cities community is so help to the new population of Russellville. Also take a minute to appreciate that the schools mascot is cute loving bulldog named Jerry. Last thing to say is Heck Yeah, Tech Yeah!"

The campus has a great student life and there is always something going on for everyone being that from clubs to just about anything under the sun. Specking about the sun, the Golden Suns and Wonder Boy games are free for students to get in to! Arkansas Tech cares for their students and is an overall amazing institution."

Senior,5,"I like how well informed they keep the students about everything going on on campus, not just academic life.  They offer a lot of different events for the students to attend. The library enforces the quiet areas well. The professors do take time to help you understand their material better if you show you are trying and seek help outside of class."
Senior,5,Amazing school! They really care about their students. I learned so much when I completed the online Bachelors of  Interdisciplinary Studies program. Great teachers and amazing advisors.
Junior,5,I have absolutely loved Arkansas Tech over the years! I have had great experiences and met some extremely incredible people.

Freshman,5,"They really care about their students, their one on one with students help. During the preview day I was able to learn about all aspects of the life on campus and get to know our leaders in a fun way. I am excited to start attending and move into my dorm.

Freshman,5,"I love the campus, it is beautiful and has emergency buttons everywhere. Arkansas Tech University has public safety available for students who are in danger.

Junior,5,I really love Arkansas Tech it's a great school u gave no complaints about it I recently transferred and I was looking for a better opportunity and Arkansas Tech gave it to me.  What makes me happier is that the people here are more friendly and really respectful and act professional.  What makes this school better is that I want to play football and I really haven't got the full affect of student athlete in college but hopefully with this school it goes better than the last.
Niche User,5,I am interested in attending this college to play football and further my career in high school education. would love to receive a 4 year full ride to attend.
Freshman,5,When I first got to Tech I came for really week because of band so I got to see my dorm room early. It was pretty nice if their was only one person in it. Luckly I was one of the few that got their own room and hopefully next semester also. Classes were wonderful. The teachers that I had for the semester were understanding and allowed us to make up work that we weren't able to the first. I've enjoyed Tech's social events and their efforts for everyone to get to know each other. Hopefully next semester is as eventually as the previous.
Sophomore,5,I am a current student and I must say that my experience has been nothing but positive! My instructors have been great they put alot into the lessons and have been great to help me to understand exactly what is expected.
Freshman,5,"Arkansas Tech is a smaller campus which made it more appealing to me because of the ability to locate all my class without the stress of getting lost.  I also, enjoy the teacher to student ratio.  They are very student orientated and have made the transition to college life very smooth.  I look forward to my next 4 years here and what they have to offer.."
Junior,5,The classes and people who work there are so awesome and I feel like I can really get my degree there. It is very home welcomed. I love this place

Sophomore,4,I think that the atmosphere of Arkansas Tech is perfect for me.  There are always events happening on campus that make me feel excited about being a college student.  The effect of Covid on campus has kind of put a damper on things but I feel as if ATU has tried its best to continue to do activities.
Sophomore,4,"Arkansas Tech was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I spent my first year of college at UCA and found myself wishing I had gone for my other choice. So I decided to transfer to ATU and I've loved it. COVID-19 has made the college experience very different, but despite online courses and social distancing, I've had a great second year. The staff, both professors and general workers, clearly care for the students here. They're always willing to help and extend a hand to students struggling. I've also found that the other students here are generally very open and nice to new people. The food and other necessities like dorm life is fairly average, but for the affordability of this campus it's great. Overall, I would recommend ATU to any Arkansas student looking for an affordable campus that cares about their wellbeing."
Sophomore,4,I take all online classes and all of my online professors give good lectures just like face to face lectures.
Sophomore,4,"I liked atu's slims chicken and I was surprise how they let everyone know a special event by posting and hanging banners around the area, it shows supportive they are towards students. It allows students to be engage of their surroundings."
Freshman,4,I went to ATU for three years and got a degree in criminal justice. I very much enjoyed my time at Tech. I always had great professors and student life was great. I will always feel like Russellville is my home away from home. I would highly recommend attending Arkansas Tech.
Freshman,4,I took a majority of my criminal justice courses online and it was great. Everything was done through blackboard and it was easy to navigate and the professors were very easy to contact if needed. I actually preferred online to actual in-class courses.
Alum,4,It is not the same to build your schedule around work as you're teacher may not be able to work around you. Which is more directed at late night questions and concerns.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed several teachers at this school that love building connections with their students. However, the grounds on which the school was built needs to be re-evaluated. It is prove to flooding and the English building is sinking into the ground."
Senior,4,"Arkansas Tech has been a great college. Since this is my last year, I am a little sad! these experiences that I have had, I will not forget! the campus is very conducive to learning and fun!"
Senior,4,"i took as many classes that i could get away with online, due to being a nursing major, i wanted to focus on my in class classes. the online learning is very effective!"
Junior,4,"ATU has a plethora of different online courses, and during the worldwide pandemic, there was a necessity to transfer to a remote environment. Although most of my classes were great and efficient when it came to this new environment, there was one class in particular where a professor seemed to now know how to handle the new environment. This caused us to not learn as much during that time. However, the professor made up for it with online lectures and plenty of homework to use and study with."
Junior,4,"With Covid-19 happening, all classes went online in very quick timing. I am not a great online student so from that stand point I did not do as well as I would have liked. I could also tell the professors seemed swamped with switching to online and might have had difficulties in that area. Overall, the staff at ATU did a great job handling the pandemic and still found a way to make sure their students were taken care of and were not cut short of the learning that semester."
Junior,4,I like that that there are a lot of different students with different backgrounds. Most people on the campus are really welcoming. There are a lot of fun campus activities and groups to join.
Sophomore,4,"Arkansas Tech University is a pretty awesome University, with lots of highly experienced staff and proffesors. Very organized in all their activities, use of high quality technology to aid in better learning."
Sophomore,4,"I had been taking one online class from the start of my second semester, so on transition to virtual online classes due to Covid19, I found it easy to proceed with my classes smoothly. Lectures are well recorded, assignments well explained, use of Respondus Lockdown for tests is very effecient."
Freshman,4,I like how everyone makes you feel a home always from home. I also liked the fact that they gave a couple days to get to know the campus before classes started.
Freshman,4,"Very nice, neat, tidy campus. I attended several years ago and was an Agri/Business student. Faculty and staff are very friendly and most all are more than willing to help"
Freshman,4,"I am in my spring semester of freshman year and my experience so far has been really good, making friends is easy especially when you can connect with someone who has the same interests. There are a lot of international students so the diversity here on campus is really good, no discrimination or racism."
Senior,4,"Arkansas Tech really does feel like a home. Professor care, the environment is good for learning, and overall I have loved my experience"
Freshman,4,"Most professors are very nice and understanding, though I would like to see better one-to-one help from professor to student"
Sophomore,4,"I like how inclusive the campus is. There seems to be something for everyone in every culture, gender, race, etc. I enjoy the size of the campus because you are most likely always going to see someone you know, making it feel less intimidating. The professors are also always willing to help students."

Sophomore,4,"All faculty, staff, and students are friendly and nice. Tech is a tight knit community full of all different types of people from around the world. There is also many different groups you can join. They have just about anything for anyone!"

There are so many activities and things to get involved with along with wonderful ways to network around campus! Arkansas tech has inspired me to become a more active leader on campus and in my future.

Junior,4,Arkansas tech Russellville campus has given me an amazing opportunity to further my career. They are quick to get you an adviser to help guide the way.
Senior,4,Nice small university. The campus is beautiful and not cramped like most other colleges. Most teachers care about your education.
Niche User,4,"I like how everyone is so different and how they will include you in the activities.  I also enjoy how the campus is so roomy, which also how everything is spread out. I love how there are different departments for different people who want to be in the field. Especially the College of Business is probably the most interesting one of them all. I enjoyed taking the tour around the beautiful campus."
Freshman,4,"I love Arkansas Tech because the campus is so beautiful and so spacious, nothing is all crammed together and I love that! The people here are so nice and so helpful with whatever it is you may need. They are understanding and do whatever they can to try and help you and do what is best for you. The dorms are a good size and everyone is super friendly. There is so much to do at Arkansas Tech and I absolutely love it."
Niche User,4,"When I was on the campus during my tour, it seemed as if the college had a lot to offer. In retrospect, the college itself was a bit older, but it seemed as if a lot of the older buildings were either being renovated or being torn down and new ones taking their places."
Sophomore,4,What i like most about Arkansas Tech is how diverse it is. There is a club for anything and the people are very welcoming. You really feel at home here. The food is great and they have a few options you can choose from. The professors are wonderful and great. I would recommend Arkansas Tech to anyone who wants to go a cheap and great school.
Graduate Student,4,I liked touring around the campus and eating the cafeteria food. I liked the inside of the buildings. I like the dorms and room. I liked the library there. I liked the little food stores. I liked the stores inside the campus. I liked going to see what a class room is like.
Sophomore,4,Arkansas Tech is the most welcoming university I have ever visited or went to. There is a home vibe anywhere you go on campus and you can tell the people and professors sincerely want you to succeed. The thing I would change is the way events are posted about and make those easier to be known about.
Senior,4,"I really like the size of campus, there is about 12,000 students so it's not too big but not too small. This also allows for optimal class sizes. I always feel like I am noticed in class and not just another student. Most of my professors have gone above and beyond to help me and work with the special accomdations I have. I believe they truly want to see me succeed. I have also enjoyed the student life on campus. There is literally club for everyone. I have personally found Greek life to be my thing and have really enjoyed being apart of this organization since it promotes leadership and academic success. However, the only negative is the food choices on campus, they don't have the healthiest of options. Some of the dorms on campus need some upgrading but I hear they are in the process of doing so. Overall though, this was the best school for me!"
Sophomore,4,I love ATU! The atmosphere is great for a smaller school and they make it so easy to feel at home and meet people.
Freshman,4,About to start in the Fall but I have watched the program grow since 05 and I'm excited to attend. Everyone I know who has attended has loved it.

I have made several trips down to Arkansas Tech University and, all of my experiences with the students and staff who work there has been excellent. The city of Russellville is very good as well.

Senior,4,"My experience at Arkansas Tech University was quite thrilling and overall life changing. I completed four years at Arkansas Tech University with an intended major ""Nursing."" I recently had a self- realization that I do not want to be a nurse. So I have decided to journey elsewhere. However, I was fortunate enough to be on their dance team for three years. I loved it. I met some unforgettable people. Although, the diversity at Arkansas Tech is quite scarce. I would like to see more involvement with a variety of cultures and ethnicity. I believe in time Arkansas Tech good be an even better school once they take into consideration the lack there of."
Junior,4,"This is a great college. I have enjoyed my experience so far. The faculty is very nice and helpful. The class size is decent enough to where the professor knows your face at least, and in some cases, your name. It is a diverse campus and is very safe."
Junior,4,I have enjoyed great success at ATU.  The professors are awesome.  I am a Political Science major and have learned so much.  I have had a positive experience with Greek life.  I do wish they would renovate or destroy the Critz Dorm.  Community Bathrooms.   I had to stay there for way too long and did not like that part of my college experience.
Niche User,4,Arkansas Tech was a beautiful campus and the people giving tours were super nice. The cafeteria and the dorms really caught my eye. Some of the dorms were very small but thats expected. There is a ton of walking i would have to do from class to class but excercise is good for you anyway.
Senior,4,The classes are small. The campus is clean and well kept. Staff are friendly and helpful. They want students to be successful.
Sophomore,4,Tech is a great school and the people here are very nice. I don't see any changes that need to be made.

Junior,4,"The classes were challenging but the professors were very helpful.  The courses build upon each other and it is great to keep learning at a steady pace where I do not feel overwhelmed.

Freshman,4,I'm an incoming Freshmen and so far my experience has been pretty amazing. They've helped me with all my needs and getting my classes sorted and where everything is. It's a great campus!
Junior,4,"Arkansas Tech has very friendly students and professors. There is a wide range of majors and electives.

The on campus health center is very convenient and their staff is very knowledgeable."
Junior,4,Overall Arkansas Tech one of the most afordable colleges in Arkansas and provides the best instructors they can. The campus is constantly getting maintained thus looks good year round!
Niche User,4,"Arkansas Tech University is a great campus that I highly recommend. It's very affordable as well. Some things I would like to see changed though are some of the Dorms. Some are just in need of updated,  however they're not in an out of use condition."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a Sophomore at Arkansas Tech University and I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering. There are many things that make Arkansas Tech a great college, but the two that stands out to me the most are the students and the staff. When I first came to Arkansas Tech, I didn't know what to expect. I was nervous and wasn't sure how difficult it was going to be to make friends. The students on campus are very friendly. Arkansas Tech has many events for new students  to help you interact with other students. I was able to make friends within the first week of coming to tech. The staff here are friendly as well. They encourage you to do your best and if you need extra help on any assignments just ask them and they will be gladly to help you. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at Arkansas Tech and I would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending Arkansas Tech University. My professors are helpful and are willing to help struggling students. I also enjoy Greek life here. The campus is welcoming and there are many opportunities to be involved.
Senior,4,"My time has been full of my getting to know my instructors and they getting to know me. The instructors are top notch and will do anything and everything to assist the students, as long as the student is putting fourth the effort to actually pass the particular class. I feel that I have learned so much in my time at Arkansas Tech University."
Junior,4,I am doing all of my classes online. As far as I am concerned they people I have talked to are extremely nice.
Niche User,4,"I really love the community, and the area. The campus is easy to find your way around, and the people are nice."
Senior,2,I am so confused when information is needed. The people I talk to give me the run around. If TAA was not helping me out with my education I would have moved after my first semester. They cannot help with simple questions. I am given the run around all the time. No one seems to want to help me advance with my education needs.
Sophomore,2,There's  not enough parking and they spend money trying to make things look nice on the outside while they are actually really old and outdated on the inside.  My dorm doesn't even have a thermastat.
Junior,2,"I like International students events and activities, and on-campus work opportunities.
I would like to see ""International students Tutoring and Writing center"" were senior International students work as tutors for fellow International students.
I would also like to see new BLOODS and DIVERSITY at the library's AND Information Center's administration. Someone should keep an eye on those guys because they're trying to turn the library to a political and hate battle field. What makes it worse is American students trying to satisfy the administration."
College Junior,2,Getting to where you need to go is a pain!
College Sophomore,2,"The bathrooms are disgusting. Not because of the lady that cleans them but because of the students living in there. I try to keep everything tidy while I'm in there, and even go out of my way to pick up the paper towels and place in the trash but the guys just don't care. The rooms are perfect for one person but too small for 2 people."
College Sophomore,2,They've lost a lot of my applications and I ended up not getting any aid when I transferred into the school.
College Sophomore,2,It gets old and nasty really quick.
College Freshman,2,"the only parties around Russellville are the ones that Greek hosts and even then they are usually far away in Pottsville because that's the closest wet county. If you want to go to a good party it would have to be in Littlerock, Conway, or at U of A"
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of support for out football team since they didn't do so well in the past seasons.
College Freshman,2,Almost all of the parties are on campus and thrown by the frats. You have to pay to get into almost every party.
College Freshman,2,I feel that i would ever be accepted to do an internship. I probably won't qualify for any.
College Junior,2,Theres only a McDonald's in town.
College Senior,2,"This place has little to no shopping, the closest mall is 45 min away, the closest sports team is 75 min away. The locals are okay towards students."
College Sophomore,2,no drugs Haven't heard of drug related issue since I attend this school.
College Sophomore,2,This school do not focus on social events like partying e.t.c mostly it focuses on the academics.
College Freshman,2,Every one does it. If someone get's caught it's a good thing. Maybe they'll quit! P-safe is really great at detecting these things though.
College Senior,2,The weather is really chaotic.  Not bad all the time but it floods very frequently.  Avoid the parking lots next to the car pastures if the weather calls for heavy rain.
College Freshman,2,"I've lived here my entire life. The weather goes from 75 one day to snowing three days later. When it's nice outside everyone enjoys it. But it gets kind of annoying to wear shorts, and tank top and sandals on Tuesday and need a Parka by Thursday."
College Freshman,2,always full or booked for a class
College Sophomore,2,"Hot and muggy during the summers, a lot of rain during the winter."
College Junior,2,"There are no taxis or buses for Tech, you have to drive everywhere. "
College Junior,2,Tech is getting more students than parking spots so finding a spot all the time is hard. 
College Junior,2,"Russellville has no bars, jus resturants that serves drinks. "
College Senior,2,"The computers are good at campus, especially in the library.  However, the internet connectivity and speed are not that great.  The computers are slow and the WiFi connection in some of the buildings is spotty at best."
College Senior,2,"Tech doesn't have the best safety record.  There have been a number of assaults, rapes, and thievery over the years.  I don't feel all that safe walking around a night.  Tech has beefed up its security over the years but not by much."
College Junior,2,There is a good mix of student attending ATU
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do here in town. I would like to see more restaurants and activities. It is great for the outdoors man but I am not into much of that. I think we would benefit from adding more shopping centers for entertainment and jobs!
College Senior,2,"The facilites at Arkansas Tech University are mediocre. They aren't run down, however, most of the buildings on campus are the original buildings with somewhat renovations and additions."
College Senior,2,"Most of the housing at Arkansas Tech is acceptable, however internet access is more than insufficient.  Also, for the price of the campus housing, they are lacking in extras such as furniture and quality appliances."
College Junior,2,havent really gotten into the greek life but i do have friends in certain sororities and they feel its best for them however its not much known on the Tech campus
Recent Alumnus,2,Public safety only have one thing in mind.....get someone in trouble.
College Sophomore,2,besides the Vista apartments there isnt much choice for off campus apartments but the Vistas are really nice
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much to do. There are a few shopping places, but not a shopping center."
College Sophomore,2,"I typically find students here to be extremely clique-y and really into themselves. Not a lot of people willing to be real friends, unless its convenient for them and their important schedules."
College Sophomore,2,"Even though we are in a college town, there is almost nothing to do at night other than spend money on going out to eat. As college kids, most of us don't have much extra money to spend. So we are typically stuck in the dorm with nothing to do."
College Sophomore,2,"WIth some dorms parking is a little better, however the distance to walk to dorms at night is pretty far from most and that can be extremely dangerous."
College Sophomore,2,"I easily got a scholarship from the University but it wasn't enough to do much. It's amount was pretty low considering it was a university scholarship, and i wasn't able to keep it after my second semester due to grades."
College Freshman,2,The only nightlife around here is the parties off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Edible but Why Would You? The food on campus is okay, theres really nothing spectacular about it. Some days you get lucky and get a great meal, but most days the food is gross and repetitive. Who wants burgers and pizza every day? I would personally love to see some healthier options other than just salad so we can all beat the 15 pound gain every year. We do have DCB bucks that we can use at the campus store and the four on campus fast food places. The fast food places are okay but their all just greasy, and grease every day is not healthy."
College Junior,2,"Not as Good as It Should Be – In my opinion, Arkansas Tech University does not have a good safety system.  Last year there was at least three rapes and a couple of assaults.  I always carry a knife with me.  I don't want to sound mean, I have respect for the safety officers, it's just that they only seem to be around when there is alcohol or school events."
Sophomore,1,"We were required to take all of our courses online in the spring 2020 semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I rate them as poor because, the courses had to be thrown together in a very short amount of time and it was very difficult for me to  adapt to the change"
Alum,1,"Enjoyed my degree program (English), but really soured on the university due to a blatant lack of caring from the previous administration (which ran the university when I attended). There's a reason Gary Biller was fired from his job at Western Illinois after leaving from ATU."
College Sophomore,1,No scholarships for people like me.
College Freshman,1,you can not live off campus because they want to get all the money that they can from you. there is a way around it though. find an apartment and tell them that you are living with family at your new address.
College Freshman,1,you can not move your car on campus. you have to stay in your color parking or you get fined. mind you that the campus is not small so put on your hiking boots because you will be having a nice long walk.
College Freshman,1,it was very hard for me to get any money at first but eventually i got the enough money i needed.
College Senior,1,Nightlife really sucks because the surrounding bars are trashy.
College Senior,1,"Russellville dies after 10pm.  Unless you know some people who like to have house parties late at night, this town is really sleepy."
College Senior,1,"It's a small, isolated school.  People are trying their best to plant seeds of culture around here, but for more interesting events, you're probably going to have to devote a weekend to heading to Fort Smith,  Fayetteville, Conway, or Little Rock."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is a pain in the butt.  My Site Planning and Design instructor uses Tech's parking as an example of what not to do.  The parking lots are always full, especially during the first few weeks of school.  You have to get to school an hour early just to get a good parking spot.  Most of the parking lots are color coded which means that you can only park there if you have the same color tag.  Unfortunately, the parking lots are inappropriately colored.  Trying to park in the right spot is almost impossible."
College Senior,1,The transportation at Arkansas Tech Univesity is non existent. There is no transportation on campus.
College Senior,1,"I feel that our public safety department worries more about writing parking tickets than protecting us from battery and assault, and sexual violence on female students."
College Sophomore,1,Would really nice to see different kinds of Greek life on campus. To show that Tech is not one sided.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do at night in Russellville for students under 21
College Sophomore,1,It's tougher than i thought to get scholarships. Or financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, the parking is horrible. There are 10,000+ students attending this college at all different times of the day some village but mostly dorm, most all have vehicles. But when it comes to finding a spot, there is dangerous road rage for a last minute spot especially at corley. They need to winden some areas and lay out more parking for the Yellow hang tag(village) students. Even arriving 30 minutes early people there before you aren't done with class yet and still no parking. This issue needs to be fixed asap!"
College Senior,1,If you live on campus then you are fine.  If you live off campus you might want to leave really early for class just to find a spot and walk to your building
College Freshman,1,"The internet speed is terrible, especially at night."
College Sophomore,1,Tech does not have a nightlife because there is nothing to do in Russellville since it is a dry county.Someone might have a house party but its not a gurantee that anyone is going to show up.
College Sophomore,1,Run down facilities. Only good is Hull and Library

Sophomore,5,The campus closed for the virus concern so classes were moved online. Teachers did a good job keeping the class environment the same so the students were still able to learn.
Sophomore,5,"Great!  The professor's are very knowledgeable, this is definitely a college that will prepare me for success."
Niche User,5,"My experience at the school was really good because the campus isn't that big, so there aren't that many people at the campus, which is a good thing because the campus won't feel as crowded. Also, the teachers really about the topic they teach and really try to interact with the students as much as possible."
Sophomore,5,"everyone here is super nice and the teachers are very dedicated to helping you be the best artist you can be! everyone is very friendly and chill, and I've learned a lot ever since coming here. 
the campus is really beautiful and the vibes are good.
the food could be a little better and a lot of people complain, but honestly it's perfectly fine to me!! not the best, but like it's not awful.
diversity wise, we have many Asian and white students here, and then a smaller amount of Hispanic and black students. I'm black, but i never really feel uncomfortable on campus! everyone's really welcoming and kind, and very aware of how they treat others. also a good majority of people on campus are gay/bi or cool with it!
there's lots of little events for the students which is fun, and there's lots of cool clubs to join!
as for athletics, people aren't crazy about it, but there are clubs for them, i know a lot of people are in soccer club, i'm in volleyball club!"
Junior,5,"Since most of the last semester of my sophomore was spent at home due to COVID-19, my classes were held on line.  The professors were right there helping us navigate through a tough and unusual time for all.  Classes were held on-line and taught as if we were still in the classroom.  Professors were still able to talk to us one on one about our assignments and projects.  Any extra help could be on-line or via phone calls directly to the professor."
Junior,5,"I've been very proud and privileged to call this school, my school. The experiences I've had at this school are ones I'll never forget. From the campus to the faculty, the entire school is there to focus on you and your artistic path. The teachers and faculty are very straight forward and down to Earth; they're not going to give you the run around because they're there for you. The entire school is there for you, and it's up to you, to either make it or break it. It's hard work, I'm not going to lie but it is without a doubt, worth it; because of this school, I've become not only a better artist but a better person. Along with my art, I've grown tremendously. It's all thanks to the time and effort I've put into this school and the teachers and faculty having my back along the way.  I'm very glad I decided to attend Ringling College of Art and Design."
Freshman,5,With the campus closing mid-spring season our classes went online.  Definitely missed being on campus with live interaction but the online learning was definitely a plus doing this difficult time.  The college made transitioning to the online learning seamless.
Freshman,5,"Love, love, love this college.  Being introduced to new people from all around the world, learning sooo much that I absolutely love doing, and being surrounded by such beauty.  The campus is located in Sarasota, Florida."
Niche User,5,Summer classes are great - professors are excellent at explaining everything and the content is interesting.
Sophomore,5,"I currently go here for computer animation. I absolutely love this school but it is very difficult. You must be sure this program is the one you want because it's very difficult, but it's the best of the best"
Freshman,5,Great teachers.  Ringling let's you dive right into your major beginning freshman year.  The hands on experiences and opportunities we are afforded are exciting and helpful.
Niche User,5,"Although I have yet to be accepted into Ringling, I have visited the college because someone very important to me is majoring in animation there. The campus overall is gorgeous, there's plenty to do outside of class and all of the classes are usually within 5 minutes of walking distance. not only this, but the community and students are by far the sweetest and most accepting I could know."
Freshman,5,"The instructors are all very good, some are good at teaching while being nice, and others like to push students to know how to fend for their work. As a commuter, I have the opportunity to bring my own home-cooked lunches, but I hear rumors of some of the food there making people feel sick."
Niche User,5,"I attended a summer camp at this school where I was taught by professors and earned college credit. This school has excellent art education, and is especially known for its Animation major. The professors all have experience in the professional art world and are amazing connections for future careers."
Freshman,5,"I had a good experience at Ringling College of Art and Design, I love the campus, is big a clean I would't change nothing about the School I think it is a good experience to study at Ringling College"
Niche User,5,"I attended the Ringling college of art and design precollege program over the summer, and it only solidified my choice to attend. It was the best summer of my life because of the connections I made, and the courses that challenged my skills."
Senior,5,Ringling College of Art and Design is an amazing school with both the technology and instruction to help students to be creative. Ringling has always played a big part in the Sarasota community helping surrounding schools. I absolutely love being able to express my own concept art and 3-D work environments.
Sophomore,5,"Excellent professors, extremely challenging curriculum makes you improve by leaps and bounds. The environment is made for art kids to thrive."
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely fell in love with this school after completing my first year. There is absolutely no delay in starting your major, there is a lot of work that you are expected to complete but it is all for the sake of making sure you're up to par with the rest of the students. Faculty, Staff, Facilities, all amazing. Each professor is a delight to have in their own way, each passionate about the course they are teaching. Some even perform the job outside office hours so you know its someone who is successful in their field."
Freshman,5,"It is evident that this school works hard to provide the best resources for their students, and I am always amazed by everything Ringling and its students produces. After visiting the school, I know that there are great instructors who help their students develop as artists making them the best they can be."
Freshman,5,"I love this college! They will push you past your limits and challenge you in ways no other art college can.  Freshmen year is exceedingly difficult but persevere, friends! They break you but then they rebuild you into a better artist than you could ever possibly imagine yourself to be.  If you can afford to go here, I 10/10 recommend attending."
Sophomore,5,"Ringling College of Art and Design has SO many pros over cons in attending. Get ready for a stunning small campus that draws in people from all over the globe, and that isn't just a cheap phrase. A massive chunk of Ringling's population are either from across the US or international, creating a beautifully diverse experience. Teachers there are world renown, and every single one is very committed to your success."
Freshman,5,"Amazing School. A lot of courses that can teach you very unique things. Very fun clubs, amazing staff and everyone here is amazing. We all work together to achieve a similar goal, and we are all a tight community."
Niche User,5,"Ringling is an amazing art school in Sarasota. While I was visiting, I was able to experience the hands-on attitude of their highly skilled and intuitive professors that not only teach but have a passion for the craft. It was different from the schools that just want to push through the system and out into the world. Ringling seemed to actually prepare their students for the workplace and provide them the opportunities to make connection in the field.  There is only a few buildings, making the layout of the campus very easy to navigate. The dorms are well kept and allow space for work, connecting with peers, or just sleeping in between your classes. The weather is phenomenal year round with the exception of a few showers. The beautiful campus lies only miles away from a beautiful beach and sits in the heart of Sarasota with plenty of food and activities to satisfy all walks of life. Overall it was a wonderful experience to visit and see what they were all about."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the community at Ringling! Everyone one is so helpful and positive. It's one of the best places to learn and grow.
Freshman,5,"Ringling is such a beautiful and mind opening school. When i walked onto campus i seen how clean and wide open the campus was. So colorful full with the students art work and pieces. i felt right at home. While walking to the next building walking by the students I seen and feel the great positive vibes everyone is sending to each other showing beautiful bright different smiles and yet all mean the same feeling. Happiness. joy. Ready for anything that comes our way. i love knowing i'm going to learn something when i get there, to better myself as a person and better myself as an Artist."
Sophomore,5,Ringling College stands out as a leader in Art Schools.  The professors are all great and the campus is beautiful.
Niche User,5,"I loved all the things they provide such as equipment, one on one time with students, everything is in walking distance, and a lot more. one thing i would want to change is the location due to it being next to a sketchy area. Other than that I really like the school!"
Sophomore,5,"I have only been attending this school for a year so far, but I am very happy with it so far. I've improved tremendously in a short time, and am excited to go back. Although the school is pricey, the resources and facilities are always being updated and improved. Teachers are very knowledgable and will return the effort you put in."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Ringling College of Art and Design was fantastic! I was only there for as a first-year Illustration student, but I left there with more knowledge of drawing than when I went in.

I will say, that it was a tough journey, what with my limitations being pushed, but it was well worth it in the end. I can now see perspectives in a completely new...perspective! 

Drawing for Illustrators was a new experience for me, too. I really hated painting, and the entire class was done with Gouache paint. But it helped me see lighting and color differently. I learned how to control the paint a lot better. If given the opportunity, I would like to go back.

My only issue is the cost. It is considered one of the most expensive schools in the country, and they prove that with how much the tuition is. I spent more money on supply refills than anything else.

Other than that, I loved Ringling."
Niche User,5,"I visited Ringling during their Fall preview day, and it was very impressive and amazing. They had many rooms and resources. Also the faculty and students were very supportive and nice."
College Junior,5,"A more open-minded school you cannot find, of course there are some exceptions, but overall is very accepting of everything."
College Junior,5,"It's safe, people is not going to make you take something that you don't want  and public safety is always taking care if they heard you have drugs"
College Junior,5,"Career services are the best thing at Ringling and it is one of the few things it calms me down because I think is too expensive for the academics, there are better universities for his same price. What stress me out isthat in somehow you are not going to find so much room for creativity, they will make you to follow the rules."
College Freshman,5,I believe the campus is safe and secure.
College Freshman,5,I think it matches my goals the best so far of all other schools I visited and applied for.
College Sophomore,5,About 97% of students are guaranteed a job upon graduation (assuming that they really want it and put the hard work into getting where they need to be).
College Sophomore,5,"I've learned so much during my time here. Apart from the staggering tuition that each student is faced with, all other aspects of the college are absolutely amazing."
College Sophomore,5,The quality of work that comes out of this school is great
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so supportive and creative!
College Freshman,5,The professors that I've had all really care about teaching and are really passionate. I had a wonderful experience.
College Freshman,5,The alumni work is what inspired me to come to Ringling so I am pretty convinced about the quality coming from Ringling.
College Freshman,5,My experience in goldstein freshman housing was awesome!
College Freshman,5,If you even say that you are from Ringling people automatically take more of an interest in you because of the quality of people the school produces
College Freshman,5,We dont have any and most of the students who go here are grateful for it. IT takes away an added streess
College Freshman,5,My school teaches you what you need to know effectively
College Student,5,"Really looking forward to applying and getting into this college, it will bring me closer to my goal if I do."
College Freshman,5,The security on campus is amazing. From round the clock public safety to the fobs to get to a certain floor. Public safety is always on top of any situation that arrises and always has the students well being in mind at all times.
College Freshman,5,The instructors really go the extra mile in helping make sure the student understands the subject matter. Ringling puts you full force into your major from the first day of freshman year. This way you avoid topics and unnessasery information that could slow down the expation of your skills. Class size is great just enough to make sure each student can get individual attention form the intructor.
College Freshman,5,Ringling is known for their career center and the services they provide. This group of people will help you step by step to achieve your goal of obtaining your dream job.
College Freshman,5,Since starting at Ringling College of Art and Design I have found that my knowlage and skill levels have dramatically increased. This is due to the fact that unlike other art colleges and intitutes we are flung into our major from day one. Ringling takes pride in teaching students and using every resource to help them succeed and grow as a professional individual.
College Freshman,5,"These guys patrol the campus 24/7 and someone on a golf cart is always near by. Campus isn't in the safest area, but campus itself is it's own safe little bubble. Just don't walk alone on MLK and there shouldn't be any problems."
College Freshman,5,"A ringling degree is a golden ticket to any job the student desires. If your portfolio is  good, which is will be from Ringling, Ringling gets your foot in the door. Laika, Disney, Pixar and many other big names come straight to campus to recruit. Career services will help with resumes and anything else students need."
College Freshman,5,"I have loved all the teachers I've had so far. They love their work and genuinely want to see their students excel. They come from all kinds of backgrounds, even Disney and Pixar and their stories inspire you to push yourself."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Ringling, it is a dream come true. I get to work at animation desks used by Disney legends and famous business heads, actors, and artists are constantly on campus to give seminars to students. The teachers are all, or were, practicing artists, some animators on movies like Bug's Life and Lilo and Stitch. They love their job and extremely enthusiastic. The workload is hard, but it should be. Ringling is the best of the best and I'm so happy to have the opportunity to learn here."
College Sophomore,5,"I've heard great things about career services from other students, and have set up an appointment myself. They are generally very helpful and make you feel (or at least me) at ease with the whole prospect of acquiring an internship or job opportunity. The key though, is to pop into the office as early as you can in your college career to maximize the benefits and help they will offer you. You won't be maximizing their opportunities of help if you're a senior setting up an appointment for the first time."
College Junior,5,Very clean and spaious. The resident staff are very welcoming and helpful with any issues and questions.
College Junior,5,"Our work load is intense. But when I graduate I will have so many skills and certifications that I will be able to find a career job in my Major within just a few months... If I am not employed by graduation. I normally do at least one all-nighter per. week, if not more. for my hard work has paid off so far, as of my Spring grades were a 4.0, and I continued to be on the Presidents List. Ringling has Job Fairs, and  so many well known companies come all year long to review portfolios. Some of them are, Disney &Pixar, Hallmark, Target, Universal Studios, Privately owned Interior Design groups from large cities all over the US."
College Junior,5,"Ringling has a very diverse curriculum. Interior Design, Graphic Design, Illustration, Animation, Photography, Fine Arts, The Business of Graphic Design, Computer Graphics, Computer Gaming, and probably a few more that I can't remember. For my degree in Interior Design, I will have to get an apprentice job in my field to get a separate accreditation.  I am a rising Jr. and this summer I have two jobs, one of witch is working for the largest photography & design studios in the US. It is called 'Kreber Studios', and they photograph room scenes for large furniture manufactures and also for retail companies."
College Junior,5,"Ringling College of Art & Design is located in Sarasota, Fl. We have many excellent museums, and galleries to visit. The John Ringling  museum and grounds are open for our students to use anytime, including a perfect place to draw or sketch the amazing architecture from the early 1940's.

We are about fifteen minutEs from Lido Key, and the State Park located at the end of the Key. Shopping for students on a budget are also within a short drive, with Walmart, Sam's Club and K-Mart. My major of Interior Design is one of the hardest at Ringling and therefor My roommate and I usually cook."
Sophomore,4,"All of my classes are online at the moment, but Ringling has done a great job at making it feel like I am on campus. I have access to software on the campus computers, the professors' lectures are still informational, and I think I am learning the same if not more than if I were on campus."
Sophomore,4,"This is a beautiful interactive campus, full of fun, quirky elements perfect for artistic majors.  The professors are really qualified, and it is an experience to learn under each and every one of them. I have learned so much, and the campus provides so many opportunities for careers after college."
Junior,4,"The education had been incredible so far, however it's one of the most expensive educations in the country and because of its competitive nature there are very few scholarship opportunities for my major specifically.  If you can not get the cost of tuition covered by loans and scholarships then you are at a severe disadvantage compared to students who are covered.  If you are poor or underprivileged, you WILL see and feel the difference between your work and the work of your wealthier classmates, no buts about it. Because of this, the school population is largely comprised of white students, which isn't intrinsically bad, but clearly demonstrates how difficult social mobility is for poor and minority students on this campus."
Freshman,4,"Ringling College of Art and Design has always been my dream school ever since I was first informed about it at the age of ten years old. By the time I applied, I had been practising drawing animals, background art, and even worked on a few comics and fan games! Ringling was impressed by the time I told them and gave me a scholarship as well as an acceptance letter! So ever since then, I've been working on making sure I got my Bachelor's in Game Art. I look forward to the day when I walk in that cap and gown!"
Freshman,4,"The Zoom calls are very informative and never have given any bugs. In my experience, nothing ever crashes when I'm in a Zoom meeting with them. If you have any questions they are quick to answer and are very informative and helpful!"
Niche User,4,"My experience with the college was very good because the teachers really focused on what the students really wanted to learn for their careers. Also, the school really cares for the students health and well being by providing housing and food for the students."
Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19 I finished the semester online. I think it would have been much better to do the work in the studios however, obviously that wasn't an option. It depends on the major but for Motion Design my teachers were accommodating to us and our stress"
Sophomore,4,classes online for the virus kinda really sucked!! classes in person are really nice but i literally cannot function with online classes they suck! which is understandable because no one had ever done that before.
Junior,4,"I like access to the latest software to be able to create a state of the art video game.  I also like that we are working with people who have been and still are in the industry.  Their knowledge and advise helps guide us in being able to produce, create, and imagine new games to add to the ever growing video game community and business."
Junior,4,"Due to the recent global pandemic, my school along with schools around the world have switched to online classes and teaching. I'm not going to say it was perfect but overall my teachers were able to make the best of a bad situation. They didn't always know what to do but they tried their best to make our time together online worth it. Just because we didn't get the hands on teaching that many of us were use to, doesn't mean that the teacher gave up on us. The work load was still just as intense and the assignments still got turned in."
Niche User,4,The school is on my goals of being able to go to the school and achieve what I want to be able to do.
Niche User,4,The school is on my goals of being able to go to the school and achieve what I want to be able to do.
Freshman,4,"The food is awful for those who live on campus and stuck in the meal plan. Especially those who have dietary restrictions. The education is great, however, the area around Ringling is sketchy."
Junior,4,"Ringling has wide networking for students to help their careers even at school. The rigorous program helps students improve extremely fast. In addition, faculty are all top professionals and working in their field of study. There are always opportunities to help students connect to resources outside of school and always someone willing to help a student with their specific needs. You end up truly getting what you pay for. 
What this school should provide more of is safety, as the campus is situated in the city of Sarasota. While public safety is genuinely good, I feel like some further measures of protection would be ideal."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere at Ringling. As a Freshmen who was supposed to stay instate, the journey here has been long and stressful. But the people here are very welcoming and inclusive. There could be more done to the food, as most people joke about how bad it can be at times. Also, there are little options, food wise, for those who have special needs or are vegan and/or vegetarian.  The teachers here all have their own experiences and connections, which is valuable for the students here. Usually there is something going on, students receive emails daily and the RA's are very good at keeping students informed."
Sophomore,4,"I really love how diverse Ringling is. You can really tell that there are cultures from all over the world who gather just to learn about art. The professors are pretty amazing as well, the really do teach you how to draw correctly in perspective. The students at ringling are rather odd, but they take some getting used to. Overall, ringling is a great experience as long as you get to really take advantage of it."
Sophomore,4,"The freshman class is growing each year at an alarming and disappointing rate, bumping upperclassman from their housing and losing some of the fidelity that comes with a small class setting. It's happening slowly and the school still shines, but I worry about what it will look like in 5-10 years."
Niche User,4,I was invited to one of Ringling open houses and it was amazing. I got to talk to some of the heads of majors and interact with students. everyone was so forthcoming with answers to my many questions. They also help me curate a good portfolio not just to get into their school but others like it.
Freshman,4,"My freshman experience has been a great start so far. The faculty, staff, and student body are incredibly friendly and supportive. I could easily find someone to help with the challenges I was facing."
Freshman,4,I love Ringling and I hope to continue studying here. The only difficulty for me is how expensive it is. I'm currently struggling to stay here.
Sophomore,4,"Current CA student. The facilities are nice, the teachers are really impressive, and the recruiters that come are amazing. Everyone I've met is super nice. My biggest issue is the school's financial aid department/tuition, the school does not do enough (or barely anything) to make the school affordable to any students coming from a non wealthy background."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely enjoy my experience here at Ringling, the labs and studios here are breathtaking and I spend hours at labs doing assignments. I would love to attend Ringling College next year but the expenses are too much for me and my family."
Freshman,4,"Very good but very heavy work load! If you are not VERY serious and VERY willing to not have a social life you can forget  about your success here. In fact many of my fellow VR students are like me. Exhausted and getting skinnier due to the fact that the work load is truly that heavy. 
Housing is also a big problem. two dorms have been taken down to make room for the new housing going up."
Sophomore,4,I love the faculty and access to any equipment needed for a project. The food should probably be more diverse/ have more options.
Junior,4,Ringling College of Art and Design is a wonderful college for those who want a career in the arts. They effectively give us the building blocks to reach our goals and show improvement with astonishing results. I have met great people while attending and hope to finish every semester with new knowledge and pride.
Freshman,4,"Though the school is expensive, Ringling offers many opportunities for student to get into contact with employer for their future. Many fun activities to participate in outside of class."
Niche User,4,"I like that Ringling sets you up with a four year plan, and genuinely being a small school, makes it easier for the professors to care about the success of their students and bond with them. However, it is not in a college area to say the slightest, has slim food options, and is behind in some of its equipment compared to other art and design schools."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Ringling is that there are a lot of different career paths to chose from simply in just the one single major that you chose. I have made a lot of friends just like me who share the same passion, plus there’s a lot that I’ve learned from friends in different majors too. They really offer a lot of options for their students."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to Ringling College of Art and Design from another art school. In my year there, I've found myself honestly learning the fundamentals of art and design cohesively and have a constant motivation to want to keep drawing, even outside of classes. What I would like to see change is more diversity and respect on campus for people of all backgrounds as well as healthier food options that are also fresh."
Freshman,4,There was a lot of racial tension around campus. We would hear reports of racial harassment and the students responsible basically got a slap on the wrist and were still attending school.
Sophomore,4,"Overall the teachers and courses available are  very good, however the meal plan food and on campus housing situation can get pretty bad. There was a food poisoning problem earlier this semester and it can be difficult to get good housing. The area in which the school is located isn't the safest either, and they could stand to beef up security a bit."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers have usually worked in the field they teach so they really know what they're talking about and try to help us all become better artists. There's kind of a mentally draining mindset though to put your work and your networking first, no matter if it affects your mental health. It's also not a very racially diverse accepting or knowledgeable campus, but we're working to change that to make it into a more welcoming and comfortable for all! Overall, I feel like what I'm paying for, which is the education, has been worth the money and is making me a better artist!"
Sophomore,4,"Teachers are great, you'll learn a lot. They are having trouble keeping up with dorm space but the new dorms should be finished soon? Food on campus can be a bit questionable, but there are some good places within walking distance. The book store/cafe across the street has some great tea and sandwiches!"
Junior,4,"Great professors are very encouraging a helpful in improving student work. On campus housing needs to be increased due to the school accepting more and more student each year. Reslife faculty could use some work on how they handle problems and overall service. The surrounding area of the campus does bring concern to student life, its not settled in the safest neighborhood. Food is decent at the beginning of the year but grows to be lacking in all taste halfway through the year."
Niche User,4,Ringling College of Art and Design is an excellent school. The campus is neat and safe feeling even though it is an open campus. Having attended their precollege I was able to experience true college life while getting the credit.
Niche User,4,"I was at Ringling for a little while. For the time that I was there, it was very nice. The campus was clean and well taken care of. There were great facilities and helpful students there. Much diversity as well. The only thing that could improve are the dorms, especially for freshmen."
Freshman,4,They have a great illustration and computer animation programs.  They also have wonderful job placement resources.
Freshman,4,"While an expensive school, the experience and contacts one can make at the school make it worth the financiers and application exams required to attend. You will get out of the school what you put into it, and given the extensive business world contacts and amazing faculty available; I would say Ringling is worth the investment. I would love to see more hands on help from financial aid persons or at least some earlier introductions to core concepts of individual career options; as these are often reserved for upperclassman."
Niche User,4,It is a nice college. They are up to date with the latest technology and the students love it there. I'd like to see the prices go down for tuition and to have more greenery on campus especially around the student dorms.
Alum,4,"The general rule is that you should always compare departments, not colleges. Ringling boasts some great ones.

The Computer Animation program is one of the nation's best, and many alumni have found work in companies like Dreamworks, Pixar, and Disney. Ringling's Graphic Design program boasts impressive alum, as does Illustration.

The campus is small, and you will get to know every student in your year. The facilities are varied and modern, including 3d printers, laser cutters, photo studios, entire computer labs stocked with Wacom Cintiqs, an incredible library, and much more.

It is a private school and it is incredibly expensive– Ringling is not known for being generous with scholarships. A Bachelor's degree with run you 45k/year. Some friends I know graduated with over $100k in student loan debt. 

Ringling is an amazing school, but there are many ways to get an arts education, depending on what your goals are. Think hard about what loans like that will do to you."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Ringling, the only down fall is the over-all cost. But I feel like I am actually learning something that is relevant to my major. Everyone is friendly to one another, it is over-all a pleasant experience."
College Sophomore,4,"I have only just completed my freshman year, but I have heard stories of students getting really great jobs. Recruiters come to speak all of the time- big name recruiters too, like Disney and Hallmark."
College Sophomore,4,"There are always security guards driving around, they are very friendly."
College Sophomore,4,"For my freshman year, I stayed in Goldstein. It is the newest residential building, and it really shows compared to the other res halls. Everything in Goldstein looks clean and fresh, although sometimes the elevators break down."
College Sophomore,4,It is only as good as you make it. The teachers are not going to go out of their way to hold your hand and walk you through processes. You must have a strong work ethic in order to succeed and get the most out of the education.
College Freshman,4,"Residential halls are great, I'll see them in fall."
College Freshman,4,"I have a great admiration for it, but so far I do not have any personal experience."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy work-outs and the school provides excellent facilities.
College Sophomore,4,"I normally fell really comfortable and safe on and around campus, thanks to the 24/7 local officer patrols that occur."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone in general is super-friendly, and the atmosphere is a perfect blend of creativity"
College Sophomore,4,They do their best to help you
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is great. I made so many good friends
College Freshman,4,The professors were and still are artists that work for major studios and are very passionate about teaching.
College Sophomore,4,"academics are great. It is a bit competitive if your a CA, GA or ILL major ,but the classes and curriculum offers great preparation for the field you go into. The faculty leaders make a great effort in making sure students get what they need and hire wonderful professors"
College Sophomore,4,They are a variety of diverse ethnic groups and international students
College Sophomore,4,"The experience I've had with campus housing has been great. I would recommend trying to get into Goldstein freshman year,  but if not, I've heard other dorms are okay, not as great as the newer dorms, but okay."
College Sophomore,4,There is a small gym available to students and they provide a few classes such as yoga and dance classes.
College Sophomore,4,There are a number of security calls on campus people can use to get safe transportation from a security guard whenever needed.
College Sophomore,4,There are many opportunities for jobs/internships here at Ringling. Career services do their very best to help students with what they need in this area. There are many great recruiters that come to campus.
College Sophomore,4,Many professors here are great and are very concerned of the students improvement and experience in class. There are a great variety of courses offered and summer courses and class sizes are fairly small depending on the class.
Junior,2,This is a art college we should have online. Some majors are more lucky then others but the film major is all online how is that suppose to work.
Alum,2,"Absolutely not worth the 50k+. I was a CA major and the program forces you to be a generalist- despite barely any jobs as a generalist existing. Specializing is extremely hard because of the strict curriculum. The administration is fraught with problems. Yes I got an industry job with the help of this school, but also continuing physical effects from the all nighters, poor diet and extreme stress the school forced me through in order to graduate. And I had to take classes outside the school in order to get that industry job. 

Yes, ringling can get you a job in the industry, but unless you have tons of money to blow and impeccable mental health, don’t go. 

Also to note- it’s not uncommon for the school to sue students for defamation if they have complaints. This school isn’t interested in bettering itself- only silencing it’s critics."
Junior,2,"Speaking as an Illustration major: Ringling makes a strong sales pitch, but the reality of attending is a lot less ""creative wonderland"" and a lot more ""oppressive overwork culture."" Half the friends I've made in my time here have dropped out from mental health issues or financial burdens. Unless you're a well-adjusted neurotypical with a free ride, it's not worth the loans, the stress, or even the beach (which you'll rarely even get to see bc homework).
Financially and creatively you're far better off A.) cultivating your personal work and sense of discipline, B.) building real connections with working artists in your field, and C.) attending community college/short intensive workshops to expand your skills. Don't let art school steal your soul.
ps: the school is going downhill fast because of aggressive over-enrollment & lack of resources, CA is the only major that's retaining its quality.
pps: TAKE BUSINESS CLASSES, they will help you navigate artistic self-employment/freelancing!"
Sophomore,2,"The professors are generally good (many are great) and most have mutual feelings about the increasingly terrible school administration, which takes student workspace away to host parties for donors. They invite celebrities... for donors. They tear out buildings, trees, and plants for boring grass lawn... to look good for donors. They put up flashy modern architecture that will be outdated in a few years and it honestly already looks awful now. They host next to no student events and they don't even have a large enough auditorium to host big events... so they don't even bother. It's as if they don't really prioritized students anymore."
College Junior,2,"You are not going to find a good decent party, must of them are drunk and high people, nothing fun."
College Junior,2,"It's ok. It has the space you need. It has a small gym, it does not have a lot of machines, but you can work around it."
College Freshman,2,"Ringling offers Quiditch as a team sport and travels to matches but it is not huge in terms of the college revolving around it. School spirit goes more towards our work, gallerys and community service. However there is a fully equipt gym for those who attend the college."
College Freshman,2,Some of the housing is downright scary. AVOID THE COVE AT ALL COSTS. It is a death trap with lead paint and only one shower.
College Junior,2,"Few and far between... everyone's very focused on creating and doing well. There were parties, and a lot of school functions, but not a lot of typical college ""parties""."
College Senior,2,"The school is strict about graduation requirements as well as the classes needed to be taken for the major you signed up for; however, the counselors doesn't seem to be that informative when anyone needs to know whether or not we are missing credits or anything in general. They let us know at the last second which is basically by the time we all graduate. Frustrating and not helpful tuition wise when you are taking extra classes because of that."
College Junior,2,"The food at the cafeteria is not of my like but it give you a lot of diferent options to choose from also the have vegy food, so is convinient they also have a couple places close to school where you can eat."
College Freshman,2,"There are no ""athletics"" at Ringling.
This is an Art and Design College.
You want college sports, drive to another larger town... Or watch it on TV.
We really don't miss it, as we are busy with school work and the occasional beach day.  :)"
College Freshman,2,"They do not offer full-ride opportunities and big scholarships are available to only one person per major. Overall they are not very good on scholarships or financial aid. You are automatically eligible to win small scholarships from sponsors/trustees, but its not very much."
College Freshman,2,I do not live on off-campus housing. I am a local and commute from my parents house.
College Freshman,2,"Much too difficult. They have entirely unrealistic expectations. They have a very strict attendance policy; 4 and fail. There is never any time to do anything  and you will be staying up late every single night and getting sick while doing so (the food doesn't help). But you can't miss class?? You are given about two days to finish a project in every single class every single week. Ridiculously difficult and fast paced, especially for an art school. I suffered nothing but depression and anxiety while attending Ringling. Thank god I only stayed one semester."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They changed the meal plan after I stopped using it, but the meals in the cafeteria weren't great. A lot of the food sat out and was reused for the next day when it shouldn't have. Many people had stomach issues with the food. Outtakes had the same food as the cafeteria and was pricey. The new cafe wasn't bad at all, but since it opened my senior year I didn't really go there a lot. Around the campus there isn't much. A Burger King, a burrito place called Chips, and my favorite: a hole in the wall cafe called Big E's. Cheap, friendly, and tasty, Big E's was the best place to get a quick bite."
College Sophomore,2,"There are smoking areas around the school, so its pretty controlled. Haven't seen anything weird around campus, yet."
College Junior,2,"Our Quidditch team is really good, but that's a whole different monster. We have recreational rivalries with neighboring schools, that's about it."
College Senior,2,"There's a public safety service on campus, there are cameras, call boxes, and you can ALWAYS get in touch with someone.
However, all of the safety men are 60 years old+ drive a golfcart, and do not carry any form of weaponry. Maybe a taser or pepper spray. 

There's a lot of students getting jumped for their computers, and these old men can't fight them off. They'e VERY nice guys, but in a bad situation, they don't really......help.

Last semester Ringling hired a Sarasota Country police officer from the hours of 12am to 4am to sit on campus because crime was getting out of hand. This is the type of protection campus needs 24/7"
College Freshman,2,"Really Nothing Going on – In this school, you're basically in the middle of nowhere - I admit it. But it's not like you can really do anything due to the fact that people have so much work! Public transportation is hard to get during this time too since you really need a car to get around places."
Freshman,1,"I was paying 10,000 a semester out of pocket to get here. I had to work full time in order to, and so did my husband. We saved about 1500 out of paychecks and starved so I could go here. I was humiliated by students and faculty for being poor and because I was 24 years old as a freshmen. The administration refused to work with me, or accomodate the fact that i had to live over 2 hours away from campus because I could not afford housing or find cheap apartments in Sarasota. This school broke my spirit. I became so depressed by the end I couldn't even get to my classes on time. I withdrew and I will never look back. Ringling is for rich people, and they will make damn sure you suffer if your parents don't make 6 figures."
Senior,1,"Horrid place, has been caught covering up sexual and physical assaults, they  do not discipline students, staff, or faculty properly. They are not receptive to those with disabilities, different races, etc. You are allowed ONE absence, even with COVID-19, and beyond that your grade will drop one step. An assistant dean of students has decided to sue a former student for calling attention to these issues. If you come here, you are not allowed to complain, or face severe punishment for it."
Senior,1,"For online classes, we were expected to do the same, if not more course load, but not provided with the resources to do so. All thesis classes kept their same deadlines, tuition was not lessened despite the recession and the forceful eviction from campus"
Alum,1,"Useless.... no amount of money is worth spending at Ringling. But considering they are really a lot of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.  There are many more options in this world. I invested over $300,000 for this school with narcissistic instructors, that are not mature enough to be working with these wonderfully diverse and creative group of gifted college students. They will crush your dreams if given a chance. Something happened to my daughter in her Senior year which she won't talk about. We had to pull her out halfway, lose that money, bring her back home to Texas, and then she very unenthusiastic went back for a 5th year to graduate in Computer Animation. Return on our big investment? NO.  And 5 years after graduating, she's working at a Doggy Day Care. She started out super pumped-up for Art School, and had even gotten a $40,000 scholarship from DREAM WORKS! She was bright, happy, motivated, and in 4 years Ringling College managed to BREAK HER SPIRIT. And no, NO DRUGS..so do not assume!"
Alum,1,"My dtr's SR year, she was placed in an old campus apt. Their furniture supplied by school was awful, so I did go and buy a new 2nd chair for the place. The school also supplies the mattresses. Her roommate picked the bedroom that had a 1 inch thick spongey thing beneath the waterproof mattress cover.  After a month of her roommate having bug bites, my dtr noticed her roommate had a BED BUG crawling on after just getting out of bed! That  old mattress was infested in BED BUGS! The girls went to the Assoc. Dean of Students, Chris Shaffer, for help. He was quick to put the blame on them, and told them to get out of apt and take their electronics and move down the street to some other place while they fumigate the place. In NO part of his communication to the girls was he ever decent,compassionate, empathetic, helpful or human! The girls had to move in the rain, NO CAR, huge mess! The school tossed out their furniture, and gave them ONE ROLE OF QUARTERS or laundry! WOW, Cost ME $30,000."
College Junior,1,We do not have greek life
College Junior,1,"I had an accident on campus, right outside my classroom on the second floor in late Sept. 2013. I slipped and fell hard on a huge water puddle.. Security came to help me, and he made a comment to my roommate & I that the openness to the elements/rain have been bad in this area, and he was surprised that nobody has been seriously hurt before. When the incident report was reviewed, his comment had been stricken. I have had wrist problems and multiple surgeries over the past 7 years. I have a torn ligament that prohibits me from taking extensive notes, or drawing for hours at a time. This accident put my rehab back by about a year or two. My parents (both alumni of Ringling) and myself wanted to settle with the school directly... possibly by giving me a tuition credit. The administration decided to use an insurance company, which the school changed two months later. We have submitted every dr. report, bill, statements needed, and we are still waiting.

The school also has a clinic on campus. It is a good clinic, IF you can get in to see someone without missing two classes... and its operating hours are very sporadic. At times it is not worth it, as the line is long, and they will close before you are seen. Many times I have gone there during the day, and the clinic is not open."
College Freshman,1,Graduation for most students was the biggest achievement for most.
College Sophomore,1,There is no fun here at all. Unless you watch anime.
College Sophomore,1,The schools uses the students talent to get their accredidation up
College Sophomore,1,I guess this is why our school lacks hot girls.
College Sophomore,1,The credits i recieved here will not transfer to normal schools.  The workload is grueling.  It ha to be in order to make sure you have no time to enjoy the activities and events that don't exist on campus.  Could have learned more about film in a week on youtube then at Ringling.
College Sophomore,1,"Not sure, i can't belive some students made it to senie year without going insane."
College Sophomore,1,Art schools are tough. There are some hot guys here. The only problem is that they aren't interested in girls.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life at Ringling whatsoever. The school is not nearly big enough, nor is it enough of a party school to warrant any interest."
College Freshman,1,It is in a terrible area and you can never walk by yourself off campus. The work load is so intense that you will become ill staying up every single night. The food is very low in nutrients and only helps make you ill and overweight. My hair started falling out and my cycle stopped in the first couple months from stress and depression.
College Freshman,1,"I lived in the new building, and yet my air conditioner broke, leaked, and created mold. They never once fixed it after many complaints, and it was a health hazard for me to even stay in my room. I was sleeping on the couch in the lobby my last few weeks there. I also had two outlets break which were never fixed. Terrible dorm upkeep."
College Freshman,1,"They barely even give scholarships, and when they do it's only to the best of the best people. They are near impossible to get."
College Freshman,1,They only have Quiddich which I do not consider a real sport. Only quick and efficient workers will have time for Quiddich.
College Freshman,1,"Students are rich, stuck up, and extremely self-centered. They are weird, but not in a cool artsy way like you might expect. Most people that go here are either into anime, a ""brony"", or a ""furry"", or are very conservative and religious. Or they are all of the above, of course. Do not expect strange, down-to-earth, artistic, or interesting people. Most people that go to this school are in for the money and really don't even care about art. Parties at Ringling are watching a Pixar film. Nobody likes to have fun and everyone is very serious and into their work. And LOUD!"

Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Tech is very good. The campus is beautiful and everyone is so friendly. Ruston is a very family focused town. But, there are plenty of parties on the weekend. The food at Tech is good and organizations have done their best to make this year feel as normal as possible during the pandemic. The school has done a good job of keeping students involved as much as possible along with social distancing. Greek life and sports events is also a very fun thing to get involved in. Tech is constantly renovating buildings and building new buildings that are very nice and state of the arch. Also now apartments and dorms are being built which is very needed on this campus."
Niche User,5,What I really enjoyed about Louisiana Tech was the faculty and dedication of the staff and students. It is a very productive and learning-oriented environment.
Niche User,5,My experience with Louisiana Tech has been very positive and beneficial. I have taken online Dual Enrollment classes with them while in high school and it has definitely improved my GPA and overall understanding on certain subjects.
Junior,5,Louisiana Tech is awesome.  You have the advantages of a big university but everything is so easily accessible and Ruston is just a great city.  It's home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"Louisiana Tech is a college like no other, the whole campus is a tight knit family. The friendliness makes the whole place feel like home."
Sophomore,5,"Over this past summer, I took 12 hours of classes and honestly, the experience was daunting at first but I eventually started to love it. The professors helped when I had any sort of confusion. I loved the online classes so much that I will be doing classes every summer until I graduate."
Sophomore,5,"Louisiana Tech is a great University full of great and kind people and understanding professors. I won't deny, classes do seem hard but every professor is more than willing to help you on any material you need assistance you need help with. The cafe is a nice place to go to do work and eat Louisiana food. They have a nice ice cream machine. There's always tons of events going on campus everyday so you should be willing to join in. There's tons of clubs for fun and for work. They have free tutors and 24 hour printing. 

There are somethings I would like to improve though. Besides the New Engineering Building most of the other buildings look very old. You can tell by the exterior and interior. I feel like the campus needs to fix the sidewalks that are cracking and some of the roads. 

Besides the appearance of the campus, it's actually a really wonderful place."
Junior,5,"The best thing about Louisiana Tech University has been the relationships with the professors. They want to see you excel in your courses and do anything to help aid you in the right direction. LaTech makes you feel like you're at home. The president of  the university keeps students informed and is one email or phone call away at all times, and makes time for everyone! During the past quarter, there was a death in my family. The president, my professors, and the dean of my college all reached out to me and made sure my family came over school. I recommend Louisiana Tech University to anyone who wants to go to college and make great relationships with not only other students, but professors, other staff members, and the helpful alumni."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19, all of my spring quarter classes transitioned to online. One of my professors took off proctor U and made all of the exams open notes due to all of the stress of switching online. Other professors enhanced their lecture videos and were very lenient with all of the students. The president of the University also sent an email out every single day of the quarter Sunday-Saturday with updates, words of encouragement, and where to find resources. Louisiana Tech University made the online transition as smooth as it could ever be."
Graduate Student,5,I love the big dog that they have in front but also I love the so many options that I choose to do for myself and dreams.
Sophomore,5,Louisiana Tech is like a family. The professors care about you and take the time to get your name and face down pat. The marching band is fun place to be in as well as around at events. The opportunities are plentiful in research and the small town feel makes everything about this school amazing.
Junior,5,The people are all around amazing. There are a lot of activities that you can do. There are also counseling services and tutoring services offered to students for free.
Niche User,5,"Although I have not moved on campus at Tech, a few years back, my older sister attended. Making several trips to Ruston made it feel like home. It is such a welcoming environment. Leading up to my senior year, I knew that I had to put LaTech on my list of possible colleges. Earlier this year, I received my acceptance letter. I am so proud to call myself a Bulldog!"
Niche User,5,"I enjoy Tech and everything about it. It's like a family. I'll see people on the street with a Tech T-Shirt on and ill say ""GO DAWGS"" and they shout it right back. I like to size of the campus to its big enough to know whos who, but not small enough to know everyone's business."
Junior,5,Tech is a great school for education and for enjoying your college years. The education programs are top notch while community life and organizations gives you a way to unwind from your studies. The only thing I would change is the amount of parking but every college has that problem.
Niche User,5,Louisiana Tech has always been the school that I grew up around. I have had nothing but exceptional experiences with all forms of life with the campus. Great school!
Junior,5,"Louisiana Tech University is such an amazing place to further a student’s education. I absolutely love the atmosphere here. We have a very “family-oriented” culture here at Tech. There is always someone who has your back, and there will always be someone there to guide you along the way. I personally have all of my professors’ phone numbers to contact them at any point and time. I rate Tech 10/10, and I recommend it 100%!"
Niche User,5,The very friendly atmosphere makes college not seem very scary and life-changing when a huge support system around the school and campus exists.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Louisiana Tech University, it truly feels like home. Everyone is genuinely nice and supportive. I love being able to talk to my professors, administrators, and even our President, Dr. Guice, one-on-one."
Sophomore,5,"This school feels like a home away from home. Even for the student that may live 2,000 miles away,they will always feel welcome here. I feel that we could use a consistent price on room and board,it feels like the price goes up every year or every other school year."
Senior,5,"Being a smaller school, Tech feels like a family rather than its students being cogs in a large machine. The professors truly care about their students and work with them to ensure success in postgrad life. Ruston is a great little college town that is extremely safe, which allows students to feel comfortable exploring the area."
Freshman,5,"Tech is a very diverse campus with great professors and staff. The campus is well kept. Louisiana Tech is unique because whether you are a first year student or a grad student, you feel at home from day one. The Tech family is a unique part of Tech culture that makes Tech stand out from any other school. The bonds between the students, professors, and staff create a community that is strong, and will always be there in any time of need."
Senior,5,Tech was not my first choice for college but now I can’t imagine going anywhere else. The academics are what is king here and I would put any STEM major from Tech against the nation’s best
Junior,5,"I've enjoyed being a student at Tech since the minute I stepped foot on campus. The staff will go above and beyond to help you and the student body are very composed. I've had some great professors, some not so good, but for the most part very good professors."
Alum,5,"Tech was my home for just 4 short years, but it will have my heart forever! My husband and I can't wait to show our kids where we ""grew up"" and got prepared for the real world. I really can't wait to show them our side-by-side bricks. Twenty years later, we still talk about our fantastic professors and amazing experiences on campus and in Ruston. Our degrees served as wonderful foundations for our service on active duty, graduate school programs, and our professions. We are so grateful for our time at Louisiana Tech."
Alum,5,"One of the best kept secrets of higher education in the nation today. Tech consistently surprises numerous students by over delivering in every aspect of the modern, American collegiate experience. One of the top ROI’s in the nation and truly a unique and charming school. Good luck trying not to find community or falling through the cracks because the staff and students alike will be sure to reach out."
Alum,5,"Louisiana Tech has the most beautiful campus. It is big, but not overwhelming big. If there is a rainy day then you will not be soaked from just walking class to class. The environment on campus is amazing. The students are beyond friendly and they are able to make friends easily because of the size. Also, it is a college town and the town brings a lot of support to the students, athletics and academics."
Freshman,5,LA Tech has a quarter system which allows for more breaks and a more relaxed college pace. I really enjoy the smaller campus size as well because I can find my way around. Louisiana Tech also has several social and places to get connected. It has helped me find study group or people to socialize with in my major.
Freshman,5,"i recently enrolled, but even before starting classes i have felt so unbelievably welcomed into the school and the community. the school itself is easily one of the most accommodating schools out there."
Freshman,5,"I start this college this month, but I have toured it and went to their orientation and I can already tell the entire administration care about their jobs. It has a good reputation and a great campus in all. I wish I could tell more, but I know just the basics right now."
Freshman,5,So far as I am an incoming freshman I have felt welcomed and relieved at how stress free the University made the transition for me and my parents.
Freshman,5,Louisiana Tech University offers the best Engineer and Science program in the south! Love the friendly environment around Ruston and on campus!
Sophomore,5,"Coming to college was a scary process at first, but the people make campus feel like a home away from home. Definitely recommend getting involved in some sort of organization so you can get connected to more people!"
Junior,5,I absolutely LOVE Tech. Ruston is such a great place to live and very safe! There are so many different things to do on campus and so many great organizations. The classes are on the smaller size which is very helpful because you really build a relationship with your professors. I will Ever Loyal Be.
Sophomore,5,louisiana Tech University well prepares students for the carrer of their choice. This university is on the quarter system but recives semster hours so the student can earn credits faster.
Freshman,5,Great campus tour. Pretty grounds and small hometown feel. Professors really care about your success.
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed my first year at Louisiana Tech University and plan to continue my education there. I feel that I can learn and grow in an environment because it is fit for me. The campus is well kept and the people in the area are very kind and helpful. There is good food on campus as well as the surrounding area. There is always something to or to see in Ruston. The class are perfect for engaging and learning because they are never too big and give you more of a personal connection with the teachers.
Senior,5,I loved how tight-knit the community is around here. Our college professors truly become part of a small family.
Freshman,5,All of the professors and staff are wonderful. They know what they're doing and they're very warming and welcoming.
Freshman,5,"Lousiana Tech University is a University that I am so thankful to have chosen.  My dad is a past student here and he always told me how amazing it was and he could not have been more right.  The education here is unbelievably great as well as their programs.  The teachers excel in everything that they do and will go above and beyond to help you.  Each teacher, as well as your advisor, is willing to create a personal relationship with you to make you feel comfortable and right at home.  Being here makes me feel like I will be more than prepared for my future career in Early Childhood Education.  they have showed me what it's like to be a good teacher and how important it is to have a good impact on their students.  This university has given me so much and I would recommend it to anyone considering."
Sophomore,5,"I loved attending LA TECH and feel that it is a splendid university. There are so many amazing programs with the best teachers. There are tons of extracurricular activities for all types of people. All around, the atmosphere of this campus is wonderful."
Freshman,5,"its alright, havnt started yet but i am this coming fall, trying out chemical engineering and from what ive been shown its  the top of the line and very prestigious."
Sophomore,5,"I love La tech. It is a great place to go to school. The housing is not the best. Well, the dorms are not but the apartments and the new suites are really nice. We have a chic-fil-a on campus so I spend most of my time eating there lol."
Freshman,5,"Coming from a big city and high school, I wasn't quite sure how much I would enjoy my time at Louisiana Tech. Ruston is 100% a college town, and I wasn't used to living in such a small town. Now that I've been here for about 7 months, I could not imagine myself anywhere else. At the max, it takes me about 10 minutes to get anywhere I need to go in Ruston, and I LOVE it. All my professors have been so persistent and helpful, but laid back enough to where I have grown to learn how to take initiative on things that I need to. There's always something going on on our campus. They put on so many fun events, and they even put on educational events that open up job opportunities and new knowledge for us. Everyone on the staff is so friendly and helpful. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Louisiana Tech, and I can't wait to see what this university will do for my future."
Freshman,5,I love the campus. It is so beautiful with all the brick and vegetation. The overall environment and culture of the students is amazing. I love football and this college has a great football culture. The professors know what they are teaching and support and help you so that you can prepare for the workplace.
Freshman,5,"Louisiana Tech University is a institution that allows everyone to be themselves. The program I am in, studio art, has a lot of diversity and everyone is nice and friendly. The professors here are very helpful and are willing to get you to the professional level you want to be at. Finding friends is pretty easy due to the fact that most people are welcoming and don't discriminate. Overall the campus provides plenty of opportunities and is full of resources to help you become great."
Freshman,5,I love Louisiana Tech. It has so many different opportunities and there is something for everyone there. Ruston is the perfect place for a college kid to find out who they are; there are so many fun things to do around there!
Freshman,5,"I loved how homie the campus felt. I’ve lived in Louisiana my whole life and the campus reminds me of my home, so I feel comfortable completely. I loved the fact that as an Elementary Education Major I can get into the classroom ASAP and start learning how to properly and efficiently teach children."
Freshman,5,I thoroughly enjoy Louisiana Tech University. I am currently a first year student and i have had absolutely no problems. Every professor and anyone I have ever met on this campus has been friendly and would gladly help with any situation you may encounter.
Freshman,5,LA Tech is very inclusive and I love how nice everyone is. I could only wish that all Universities would be modeled after LA Tech. The only bad part is the parking situation.
Graduate Student,5,"Attending Louisiana Tech has been the greatest experience of my life. The president, Dr. Guice, is so kind and friendly and every student has opportunities to get to know him. The campus is very student-focused and has a diverse population. Louisiana Tech is like a family. Everywhere you go, there will be a familiar face! I would choose this institution every time!"
Sophomore,5,I love attending Louisiana Tech!! The professors are awesome and will frequently help you if you have any problems with the coarse work in addition to being great people. They make me feel like everyone on campus is an extension of my family. I really cant put into words how much i love this place!
Freshman,5,"So far I am in love with Tech! Everyone is very helpful & kind. No matter what the problem may be, some one is always there to assist you. The classes are very rigerous and challenging. The professors really connect with and care about students. The cafe food is delicious & if that isn’t enough, there’re several other restaurants surrounding campus. I love the location and the spirit of Tech!"
Sophomore,5,As soon as I stepped on campus I knew it was home. There is something for everyone to feel welcome. The students support each other and encourage each other to be successful.
Sophomore,5,I love everything about Louisiana Tech and I don't see any need to change anything because the people there make you feel more welcome then ever. The education at Louisiana Tech is amazing.
Junior,5,Louisiana Tech does a wonderful job of keeping connected and having a family oriented atmosphere. There is always something going on around campus that is open for students to come and enjoy. Currently they are going through some changes in that developing more dorms and paved parking all over campus.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus. I loved the people in the engineering department. I wished the dorms were cleaned and painted during the summer for incoming freshmans and they had better beds.
Alum,5,"My tour at Louisiana Tech Univeristy was amazing. The faculty, students, and parents of everyone were very open and ready for anything you had for them. The atmosphere feels like home."
Sophomore,5,Louisiana Tech University has given me such a great college experience in just my first year there. The people there offer you so many opportunities to help your academic career. They also believe it is important for you to create relationships and there are many opportunities to do so. Their nursing program has just been ranked number one in the nation and I believe that you will be more than qualified when you leave this school.
Senior,5,My experience at Louisiana tech has been great! The diversity of the school is a plus and also the programs that are offered. The only thing that I would change would be the food options in the cafeteria to some better options.
Freshman,4,"My online experience has been pretty good. All of my classes are online so I have a lot of experience when using online at Tech. The teachers are learning with students, as it is new for both of us. The teachers have done a good job of changing from in person to online."
Alum,4,The overall sense of community experienced with the staff was second to none. Almost all of my professors were willing to go the extra mile whether it was an academic or personal issue that I was having. The academics could always be improved though.
Alum,4,"The online courses, although I only took a few of them, were well structured and the professors made themselves readily available to any issues that arose"
Junior,4,The classes themselves are fine.  It was just an adjustment for me as a student to get my time management and schedule reorganized to best benefit me and my study habits.
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience at Louisiana Tech University has been good. I have meet some amazing people. However,  I'm am senior who is still very worried about what will happen after I graduate.  If I had a real negatives to say they would be as follows: 

Housing is either utterly terrible or overly expensive.

They could focus a bit more attention to placing students in jobs after they graduate rather than trying to recruit incoming freshmen.

It feels almost like they will do anything to get you to attend but once you're there you aren't as important any more."
Junior,4,Great school and great environment. Quarter system just moves too fast for me sometimes! Almost all the professors are super nice and understanding as well
Niche User,4,"I attended Louisiana Tech for undergrad just to get out of the house. Little did I know, I would soon fall in love. Tech is a hidden gem in north Louisiana. It is inexpensive, but don't let that mislead you, the education is incredible. I graduated with a Bachelors in Fine Arts. All of my classes were small and personal. I found it easy to succeed, the teachers were all very involved, and Ruston is an incredible place to start a life."
Sophomore,4,"I will say that the online experience is definitely harder than just coming to class in person. I like that you don't have to actually come to class and can just chill in your bed and listen to the lectures, but for me. The first year I went to Tech I formed a study group with some friends so I'm used to studying and doing problems with people, but with COVID and online classes that was very hard. All of the group projects became solo projects which felt like an overload but I got through it. The online classes made me really lazy. One of the hardest parts was not getting too lazy to the point that you'd sleep the day away. I'd rather take classes where I can meet people in person. If I can do that while taking a class online I don't mind."
Junior,4,"I loved attending Louisiana Tech University and experiencing the atmosphere of the school. Even though I am transferring to a new college, I would definitely rather attend Lousiana Tech University. I love how easy it is to meet new people. Classes are very understanding and many professors are helpful."
Freshman,4,I love Louisiana Tech University. I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.I love Louisiana Tech University.
Sophomore,4,They are very welcoming and want you to be involved!! I have never met an unkind student. The faculty and staff are always willing to help and the students always make time to help you out if need be. There are tons of ways to get involved and they try to make sure no one feels left out.
Sophomore,4,"I'm nearly done with my second year here and my experience has been great! I am studying to be a mechanical engineer and, while it is quite difficult, I have already acquired so many valuable skills."
Niche User,4,I like the fact that Louisiana Tech University has a diverse selection of students. The professors and students there give a warm welcoming atmosphere to new faces.
Junior,4,"Louisiana Tech faculty and students tend to be very religious (Christian). It is a bit off-putting, and I'm saying that as a Christian myself. The folks in the area tend to be rather racist. Activities and organizations tend to be segregated by race. Academically, Tech is pretty good, especially for engineering students."
Junior,4,"Louisiana Tech is one of the least expensive schools in Louisiana, but still stands to be incredible credibility.  I am a part of the College of Business. This college is very passionate about helping students."
Freshman,4,Tech is a very friendly place and there are so many diverse groups of people here and interesting things to do. Resources abound; the only negative is that some of the buildings are on the older side and some pre-established competitive groups within the school can be a little cliqish.
Sophomore,4,I love Louisiana Tech University because it is such a small community and everyone knows everyone. You get to have interactions with the professors instead of just being a number on a list of names. I especially like the Forestry department because the professors are very open and always have an open door policy. They will always help if you just ask for it. The only bad thing is the parking situation.
Junior,4,I have loved every minute of my academic experience at tech. I love the campus and the environment Ruston provides Louisiana Tech Students. I have had some difficulties with housing but that hasn’t put a damper on how much I love the school. I believe my college is unique in the involvement of proffessors they seem to take you in as family and truly care about your success. I highly reccomend Louisiana Tech to anybody looking for a good college.
Freshman,4,"Louisiana Tech is a medium-sized university with outstanding academic programs, specifically in STEM fields. The campus is beautiful, especially in the spring. There are clubs and opportunities available for every student. While it's not known as a party school, the school hosts several events every year designed to destress and have fun, and there are several locations off-campus where students can get together and hang out. The housing options available on-campus are limited. The dorms need renovating and there are several freshmen-only buildings. There are many options for those wishing to live off-campus as well. Overall, a fantastic university!"
Freshman,4,I will be a freshman entering Louisiana Tech University in the fall.  I love the campus and the enviorment.  The university offers all the things that I was looking for in a College.  The only thing that I wish that could be changed is more housing.
Freshman,4,"I get a very nice, southern hospitality type of feeling from this college. The teachers are mostly great, and the curriculum is hard and rewarding. The dorms are pretty bad, so try to get out of them as soon as possible."
Alum,4,"I am originally from Atlanta, GA and I came to LA Tech on a track and field scholarship. Moving to Ruston was a drastic change for me. Despite the lack of skyscrapers and the constant traffic, I would say that I adjusted to life here well. I really enjoyed the time I spent here and I definitely was able to grow as an independent individual. I would recommend making Louisiana Tech/Ruston more interesting. Ruston is already a small city so everything here gets repetitive over time."
Freshman,4,"The professors are great, they're always here to help. The food is good but they always have the same thing so you get tired of it. The community is very welcoming. Ruston is a small city but you can find some things to do to have fun. Overall, I really enjoyed being here so far."
Niche User,4,Louisiana Tech University is a great school. It a very well rounded school with great professors and an amazing student life. It is amazing walk around the school and see smiling students as they carry on their day. I think that LA Tech is well rounded in their educational teachings.
Junior,4,This school is in the process of getting updated with new housing and new buildings. I think most of the professors here really care about their students.
Senior,4,I really like Louisiana Tech and I think the electrical engineering program is very good. I think they need to hire more teachers for engineering. The focus is too much on business.
Junior,4,So far my experience at Louisiana Tech has been a positive one. The school does it's best to include the include the students in most activities and there are a lot of opportunities to get extra help for classes. The workload for certain higher level classes is kind of bad but that's par for the course in prestigious schools.
Freshman,4,Have fun as much as you can. Great environment and has one of the best athletics in the nation. Plenty of annoying people but if you find the right circle this will be the best experience of your life.
Freshman,4,"Living on campus without a car makes living in Ruston a little harder than the average person. Off campus is not very pedestrian friendly. As far as the campus itself, it's very small and easy to navigate.  All of the professors I've had so far have been very dedicated to teaching, and all of my classes have been worthwhile. There is not a huge party scene outside of fraternities and sororities. Tech is a good college for people who are focused on their studies and don't mind the lack of party scene."
Freshman,4,Well its a very good University and they have many resources that help me achieve excellent academic preformace at that school.
Freshman,4,"Loved the campus love love love the sports!!! The only change would be to update the dorms, but that is happing now. Go LA Tech"
Freshman,4,"Everyone I met there was so nice and helpful, including the faculty on campus. I loved spending time in downtown Ruston because the buildings were beautiful and the store owners were very sweet. It's a nice sized campus with a lot to offer as far as stores, churches, and other necessary things."
Sophomore,4,Tech is a great school and number one in the state of Louisiana. The school isn't too big or too small and there's lots to do here.
Alum,4,"Louisiana Tech University is a very special place. It's in the middle of a small, but lovely community. It is easy to get involved both on campus and within the community, which is what will really make your college experience a memorable one. The orientation leaders get you off to a great start and there are tons of student services available. I highly recommend LA Tech University."
Senior,4,"Louisiana Tech is a great school with professors that will absolutely go the extra mile for a student willing to do the same. The thing about Tech is that its flagship programs are all STEM, especially engineering. In light of this, most of the money does not necessarily go to social sciences, humanities, etc. However, Tech is a really great school. I have had no problem getting internships, getting involved on campus, and really trying to be a leader. Tech has all the opportunities that a student could want, but it is on the student to seek those out and make themselves better. Finally, the great thing about Tech is that I am always, always seeing someone on campus that I know, but I continually meet new people. The quality of students is rising and Tech is certainly a school to watch going forward."
Freshman,4,I have overall enjoyed my experience with La Tech. There are various opportunities for all students with a great feeling of welcoming environment.
Junior,4,"I have loved Louisiana Tech since the moment I set foot on campus. I love the atmosphere and the friendliness from everyone on staff. Ruston is a wonderful place to live and I've never encountered an unkind person since I began there three years ago. Every teacher I've had at Louisiana Tech has been great. In my experience, they all go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material and really learn what is taught! LA Tech has a beautiful campus. Though some of the dorms aren't the greatest place you'll stay, living on campus freshman year have me a college experience I'll never forget. The stories and memories Louisiana Tech has given me will be stories I tell for years to come. Ever loyal I will be & HBTD!"
Freshman,4,"So far I have enjoyed myself at Louisiana Tech, I find that the academic atmosphere is very positive and that all of the professors care about the well-being of the students and their success in the classroom."
Senior,4,"This school is really great. This place is my current home, and I have to say that my years here have been pretty interesting. There is a very diverse population of people from all over the world collected here, along with some really bright minds. The campus is really good looking with mostly matching building designs, and they are constantly developing new projects. The quarter system is really fast paced, but if you stay on top of it you can get through it. Over all this place is a very positive experience."
Freshman,4,"I LOVE LOUISIANA TECH!! Choosing to attend LaTech was the best decision of my life. When I was a sophomore and Junior in high school I would myself I would absolutely not go there, but once I toured and talked to a few of the professors, my mind was automatically made up. Everyone is so kind and helpful. They say that Ruston would not be Ruston without Louisiana Tech, and when you visit the town, that statement is correct. Tech is a wonderful school with amazing teachers, a beautiful campus, and so much school spirit. I am blessed to call Tech my school and soon my Alma Mater."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Louisiana Tech is a nice school. However, once you're used to living there, the town can get boring."
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman and so far I've liked La Tech. The campus makes me feel safe and happy. The reason I gave it four stars is because of dining. There are only two good placed to eat on campus, which are Chick-fil-a and McCalisters, and the rest of the places no one even looks at. But the teachers I've had so far are so nice and also very helpful."
Freshman,4,Louisiana Tech University is a very beautiful college and has excellent professors along with services available to students. Included in the tuition is unlimited access to a gorgeous gym with updated equipment and free classes. Also included are counselling services to help students adjust.
Sophomore,4,"The education is great! I really feel like I'm learning skills that will be useful in my career. The people are very friendly and it seems like everyone really cares about my education. Living in the dorms is great because they're in the center of campus so it's easy to get to class and also meet up with friends. But with how many clubs and organizations  there are to choose from, it's really easy to get involved on campus, even when you don't live in the dorms. It is a college town, so a lot of people go home on the weekends. If you like to be busy all the time this could be a problem, but it gives me time to hang with a few friends and catch up on schoolwork."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Louisiana Tech University. Overall I like the friendliness of everyone, and how close everything is from the campus. The professors are here to help you and make sure you pass and give you there office hours that they can give you extra help. The best part i enjoy is the apartments and how close they are to campus and there build. There are some things I would like to change which would the parking, there's few parking and take awhile to find one with out getting a ticket."
College Freshman,4,The sports are very good on the campus
College Senior,4,The football field is especially outstanding as they are continually redoing it.
College Junior,4,"This university is fairly small, but has a nice and welcoming atmosphere."
College Junior,4,Very little crime but when something does occur the police department on campus as well as the parish police are on it immediately and address/solve the issue.
College Junior,4,Campus doesn't revolve around Greek life. Non-Greeks are treated the same as Greeks.
College Junior,4,Many sports to participate in. Excellent teams. School spirit is high and support from other students are as well.
College Junior,4,"From my experiences at Louisiana Tech, I would rate the quality of the course as exceptional along with the very experienced and helpful professors. At Tech there is a vast majority of courses offered each with unique and varied experiences. Most class styles are pretty standard to what you would find at any other college however, the class sizes are generally small from my experience."
College Junior,4,I have not had the opportunity to attend any career day activities but from what I have seen around campus is that Tech really put forths the effort to help its students find a job or career in the future.
College Junior,4,"For the experience regarding my two full years here at Louisiana Tech, I have not come across no circumstances that would put me in harms way for that would have made me fell unsafe."
College Junior,4,"I am not really fit to write a detailed review over the Greek Life here at Tech but, from what I have heard and or seen from fraternitys and soroitys they appear to be great sources of social interaction."
College Junior,4,"As I connot really speak for other majors, I can speak for the experiences I have had with the aviation program and community.  I find that they are both very welcoming and interested in every student that enrolls in the program. Everyone here is very willing to help you excel towards your perfered aviation career."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics are great , the whole school supports them and the school spirit is ridiculous"
College Freshman,4,"Its really good , i was there in the summer for a math program and now i'm starting in the fall over there as a freshman , i think its really cool. What makes the school unique is that its a small school but really good in academics at the same time"
College Freshman,4,"Fall classes have not started, so I have not had the opportunity to meet any of my professors or learn from them yet, but I have had the chance to make my fall schedule. The variety of classes offered is definitely impressive, and the availability of spots in classes is very nice. My class sizes should be relatively small since I will be in honors. It should be around twenty, which is ideal for me."
College Freshman,4,"I truly have not had the chance to experience this yet being a freshman, but I have been told by administrators, as well as some fellow upperclassmen, that the availability and prospects of internships and jobs right out of school are very high."
Senior,2,The online classes that are intended to be online are pretty good in my experience. Being a student during the COVID 19 crisis many classes that were never meant to be online were forced to move online shortly after they already started. This caused many problems throughout my college experience and has thus effected this rating.
Freshman,2,"I would like to see change because everything here is mediocre in quality. The campus, the classes, the food, and the whole experience. Administrators, try to make it seem better than it actually is, it's overrated. Events and clubs are mostly poorly planned and campus life is mostly quiet and inactive over the weekends."
College Freshman,2,The space in the rooms are too small and very crowded.
College Freshman,2,I live in Harper and its so old and falling apart.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the greek life fight with each other and the student do not particularly like them.
College Freshman,2,Admissions misled me about my transfer credits which were not counted toward my degree at La Tech.
College Freshman,2,"Two words: BLACK MOLD. There is a piece of paper that says something along the lines of, ""don't worry we checked for asbestos in 1993."""
College Senior,2,Some of the rules are strict and people cannot wait to move of campus to have more freedom.
College Freshman,2,I live in the dorms and share a room with two other girls. It's super small with no room to move around. The walls are thin so I can hear everything in the hallway. The girls are super nice but that doesn't make up how bad the rooms are.
College Freshman,2,"Shootings, burglaries, Pedestrians getting hit, muggings"
College Senior,2,"Get your questions ready before you go.  Be prepared for different scenarios.  Be patient, the desk attendants can't answer your questions.  They will have to go and ask someone else, almost every time."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The party scene at my school is kept under wraps.  If someone doesn't tell you about the event, you want find out."
College Senior,2,"La Tech is very traditional. Being an architecture major, I find the entire campus to be boring and non-lifting towards a more modern feel for the students. This school always goes the cheapest instead of the most efficient, and I don't really know why."
College Freshman,2,"It would be beneficial to have a campus bus system that takes you from campus to far away stores since there is quite a bit of required shopping that you cannot do in the immediate area. Instead, professors in University Seminar insisted that we mingle and find friends who we could hitch rides with. I think this is a brilliant idea to promote socializing, but it's still quite inefficient at times because everyone has their own obligations."
College Freshman,2,"Students can only park in specified zones depending on the time of day. Tickets are issued daily due to constant rounds by a worker. Cars are not necessary for students who are healthy, live on campus, and don't have to carry excess baggage to class each day. Bikes would be more efficient if anything. Parking spaces fill up early during the day. If a student's classes begin any time after eight in the morning, they shouldn't even attempt to locate a parking spot near central campus, but feel free to try, there are lucky situations more times that not."
College Freshman,2,Initially received out of state tuition waiver - this voided all my federal financial aid options??
College Freshman,2,"There isn't any public transportation, but not needed in such a small town/campus. Most people have their own car or bike."
College Freshman,2,There's truly nothing worth reporting because this town and this campus are incredibly dull.
College Freshman,2,"The girls are not what I was accustomed to and not at all what typical ""college girls"" are like."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're from some back woods, duck hunting, inbred town, the academics here are laughable."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't own a car, you have to try to get rides from people you know. There is absolutely no public transportation."
College Freshman,2,"I hope you like greasy, fast food chains because that's all there is."
College Freshman,2,The weather can change 40 degrees from day to day but the one constant is that it is always humid.
College Freshman,2,Everything here was top of the line about 25 years ago.
College Freshman,2,"Down here in the Bible Belt, there's are plenty of students who disagree with what being in college entails."
College Freshman,2,I was briefly pledging a fraternity but the party life generally associated with Greek life is far from that on this campus.
College Freshman,2,The sports teams are all below average and they do not bring much excitement to the dullness of everyday life in Ruston.
College Sophomore,2,Some off campus housing is down right nasty. Others are way better than the apartments on campus. It all depends on where you can find a spot.
College Sophomore,2,Almost everyone here drinks or smokes weed. about 75% of the students do.
College Sophomore,2,Everyone has their own little cliques and we dont mix it up.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is not a lot to do in Ruston outside of campus. 
College Junior,2,"The need for a car on campus is pointless.  You will only need a car if you want to go home often.  It would also be convenient if you wanted to travel around Ruston for errands.  Everything on campus is in walking distance.  Everyone parks their car in the morning and then walk to their classes.  If you did not want to walk then you could ride your bike.  The closest airport is in Monroe which is about a thirty minute drive.  There is a bus that stops in Ruston if you wanted to take the bus home.  There are not many taxis, if any.  Travel in Ruston is pretty limited."
College Senior,2,"Most of the greeks are into heavy partying, drugs and drinking. They do, however, do some things for the community here."
College Sophomore,2,Its not great but its not just horrible unless you live in a dorm!
College Junior,2,"Everyone ALWAYS has trouble out of our financial aid department. Things are super, super slow and I was denied for understandable reasons - but I had never, ever received any financial aid from government before. If I didn't have band scholarships, I'd be in even more debt. When I tried to get an appeal to get federal aid, my heart surgery didn't even count as good enough to get an appeal and the decision was made so quickly I doubt they even cared to understand. The student workers don't seem to know what they're doing half the time and it's not really their fault if they're not trained well. One of the main people in charge is rarely in the office. It's just such a hassle to get any answer from any of them. This year, seemed like every one of my friends had an issue of some kind from their office."
College Junior,2,Not all buildings are wheelchair accessible or accessible to people with other disabilities because of no elevator. The food is good at Mcalisters.
College Freshman,2,"Louisiana Tech police take their jobs verys seriously. Parking is the number one offence for students. Parking is somewhat limited at Louisiana Tech and if you park in a handicap spot, or in the wrong zone you will get a ticket. Noise complaints are also taken very seriously. The campus police can give you fines or holds on your account (making you unable to register for classes on time). Alcohol is also a serious offense on campus, considering Louisiana Tech is a dry campus. Having alchol found in your possesion on campus can get you kicked off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol at Louisiana Tech are only accessible to those students who go around looking for it. Those students who do ""drugs"" are mostly only smoking; I have not seen any other drug use. Students do drink often, but most are over 21 years old as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited bars and clubs; have to be 21+ years old to access. They are quite distant for walking, and cabs are limited and quite expensive. If anything, try to acquaint fraternity and sorority members to join their parties, if you want some nightlife fun. Or else, just have a house party for yourself and some friends and it'll be a lot more fun than going to a bar."
College Sophomore,2,"You'll be lucky if you find a parking spot on campus, though walking to school isn't bad. The campus is pretty small, so you could get from one end to another in about 10 minutes. The police at Tech always have ""ticketers"" looking for cars who are not validated to park in specific areas. Parking space is limited, so if you choose to park on campus, be sure to be the early bird."
Senior,1,"I am a graduating engineering senior from Tech, and I’ve had a very negative experience. If you’re not familiar with substandard Southern schools, let me give you a refresher:

Racism
Fatty Food
Low emphasis on improvement or self awareness. 

If you’re coming from the North like I was, you may not be consciously thinking, “Wow, I’m really glad I’m a white male,” LaTech will be sure to remind you. Taking a trip to Ruston is like taking a trip 30 years into the past. White men often you use the N-Word, and talks of segregation still occur: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-school-district-desegregate-elementary-school-classrooms-ruston

Grambling, a HBC (Historically Black College), still exists about 10 minutes away in order to maintain seeming racial and societal segregation between wealthy Ruston and relatively poorer Grambling."
College Sophomore,1,prepare to get ticketed or locked up by racist cops if you enjoy yourself after 11 pm.
College Sophomore,1,"Overly priced, poorly managed, old housing. also prepare to get robbed."
College Sophomore,1,"If your not rich, prepare to starve."
College Sophomore,1,Louisiana Tech has the worst Financial Aid Services known to US Universities.
College Sophomore,1,Dorms are small are disgusting.  Bathrooms are disgusting.  Rules are disgusting.  Parking is atrocious
College Sophomore,1,Ruston is a small town with very little to do
College Sophomore,1,"In my personal opinion, the fraternity greek life is great.  If i were a guy, I would totally get involved in it.  The sorority greek life however is a different story.  The girls all talk bad about each other, really snobby, plan out what they are going to say to rushees before even meeting them."
College Freshman,1,The dorms are extremely old and the cockroaches are getting bigger.
College Freshman,1,Louisiana is stuck in the 60's in terms of accepting any minorities.
College Freshman,1,There are 3 bars in the town and they are all below average; especially once you've been a few times. There is nothing to say about the nightlife other than non-existent.
College Freshman,1,This school and this town are where fun goes to die. The academics are a joke for anyone who comes from either the north or from a private school.
College Sophomore,1,"I love Tech, but I have a lot of complaints about the housing options. The few options we have are not good ones. First of all, everyone one must have 80 credit hours in order to live off campus, which would be fine if the living conditions on campus were better and cheaper. The options we have are, to live in a small dorm room with one or two roommates or to live on an on campus apartment with 1 or 3 roommates. In two dorm halls there are community bathrooms and in one hall there is one bathroom per two rooms. Each hall has a different problem, including mold, roach infestation, or rat infestation. These are typical dorm room conditions, but the prices are ridiculous and many times unaffordable, especially for students paying for their education on their own. The apartments are better conditioned, but completely unaffordable. In addition, a student living on campus must have an expensive meal plan that gives more food than a human can even consume in a weeks time. The housing office is also very nonnegotiable and inconvenient to reason with."
College Freshman,1,Parking on Louisiana Tech campus is a nightmare. There are never open spots and if you park in the wrong zone or in a handicap spot you WILL get a ticket. The best option is to find a spot and walk everywhere you go. If you are driving to school from off campus you will most likely be parking pretty far away so get to school with enough time to walk to class.
College Junior,1,"No Small Town Charm Here – Ruston is very tiny, and there are not a lot of things to do in Ruston. To find fun activities you usually have to drive at least 20 minutes outside of town."
College Junior,1,Small Town Nothing Better to Do. Police give you parking tickets way to often and there is not enough parking on campus. The parking lots are not maintained at all and are full of pot holes. The cops do man checks in the female dorms but never do them in the male dorms. Guys can not be in the dorms after 12. Were adults now are we not... They harrass students with small traffic violation stops...
College Sophomore,1,The school needs to have more of a variety of foods offered on campus. The majority of the food choices are unhealthy fast food and over-priced.
College Senior,1,Campus Experience – When it rains the sidewalks flood which makes it impossible to go to class dry.
College Sophomore,1,"Glad I Don't Drive to School! The parking is pretty terrible. It can take you up to 30 minutes just to find a spot and you still end up walking a lot, this is especially frustrating in bad weather. Instead of building us a parking garage, they take up what little space we have for parking to build new buildings and don't make new areas to replace them. The only credit I give to them is that when you get a ticket, they'll go easy on you if you're just visiting or if it's still early in the quarter and you haven't gotten a parking sticker yet."
College Senior,1,"Parking on our campus is by far the hardest thing to do. if you can find a parking spot then the rest of your day is pretty much good to go, if you can find one. I have to park so far away from my classes that I may as well just ride my bike to class which is something that I have started doing. We need more parking spots."

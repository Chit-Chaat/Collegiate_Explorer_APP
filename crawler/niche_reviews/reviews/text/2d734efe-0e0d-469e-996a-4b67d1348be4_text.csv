Alum,5,"Bellarmine was my first choice to attend and it met and exceeded every expectation that I had. Oh yes it was expensive. (very) But it was worth. every. penny.

My time here was transformational and absolutely wonderful."
Alum,5,Took only a few classes online. They were good! It was missing a little something compared to in person but still effective and I learned a lot.
Alum,5,"I absolutely adored my time at Bellarmine and miss it tremendously. I felt valued and I grew both academically and personally. I graduated in May of 2020, in the midst of COVID19. Although it was an ugly situation, my professors and the BU staff worked to give me as much support as possible during that time. Bellarmine truly is my home away from home. On this campus, I found a family within both Residence Life and with the international student community. My classes challenged and inspired me. As a first generation student, I found dreams here that I never thought would be possible for me.  
Bellarmine has a long way to go with campus diversity, although I do feel like they are realizing this and working to improve. There have been multiple cases of active racism on campus that were not handled properly, however I am hopefully that BU has learned from their mistakes and that they are actively fighting to ensure equality on campus, but it is important to be aware of this before coming."
Freshman,5,I can not rate this area because I have not yet started classes. I am hoping that the COVID does not prevent me from having a first year college experience.
Freshman,5,"I will begin my journey with Bellarmine in the fall so I can only speak from a selection process standard. I toured several universities and Bellarmine by far had the best tour. There were few questions that I have had since attending this tour. I chose Bellarmine because I want to be more than just a number. With Bellarmine's small classroom ratio (often 12:1 or 15:1), I feel confident that I will have the opportunity to ask questions without feeling like a room of 200 random strangers are looking at me. Bellarmine has a 95% success rate of graduating students and I feel that says something about their curriculumn and staff. Don't let the price tag deter you from applying. The Financial Aide department will go above and beyond to find a financial awards package that will assist you with your journey. The campus is BEAUTIFUL and is located in one of the safest neighborhoods in Louisville, KY. Plus, this year Bellarmine is moving up to be a D-1 School!"
Senior,5,Bellarmine has handled this pandemic well and making the transition from face to face classes to online classes easy!
Senior,5,It’s a great place if you like to know everyone! The staff cares about each and every one of their students. They are always willing to help when you need them help.
Alum,5,"Bellarmine is a lovely, warm University with an inclusive community. The small class sizes create a great student-teacher relationship. Many professors work with students to provide help outside of class. The community at Bellarmine is nice as the student body is relatively small. You hardly ever go somewhere on campus without someone saying hello! The placement of the university is also a plus as it is close to downtown Louisville Kentucky. An exciting city with a warm and welcome university."
Graduate Student,5,"I really enjoy the small class sizes and the attention given by professors to students. They really seem to care for us, beyond their classroom."
Freshman,5,"Overall excellent university which tends to the needs of its students and staff, also extremely inclusive. The only improvements which I personally believe need to be made at the ones dealing with campus food, especially regarding the ""meal swipes"" and ""flex dollars""."
Freshman,5,I felt safe on campus and there are plenty of places to shop nearby. There are also many things to get involved in. I wish they had more sports teams and better/cheaper food. But overall great.
Freshman,5,I am on the field hockey team and I am loving the student athlete life. There is so much excitement about the move to D1 and it is amazing to see all of the coaching working extra hard to make this a smooth transition.
Sophomore,5,"Very welcoming and willingness environment to make sure its the best place to be. From helping with classes, finding interests, activities, people, and more."
Graduate Student,5,This University provides a challenging curriculum by professors that truly care about your learning experience. Professors are easy to talk to and are always available for questions outside of class. Best university I've been to by far
Senior,5,"I thought I wouldn't like attending yet another small, private, religious institution after high school, but Bellarmine is an extremely open and welcoming community that accepts all types without hesitation. I love the tight-knit community and variety of groups and clubs for all interests and backgrounds. I also love the location, situated right in the midst of the Highlands, the center of much of Louisville's culture. It is truly a wonderful place."
Freshman,5,"I love how Bellarmine has small class sizes. Since this is a small school, this place is like a close community."
Sophomore,5,When I first thought about college I was scared of being independent. The community environment at Bellarmine made it easier to assimilate into college life.  The campus is small enough that everyone there are peers.
Graduate Student,5,"Bellarmine University is on a beautiful campus and in a wonderful location in Louisville. Not too far from downtown, but far enough to not be in the big city. There is such a nice and friendly atmosphere and plenty big for the number of students enrolled."
Freshman,5,Bellarmine is a great college for young adult who wants to pursue their dreams. Bellarmine has one of the nicest campuses in the country and the staff is just beyond excellence.
Freshman,5,"So far, my first year at Bellarmine has been amazing. The people are great, food is good, buildings are clean and class is enjoyable."
Senior,5,"Bellarmine lives its Catholic identity of being open and welcoming to all people, regardless of sexual orientation, race, religion, gender, socioeconomic status, and the like.  Bellarmine challenges its students by being a liberal arts institution and encouraging students to study topics outside of their major(s).

I lived at Bellarmine for three years, two of which I worked on Residence Life.  The Residence Life team's comprised of highly qualified professional staff and students who assist students in all aspects of on-campus living.  In addition to the Student Activities Center, the Residence Life office provides many great experiences and events for students to attend and enjoy.

The teachers are friendly and very knowledgeable of their material.  Students receive better attention in class than larger schools because of the small class size.  The school is near shops and restaurants, as well as the mall and downtown within 10-15 minutes from the campus.

Go Knights!"
Senior,5,"From the arches at the front entrance to the endless array of scenic views on campus, Bellarmine University is easy to fall in love with at first glance. A closer look will show the interconnected community created by a standard set by the warm, hospitality of the faculty. Bellarmine allows each student to expand their horizons on areas of study outside their comfort zone. In addition, there is always an organization one can create lasting friendships in."
Sophomore,5,Bellarmine has a wonderful campus and all faculty and professors are awesome and really care for your success.
Sophomore,5,"I love Bellarmine because of the amazing people and opportunities there. The professors truly care about me personally and academically, both when I am doing well in class and when I am struggling. This is incredible because I feel that I can connect better to them and learn more. They are willing to share their own life stories with the class, explain their struggles, and give us advice on how to improve our college experience."
Alum,5,"Bellarmine sits on a beautiful campus. Which was the first thing I loved about it. It is a close knit campus. It is an academic forward school, with athletics being division II. Sometimes it can seem bland. But the culture of Louisville is able to compensate where Bellarmine lacks. Diversity is lacking severely, but hopefully that will change in years to come."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love Bellarmine and everything about it! The campus is beautiful, and staff really look to help each and every student who comes through their doors."
Niche User,5,The professors are extremely helpful and will do everything they can to make sure you succeed. All of the students on campus are very friendly and you never feel lonely. Bellarmine offers many classes that are interesting and diverse. There will always be something that you will be interested in and there's plenty of new things to try.

Freshman,5,I really like the inclusiveness and how friendly everyone is. They're big on diversity and broadening peoples horizons and I like that about this University.
Freshman,5,I love the campus... it’s such a small and older-looking area. The professors are very open with office hours and are always willing to help. They even give out personal cell phone numbers in case the students need any help. The classrooms are small so that more help is available. Everyone there is really helpful and nice.
Alum,5,"Fantastic institution for growing inside, and outside, the classroom.  Top-notch professors know their stuff.  Beautiful campus with quite nice dorms.  The place will position you for a successful career and life.  Excellent law, med, and other grad school placement (I got into the law school of my choice)."
Freshman,5,The second I arrived on campus it felt like home and a place where I could make numerous memories that will last a lifetime! The college visit was so personal and informative. The professors and the staff provide tremendous support and guidance.
Senior,5,"The reason I chose Bellarmine University is the fact it felt like a second home. I didn't feel overwhelmed in my classes, and the small campus gave me the chance to do one-on-one with all my professors, who actually cared about my grades and showed me how to stay on the right path to graduate. It is a beautiful campus surrounding by so much to do! The whole community around Bellarmine is welcoming and supportive."
Freshman,5,"Bellarmine University has a great reputation for the business school. The professors are the best! Bellarmine is like a home for all, the people here are always there to give a helping hand regardless of your ethnicity or religion. Bellarmine is a university that is genuinely interested to make their students excel in their lives. They provide mentoring programs to assist you to your future academic life. I love my experience here at Bellarmine, and there is absolutely nothing i would like to change. ""There's no place like home"". Go knights!"
Sophomore,5,"Bellarmine is a smaller university which allows for a good teacher to student ratio.  The academics are quite challenging but in a way that is meaningful.  The campus is clean, friendly, and quiet.  Amenities and activities are abundant and the campus is close to many amenities and attractions."
Junior,5,Bellarmine is my dream school. The campus is beautiful as well as the city of Louisville. The class sizes are no larger than 30 people which makes for a one on one environment with the professors. Since being at Bellarmine I have had numerous Internship offers with big companies. It definitely has set me up for success.
Sophomore,5,"The community at Bellarmine is tight-knit. I really like the fact I am given the freedom to be independent with the guidance and supervision of faculty who actually care about you. I find that most Bellarmine students get along with each other and I am able to avoid the""cliqueness"" of high school so I have friends from all different backgrounds and majors and interests."
Freshman,5,"I start school in the fall at Bellarmine but I am extremely excited. Throughout my search for colleges this past year, something stood out about Bellarmine. I was set on going out of state for college to get closer with family, but that all changed when I visited Bellarmine. The students and staff are incredible. I am always excited to be on campus for events. When I went to registration back in April, there wasn't a single student ambassador or professor that I did not love. They're all so nice and inviting and super helpful with any questions you have.I will be a commuter student when I attend, but that hasn't changed how involved I will be. It doesn't matter if you're a commuter student or if you live on campus, everyone is involved with everything.  I felt like I was already at home when I was walking around on campus. I can't wait to make this my home for the next four years."
Niche User,5,"Oh my goodness, this place is the absolute best place to go for college. They are just amazing. A teacher would come back to a lab to help the kids succeed. They would help us study till 2-3-4 a.m. They really care about you succeeding and knowing that you succeeded. They are just a great program, love the food and staff and sports just all around they are a great program."
Freshman,5,"I have not yet attended Bellarmine but, the aid and guidance they have provided for setting up my first year has been wonderful. It seems to be a wonderful university with a great population for people to flourish. I am excited."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my time as a Bellarmine student. The campus is incredibly inviting and really feels like one big, happy family. There is something to do for everyone, no matter what your interests are. There are over 100 different clubs, and if someone wishes to start a new one, they have the ability to do so! In addition to to Bellarmine having something to do for everyone, the professors are incredibly helpful and very engaging. I have yet to have had a professor that did not go out of their way to help me succeed. All of my professors challenge me to think in ways I did not before and to go outside of my comfort zone. I have made so many life long friends here and I know that after I finish college, I will have no trouble finding a job, purely because Bellarmine is so prestigious."
Freshman,5,"Bellarmine University is a great private university where you can go and be with other people like you. The Universities great when it comes to someone needing accommodations for anything and I haven't seen any University like that. Bellarmine offers so many great things like free tutoring and writing help. I chose Bellarmine because I knew it was a place where I could thrive. You meet incredible new people, the food is alright, they have awesome professors, the campus is amazing and even is in the city of Louisville which has many amazing things."
Freshman,5,I love that the class sizes are so small. By having fewer people in the class it allows a teacher to better connect with his or her students. Most of the programs are very competitive which inspires students to get above average grades. They even offer free tutoring! Bellarmine is a great place to get connected with the people both on and off campus.
Freshman,5,"The campus is small so you don't have to walk super far from your car or dorm to get to class. The class sizes are also small, which gives you a one on one learning experience with your professors. I have had so far at Bellarmine and I am glad I made the choice to go to college here."
Freshman,5,"My college experience so far has been great. The people here are really nice and helpful. The professors are extremely helpful and are always willing to answer your questions to help you learn. I love the small class sizes and I love having a specific major because I actually get to learn what I want to learn about. Freshman orientation was fun and very helpful when it came to meeting people. However, I think we should have been put into groups based on our major because those are the people we would be more likely to have a class with. Other than that orientation was fun and I hope to be a leader next year. "
Niche User,5,"This college is absolutely amazing. The professors are awesome, class sizes are small, food is great, comfortable are dorms, and they have such great programs. I would recommend this college to someone who likes one on one interaction with professors, and who desires personal teaching. "

College Freshman,5,"I am looking forward to my future experiences. I know that class sizes vary but the average at Bellarmine tends to be smaller sized classes, which was a major factor when choosing my school. There is a variety of classes offered, and from my encounters with professors so far, they care  about our success and are deeply passionate about their teachings,"
College Freshman,5,"Campus security is excellent. I feel little worry about anyone getting into my residence unwanted. There are frequent security call posts, so if I ever feel threatened or in any trouble it is easy to alert security. They are very willing to provide an escort when crossing campus late at night as well."
College Junior,5,"Bellarmine gives its students a great education that is respected by everyone in the community. Bellarmine is known as a great school. There are many job fairs and involvement fairs available for students to become involved in the community and the school.

College Sophomore,5,Safety and security is of top priority at our school security is every at all times which gives a sense of security and safety.
College Sophomore,5,There is a great value of having a Bellarmine degree. The community has many employment opportunities for students and graduates of this school.

College Sophomore,5,Great housing! The residence halls are near each other and not too far from classes and other places on campus. I greatly recommend staying on campus.

College Sophomore,5,This is an amazing school. I am so thankful that I chose to go here. It is a beautiful school with professors that truly care. There is an inviting and friendly atmosphere everywhere on campus. The location is great and exciting. Please take this school into consideration. I would recommend it to anyone.
College Freshman,5,Coaches put a lot of work towards their athletes which it shown throughout their performance. the team is supported strongly by the school. Almost the entire school goes out to support their team at games and travels around with them. athletic facilites are up to date and are suitable for all athletes and students.
College Freshman,5,This school is very open to all students and allows them to be a part of school. Professors strive to help out their students and go beyond the classroom to reach out to their students. staff and students are all friendly allowing students to grow strong relationships with anyone they run into.
Alum,4,"During COVID-19 in Spring of 2020, Bellarmine was one of the first universities to move online. Although I was frustrated by this as it was my Senior year, my professors worked to ensure that the quality of our classes did not decrease. I remained challenged, passionate and engaged. Professors were more lenient than normal to adjust for COVID19, but they still successfully completed their jobs."
Freshman,4,"During these uncertain times and being a rising freshman, I so far don't have any online learning experience at Bellarmine University. They have really great summer classes deals however I'm not interested as of right now."
Freshman,4,"Since I'm a rising freshman, I really liked how they can adjust some ways to stay connected during these difficult times. The virtual student orientation was awesome and a great experience."
Alum,4,"During COVID-19 Bellarmine was one of the first schools in Kentucky to switch to online classes. As the teachers are already phenomenal, they made the switch to online classes pretty much flawlessly. They were flexible with students who had internet problems and tried to keep tabs on their students. Even the older, less technology inclined teachers found ways to keep class work engaging."
Graduate Student,4,Bellarmine offers such a well-rounded education with many different degree options. I am forever grateful for my experience here.
Junior,4,Bellarmine is a great school for academics. With small class sizes professors get to know each student individually and want to see them succeed.

Junior,4,The campus is lovely and the people here all want to help you succeed and to see you reach your goals. The institution could be more diverse and less conservative in its ways of operations.
Junior,4,The faculty at Bellarmine are approachable and almost always willing and ready to help their students. They present challenges that they know you and your fellow students can achieve through hard work.
Junior,4,I am a junior in the nursing program at Bellarmine University. I have felt truly cared fro by the instructors and professors at this school. The class sizes are small. Instructors have the opportunity to learn students name and students have the chance to build relationships with their professors because of the small class sizes. The university cares about students mental and physical well-being and promote self care in many ways. The reputation Bellarmine has in Kentucky and Indiana make me proud to attend here. My experience has made me very grateful that I chose this school.
Sophomore,4,The campus itself is very nice and feels very safe at all times. The class sizes are small enough that I feel like I can ask the professor for the extra help I could need. Most of the professors are very good at teaching. The dorms are decent and everyone on campus is always very friendly.
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a sophomore at Bellarmine in the Education program, and I feel like I made the right decision in choosing my college. Bellarmine is a smaller school, so students and professors share more of an opportunity to share a connection which would not be present otherwise. The only issue I have is that, as a commuter, there isn't a lot of commuter engagement - most activities are late and hard for commuters like myself to attend."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous. Everyone is nice, and there is so much to learn from the professors. That being said, I wish that some departments are larger than what they are. If you are looking for a place to find who you are, to find what you are passionate for, Bellarmine is the place to be. It’s a small school so you really get to know your professors. There’s also a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus."
Sophomore,4,I love thw campus and the small class sizes. But i would like it if they improved the available food on campus.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is amazing. Bellarmine has very small class sizes and it is great to know that all your professors care about you. Only thing I would change would be price of tuition, it is so expensive."
Junior,4,"Bellarmine University is a very good school. Academically your are guaranteed a good education, socially it can be better."
Sophomore,4,Bellarmine is great university. My freshmen year was a blast. Their main goal is to see you grow not only in academics but into a young adult. They challenge you but have many ways to assist and go out of their way through freshmen programs such as Pioneer Scholars to help make the transition from high school easier. It was the best choice I could have made for college.
Freshman,4,I have not yet started bellarmine but I am very excited to! They are very welcoming and I can’t wait to start in the fall!
Freshman,4,"My time at Bellarmine University has been everything I wanted for my college experience and more! The professors and staff are welcoming and personable. The class sizes are similar to that of a high school to give a more personal education. There are a variety of resources on campus, too, to aid in almost everything one may need. The only recommendation is to expand the diversity on campus, and the acceptance of it."
Senior,4,"Bellarmine offers a liberal arts education, which is unique just like many other aspects of the college. For example, the school hosts many activities such as Easter Egg hunts, student concerts, late night bingo, roller skating, hot air balloon ride, concert each year with prominent artists, and free food. It is easy to have a diverse experience at the school with the interdisciplinary liberal arts classes and wide range of activities on campus."
Junior,4,"Bellarmine University places emphasis on finding your ""true self"". Students always remember the phrase ""be you at BU""!"
Junior,4,Being a student here at Bellarmine University has definitely prepared me for working in the real world. I feel that I have been able to grow so much after being at Bellarmine for three years so far. Bellarmine has taught me to grow in leadership and has brought me 'out of my shell' and I have learned to become more independent.
Freshman,4,I love the community feeling at Bellarmine and how noce everything is but it’s weekend life is dead. More events that are on weekdays when most people are busy could be on the weekends.
Freshman,4,I really love Bellarmine. The classes and professors are great and the community is very inclusive and awesome.
Niche User,4,"Bellarmine is a great school that responds quickly, has great financial aid and an excellent physical therapy program."
Senior,4,"VERY EXPENSIVE BUT AMONG THE TOP IN THE REGION. PROFESSORS ARE GREAT, THERE ARE RESOURCES SUCH AS COUNSELING AND TUTORING AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS. FOOD IS OKAY BUT CAN ADD UP QUICKLY IF YOU EAT IT EVERYDAY."
Junior,4,I like that the professors are willing to work with you and many of them seem to care about your success. Many of the other students are very friendly.
College Freshman,4,You're almost garunteed a job in your field when you graduate.
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are great. Almost 12:1 usually except in Gen Ed classes where there may be a maximum of 30 students in the class. There are a variety of courses offered, even an IDC course on fandoms (which I hear is extremely difficult). Professors care and are easy to approach."
College Freshman,4,They make us take classes on sexual assault and alcohol and they also made it a part of our orientation experience. Sexual assault is no joke on campus and is not tolerated at all by anyone.
College Freshman,4,They provide you with a fridge and a microwave and the rooms are relatively spacious. They smell weird at first but they are clean and they have carpet. I'm in Kennedy and we have air conditioners and heaters we can adjust ourselves to make our room the perfect temperature for us. Provided a desk and a chair and a bed and a closet with 2 drawers. Communal bathroom with clean showers and working facilities.
College Freshman,4,They have a workout area for athletes and non-athletes that is easy to access and free to use. The equipment is up to date and there's a lot of it. Personal trainers are offered as well to teach you how to use all of the different machines. The gym is a little small but Bellarmine is a D2 school so that is to be expected.
College Freshman,4,"I would love to attend Bellarmine University all four years of my college experience but family circumstances are forcing me to transfer schools because it's so far away. The college is really friendly, really diverse, and extremely challenging. Class sizes are small and professors are good for the most part. There are no decent history professors though which create a struggle in General History."
College Sophomore,4,"In the area especially, a degree here in certain areas can mean that you are hired for your career before you even graduate. I like that, and additionally, internships are very easy to acquire."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms here are of a much higher quality than many of the other colleges I toured during my decision making process. The hallways resemble that of a hotel and the rooms are very nice. The buildings are mostly new, with just a couple dorms being older. The only downside is that there isn't enough on campus housing for all that want it."
College Sophomore,4,The student section at basketball games is always very supportive of the team. The school spirit is definitely impressive and I love it.
College Sophomore,4,"Ball on the Belle is definitely a unique experience. It's a Halloween dance where Bellarmine rents out the Belle of Louisville, and old steam boat, and students dance and listen to music while it goes down the river and then returns. It has been my absolute favorite experience."
College Freshman,4,"Job internships are a required part of many fields at this school. The career services appear to be very helpful with helping students find internships and job opportunities, so I have no doubt that I will be able to find one."
College Freshman,4,"Being a resident on campus is great. It offers an excellent opportunity for a closer knit school with plenty of chances to make new connections. It offers many good quality amenities, including free laundry which is a very nice perk."
College Freshman,4,"Students are very involved in athletics, and everyone has an opportunity to participate in some fashion. The athletic facilites are of good quality to both athletes and non-athletes."
College Freshman,4,My favorite experiences thus far have been freshman oriented events to help incoming students solidify our choice to attend. The events allowed us to connect to other freshman and returning students and get a taste of life at Bellarmine.
College Junior,4,"Most of the professors are very invested in their students. Most are very organized and helpful. They are always eager to help students if they are struggling, or need advice. There are an abundance of courses to choose from, and most all of them have class sizes less than 30. Professors know you by name, and build personal relationships with you. There is a family atmosphere about the school."
College Sophomore,4,A degree from this University is one with lots of value due to its prestige and academic performance that it demands of its students.
College Sophomore,4,"Although I do not live in the dorms I have been in them and they seem pretty good for college students and they provide an atmosphere of studying, which is vital to obtaining good grades."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics at my school is pretty good they hold many events in our school campus which ultimately lead to some student involvement. But although athletics is present on our campus it is not one of where everything revolves around it.
College Sophomore,4,"I without a doubt would choose my school all over again if I had the opportunity. I believe that through the challenges that this school has put me through has grown me both spiritually and mentally. The school's atmosphere is one like no other, being both friendly and outgoing while also being one of strict academic performance. Although every day is a challenge there always seems to be an activity or two to help you relax just a bit. For example one of my favorite memories was when I and a few friends signed up for a mud volleyball tournament and got all muddy as we played. Although we lost in the first round it was a very fun and memorable experience. One that alike this school will never forget and without a thought would choose again."
College Freshman,4,Greek life brings students together to have a closer relationship with each other. They become brothers and sisters and shows them to stand for their peers. Non-Greeks believe Greeks do great things for the community and set high roles in society.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not actually in a sorority, but I can tell they are very good."
College Freshman,4,The Bellarmine Knights rule! Enough said.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't started yet, but I know I'll love college."
College Freshman,4,Professors hold high expectations for their students. The curriculum is difficult.
College Freshman,4,"I'm in a new dorm, so it's great. Everyone is close together no matter where you live on campus."
College Freshman,4,I love attending basketball games! They're very fun and a lot of students go.
College Freshman,4,I love how everyone knows everyone here. Walking around campus you always see friendly faces. The university is also well connected in the Louisville Community.
College Freshman,4,"After graduating, there is an extremely good chance that I will find a job/career in the major I graduated with. Most upper classman are able to get an internship for a year or two and that helps with their resume for future job opportunities. The career center on campus is the perfect place to go to start looking for a job or internship. They help us create resumes and even provide mock interviews if needed. There really isn't anything that they can not do to help us."
College Freshman,4,"I only know of a couple of Greek life organizations only because I have friends who are a part of them. From what I have heard and seen, the Greek life organizations are supportive of their community. They have fundraisers to raise money certain organizations. I'm not quite sure what organizations but I do know they donate the money they raise."
College Freshman,4,Athletics are a big part of this campus. There's at least one athlete in every class that I am in not including myself. Basketball has been our most successful program here in the past years. Every home game has a full house. It's great to see the student body out supporting our sports. Even though we're a Division 2 school we have a lot of support from our community. The athletes are also extremely friendly and kind. We all get along with each other just fine.
College Freshman,4,"My current school Bellarmine University, is a very small and friendly campus located in Louisville, Arizona. Everyone here is friendly and open to meeting new people. It is a very challenging school academically and it's definitely worth my money. Being a part of the Men's Soccer Team here has also been such a great experience. I've enjoyed every moment of it. My teammates are also the best to none. We all get along so nicely and we are always there for one another. It's like being a part of a family away from my actual family back home in Phoenix, Arizona."
College Freshman,4,Security is always available and willing to help the students. There are also plenty emergency alarms spread through out campus in case someone needs help.
College Freshman,4,There is only a small bit of Greek life on campus. I have some friends apart of the Greek life and they always seem to have a good time and enjoy having a group of friends they can rely on.
Freshman,2,"Professors do not care. One of the main reason I chose to go to Bellarmine was that they had professors who cared about you. If you have a learning disability, it becomes a major issue for professors who do not want to let you have accommodations."
Junior,2,"I did not enjoy my experience at BU. I was not fond the over-exaggeration of the quality of its education and facilities. I was picked on by my peers because I was different and wasn't afraid to ask questions when necessary. The professor turned a blind eye many times. The professor wanted to protect their reputation at the cost of integrity. There is also a lack of privacy security. There were multiple instances where students would share information about other students as student workers. 
I've had peers who tried to transfer out but many of BU's credits are not recognized at other universities. They're finally having better experiences elsewhere."
Freshman,2,wayyyy to small and I am transferring from Bellarmine after the end of my Freshman year. I liked some parts but others were not so good. Everything is small community and family feel which is nice but then it has its downsides as well. All my classes were tiny and I did not like that one bit!
College Sophomore,2,We don't have an abundance of fraternities or sororities and they don't have their own houses like typical film ones. They just live on or off campus in normal situations and they're often organizations based around studying or community service.
Recent Alumnus,2,I hardly hear about the teams success; seems hard to come by
College Freshman,2,There is only one sorority and one fraternity. There is not much of a Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,2,"There is only one sorority on campus, it isn't all that great either."
College Freshman,2,"I do not like the dorms. There is no enforcement to quite hours. The dorm rooms in Kennedy are small. The heating is hardly turned on. There is hardly any lighting. The community bathrooms are okay, but people are gross. Some like to gather into the hallways and talk as loud as possible, which can be disturbing for mostly everyone. It is not worth the cost. There are newer and better dorms, but i do not live there. It is very convenient to live on campus. The furthest you would have to walk to class is about 10 minutes."
College Freshman,2,"There is no greek life. We have one frat, one sorority and one mixture. Greek life does nothing to the social atmosphere of campus life. Nobody really cares about the Greek life and no special housing for those in Greek life."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is not very encouraged here. You have to write an appeal just to live off campus, if they even allow it. There aren't very many university apartments near the school. Off campus housing is easier to find near the University of Louisville, which is located 20 minutes away."
College Freshman,2,There are only 2 sororities on campus and one co-ed fraternity.
College Freshman,2,"Lots and lots of pot smokers, but I guess that's all colleges?"
College Freshman,2,"When it snows, the whole world stops and everything is closed except dining and the workout facility."
College Freshman,2,There is only one sorority and one fraternity. There is also a coed fraternity for business related majors. They don't do much and are not very present on campus. I really wish there were more sororities and fraternities.
College Junior,2,There is only one fraternity and one sorority. Greek life is not big at Bellarmine.
College Junior,2,Pros and cons of this small school
College Junior,2,Drugs and alcohol are common
College Junior,2,Campus housing is great for the first few years
College Junior,2,the RAs are way too strict 
College Junior,2,Lots of computers but the connection is weak
College Junior,2,Campus shuttle is usually a convenience 
College Junior,2,Weather is usually pretty mild and nice
College Junior,2,got a fairly good academic scholarship
College Junior,2,wealthy school with nice guys and nice girls
College Sophomore,2,"Bellarmine is in a residential area, so good luck finding a cheap apartment that's still available. Your best bet is to stay on campus. Annie Hall and the Siennas' are great."
College Sophomore,2,"The Dining Hall is hit or miss, and the Palio (the cafeteria closest to the dorms) is infamous. Catie's Cafe has earned the name Inconvenience Cafe for it's very unusual hours, and Cafe Ogle has good food, but much less variety. All in all, not very great."
College Junior,2,"The computers at Bellarmine are not as reliable as they should be. Problems arise with wireless connections to student laptops, public computers are not up to date, and printers are constantly breaking."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is never a fun task. So if you want to ensure you have a parking spot choose early classes such as 8am to get good parking.
College Freshman,2,"Bellarmine sports are supposed to be very good and popular, however, no one hears about them on campus. There are no signs or banners that state when games are or to get people excited for varsity sports."
College Junior,2,"If you go to the library during ""free period"" on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it is almost impossible to find an open computer. If you try to get on the internet anywhere besides the library, the internet is very slow."
College Junior,2,Bellarmine only has one Fraternity (for girls) and it seems very exclusive. There is no real Greek life at Bellarmine.
College Junior,2,"I feel like our campus security is just average. I feel like they focus more on giving parking tickets than protecting the students' safety. Although, I have never felt unsafe on campus. I do not frequently see the security personnel around campus except when I walk past the office or when they are driving around in their cars. I would like to see them out and interacting with the students and therefore building a better foundation of trust."
College Senior,2,"Lots of Annoyances – When I lived in Kennedy as a freshman, I hated every minute of it. The bathrooms were constantly disgusting. The showers were the same. The dorm smelled weird as well. The common area had really old furniture which I never wanted to sit on because it looked full of germs. Petrik is a little better because of the space. It's like an apartment and I liked that we had our own bathrooms. Socially Petrik is a mess. The new Sienas are not as functional as they are pretty. The second floor of Terzo smelled all the time. Also the large waterfall makes a sound that shows that it is highly unnatural. The whole sienas look a lot better than they actually are."
College Sophomore,2,"Eh... Yeah. Honestly, for a commuter, parking isn't all THAT bad. At least, after you become a sophomore. Freshmen get the short end of the stick either way, but from the freshmen lots it's about a 10 minute walk to most of your classes. However, for residents, parking is awful. It's a haul from the freshmen lots to any of the residence halls, and don't expect to find parking near the residence halls when you're a sophomore, or even on weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Really there isn't too much parties because we are in the Highlands and they always get busted. However, spending time on Bradstown road is fun. Other then that you kind of have to make your own fun if you dont have a car."
College Sophomore,2,Wasting My Printing Money – The computer's at Bellarmine are usually occupied. If you need a computer at certain times of the day then you can take a chance that you won't be able to get one. The printers are also frustrating. Every time you go to print you can guarantee that the printer is messed up by a paper jam. If there is a paper jam then there probably won't be any paper available to print your documents on. It is a waste of print money.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Allowed – According to campus rules, drugs and alcohol are not allowed on campus, but most people I know go out & drink anyway."
Recent Alumnus,2,The Rent Is Too Dang High! Houses and apartments close to the university are very expensive to rent - one house I looked at was over $900 a month! I have been unable to get any sort of housing/rent assistance from the university.
College Sophomore,2,"The fact that they give us access to printers is great. However, the printers often run out of ink and are almost always out of paper."
College Freshman,2,BU contains mostly white students but there are a few students from other states/countries that are here for sports. But most students are from private catholic high schools from the Louisville area.
College Freshman,1,Not many parties are located around Bellarmine. More parties can be found around the University of Louisville. Most parties get busted around Bellarmine because the school is literally located in the middle of a neighborhood.
College Freshman,1,"They don't do step shows, they are very low key and boring."
College Freshman,1,"The Party scene at Bellarmine sucks! The last Bellarmine party I went to, I got pushed, vodka was spilled on me, some girl kicked me, and drunk people are just falling all over each other and other people that are trying to have a good time and just dance. I think the only purpose of Bellarmine parties are to ""turn up"" and get as drunk as possible, it's stupid."
College Freshman,1,"Freshman have to park super far away, but everyone else can park anywhere they want. Parking spots fill up extremely fast, so if you are a commuter you are screwed."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life here is a joke. Sports teams here throw all of the good parties and events. Not a true for Greek life, sorry ladies and gentlemen."
College Junior,1,1 sorority and 1 fraternity 
College Freshman,1,There is no night life at Bellarmine. Most students have friends at UOfL and that is where they go to party.
College Freshman,1,You're not allowed off campus until you're a senior unless you live with your parents. It's also really difficult to get exemptions so that you can leave earlier than senior year which can be annoying if that's what you want to do.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life at Bellarmine is almost non-existent. There is one sorority and one fraternity on campus, plus  a fraternity for students in the school of business. The sorority is Phi MU and the frat is ADG. The greeks have some parties but they are definitely not the only source of a social life on campus. Greek housing includes a floor of one of the upperclassman buildings for Phi Mu, but I am not sure about ADG's housing situation."
College Junior,1,"May God be with you.  If you don't arrive on campus really early or really late in the day, you're going to have to walk from Siberia.  Granted, the longest walk may only be 10 minutes, but on a campus our size, that's quite the trek."
College Sophomore,1,I was offended. When I checked for any more available aid I was told they could help me if my dad died. Then they threatened to remove my institutional scholarship when a professor tried to give me a departmental scholarship. I love my degree field but at this rate they seem to be doing everything they can to ensure that I won't be able to afford finishing my degree.
College Junior,1,"Depends on the Day! Parking on campus can be a nightmare. You'll always be able to find a space, but searching for the closest one is what takes awhile. If I know I have a class at the same time as many others, I tend to assume there are no open spaces and automatically go to the freshman parking lot and find a spot easily. It's just a farther walk by about 5 minutes."
College Senior,1,As far as greek life goes there is one group for females and one group for males.  Unless you're involved in them you don't really hear about them on campus.  So it's pretty low key
College Sophomore,1,"The women at bellarmine are rather sub-par. It is pretty difficult to find a girl for a relationship and casually hooking up with on the weekend because the nightlife is just bad. Sophomore year you live in co-ed dorms which sounds great at first, but it disappoints. Some of the girls often are boring and overkill the phrase ""i love you."" Overall if one wants to find a nice girl to find a relationship with socially or in a serious nature go to U of L or elsewhere. "
College Sophomore,1,Food Is Horrible – food at bellarmine is just horrible.. places such as the palio are way too overpriced and unhealthy.. it gets so bad that the soap in the dorm bathrooms looks tasty.. i often go to local restaurants and grocery stores to help me remember what normal food tastes like
College Sophomore,1,"Where's the Party at? The night life at Bellarmine is not the best. There are not very many options, especially if you are not out with a large group of friends."
College Sophomore,1,"there is no nightlife. people at bellarmine don't know what that is. oh, and don't plan on drinking anywhere on campus even if you're 21. bellarmine loves money so they write people up with alcohol and charge them $60."
College Sophomore,1,"Weigh Your Options – i advise you to look somewhere else. it's a giant scam. you don't get what you pay for, and having no greek life might not sound like a big deal to some people, but that's a huge drawback. bellarmine has literally let me down in almost every way. i'm just glad for the few normal people i have met here so i'm not the only one going through hell here."
College Sophomore,1,The parking is very limited. There are not a lot of options to park close to the dorms. It takes a long time to look for a parking spot relatively close to the dorms.
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately, if you don't have a car on campus, you can't even go grocery shopping. There is a small bus that only drives around campus, but we definitely need something for students without a car on campus."

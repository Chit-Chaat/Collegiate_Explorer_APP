Sophomore,5,I like the number of options LaRoche offers. There are a wide variety of majors and minors. Small class sizes allow for more student-professor interactions and I feel supported throughout each semester.
Sophomore,5,My experience for my freshman year was rough but I made it through. There are people there to help. Some of the departments are excellent for what they do.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy LA Roche University. I am about to start my spring of 2020 semester. I started in the fall of 2019. I am majoring in Information technology. I like the setting of the college. It is a friendly and helping school. Everyone is so friendly. I like how the dorms are set up. There is nothing I would change about the college.
Works Here,5,I liked everything about la roche from academics to sports to professors and dorms. There socccer coaches were super nice and supportive throughout the rest of my high school career by coming to my games and everything. i also talked to the education director shes very nice and thinks ill do great. the study abroad experience at la roche is amazing is well and i cant wait to be able to experience that by going into classes in different countries.
Freshman,5,I’m a freshman at La Roche and also an International Student. The school does give help to every and each student on there campus and care to hear what everyone has to say.
Sophomore,5,So far La Roche has been a great school for me . It is a small school with great academics. Professors are friendly and professional & they care a lot of their students future .
Sophomore,5,I like that La Roche is smaller than other Universities and you won’t feel cramped up.  The people their are amazing and great to work with.
Sophomore,5,I have recently returned to La Roche after nearly 20 years! My dream is to finally complete my bachelors degree and become a deacon. The staff at La Roche have been extraordinary in their efforts to ease my return and help me complete my studies. The campus is beautiful and faculty very caring - always willing to lend guidance and support.
Freshman,5,"I am a new student.  Everyone is very helpful.  My professor's are attentive and supportive. I like the setting of a small college, but close to the city.  Everyone is very friendly.  It is the right fit for me."
Junior,5,I love La Roche. The administration genuinely cares about all of their students and put in tremendous effort to make sure all of the students have a safe and comfortable learning environment
Niche User,5,It is a small school that focuses on the students. The location and price is also reasonable. It is a great school to go to.
Sophomore,5,Its a Great College. You can see people from all different nations. It has great programmes and various clubs u can take part in.
Junior,5,LaRoche College is a great place to study if you want to get individual attention and excel without distractions. The teachers often go out of their way to help students that are struggling. Also the environment is so friendly. Everyone is friends with everyone mostly.
Junior,5,"La Roche may seem like a tiny dot on a map to some, but La Roche college has so many things to offer to students and I am proud to be a part of it! The school has many clubs for students to join which range from doing many different things. One great thing that La Roche offers to students which other schools don't is the chance to study abroad. What is special about the study abroad opportunities at La Roche doesn't have you pay extra money for the trip. When paying for tuition, study abroad is included in that which makes it impossible to pass up!"
Niche User,5,Small campus.  Close to home.  Caring Catholic environment. Opportunity to travel abroad included in tuition.  Opportunities for internships in the city. Goo location.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the small campus and small class rooms which makes it easier for me to learn. Everyone is very friendly and easy to get along with. The dorms are large as far as colleges go which makes for a comfortable living experience.
Freshman,5,"I had a very positive experience. Very diverse campus, everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Teachers are also very helpful."
Freshman,5,"Very inviting all the time, everyone here, staff and students are very welcoming and accommodating. Overall, a very good education so far!"
Freshman,5,"La Roche College is a wonderful school for those looking to learn in a small community with people from all around the world. Our goal is to be the best for the world, and that is something that inspires me to continue doing well at La Roche. When I graduate, I will be someone who helps the world with my degree. I was very nervous to start college, as most people are. I'm a commuter and was very afraid that I wouldn't make friends. The wide range of commuters and residents is wonderful, I don't feel alone because almost half of the campus commutes too! I have loved my experience at La Roche so far and I can't wait for the next three years!"
Niche User,5,"I have found La Roche to be very adult friendly.  As a nontraditional student returning to complete a degree, the experience has been first rate.  No recommended areas for improvement."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small size of the classrooms; it really gives the students an opportunity to form relationships with their professors. I also like how inclusive La Roche is. They welcome any and all students, and are willing to accommodate any limitations or requirements you might have. I'm a transfer student, and it was incredibly easy to transfer here from a community college. They took all my credits, and helped me get acclimated every step of the way. "
College Freshman,5,"Especially for a Catholic we take alcohol  and sexual assaults to a great deal. We even have party about sexual assaults,  we're we learn about alcohol and assaults then eat pizza and get to know everyone in the room."
College Freshman,5,Life on campus  is really good. I am home right now and I missed my room back on campus already. The campus can get pretty quiet during the weekends but overall it is great.
College Junior,5,the  small class room settings and the individual attention is awesome for those like me with a learning disability . I have ADHD
College Freshman,5,Applying early for scholarships and financial aid was the best decision I made.
College Freshman,5,There is so much to see and do and has plenty of job opportunities
College Freshman,5,There are tons of restaurants and places to eat off of campus. They are very close but however not everything is in walking distance.
College Freshman,5,"I am a graphic design major, and I love it. The work load is on the heavy side but the staff and facility that is here on campus is fantastic. I love my professors and classes, and also get along with all the other freshman designers. It is a wonderful place to learn the ropes and be pushed to succeed in the field with gaining professional experience throughout all four years."
College Freshman,5,I love this campus! It is close to but still far enough from the city for me. The food and library could use some more variety but that is just small compared to how much I enjoy my classes professors for english and graphic design.
College Freshman,5,"I am in one of the biggest programs in La Roche. The graphic design program is awesome. Everyone is fantastic and friendly, staff and students alike."
College Freshman,5,I'm bias. I love Pittsburgh. It's one of my favorite cities I've visited.
College Freshman,5,"It's very diverse, which is great to me. Not recommended for someone who is, sadly, racist."
College Freshman,5,I love Pittsburgh for entertainment and food. It is a big melting pot of different ethnic groups.
College Senior,5,"I havce learned a LOT of personal and life lessons that will stay with me throughout my existence. La Roche allowed me to travel, meet new people, and understand new cultures. Time of my life!"
College Senior,5,"The teachers at this school are there to help you succeed and want the best for you at all times. They will stay late or come in early to ensure that your time as a student here is as carefree as possible, but they do not do it for you. You still must put in the time and effort to really excel."
College Senior,5,Very safe and home-like feel to the campus. Very small and everything is within walking difference!
College Senior,5,"The campus is located in a very nice area where it is very safe, the local community loves us, and there is a lot to do once you open up your eyes and start exploring a bit. From North Park to Ross Park Mall there are tons of shops and places to go, with the surrounding area slowly but steadily growing and allowing more for the students to choose from as far as dining, shopping and leisure activities."
College Junior,5,"I don't really follow the sport activities that take place at La Roche College. I see basketball players and baseball players who sometimes wear their jerseys with dirt stains on them or clean. But, I don't hear a lot of talk about on-campus sports."
College Freshman,5,"This school gives a good load of money for financial aid. Of course enough is never enough with any school, but the money La Roche gives really helped me out. That was the only reason I attend this school in the first place."
College Student,5,"I am a Psychology major, and it has been a very enjoyable experience so far.  The workload is bearable, and the subject matter is very interesting.  There are so many different classes you can take in Psychology, and they are very cool to learn.  The professors are excellent and know their stuff."
Junior,4,"I recently transferred to La Roche University to pursue my education in Radiology. It has been a very smooth and easy process. My advisor has been in contact with me when my transcripts have arrived and when I could schedule my classes. With the results of COVID-19, they have offered summer courses online and discount tuition. They truly care about their students and their families."
Alum,4,"I loved the professors here, they really cared about your success! Sometimes it was difficult to get financial answers or answers from a few professors."
Junior,4,"La Roche College, with it's small student body and campus, feels close to home. Its size allows it to not appear overwhelming, and the colleges focus on service and spiritual learning helps improve its students worldview and critical thinking."
Sophomore,4,"At first, I was very unsure of whether I would be happy at La Roche or not. All of my friends at the time were applying and going into bigger schools so I felt like I was not achieving enough. However, when I got to La Roche, I knew it would be home.  Even though the school is on the smaller side, I enjoy the smaller classes and how the professor gives one on one attention to each student. Also, the campus feels very safe compared to a big city campus and even if I have later classes I know I will be safe walking. La Roche also has so many different opportunities available such as the travel abroad program which is amazing. You are allowed to study abroad at virtually no cost since everything is included in you tuition!"
Senior,4,"Very small school with ability to fit in. If you want to go to a college that is very similar to high school, then this is the right place for you. The campus is about a half mile long and wide, that is surrounded by plenty of places to go and enjoy yourself."
Sophomore,4,The only reason La Roche gets a 4 star is because they dont have that many activities during the weekends.
Freshman,4,"In my experience, La Roche has been a wonderful fit for my lifestyle. The small campus is easily navigated and has a quiet nature. It is very peaceful and there is always something to do. The dorms are very good sized and the professors will do anything to help you. Being right across from McCandless Crossings, there is a number of shops, restaurants and even a movie theatre for students to easily access."
Freshman,4,"Professors are very attentive and helpful when it comes to the students academics. This school helps a lot with staying spiritually calm, which helps the average student succeed in the long run."
Sophomore,4,I like all the fun activities for the students to do on their free time or to get a break from school work. I also enjoy the free counseling.
Sophomore,4,"It is a very small college with nice athmosphere. There are a lof international students, which makes the experience even better. Most of the professors are interesting and helpful. Unfortunately scholarships are low."
Freshman,4,Just like every other school some eexperoences are good and some are bad. Just depends on how you work to improve!
Sophomore,4,"La Roche College is a wonderfully diverse school of both academics and nationalities. Here I've been introduced to so many new people and topics of discussion that I might not have been at another institution. There is also the matter of how its not just a school, its a family. All the professors know you by name, they know where you are from and they know when you have your ups and downs. They always make the greatest effort to see you succeed academically and mentally."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is extremely polite there. The professors all know you by name and the education is very personal. The sports teams are always fun to go and watch when you're looking for something to do.  The food is pretty good there. The campus is very small, which is good if you don't want to feel overwhelmed."
Freshman,4,"I love how diverse the college is and the amount of students the college has, but some changes that should be made is the food."
College Freshman,4,Most class sizes are small since it is a realitivly small college. I enjoy all the courses that I am in and hope to do big things because of the help of my professors.
College Freshman,4,When at school and walking the campus I feel very secure and safe. All rules that the school has a greatly enforced and it makes it more comfortable.
College Freshman,4,The living halls are great! They are a little out dated but spacious and clean!
College Freshman,4,La Roche is a great college. All of the students that attend are diverse and unique. Many students are international so it's great to get to know and learn about their cultures.
College Junior,4,"Overall, this place is a pretty decent school. It's small, has had funding problems over it's only 53 years of service, but it is a decent school. It is best known for it's Nursing and Graphics programs. I am a science major and must say that our building is extremely neglected. The building facilities are terrible, the set up of classrooms are not efficient and no longer accommodate the influx of students the past few years. We must rely on the graciousness of local chemical plants and labs to donate their old equipment to us. Our professors in the science department are fantastic though; each one of them makes due with what we have and they all have very interesting courses and lab materials. In regards to my time with criminal justice, English and art classes, the school is also very wonderful in those departments as well. Class sizes, classes offered and how they are taught have all been fantastic. Not the best, but considering this place's history , I'm happy with my experience thus far."
College Junior,4,"As a Forensic Biology & Chemistry major, I frequently question ""why"" I picked this school, but the place is growing on me. It's hard to, at first, get used to HOW diverse the school is and the very small class sizes (classes are as large or smaller than my own high school's). I came to really appreciate the class sizes though and it's nice that my teachers know me very well on a more personal level. I feel I am able to ask more questions and get more individualized help if needed. With the diversity, it was a bit awkward and uneasy when dealing with SO many international students, but as I've gone through more courses and worked at various places on campus, I've run into many wonderful kids and adults from all over the planet. Overall, this place isn't all that bad."
College Freshman,4,"At La Roche College, there is so much to do whether it is on what classes you can do, what activities you can do, and everyone is very friendly"
College Freshman,4,Public safety is constantly driving around campus at all hours of the day and night and there is always somebody sitting in the public safety office. They are also always available by call and they constantly walk around the dorm buildings.
College Freshman,4,All of my professors are interested in their courses they teach and the class sizes are small enough that they know their students buy name.
College Freshman,4,This college is all about getting an education and preparing students for the real world and getting a career.
College Freshman,4,Most of the on campus facilities and dorms are newly renovated and in good condition.
College Freshman,4,I play on the women's soccer team and the experience has been great. The facilities are all new and the school supports us as players and as a team.
College Freshman,4,"I come from a small high school where everybody knows everybody and I attend a smaller college now as well, so the transition was very smooth. I also like how the class sizes are small and the teachers know the students by name."
College Freshman,4,As a college freshman my school actually made an effort to teach me about all the different resources on campus. Which I found very good indeed.
College Freshman,4,"Its a very small, but God school. The people are friendly and considerate, the teachers are nice and friendly for most part."
College Freshman,4,Life on campus is great despite the possible outburst with a roommate now and again. I like to live on campus because i can more easily focus on my homework and do not have to worry about bad weather. Also i feel i get the college experience and have made more friendships due to living on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I love the food here, except Redhawk runs out extremely fast and sometimes the workers steal your money out of your account to feed themselves."
College Freshman,4,don't really eat off campus
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,We have bran new athletic fields and facilities for our sports teams. We are huge on team spirit and have successful teams.
College Freshman,4,"I have had a great time here, and most of my favorite experiences have happened in the class room where I have had a ""lightbulb, I got it!"" moments with the friends Ive come to know and love in the same major as me."
College Freshman,4,I do plan to have one because I believe that it will shine some more light on what i want to do with the rest of my life. There doesn't seem to be many problems with students and finding internships.
College Freshman,4,I have had very few problems with anything coarse or professors wise.
College Freshman,4,I received a great scholarship though getting the state aid in the office taken care of was a hassle.
College Freshman,4,"I love most of my classes. I get my major courses first, but i always get my homework done."
College Freshman,4,I haven't used but by what i have heard it is a nice service.
College Freshman,4,No where is perfect but its pretty nice.
College Junior,4,I am not really set to one side of things. I do not base my life around others lifestyle.
College Senior,4,The campus isn't too bad and the RA's on campus are usually pretty reasonable and willing to help others.
College Senior,4,"For students who want to get in or stay in shape the workout facilities are good, and there is also a LA Fitness and Fitness 19 not oo far from campus for those looking for more convenient times to workout."
College Senior,4,"From Chipotle to Bravo!, there are many options to choose from. The list of places ranges from Olive Garden, Subway, Dibellas, IHOP, Denny's, Eat n' Park, Aladdin's Eatery, Starbucks, BRGR, Chick-fil-A, Sarku Japan, Burgatory, Winghart's, Fox and Hound, North Park Lounge and Panera Bread just to name a few!"
College Senior,4,The computers are very fast and readily available. Changes will also be made if students need to use them early or security is always available to come and unlock classrooms with computer for students to use.
College Senior,4,"The rating I gave is for someone who has a group of friends and that are over the age of 21 so that you can experience Southside, the Strip District, and other local bars like Fox and Hound and North Park lounge. A much lower rating would be given for those who are  a lot younger in which you may have to make your own fun."
College Junior,4,"La Roche College is a very diverse school. International students attend this college and people of various races and ethnicity. Most of the international students are Middle Eastern; but there are Asians, Africans, and I know a Russian."
College Junior,4,"La Roche College is a small school. Thus, the teacher-student ratio is small as well. This ratio smallness, I believe, personalizes the relationship between professors and students, in which respect and a greater awareness of students' needs evolve."
College Junior,4,"Nearly every day as I left my residence hall, I turned to the left where the sun rose, cars chugged, buildings blossomed and trees swayed. I saw a beautiful life before me. The scenery I saw inspired hope, encouragement, peace, and love."
College Freshman,4,"You truly will receive a proper education here. Just like any other college, you have to put in the work to get the results. Only at this school, you can miss fours classes almost every week and still pull off a B if your lucky. It's so high school here. Perfect analogy for La Roche College!! If you ever took AP or honor classes in high school, thats the exact course work you will be doing here."
College Freshman,4,"Before deciding on coming to La Roche, you must first understand that this is a very small school. Because this school is so small it doesn't offer every perfect academic quality like most schools do. There are a lot of majors that La Roche offers, but because most people that attend La Roche have narrow minds, they pick among the most common major like Biology for an example. I had my first biology class as a freshman, there had to be over 75 students. The next day 1/3 of those students left and probably became undeclared. The 2/3 that was left (including myself) stayed and finished General Bio 1. When it came time to register for General Bio 2, there was only half of 1/3 of the original bio majored students. Most people failed out, and the one's who stayed my professor called us ""the survivors."" My point is student only pick common major to try to become the common doctor. Expect to be pushed here at La Roche, because at the end, all your professors want you to do is pass the course and don't give up."
College Sophomore,4,lots of options. im looking into it myself.
College Sophomore,4,everything is closeby and convenient.
College Sophomore,4,they are most worried about parking violations... lol
College Sophomore,4,"Living off campus in one of the houses can be better due the amount of money a dorm rom costs, A student would be saving more money living off campus and have freedom to go as he/she pleases. The housing is about five minutes away from campus so traveling wouldn't be an issue. The public transportation is about a five minute walk and the bus comes right across from the school."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the program and major I am currently taking. I enjoy the small class sizes in order to receive the individual help I need. We also have guest speakers in which speak about career options we can take after we graduate. The curriculum can be demanding sometimes, but the professors are always wiling to help."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very diverse and there are people from international countries such as Italy and Africa.
College Freshman,4,Baseball is a big part of campus life here at La Roche.
College Junior,4,"campus security always work, and security man always monitoring and working, and very safe place to live. you might never worry about the crime and safety. school also give you a flu-shot for free."
College Junior,2,"I am part of Zeta Alpha Pi, which is a science sorority. I know there is also a group for the Criminal Justice majors as well as English and Psychology. There was a National Leadership Society added just last year, but I have not seen them out and about in the community too much. This school is only 53 years old and we don't have large Greek presence at all; no houses, wacky traditions, or inductions or anything. The school is rapidly increasing it's size each academic year and is looking to expand to a University soon so I would expect to see a surge in Greek life with an influx of students."
College Freshman,2,I have to stay in dorms all four years due to my scholarship so I do not know much about the off campus housing but know it is available
College Freshman,2,They are there to unlock your door and that's it. Drunk people will be screaming and running down the halls and nothing is done and I am often kept up.
College Junior,2,"I think that the administration is solely concerned with appealing to recruits and athletes, hence the reason for a 2 million dollar field when the dorms are falling apart and are infected with mold. Sports are a little overrated here. Reminds me of high school. The school spirit is lacking."
College Sophomore,2,so old school and slow!
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of GLBTs at this school, more Saudi Arabian students, some African, some Chinese. Meet a lot of different cultures."
College Freshman,2,"If you want good food, go into the city"
College Freshman,2,They don't do much  and they take forever if you need they're help.
College Sophomore,2,no health center that i know of but have a hospital across the street if an emergency occurs. the campus security guards are a pain and make doing anything difficult
College Sophomore,2,there are a large variety of people but most are down to earth and relaxed. it is not a party school at all
College Sophomore,2,"they have a bus stop by entrance besides that, if  you do not have you own vehicle you are stuck."
College Sophomore,2,its an okay dining room they have plenty of options but the food is not the best. it will fill the void when you cant leave campus
College Sophomore,2,Great Lectures. Labs are sub-par. if you are willing to put in the work it is a decent school for science majors
College Sophomore,2,As a science major the lectures are excellent and if the rating was based off that i would give  4 or 5 stars. but La Roche's labs fall short on preparing students compared to alternative colleges in the area.
College Student,2,"There is not that many exciting activities to do at La Roche.  I am a commuter, and I have asked residents if they like the ""college life"", and they say they are very bored."
College Sophomore,2,There around if you need them. Other then that you hardly see them doing anything
College Freshman,2,Even with a permit you are not promised a spot to park. My friend went a whole year without a pass and never once got a ticket. Security gives tickets to people with passes more often than to cars without one. Very unfair.
College Freshman,2,"There is not many on campus transportation options. We have transportation for campus events such as night at the theater or Pittsburgh tours, but other than that it is your job to find transportation. Taxi's in the North Hills area are very hard to come by because we are in such a busy and are very close to the city."
College Freshman,2,You can go to clubs in Pittsburgh or to the hookah bar but besides that there are no parties and if there are they tend to get busted all the time. I wouldn't recommend it.
Recent Alumnus,2,I never had a  problem with parking. Except for getting the preferred spot. A lot of students complain especially commuters. I think there is enough space.
College Freshman,1,As La Roche being a Catholic school they only offer academic Sorioirtys and Fraternity's. I always loved the thought of being apart of Greek life but not at this school.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is not relevant on our campus.
College Freshman,1,We do not have sororities so I do not apply to do not does my campus
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car, or know someone with a car, transpiration at La Roche is horrible. I'm sorry, transportation is horrible in Pittsburgh, PERIOD. Taxis never come on time, buses are always late. The taxi services almost made me miss my greyhound bus to get back home. It was absolutely nuts."
College Freshman,1,The internet connection is horrible even in the dorms and the library is always crowed.
College Freshman,1,"Don't come here looking for somebody to date, they're only here for one nightstands."
College Sophomore,1,Not many places to use campuses computers and they all close after midnight.  internet gets funky and kicks you out at the worst times
College Sophomore,1,Not a frat school.  if you are looking for a fraternity or sorority look someplace else 
College Sophomore,1,most  sporting events go unnoticed here. but the gym is nice for personal use 
College Sophomore,1,the Merit scholarships La Roche offer is nice but any other assistance for financial aid is a mess
College Sophomore,1,Terrible food! Claim to have variety but you can't and shouldn't eat pizza everyday! Rude staff! Nothing is ever ready!
College Freshman,1,The drug scene at our school is not really present
College Freshman,1,The food sucks most days. Don't be fooled by people who tell you its amazing. I always bring my own food of eat cereal in the cafeteria. Its kind of ridiculous actually that they never have good food besides pasta. The Red Hawk Cafe is good but its never open when it should be.
College Freshman,1,There are no attractive guys on campus. If there is one its extremely rare and they probably commute or are graduating this year. It seriously sucks. No guys are even worth your time here.
Recent Alumnus,1,You could drive around for 20 minutes before you find a spot and usually once you do its either behind the gym or behind the old barn which is the furthest thing away from where classes are held.
College Freshman,1,There is no such thing if you don't have your own car...
College Freshman,1,"Hope You Like Walking 7 Miles to Your Dorm Room! You're definitely having a great day if you get a parking spot behind Bold, but most of the time you're going to have to park in the commuters lot or the lot on the side of the gym and carry your groceries all the way up 3 sets of stairs outside and then up the elevator if you can actually get on it without having to wait an hour for it to get to your floor... But on the weekends, you'll definitely get one then because everyone leaves, which is why the nightlife also sucks."
College Freshman,1,"OMG MOST TERRIBLE FOOD EVER! La Roche College cafeteria sucks!!! It seriously is bad enough that you can't even tell what a food is that it serves... Awful... At any other school, you gain the Freshman 15, but at La Roche, you will lose 15 pounds instead."
College Freshman,1,"Apartments Are Expensive – Apartments around La Roche seem either too nice and very expensive, or really crappy all together. So, either way, you're out of luck with that..."
College Sophomore,1,Food and Dining – Im not a huge fan of all the meals on campus. I think they need a little more variety on it. The redhawk only gives you a few other options as well. I think it could be a alot better.

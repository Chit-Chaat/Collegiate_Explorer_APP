Sophomore,5,"Online classes were given during quarantine and communication was easy with all professors, the classes were comfortable to continue and we were still able to complete everything that was planned for regular in person classes. Presentations and maybe a couple website crashes were common but whatever was missed could definitely be reached on the Woodbury website and it was more easier to get things done in advanced, they even provided school software and programs to continue work from home. Regular online classes ran the same and adapted to FaceTimes or Skype allâ€™s for questions."
Alum,5,"I transferred to Woodbury and attended from 2018-2020 (graduated) after attending a public university from California and studying abroad in London. After seeing other universities I can say that the quality of the education at Woodbury is incredible.

The average class size while I was at the school was around 15 people. Depending on the class it can be more or less. The smallest class I had was 6 people and the largest was 25 (for a GE). I studied Fashion Marketing and was mentored by the department chair which was an amazing experience. Since the class sizes are so small, you really do get a chance to connect with faculty. Since every program requires an internship to graduate, the school faculty is able to help a lot in finding and securing internships.

Just some highlights: I was able to help run a panel at WWD Magic (the largest fashion trade show in North America), and one of my friends was even published in a trade journal."
Alum,5,"I attended Woodbury from 2018-2020 after studying at a public university in Southern California and studying abroad in London. As someone who has attended several universities I can say that the quality of the education at Woodbury is incredible. 

Class sizes are less than 20 although most of my classes were around 12 people. As a result you are able to get to know the faculty much more closely than you would at other schools. Additionally, because the faculty knows you, they are more likely to help you when you need. 

I studied fashion marketing and was mentored by the department chair. As a result I was able to attend industry events and meet corporate teams from top companies. Also, since a lot of the professors are adjunct, they still have industry connections so guest speakers and drop-ins are common. In the same way, depending on the professor they might push your projects forward. One student in my class even got her paper published in a trade journal after some help."
Freshman,5,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, my professors at Woodbury made our transition from in-person courses to online courses very easy. Although many of the planned projects for the courses had to be altered, the changes worked very well for what I was able to access at the time. The professors also set aside their time to go through an troubles students had, for we were able to set up individual meetings."
Freshman,5,"My first year at Woodbury University went very well! 

Woodbury University has a very friendly and safe community. Everyone that attends the school is mindful and unique. No matter what, there is always a helping hand. 

Courses were excellent as well. Professors were always fast to help all individuals. Additionally, they challenged students in different ways, so we could advance our skills and projects."
Junior,5,"The learning experience at Woodbury is great with professors looking out for students. Asking students if anything comes up they are there talk. In addition, the school offers free tutors on campus and each of them are great in the service they offer."
Junior,5,"The university is a small campus, excellent for students that enjoy smaller classes. The maximum of students in a single class about 20. The professors are always there to help and even the administrators are eager to talk and help the students. All the staff in Woodbury are kind to everyone and everyone working hard to help the students best they can."
Niche User,5,"Woodbury has been very attentive. They reach out to me constantly via text messages updating me on emails they sent me, workshops they are offering, and links to classes that I can sit in on online."
Sophomore,5,"I love my university that I am currently attending, Woodbury University. They make me feel seen, understood, and at home."
Senior,5,The small size private university creates a tight net environment that is beneficial to the students both in social and in professional life.
Graduate Student,5,"I was impressed by the fact that this environment is centred around career and personal growth, which is a difficult attribute to find in many schools."
Freshman,5,"I really love the school and many of the staff members there. As a freashman majoring in fashion design going off to sophmore year is really fun. Woodbury let's you explore your creativity as well as to really learn hands on work upon how to sew, what you'll be making as well as being able to develop great skills and new skills whether your a beginner, intermediate, or advanced sewer. Not only are your sewing skills developed but communication skills are grown to help you get out of your shell and stand out."
Junior,5,"The school itself is a small community, but I like it because you get to know almost everyone in school. There are also organizations that you can join that make you feel welcomed and at home."
Niche User,5,"Woodbury is highly secured, the food is great, and the dorms is very beautiful. Plus the prices seems quite fair, and the size of the campus is just right if you seek for classroom that is one teacher and 35 or less students per class."
Niche User,5,What I liked about Woodbury University is the help you received from the staff who work there. They are very specific when it comes to questions. I would recommend others to apply because they offer good financial help!
Freshman,5,The San Diego campus is great unfortunately it is very small. I would change the way in which classes are assigned
Sophomore,5,"Woodbury University provides a small, yet intimate campus. Classroom capacity is 25-30 students, which results into the students developing a personal relationship with their professors."
Junior,5,A great place for people to get an education. It is small and convenient for people to network with students outside of their major. Students are able to see a lot of the other majors because the campus is small and most people know each other.
Junior,5,"Woodbury is an exceptional institution. The campus is beautiful and safe. The staff is very helpful. The class sizes are small which makes it easy to have a strong bond with your professor. There are a lot of clubs and organizations with a lot of diversity. The only thing I wish I could change is the student involvement on campus. Not many students are involved or come to events, I think it would be better if they did. It would bring liveliness to the campus."
Senior,5,"Woodbury University is a small campus located in Burbank, CA. Love the compact and cozy atmosphere there. Currently, I am a senior in accounting program and have been enjoying the culture and professors of this lovely University."
Niche User,5,Woodbury University's calming ambient and employee's friendliness create a perfect ambient for a student that wants to succeed.
Junior,5,"Woodbury University is a great university, especially for Architecture. Education is great. Student life is pretty good but food options can improve as well as overall service university provides. Love my school always!"
Alum,5,"I transferred over from Cal State Fullerton. I was tired of the large public university experience , where I felt anonymous, had trouble getting the classes I needed, had very little access to teachers, and didn't get to know many of my classmates due to the large classroom size. 

Woodbury gave me everything I was looking for. I felt like I was wanted from the first day I visited the school. A counselor laid out every class I needed to graduate, and I got every class I needed. 

I had a lot of one on one contact with all of my teachers. They remembered my name. Class sizes are small: 12-15 students is the norm. I made relationships with many of my classmates. And there were a lot of group projects in many of my classes, which I enjoyed. Collaboration is helpful to learning. 

I am very proud to be a graduate of Woodbury Umiversity."
Niche User,5,I have visited the Woodbury campus with my cousin who is an Alumni of Woodbury University and I loved it. It was nice and small and I'm all set on going Woodbury this fall.
Freshman,5,"The school is a small private University which to me is a big plus. Since the school is so small I have more one on one interactions with my professors. The school always has activities going on, on campus."
College Sophomore,5,I have not heard about any crimes in Woodbury University.
College Sophomore,5,Networking  in Woodbury University is primal.
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, my experience at Woodbury University has been great. I have met many students and teachers who have been very helpful."
College Freshman,5,They help alumni and students get jobs easily.
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel incredibly safe at school and the campus police are seen and very friendly. I've never felt unsafe or threatened in any way.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Students often end up working at the place they interned at, or find a place to work almost immediately after finishing school. The career center is helpful and I receive many emails on possible internships."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Greek life is very active; they participate and coordinate a lot of the events around campus. Almost all students are Greek students and are friendly people. There is not Greek housing, its more so just which side of the campus you live on."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My school is small, but it feels like we are all one community with the common goal of reaching our potential. The professors are helpful and friendly. I would choose my school all over again because I thoroughly enjoy going to school and am excited about my future at this school."
College Freshman,5,Woodbury University is a great private university. I am majoring in Fashion Design and the professors are extremely professional and I have a great time working with them. They thoroughly explain everything and have a great attitude towards every student. They make the students feel comfortable with them asking them questions and the professors clearly answer them all. I have not felt that I am not going to be able to understand something because my professors take the time to explain everything!
College Junior,5,"I love Woodbury. I'm a third-year Game Art & Design student with a focus on Game Art, and this program fits me perfectly. It mixes art with the design of games and programming (not too much programming thank goodness). Most universities focus on one or the other, but you get the whole experience here--and it's what it's gonna be like in the video game industry. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful, and have good links to professionals in the field. Overall, for the experience I want, I wouldn't go anywhere else."
College Junior,5,"ABSOLUTLY  love Burbank. Love the SF Valley. Love LA. 6 months in, this is now home."
College Junior,5,Tons of options. None walking distance but everything you could want just 2 miles or so away!
College Junior,5,"It is the perfect mix of theoretical and concrete, book and hand-on learning."
College Junior,5,I wouldn't change a thing. They focus on the right things.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are always hiring their students.
College Junior,5,"fun small class size, i would chooose it again one because its close to my house second because the school goes on a semester system summer vacations are longer than other school"
College Junior,5,"well rounded academics you can take any classes you want from other majors as well

and also focus on your degree"
College Junior,5,the best part is individual attention and small class sizes you learn from others and instructor directly. everyone knows you
College Junior,5,"Guys and girls at school is the best place where you get to meet people that you want to keep for the rest of your life. My studying at school intended to be hard and allow us to stay in school for more than the usual hours. Pulling all-nighters is something very normal at my school, therefore making friends and having friends that you spend most of your time with them is very important."
College Junior,5,"A very safe and beautiful neighborhood,  but like most of Southern California it is very expensive to live here."
College Sophomore,5,Most of the time its always sunny! Usually it doesn't rain so the weather is great!
College Sophomore,5,They are very helpful and informative.
College Student,5,There isn't any students coming to class intoxicated.
College Freshman,5,Haven't seen drugs on campus yet
College Freshman,5,I am in psychology and it is just awesome
College Sophomore,5,Woodbury is near Downtown Burbank so there is always a good place to eat any time of day. Depending on your choice you can find cheap or expensive food. 
College Sophomore,5,"I love Woodbury. The faulty, the students, the events, and the courses are welcoming. I love the small campus vibe. You see familiar faces and you know people by name not a number. "
College Junior,5,"It's close to home, about 10-15 minutes, you're in and get to class right away. Teachers are passionate and there is a lot of support. Classes are small and you really get the family feel because it is so small you tend to get to know everybody, specially if you are involved. There are a lot of opportunities to learn things that aren't even in your major. Staff and Faculty are very nice and intelligent. You feel that you are adequately guided and there is always someone there to answer any questions. "
College Junior,5,"The school itself if small, so parking is available and you can get anywhere on campus within 5 minutes. There are small classes so you tend to get a lot of one on one and feedback from professors as well as from students. A lot of the classes are discussion based after lecture, so you get a lot of points of views and really dig into the material. It's extremely easy to get an appointment to see your counselor so you always know where you are going and you get the classes you need and want. You get free tutoring in all subjects and there are many organizations you can take part in. "
College Junior,5,"I haven't even met anyone that does drugs, most students are involved in clubs and organizations or working hard on getting their work done. There is a lot to do and we haven't seen any type of incident regarding drugs since I've attended. "
College Junior,5,"In Southern California you really have every option available to you, all you have to do it look. "
College Junior,5,"What can you say, it's Southern California, the best weather in the WORLD!"
College Junior,5,"Living in Southern California is sometimes the best place to be. At Woodbury you have the beaches within 30 to 45 minutes from campus, you're close to down town Los Angeles so everyone can partake in cultural activities,tons of museums, parades, hiking, parks, anything you can think of, in the winter you can even take a trip to big bear and enjoy the snow. Living off campus has its pros and cons, on campus has many advantages but I live off campus, about 10-15 minutes from the University and I haven't had any trouble, the surrounding are is safe."
College Junior,5,"The University has students from all ethnic and economic backgrounds. I've found a general interest for those that are different from the average american student and a positive attitude and respect is displayed when asking questions about other people's backgrounds. It seems that every one is willing to share experiences and shows general acceptance, tolerance and compassion for other student's stories. "
College Junior,5,The school admissions office was wonderful and putting me at easy and letting me know that based on my grades I would most likely qualify for many scholarships the school gives. The financial aid office was then extremely helpful and guiding me to fill out all the necessary paperwork (online). 
Junior,4,Online classes are good and are easy to follow. Just need the self-motivation to do the work on your own.
Junior,4,A good school! It allows you to grow and teachers push you to do your best. The small class sizes help teachers to remember you as a person.
Sophomore,4,"I took online classes for about 1/3 of the spring semester due to COVID-19. Overall, the class experience was not affected too much and we accomplished most of our goals for the semester."
Sophomore,4,The energy and the small campus is very welcoming while the resources are very helpful and all around accessible to everyone. Some problems in attending are usually living expenses and the indecisiveness the campus seems to show in classes or campus life overall.
Alum,4,"Pre-COVID Woodbury did not really utilize online learning, but the faculty and professors were quick to adjust the curriculum. While I am not a fan of online earning I think that they did a great job making sure that as much of the quality of the work remained the same."
Alum,4,"Woodbury was never partial to online learning pre-COVID. However, after we were forced to close campus, the professors were quick to find ways of adjusting the syllabi to still make the most out of class. Obviously there were things that didn't make the cut, but as someone who isn't particularly fond of online classes I think the school handled it very well."
Freshman,4,The online studies were much different then the actual campus studies but my professors were supportive and helped to went through the difficulties.
Freshman,4,It's my freshman year and overall I'm satisfied with educational programs and community (even though my experience was different due to COVID-19).
Freshman,4,"Campus is always clean. Cafeteria has good food, not too pricey.
Professors are the main reason its good. They're hard, but for a very good reason. Downside: they think students have unlimited funds requiring them to spend a lot on projects and a 900$ 3d-printer which is insane considering the cost of tuition.

People on campus are snobby cause its a private school but sometimes you find very down to earth people that you stick to. That part brings down the school BY ALOT. Not to mention that the amount of people you see on campus are like 20 max unless you're in class. If you want a social life = this is not the school for you.  Expect to drive to get food or uber."
Freshman,4,"This school is amazing, full of great people and fun classes. Itâ€™s facilities need to be updated, especially for how expensive it is."
Sophomore,4,"I choose to come to this school because it has a great location in Burbank in which I am nearby animation studios and other certain places where a guild called Women in Animation meets. I food is very good, I like surrounding myself in people who also striving for the same goals, to get into the art industry.  I like the professors because while they teach, they are also currently working in the industry as well. The only thing that is a bit of a drawback is the housing/ dorm. They are pricey and ofter little room to work with."
Freshman,4,I am about to go in as a freshman and I am very excited! The staff is amazing and is willing to help you through all of your needs.
Junior,4,"Woodbury is a very good school, academic wise, but has many things to improve on.

-mail room
-housing (notifications)
-insurance waiving
-background screening teachers
are just a few issues...

Make friends. Lay low. If you complain about anything it'll just get ignored anyway. Human/student services are not well rounded here."
Freshman,4,"Woodbury University is, as the number of students that attends it shows, is small. Whether you like that or not is personal, but for me I love it. If there is one way to describe it here, is that you become a part of a community of people that support you unconditionally. The professors are attentive and will help you to succeed in any way that they can as long as you put in your part in, which is just effort."
Junior,4,"As an animation major, I love the area and the amount of opportunities the school is providing after graduation. The design departments arenâ€™t as favored as the architecture or business programs. But, the campus is very safe, especially the dorms. Student life is very good for a smaller school, especially with multiple types of organizations to be a part of. The administration department needs a lot of work, considering it feels like a battle every time I go in the office about an issue or simply a question. The staff is very caring of their students besides that and I love the community feeling of on campus life. Definitely would go here again if I had the chance!"
Freshman,4,"I really love this school, it's a very artistic school but does have many other majors outside of the art field. The school is private but small which is easy for people to make plenty of friends. The classes are small so you are able to get on a one to one bases with teachers."
Senior,4,My year and a half at Woodbury has been quite well because of the kind professors and faculty that care about each student. They genuinely want you to succeed and find a career that suits you and your talents. They want to ensure that you are fully prepared for your job field.
Freshman,4,"Well for it being my first year there, it was pretty good. The one thing I would like to see change is the food, honestly."
Graduate Student,4,"I attended Woodbury's Master of Organizational Leadership Program.  When I attended it was a one year program with five-week classes, this has since changed.  I was able to work full time and loved having just one class at a time, always on the same day of week with same cohort.  We did a lot of writing and presentations.  There was a special price when I attended, making it an excellent value.  Some professors were better than others but overall the program enriched me personally.  The food on campus is great and I also loved the library.  As I was a grad student who attended at night, I can't really speak to other campus activities."
Alum,4,Small school. Psychology program is one of the smallest but has some really great professors. Professors genuinely care about students and continue to mentor students after graduation. Nice location too.
College Sophomore,4,Its great space  to rest between classes.
College Freshman,4,Great school with diverse classes.
College Freshman,4,So far my school experience has been uniquely great.
College Student,4,You do not need to worry about health and safety services. You will be satisfied with it.
College Student,4,"Internships and job opportunities are constantly updated by the college. Again, you need to work on it starting from the root of applying for the job. Getting a Degree is the only thing you need to have your full concentration on. It is important to discuss internships with the business office, student cervices and even professors in order to find one job that would suit you. Most importantly, it is important to find an internship that you'd appreciate to have your required internship hours be met."
College Student,4,It started off as a small group and now it's a huge fraternity. Delta Sigma phi is a fraternity you would consider joining if you attend this college. It is worthwhile and you will make some great brothers within the fraternity.
College Freshman,4,I like it because it prepares me for my job feild
Recent Alumnus,4,"The class sizes are rarely larger than 10 people, especially for career specific courses. The professors work one-on-one will you and make sure you understand the material. There are many courses so that each student is able to choose the class they want."
Recent Alumnus,4,It is an excellent University
College Sophomore,4,The fashion program is amazing. Teachers really want to help students which makes choosing a small school like Woodbury such a good idea. Only downfall of a small school is that there are less people to socialize with. A lot of drama tends to accumulate within groups of people. It's best to be close with a select amount of students.
College Freshman,4,I love family atmosphere of the teachers and students.
College Junior,4,It' a great way to connect with other students
College Junior,4,"Phenomenal are but VERY hard to find available, affordable housing for students. Especially with pets."
College Junior,4,"It wasn't difficult for me, however that being said I was a transfer student from another art school; therefore I already had a portfolio to show upon being asked, I had already been in my major just at another school so to go through the process again was like having a second chance but this time nailing all the parts I was weary about in the first place."
College Junior,4,The parties here aren't like at some big school like UCLA or USC but they are just right for our size school and usually everyone attends even those you'd least expect.
College Junior,4,"The workload isn't too bad if you know how to manage your time right, all the facilities are open to those when they need it, or at least most of the time. Woodbury is such a peaceful open campus that as a student you can do you work almost anywhere."
College Junior,4,"There is a great variety of foods from different price ranges to cuisine, the only problem someone might have is traveling to these places as most are located downtown. It can be hard for those with out a car or means of transportation but luckily the bus system out here isn't too hard to navigate. As for student discounts, as far as I know, only supply stores such a Swains or Joanns and such give out student discounts, not to sure if any restaurants out here do."
College Junior,4,Woodbury has a lot of international studies.
College Junior,4,Woodbury has a hire security guards that walks the campus all day and night. They have gotten better in the last six months. Campus crime is very low. I walk the campus all times of the night.
College Freshman,4,The professors are actual professionals in the field that they teach in. The class sizes are very small and I felt that the professors are very approachable.
College Freshman,4,I felt that this school is well rounded and offered several different majors.
College Freshman,4,All students must have health  insurance. The location of the clinics are locally located and easy to get to.
College Sophomore,4,Best University I have ever been to.
College Junior,4,"universal, downtown glendale galleria americana"
College Junior,4,everyone seems to be very interested in their respected majors and class that that becomes the only tpic for discussion yours major and your classes dont see a lot of relationships though no couples at all
College Junior,4,graohic design is hardwork alot of projects and designing on you mac laptop but projects are fun and you feel great after
College Junior,4,green spaces are plenty it looks like a park maintenance is done heavily and funded alot.
College Junior,4,"The security at my school is very strict. It is effecting students academic life by giving them clean environment away from drugs use and breaking rules. I believe that having a strictness in universities is very important even though all students are adults and they do not need someone to watch them, but as long as they are in an educational property it is import an to have some restrictions to respect what is being offered and to honor the good eduction that they are providing for students."
College Sophomore,4,The curriculum is fantastic. The Communication department offers courses under all aspects of the entertainment industry and outside of the entertainment industry.
College Sophomore,4,Downtown Burbank offers great restaurants for Woodbury students to enjoy.
College Freshman,4,"I think that just growing up in the melting pot of the United States, seeing diversity is not uncommon. The school has the highest percentage of international students, meaning that there is a huge mix in race, religious, and economic status."
College Freshman,4,"Downtown Burbank is only a five-minute drive, and there are many things to do there. Students just need to find the time to go..."
College Freshman,4,"The permit cost is less than $100 per semester, which is very cheap compared to other schools. The good parking spots, those in the front, are generally taken very fast. However, the back parking lot, near the dorm areas, is always empty, and one could definitely find parking space."
College Freshman,4,"The workload of architecture is very heavy, but as long as time management is done correctly, all will be well. Getting a 4.0 is hard, because professors will never give you an A, the highest they do is A-."
College Freshman,4,"It's a very small campus and there are no emergency phone booths around campus as you would see in other universities. Security does walk around every hour all day long. I definitely feel safe, but I would like for the drinking problems to go away."
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet had an internship, but it is required for everyone in order to graduate."
College Freshman,4,"The professors in architecture are fantastic. Yes, they do yell at you and you will cry, but that is just the process. The students, on the other hand, are very lazy and do not live up to the value of college."
College Freshman,4,"There are two types of people at Woodbury: those that come from money and those that receive federal aid. There are quite a few dozen of international students, and they are the ones who have the looks but do not necessarily have the brains."
College Freshman,4,"I would say that many of the on-campus jobs are aimed towards Greeks. As if, you pay the dues for a sorority or fraternity, and you get the job. Because of this, there are two sides to it-- yeah, they are the ones who are involved, but there are non-Greeks who are more involved than them and do more volunteering work, but do not get recognized, because they don't want to because volunteering is about giving from the heart, why must you join a club to volunteer? Well, that's the more social perspective of it. In terms of academics, Greeks are a bit on the lazy side, as they tell their ""sisters"" or ""brothers"" to help them with their homework and projects; it is not uncommon to see them working together and their works being so similar."
College Junior,4,"It seems very reasonable, however we haven't had a huge incident that I've witnessed since I've been here."
Junior,2,"I have lived on campus for almost three years and I never wanted to return after summer because of the housing. I would get really bad depression for a week upon return because the dorms are not welcoming at all and the cafeteria system is embarrassing. It just takes adjustment to get back into the mindset of living on the tiny campus with nothing to walk to in the empty suburban area. I have been trying to transfer ever since I stepped my foot on campus but I can never afford the schools I get accepted to so I keep returning. Also, the academics and teachers are amazing, which works as a distraction for my living situation there. I would definitely recommend this school if you can commute and do not look for a campus life and making friends. This school is good if you want to just focus on your studies and drive back and forth from home every day. There is no communal area though where you could wait in between classes."
Freshman,2,Great professors. However some students have regards over individuals who are paying for their own education. Snooty rich kids mixed with normal hardworking students.
Junior,2,"First of all, DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE A TRANSFER STUDENT. This school is based on kids who just graduated high school. The majority of the age range is 17-20 and 20 is pushing it. If you don't live on campus, you're pretty much screwed out of friends. They are super clicky here and it's like being in high school with peers talking badly about others and making snarky remarks in classes. If you don't join a frat or a sorority, don't expect to fit in. 60% of the school is in them and there's only 2. 
The professors are okay. I had a few really amazing ones and they are helpful with course work. Thats the one thing Woodbury has going to them. However, the chairs of the departments are also teachers and some are incredibly rude. I have left in tears on more than one occasion after talking to the chair of my department, he was not understanding at all and also said horrible things about my age in front of the entire class."
College Student,2,"You will not expect any athletics offered by this college. However, certain events may take place where you could have a friendly play with your friends. This is further possible if you join a fraternity."
College Junior,2,"I have lived on campus for two years now in both North Hall and South Hall. Dining is a horror, the cost is making me pull out loans I know I can't afford. I do believe South Hall had bedbugs last semester."
College Junior,2,"As a campus resident I can confidently say I am sick of the campus food, even an off campus student can probably say the same thing if asked but it is there and convenient."
College Junior,2,We do not have a sports team at this time. We have an on campus gym which is perhaps the size of a small Starbucks and basketball courts that double sometimes as a soccer field for those who want to play on the concrete because we don't have enough grass to even play catch on.
College Junior,2,They have one place to eat Woody's. It is not very good. Needs some upgrades in the food category.
College Sophomore,2,No night life near campus
College Junior,2,I would appreciate a shuttle service.
College Junior,2,"We don't really have any active sports, but honestly no one has the time for them anyway."
College Student,2,We dont have greek housing considering the school is prety small.
College Student,2,I feel like the price for housing is a little too much for me.
College Student,2,It's extremely expensive where the location of the school is.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is enough to suffice the whole campus, however it is low in quality and has very little variety than from other schools. It also consists of low nutritional quality which as a result the students fall ill."
College Sophomore,2,"little if no parties, the bar/club scene, underage nightlife, and transportation.
the 7 eleven across the street is our only source of nightlife fun , besides that its 3-d modeling, rendering, print , model building ( repeat as necessary until semester is over)"
College Senior,2,The campus only suggests higher priced properties. Most of them are out of my budget. They should offer housing in which students can receive discounted units based on the fact that they're a student.
College Freshman,2,"Campus parking costs $75, but parking spaces are limited. You need to get to the campus early to avoid the parking huslte. Also, if parked without a permit the fines vary anywhere from $25 to $100 depending on the spot parked."
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife is not so active at Woodbury University. There are no club scenes around just some hookah bars few miles away from the campus.
House parties are more popular amongst the students, usually its open to all ages and by invitation only."
College Freshman,2,"Woodbury is in Burbank, California one day it could rain another day it could be hot."
Sophomore,1,Online classes some have Zoom with lectures and others you are teaching yourself for the same price. If you are not happy too bad because education is subjective. They do not have to teach you if they don't want to. If you didn't drop in time that's on you.
Sophomore,1,Online classes some have Zoom with lectures and others you are teaching yourself for the same price. If you are not happy too bad because education is subjective. They do not have to teach you if they don't want to. If you didn't drop in time that's on you.
Graduate Student,1,"Not recommended for international students who intend to work in the U.S. after graduation. International student department at Woodbury is notorious among students for being untrained and unprofessional. Year of 2017 experienced a number of work authorizations rejected for wrong fees and insufficient documents, causing 10+ international students to suffer in Visa limbo for half an year, some of whom had to leave the country. School notified of a refund but never delivered, instead fired the department char and employed a new person who, however, appears to work the same way as the former. 

Education at Woodbury tends to be experimental and show-oriented with lack of foundation. Instructors often introduce master's level materials to undergraduate students and expect publishable works.

Large number of short-term Instructors are hired at Woodbury due to school's financial failure and often seen to take advantage of college credits to gain cheap labor for their own private business."
Junior,1,"Although the school prides themselves on being diverse and offering one of best college experiences, you will not receive that here in the end. I was given the opportunity to attend this school for over 3 years. I will admit, I was sold on the experience and environment. That was completely changed toward my 3rd year at Woodbury when I faced a financial issue with the school. As a result, the school in no way illustrated or empathized with my situation. It was as if they didn't care because I already put 3 years into the school. Of course, that didn't matter because of how much money the school got from me within those 3 years. My effort to try to get people at this school to help was extremely exhausting. Almost every department that I sought help from referred me  to another department. The worst thing I can take away from this was how close I was to finishing. Please stay away parents and students. This school only cares about you getting in and spending money."
Freshman,1,"I was offered a 15k scholarship, and arrived happily and eager to start. What could have been a wonderful experience was ruined by the staff. Most of them were two faced to me, which I could obviously tell. They were extremely judgmental. There were nice ones, yes, but a majority of them, no. All they care about is appearance and credibility, but realistically, this school is not worth your money. Spend it elsewhere, where you will not endure narrow-minded, selfish and negative faculty. For example, if you want to major in film making, how many successful film makers have said ""I am an alumni of Woodbury""? NONE. Even if I was offered a full ride, I could decline, now that I have seen what the heart of Woodbury consists of. Bleck."
College Junior,1,They really don't have a part scene that I have heard of or seen.
College Sophomore,1,No athletic teams at Woodbury University
College Sophomore,1,I have not received any scholarships from Woodbury. I suggest looking for scholarships outside the university.
College Freshman,1,"There are no sports on campus, even though the student government is trying to get sports to happen on campus. However, with the population of only 1,500, this is almost impossible. The gym is beginning to take shape, but it is still under construction. And the gym is VERY SMALL."
College Freshman,1,"DRY CAMPUS, on paper. There have been incidents of security walking around and underage drinking is still going on. The problem with this is that no one really gets punished for drinking, even underage students. What I don't understand is that this is a dry campus, where alcoholic beverages are not allowed, and yet people are still able to drink and authorities do not do much about it."
College Senior,1,They're more annoying than anything. Always throwing loud parties and disrupting non-Greek people. The only good thing they do is give out free food.
College Sophomore,1,"In the early morning and late afternoon, when the majority of students attend class the most, there is never any parking."
College Freshman,1,"There are no gyms, no official school teams, or anything. There are two blacktop courts that have basketball hoops but they are often commandeered by those who want to play soccer. There is no football or soccer field, no arenas, no fitness centers."
College Freshman,1,"Woodbury University isn't known for it's athletics, because it is actually nonexistent. They do have a basketball court where kids can play some activities, but other than that nothing. Not even a gym! So if you're into sports, I would say this isn't the school for you."
College Sophomore,1,Getting good grades and need financial help but got no scholarship from Woodbury.
College Sophomore,1,We Have None â€“ theres no sports to be played as a school. we do have clubs that encourage student participation though
Recent Alumnus,1,"AVOID THIS SCHOOL â€“ Not sure why this school has such a high rating???? From my experience at Woodbury, faculty/administration pretends to care, if you have an issue with an instructor they will do the bare minimum to assist you and make you feel as though you are bothering them rather then comprehending that it is their job to assist you as it fall under their title responsibilities. 
A lot of unfair grading in the program I am in. FACULTY MEMBERS CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. 
Basically anybody could get in. We have individuals who can not even speak English well, and they are in the program.  I applied less than 3 weeks prior to the commencement  of the program and I got in.  So, do not worry about it being difficulty to get in. 
Parking is not enforced, you do not need to buy a permit. 
Overall I find the faculty and administration to not be credible and unethical. If you are not already an accomplished individual (in reference to your career) within the program, you are automatically not a ""favorite"" for a majority of faculty members that are there just to network.   
The Curriculum is horrible, as you learn absolutely nothing. Majority of my peers do not read their assigned text, because they can get away with bsing assignments, that's how easy the program & assignments  I am in are.
I would honestly not recommend this school as it is not a higher learning institute...you can get a better education at a community college. This school should lose their accreditation."
College Student,1,"i dont believe this university has sports. it is a small university and it is getting bigger, so maybe in the future the school will have sports."
College Freshman,1,"There are few if not any dining options. most is fast food or we have to drive far to eat but concerning student discount with food, I'm not sure there are any which sucks cause the food on campus is terrible"
College Junior,1,"Sports Are Non-Existent â€“ Everyone is focused on school, which is a good thing, but sports should be a part of the campus life experience."

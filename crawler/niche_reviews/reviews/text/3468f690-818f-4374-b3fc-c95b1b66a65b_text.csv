Alum,5,"Ursuline is an extremely tight-knit community composed of primarily women and female-identifying persons.  It is a place of welcome, where your interests are encouraged and every effort is made to make sure that your individual situation is comfortable."
Alum,5,"With the transition to online classes due to COVID-19, the professors were given the week of Spring break to switch their entire class to an online format.  Without exception, the transition was smooth for all 5 of my previously in-person classes, including my senior research seminar and my independent study.  Not all of the professors were as proficient in the technology, but all of them did their best to not let their own struggles interfere with our educations."
Niche User,5,I'm a high school student looking for a college that I think that is best for me.  Ursuline has sent me multiple pieces of information about  their school that has gotten me interested.  I sent an application out and I'm still waiting for the semester to be over so I can finalize eveything and send them in.
Junior,5,"I currently just enrolled in their UCAP program for Human Resource management and so far the Administrators has been wonderful. The campus has great family feel to it and the help is amazing. So far the students are friendly, very welcoming , and respectful.  The administrators were very helpful in regards to helping you find scholarships in case you find your self paying for some expenses out of pocket.  I knew Ursuline College was a perfect fit form me once I step onto the campus and I'm proud to be a student there. Ursuline College has so much to offer. Communication excellent!!!"
Sophomore,5,"Ursuline is a great small school, that really focuses on giving students a great education! The classes are small, which allows for students to ask questions easily. The professors really get to know everyone and are very helpful!"
Freshman,5,Ursuline is an amazing school and so are the people. I have never had a better experience with a school. The people and campus make you feel at home.
Graduate Student,5,I admitted to Ursuline College 2018 spring. I was so impressed by the clean campus and friendly faculty at first glance. Even though it is a small College but have a great quality of learning environment.
Junior,5,"Ursuline College is wonderful for someone who strives in small class sizes and close relationships with professors. The small campus atmosphere provides a sense of community and familiarity with each student. Everyone knows each other; you're not just ""a number""--you are a human being. Professors are always willing to answer questions and provide support for you and your classes. Being that Ursuline College is a women's college, you have the unique experience of classroom and campus life being dedicated to putting women's learning and preferences first."
Junior,5,"I like the beautiful campus and the friendly professors, advisors, and staff members.  The campus is also an aesthetic majesty of architecture.  The only thing I would change is the cost to attend, which is astronomical as the heavens themselves."
Junior,5,"What I like most about Ursuline College is the diversity of the student body. Yes, we a majority female campus. However, within that population, you find people from every walk of life. I have made friends I never would have met otherwise."
Sophomore,5,"I love Ursuline's small atmosphere and the way that they work with the students to help them reach goals rather than setting barriers up! They are open, have an amazing curriculum and instructors! The art therapy program is growing and I am proud of the way that they are continuing to improve. I would like them to try to integrate the graduate students with the undergraduate to foster unity within the department though. Also there is a shortage of dry erase markers."
College Sophomore,5,"Very rarely, you may see or smell marijuana or edibles but they are not common or encouraged. People sneak and drink alcohol in their rooms, but you will probably not see anyone getting drunk.  I haven't heard anything about other kinds of drugs being used."
College Sophomore,5,"It's a women's focused college and it's small.  Some men live on campus and of course violent or sexual crimes can happen between women, but the likelihood is much lower than at a typical co-ed school. Also, there's no parties and no drug or alcohol scene."
College Freshman,5,Ursuline College has an amazing reputation and employers know if you have a degree from Ursuline College then you are a hard worker who will be perfect for the job.  There is even a whole office on campus that will help you find internships and jobs! Ursuline College wants their students to succeed.
College Freshman,5,"I love Ursuline College. The professors are amazing and very accommodating to every students need.  Although we are a smaller school, a lot of opportunities will present themselves and there are a lot of ways to get involved on campus and have fun!

College Freshman,5,The campus is small and intamate. Everyone looks out for each other. I regard it as incredibly safe. Campus security patrols the campus especially at night. They are willing to walk you somewhere on campus if you feel unsafe. There are also blue emergency phones that instantly reach campus security. The students are required to complete safety and sexual assault courses through the school to ensure the safety of the students.
College Freshman,5,"A degree from Ursuline is held in high regard among employers. The career counselors, and advisers work hard to find interships and job prospects. The career counselors will even hold a mock interview in order to practice interview skills. They have resume workshops based on major and the types of careers that people will be applying for."
College Freshman,5,"Ursuline College has a huge involvement in women's sports. It advocates and great supports women's sports. Ursuline has all great sports teams, with a huge variety, from volleyball, basketball, soccer, track, lacrosse, and swimming to name a few. A large population of the student body is involved with sports."
College Freshman,5,"They just renovated our Athletic center because a tornado had destroyed it a couple years back. All the athletic teams are very determined , work well together. I see a lot of students going out to cheer on our Ursuline Arrows!!"

College Sophomore,5,"The academics offered at my school are very details about what classes fit the career you choose, the curriculum is very mapped out to where you know what exactly you need to take.

College Sophomore,5,yeaye finally a drug free school.
College Sophomore,5,Nice restaurant in the neighborhood.
College Sophomore,5,"If you are looking for nursing programs, Ursuline is the best you could be in."
College Senior,5,"I feel extremely safe at Ursuline. That is part of the great thing about having a small school. The security guards are also very nice to help you out if you do not feel safe walking from one place to the next, but most buildings are close too so again, safety is great. All dorms need an ID to get into so visitors can't even get into the lobby without one which sounds like a pain, but again, extremely safe and nice to know!"
College Senior,5,"For myself, I had transferred from a different University that places you on a waiting list for their nursing program. Ursuline is NOT like that!! I was able to apply, get into the nursing program, and am in my senior year, all without having to wait on a waiting list! I have had great clinical experiences and feel very prepared for my career. The application process is smooth, ""Not a Number Night"" helps prospective students to get through it!"

College Junior,5,Parking is great! There is always somewhere to park that is really close to classes.

College Junior,5,Campus is 20 minutes to everywhere. There is amazing nightlife downtown and nearby parks with pools and walking trails.
College Junior,5,This school doesn't tolerate nonsense!
College Junior,5,I love this area. It is a very well-off area with expensive houses. The area is gorgeous. The malls and surrounding areas are very diverse and multi cultural.
College Junior,5,I live off campus so I am not able to rate the college from that perspective. I am a commuter student and I am very impressed by the atmosphere. I do not feel unsafe any time that I have come to campus. It is beautiful and well-tended. The campus security is not an obvious presence but the atmosphere feels safe.
College Junior,5,I've never felt unsafe on campus. The local police department as well as Ursuline PD are always present/ doing rounds.
College Senior,5,"Strict and Protective, but Cool About It – Beware of the maintenance nun warriors. Heed their warnings carefully! 

Ursuline College is a Roman Catholic women's college. What else can I say?"
College Senior,5,"Student Focused With a Global Outlook – The Ursuline Studies program is the core of all academic studies at Ursuline College. It develops, encourages, and incorporates excellent writing skills across all academic disciplines, and helps each student express and create their own vision, values, and voice."
College Junior,5,"Extremely Happy! I love this program and school!  I would recommend this school to everyone I know.  Upon graduation, I plan to continue my HR career as an HR Generalist"
College Junior,5,"Best Program – I am in the beginning stages of my progam which is HR Management.  However, the classes I've taken are all towards my major in which I really appreciate.  While I am learning I am applying what I've learned in school in the workplace.  The professors are all HR experts and are subject matter experts.  The UCAP prorgram at Ursuline consists of  5 week sessions which can be sometimes a heavy work load, but the professors are very supportive and are always accessible for help.  I can not wait to attend the remainder of my classes and graduate"
Junior,4,All students became online students due to Covid-19. The transition went surprisingly well and professors were helpful and lenient due to circumstances.
Junior,4,Very small college that is perfect for those who thrive in that kind of environment. Very good nursing and art therapy programs. Due to its small size it lacks in food options and extended hours for those times you are up late studying. Excellent student resources and sports teams are a good addition.
Sophomore,4,Ursuline is a great school for people looking for small colleges. The community is great especially professors! Really easy to feel welcomed
Sophomore,4,"Ursuline College is a good school that allows flexibility for adult learners, and encourages women to be the best they can be."
Freshman,4,Very nice campus! This is isn't a party which great because it helps you focus on your studies. Yes some things can be improved like a student union and more males need to attend. The sports teams are highly valued here and everyone is very nice. The professors love to help you in every way they can and there are tons of resources outside of the professors that the college offers. Yes the campus is small also which is great for if your running late to class or your not used to walking long distances!
Junior,4,Ursuline is a very good school. I feel I have a lot of opportunities there. I am in the nursing program and so far I am very impressed with ursuline.
Niche User,4,I've been here to visit friends and I feel like this college is a safe area and very well educated students.
Freshman,4,Ursuline college is a great college to attend if you are looking for an all academic college. The professors are kind and try to work with you for whatever you're struggling with. The students and faculty are all kind.
College Sophomore,4,"There have been a few racial skirmishes between students, but nothing major.  Most have been the result of ignorance rather than hatred.  There is an office of equity and inclusion if something needs to be seriously addressed. Gay people are generally accepted, you will see equality symbols on the doors of many professor's and staff member's offices.  There is a good mix of conservative and liberal students, though you probably wouldn't know anyone's affiliation unless it came up in conversation or class discussion."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are usually quiet and clean.  Rooms are on the smaller side of what I've seen on other campuses and alcohol and overnight male guests are prohibited (As of 2016).  However, female guests can stay overnight.  Curfews for male guests are reasonable.  Common areas have TVs.  There is a lounge with a pool table and air hockey.  The only ""perks or amenities"" are the average vending machines and communal kitchen.  Each floor has a bathroom with a good number of toilets, showers, and sinks.  Almost never overcrowded at any time of day."
College Junior,4,"For what I am going for, the school is very respectable and reputable for my major. I have not had any job offers yet, but many people are familiar with the good reputation of my school."
College Junior,4,"Overall, classes are good, along with the professors. The smaller class sizes allow students more 1 on 1 time with professors. I feel that for the most part, the professors care about you succeeding."
College Junior,4,"Overall, the school is safe. It is more due to the location of the school though. Campus security appears to be accurate. The school is in a very safe neighborhood and it is a dry campus."
College Junior,4,"I like smaller schools and the school I chose fits my needs well. For the most part, the classes are fairly straightforward. The professors clearly care about the success of the students. I am very satisfied with my school."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are incredibly knowledgeable, and caring toward their students. The curriculum is geared to be fair but knowledge heavy. There are a variety of courses available especially in women's studies and religious studies. The majors are diverse with the courses complimenting them nicely."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is convenient. You meet so many new people, and make friends with people you would never expect. The Resident Assistants are always running some type of interesting programs for the residents."
College Freshman,4,"Ursuline College shows great care for its students.

They all want you to pass so they will help you as much as they can. the students are great and friendly. The foods not bad but it could be better. Overall I love Ursuline and wouldn't change schools for the world."
College Junior,4,The academics is great. It has truly helped me get a greater understanding of the legal field. It has offered hands on experience and important readings.
College Junior,4,"The career prospects and value of a degree from my school is very valuable. The school provide job opportunities for jobs in my field. The alumni network is strong, a lot of the job opportunities have alumni working at that job. They are very helpful and welcoming to current students. There is a strong quality of employers recruiting on campus. The career center and services on campus is useful and constantly provide opportunities and ways to find a job in career of your choice."
College Junior,4,"My courses and professors have been great. I learned a lot about the legal system and research. The professors were very educated and helpful. The class size was small but efficient. Everyone got to speak their mind and receive feedback from other students. The courses offered and their style were useful and effective. The syllabus and course structure was straight forward and for the most part, easy to navigate."
College Junior,4,"There was an incident around the campus, but the school made sure I was aware and what safety precautions were set in place to ensure my safety."
College Junior,4,"plenty of options, good service and food, spacious"

College Sophomore,4,"It is a quiet and nice neighborhood, you will love it."
College Sophomore,4,When you live in the dorm you get to know people and they are very friendly in general.
College Sophomore,4,it is alright and the students are very friendly. Bathrooms are very clean in general and no particular noise  during quiet hours. Love the school
College Freshman,4,Minorities are involved in many things on campus.
College Freshman,4,Anything you ever want to purchase is within 20 minutes of the school.
College Freshman,4,I like the convenience of being so close to the buildings I have class in.
College Freshman,4,Everything here is great I'm enjoying my experience here.
College Freshman,4,I'm very happy with my program. I always knew what career path I wanted and know that I'm actually learning I'm very sure that this is the right program for me. If I could do it all over again I would. I would love to have my own brand of merchandise and running my own company. Honestly I have no concerns on finding a job in my field because your pretty much independent or you move to a location where there's plenty of job in my field available.
College Freshman,4,The food here on campus is really good and it's cooked fresh which is very important. It's way better than high school lunches for sure.
College Freshman,4,"Working in fashion boutiques I learned how to run a business and how you have to be able to communicate well with others. I was responsible for helping clients, putting clothes on manikins and making sure I was selling garments. I've worked in hair salons and had to greet customers and schedule appointments. I have a lot of experience in retail."

College Freshman,4,"Your always safe on campus, my college is very small so not many dangerous things happen here."
Junior,2,"Ursuline is definitely below average, but not necessarily poor.  It is an expensive choice for a nursing program, and as far as return on investment, I don't understand what they use the money on.  The quality of educators is subpar.  They brag about hiring mostly at the doctoral level, but the professors do not know how to educate.  The buildings are falling apart, and the technology is a nightmare. Many of the students when asked why they chose Ursuline replied: I didn't get into the other shools I applied to.  To me it seems as though they don't have a standard for students, and a fair amount of time is wasted teaching students basic information that should've been covered in pre-reqs.  To be fair, I have attended a 4-year and a 2-year school previously so that's where my comparisons lie."
College Junior,2,There is no Greek life where I attend school.
Recent Alumnus,2,My experience has been good with financial aid.  Up until recently I haven't had any problems.
College Freshman,2,"doesn't have parties, all girl and dry campus"
College Sophomore,2,its only one bus that comes on campus but other than that transportation is limited to get around the city.
College Sophomore,2,NO GUYS ON CAMPUS. Well for guys live in here
College Freshman,2,I'm sure it may be nice for some students but this year I have not been awarded all the aid I was in the previous year.  I did well academically and was not acknowledged for it.
College Freshman,2,Walking to class is brutal in Cleveland weather.
College Freshman,2,"Unless a student is already living in close proximity to the school with their parents, I do not see the point of living off campus.  I think it is too much of a hassle trying to pay rent, tuition, etc."
College Junior,2,"After my first semester I did not attend many parties. I had a poor experience and quickly found out that it just wasn't my scene. The parties were out of control, fights and other mishaps. However, no I.D. meant no entry. As for the club scene everything was close to campus and in later years the school shuttle provided transport to and from the downtown clubs. "
College Freshman,2,Daley is not that good food is very fating and not to much to pick from.
College Sophomore,2,It is Cleveland. End of story. Winters can be tough because of commuting. The walks across campus are not far however.
College Sophomore,2,"Guys are typically the artsy type. Ursuline is a 94% female school, so guys are few and far between. The girls are relatively athletic and inteligent."
College Senior,2,"Few Men but Growing – Ursuline was once an all female campus., But in recent years, the campus has gone co-ed. Although females largely out number males on campus, there has been an increased number of men commuting to the campus."
College Junior,2,"There Is No Where to Hide – It's a walk to everything, and sometimes it's easier to go outdoors. There isn't a lot of awnings, or places to hide. Also, it's a long walk to the buildings from the main parking area. I imagine it's very annoying for people living on dorm when the weather is bad."
College Student,2,"Registering for Classes – This is a small college, but a good majority of the classes only have one offering and even the most common classes aren't offered every semester. THis makes it difficult for me to schedule work and school. Many of my classmates have transferred to other colleges because of it and I consider doing the same."
College Junior,1,i have never been to an ursuline campus party
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life
College Sophomore,1,The local weather that affects campus is very bad because its near the weather belt.
College Sophomore,1,there is no greek life on campus.
College Senior,1,"The closest I could find apartment wise is still twenty minutes away, and still very expensive. Pepper Pike (the city where Ursuline College is located) is a very upper-class area, so the housing is expensive. You can find decently priced apartments if you're willing to drive at least 20 minutes, but there is nothing cheap for broke college students close by."
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing close to UC. It is probably a good 5 miles to anything. And most of those restaurants are overpriced. The east side of Cleveland is expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Ursuline is a small school. We recently made it into the NCAA. Sports are not well attended. As most of our students are commuters, coming back after classes to see less than average teams is not a priority."
College Junior,1,"It's All Pretty Far – There really isn't a ton of parties, and it's hard to get to a bar if you don't have a car. Most of the bars are run of the mill."
College Senior,1,"Very Strict – This is a catholic, predominantly female school.  There is a 12;00 curfew in the dorms, especially for the men who live there.  There is no alcohol or smoking allowed near the dorms.  There are security guards everywhere you turn"

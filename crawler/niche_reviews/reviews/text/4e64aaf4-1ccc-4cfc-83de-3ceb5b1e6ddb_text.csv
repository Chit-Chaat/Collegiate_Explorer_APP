Freshman,5,"Is the best. Everything and everyone are nice and perfect. Very nice and safe environment! I love everything because they make me feel like I’m actually part of something big and I love the fact that they include me for everything. I love the fact that is close to everything and I also love the fact that they have free tutoring. They are very nice with everything 
Classes are easy and professors are super understanding and relatable"
Freshman,5,"What  I like about salem is that they are so welcoming. Automatically thy treat you as If you are a sister. The faculty is so uplifting and they make me feel at home. There is so much to do and you really can have a bond with everyone. At first I was hesitant because it was all girls, but when I toured the school I completely forgot about that because it didn’t matter. What mattered was that the girls were kind and sweet. They answered all my questions I had and they made sure I knew that I was welcomed with unconditional love."
Senior,5,"I have had an excellent overall experience at Salem College as a Fleer student.  The faculty are superb, and the education is second-to-none."
Freshman,5,Salem is my home. I am so glad that I decided to come here. The support I receive from fellow students is astounding. Salem is a great place and I cannot imagine going anywhere else.
Freshman,5,I was very impressed with Salem College. I would put it first on my list of choices. The administration was friendly and very and imformative.
Sophomore,5,Open and friendly experience from the moment I began my first semester. The library is beautiful the gym is breathtaking and the professors are remarkable! I am honored to be attending this establishment.
Freshman,5,"My name is Fabiola and I'am a freshmen at Salem college , the school itself has shown me that there is opportunities for all different type of ethnicity students. All of the students get allow with each other. The professor are one of a kind because they are there to help the students when they are in need of assistance.Salem College is pretty easy because is a unique , based on that is a small school , yet , it makes it easier for student to find their class because the campus is not huge like the other colleges. Salem itself has a cafe in which student can study or each with friends. things that i would like for the school to change is nothing because they student, professors, staff, and member of Salem college make the school what it is today. Being my first year it has been the best experience ever and I'am looking forward for the other 3 yeas to come."
Senior,5,"Salem has given me the experience and education necessary to be an active and engaged citizen of its community, of Winston-Salem, of the United States, and of the world. It's professors care deeply about their students success. The Salem community is an accepting and diverse group of students, faculty, and staff who strive for the betterment of the campus every day."
Senior,5,"Salem College is a great place for aspiring leaders to get the support they need. When I came to Salem College, I was not sure how I would like being at a women's college. However, I feel that it was the best decision that I could make, especially since I plan to enter the field of medical research. The support and personal guidance that you receive from the science, and mathematics faculty is giving me the confidence that I need to be competitive."
Alum,5,"I'm an alumn of Salem College. I love this school with all my heart! There is a strong sisterhood that one cannot describe. I absolutely wouldn't change a thing about my experience there.

As for the complaint about no air conditioning, the school was founded in 1772. The buildings were constructed in the 1800s and 1900s. Students have always been allowed to have window units in their rooms and the majority of the classrooms and public spaces have central air. Feel free to go study in the brand new $7million student center and use the wifi."
Freshman,5,"A beautiful campus full of beautiful people! I love this school a lot because it is just an amazing community of people who want you there, and do amazing things."
Freshman,5,"It is an amazing College with so much to offer...from Academics to Athletics.  the Faculty are very caring and def interesting and interested  in your College future and beyond.  the Campus is amazing as is the Winston-Salem area.  My fellow students and teammates are the BEST!!  I can't believe I found the right College for my Education, Sports and Future!!"
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy my classes at Salem. Even in my least favorite class, the teachers seem to live, eat, and breath their subject. Most of the teachers have their doctorate's in their field if not then masters and really know what they are talking about. The teachers are very high standard compared to your average school. They want the students to succeed but at the same time hold us accountable as adults for our actions. Getting help and asking questions usually come with a quick response."
College Sophomore,5,"I really love this school. Over the summer I ended up taking a course at another school and the entire time I just missed Salem so badly!! The only thing I struggle with is that because it is a smaller college, it can be difficult to get the class you need for the semester."
College Junior,5,"I really enjoyed all my professors, they are very educated in their field and know what they're talking about. The call sizes are  small and I really like that. The most people I had in one of my classes was about 20, the smallest was five including myself."
College Junior,5,"Public Safety is pretty great, you can call them anytime to come pick you up from the pit when it's raining or if you're out late down at the flats."
College Sophomore,5,"The public safety department does a great job of maintaining safety on campus. All students, faculty and staff are constantly aware of any potential hazardous acts happening on or near campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Salem College has an infinite number of connections for internships and jobs for students. This is not only created by its name, but also the alumna. These women love this school so much that they are more than willing to give back in more ways than one."
College Freshman,5,"The opportunities after Salem are great, from what I have heard. They really help you find a job and stay in touch years down the road. I have also heard that when you are looking for a job, you really stand out from other people for being a Salem alumni,"
College Freshman,5,"Because we are all women, we have a general respect for other women. We know how demeaning and disrespectful it is to be cat-called and harassed based on our sex. It doesn't happen, to my knowledge. Public Safety is always on watch and does a good job at securing our campus. We're in a safe and quiet part of town. There has never been a moment where I questioned my safety at Salem."
College Freshman,5,"The Alumnae network is awesome. We're all family so no matter where we go, we always have sisters backing up up and helping us along. I am 100% confident that I will find a job after graduation."
College Freshman,5,"All the classes are less than 30 students, most are less than 15. The courses are taught by helpful, knowledgeable professors that are proficient in their field. The learning environment is ideal."
College Freshman,5,"Because we are a small all women's school, the whole campus is included in Greek life and it comes with the price of admission. We are Gamma Kappa Delta. There are students that embrace and love the sisterhood bond we are a part of and there are those that choose not to associate themselves too closely with the idea but overall, it is a constructive, inclusive part of our community."
College Freshman,5,I love my school. It is a small school so all the professors are very accessible and have the time to dedicate to their students. I haven't yet met a professor I didn't like. The student body is also delightful. It truly is a sisterhood and it is freeing to not have to worry about how people think of you because we're all family. The Alumnae network is fantastic and there are lots of opportunities beyond our campus. 10/10 would attend again.
College Freshman,5,"My school revolves around success of the students and their ability to overcome anything. There is a sisterhood that rules over the campus in such way that different graduation classes take first years under their wings and help them overcome anxiety and form an unbreakable bond of trust. The campus is small enough to get to know your peers, but bif enough to not get tired of the same pathway."
College Sophomore,5,"Salem has a great learning environment. The professors contribute by engaging the class in manner that everyone understands, and all the women are very sisterly to one another and they help build one another up in classes."
College Senior,5,"I have had so many wonderful professors!  Challengingly, funny and incredibly focused and dedicated.  Salem has been everything and more than I had hoped."
College Senior,5,"Salem is a wonderful school that elevates the education of women to a higher plane every year. Education, sisterhood, honor...all built into the everyday life of the students at Salem."
College Junior,5,"Salem College is a wonderful place. I feel as though I have made lifelong friends. Since the campus is small, it allows you to break out of your shell and meet new people because it is not intimidating. The students here are incredibly kind and it feels like a second home. In addition, the professors take the time to get to know you, creating great bonds."
College Junior,5,I love Salem's open environment. The people here are very accepting! There are many clubs you can join. My professors are also really personable and I am never afraid to talk to them. The Deans know your name!
College Senior,5,"As soon as I walked on to Salem College, I fell in love! Everything here is beautiful. The school looks exactly like the photos and the people here are amazing. This school has definitely changed my life and I will forever be a Salem sister."
College Freshman,5,I loved the school over all.
College Junior,5,"Literally the best of both worlds, and plenty of options! We have beautiful old buildings exteriors with renovated insides.  All of the residence halls on main campus are within 7 minutes from any classes, and the off-(main) campus housing options are super cool (almost all apartment/ flat style).  I've loved my room each year thus far."
College Junior,5,"We have an honor code, so administration doesn't have to be strict... Salem Women hold themselves to a higher standard anyway.  We're accepting and also strong leaders, so stuff like protests, creating new student organizations, and such aren't viewed as a bad thing.  Salem is one of a kind in this way!"
College Junior,5,"Salem is one of the most accepting places I've ever been! It's allowed me to become who I am without fear of judgment, and to be confident in doing so.  There's a lot of diversity in the student body, and I think it's a beautiful thing to be able to say that there is no ""typical"" kind of student.  We are all unique, and we are all Salem.  If I had to choose one word to describe everybody, I'd probably use beautiful."
College Junior,5,"Being an all women's college, safety is often a concern for incoming first years, but I can honestly say that during my three years here so far, I've never once felt unsafe.  Public Safety is always around, and more importantly always accessible.  They are located in the center of campus, so they're never more than a few minutes away.  One of the most important characteristics of our public safety staff is that they're always approachable. I've NEVER felt ashamed or embarrassed to ask for help, and they're always willing to help us whenever we ask.  In addition to public safety, Salem is really huge on the family aspect, or ""sisterhood"".  Through my time here, I've realized that the sisterhood everybody talks about is real! Your Salem sisters will always have your back, which truly adds to the level of safety experienced at our school."
College Junior,5,"Winston-Salem (more specifically Old Salem) has a great overall atmosphere.  Whenever considering the quality of an area's atmosphere, I think it's important to consider options... and there are plenty surrounding Salem College.  There's Old Salem- a historic area which offers rich cultural and historical resources.  There are the surrounding schools, which include Winston Salem State University (within walking distance), UNC School of the Arts, and Wake Forest University (where Salem students are able to cross-list, meaning that we can take courses there if we so please).  Perhaps my favorite option is downtown-- we're within walking distance of downtown WS, and there are tons of really awesome stores, restaurants, and bars (cool once you turn 21).  There's also a small theater downtown (and a free one on campus), and they show two or three movies a night, which is really cool!  All in all, I've grown to love the area, and I'll be sad once its time to graduate and leave.  If you're thinking about Salem, come visit, you'll love it! :)"
College Sophomore,5,"Very good scholarships, but staff can be hard to deal with."
College Junior,5,"I love Salem!  If I had to make this decision again, I would choose Salem and do it without hesitation!  Salem has a very supportive staff and faculty that love to help students find internships and praise them when the excel!  

I had amazing internships and opportunities that I loved and those have helped me get job offers already!  I also love going to chat with my professors about my goals, problems, etc, and I know that they are always here for me!  I also love meeting amazing Alumni and chatting about what it was like when they were at Salem!"
College Junior,5,"THERE ARE NO INDEPENDENT SORORITIES ON OUR CAMPUS!!  Instead, we are ALL Sister of Salem, which adds to the family and community of our campus!  We have traditions just like national sororities like Big/Lil, Wearing letters, Poster Painting, Cooler Painting, and more!  Salem is basically the perfect sorority because everyone is included and made to feel special, everyone finds their niche, and you don't have to pay extra money on top of tuition to be a member!  Gamma Kappa Delta Sister for life!"
College Junior,5,"I love being a student here!  Every school has sucky parts (meatless Mondays, classes in the basement, crazy professors, etc.) but you adjust to what you love.  If I had to rate Salem, I would give her an A+ for being the place that allowed me to find my passion, blossom and grow into a confident lady, and being the common ground for my loving friends!  

We have lots of majors for us to choose from and all the classes we need are provided at least 2 times during our time here, if not every year!  I only know about the Biology Program, so I will talk about that as an example.  Every class we need is provided once a year at a certain time (ie: Bio100, Ecology, and Evolution are ALWAYS in the Fall.  Bio101, Genetics, and Senior Seminar are ALWAYS in the Spring.) that allows us to set up a fairly stable 4 year plan!  The first year classes are HUGE for Salem as they may contain as many as 30 students per class.  By the time you reach your Junior and Senior year, the classes are significantly smaller and more personal.  Despite the large 30 person size, we still have one-on-one access with our professors and can go to our QUEST Tutors for additional help.  All of the Biology Classes are lecture style and the Labs are hands on so we get a bit of both.  Senior Seminar is discussion based and we are expected to give a presentation at the end of our time at Salem.

Our Professors care a lot about us and go out of their way to check on our progress and make sure we are happy and feel like we're achieving our goals along the way!  They don't hold our hands through the process, but they offer support when we need it!"
College Junior,5,"To be a major, all you have to do is declare and maintain a 2.5 in the major.  It is also easy to switch majors.  They don't make us declare a major until our Soph year, so we have plenty of time to try different things, then decide. 

I LOVE being a Biology Major!  My professors are always willing to chat about my goals and they pay a lot of attention to my needs!  Dr. Dunn and Dr. Porter got me several internships that I am forever thankful for!  This major is NOT easy and the professors make you work hard for your grades, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  We even have to take a GRE in Biology before we can graduate...not looking forward to that, but at least I'll have practice for the real test!"
College Junior,5,"Oh my gosh there are so many options!!!

Pizza: Mellow Mushroom, Burk Street Pizza, Chain-options

Mexican: Senor Bravos is within walking distance and yummy!  There are other options too, I just always go there!

Chinese: Buffet down the street, lots of delivery

Japanese: Sushi, Hibachi, Tokyo

Italian: Olive Garden, Cafes, Local Cuisine

Burgers: EVERYWHERE

Coffee: Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, Krankies, Camino, MORE

Those are the major options I can think of, but Winston is a mecca of food options!  I am from a VERY small town, so having more than one burger, mexican, and italian place at my fingertips was AMAZING, but I am still in awe of the number of restaurants...my goal is to try them all before graduation...I have a long way to go.  You do have to drive to get to most food options, but bumming a ride off a friend makes it and adventure that I love!  I have a car and am always willing to lend a ride, especially for food!!  

Disclaimer: I am not vegetarian, pescaterian, vegan, etc...so I am not the best source for those options.  I know a lot of my vegan friends go to Mooney's and Mellow Mushroom."
College Junior,5,"Salem meets 100% of financial need...Imma let that sink in for a moment.  They meet 100% of demonstrated financial need (you get this from the FAFSA).  I also got an amazing scholarship and they have lots of scholarship opportunities if you have the merit!  

Financial aid can take a while to get processed because they do it individually (which I like), but they get it right 98% of the time!  Just keep copies of everything (like you should with any financial transaction) and you'll be fine!"
College Junior,5,"We are DIII, so sports are not a huge deal for us, but we proudly support our student athletes!  For us, you are a student first, then an athlete, so our athletes are high competing just like the rest of the student body and are highly supported by their friends and professors!

If you want to experience the ACC or DI lifestyle, Wake Forest and WSSU give us free and discounted tickets all the time, so you can go enjoy the game and the thrill, then return to your beloved Salem without the ACC Big School Price tag."
College Junior,5,"They pay attention to the rules that they set and enforce them on a strict, yet case by case basis.  If you follow the rules, our administration is very fair.  I am a self-proclaimed goody-2-shoes, so I have never had a violation or issue to deal with, therefore I find them to be very fair and easy to cooperate with.  The ladies that decide to try to sneak in illegal or unapproved items or choose to park in the wrong place, skip class, etc typically complain a lot when they are caught.  I think this is a good thing.  If you break the rules, you have to pay (sorry if that offends anyone).  Occasionally a misunderstanding will occur (ie, the alcohol is my room mates not mine), and those situations are worked out in the best way possible.  

The easiest way to put this is, our administrator care a lot about the well being of the students and enforce rules to protect the safety and sanctity of Salem.  They are fairly transparent in their processes and I am thankful for that."
College Freshman,5,"I love my school! Alumni are always on campus, some didn't want to leave so they got a job on campus (my admissions counselor)  and a lot just come to campus to eat and take pictures with their kids. Salem provides you with plenty of options for after graduation as well like free graduate school test prep and help finding jobs."
College Freshman,5,Campus housing is great the furthest dorm on campus is only a 6 minute walk from every thing.
College Freshman,5,"I haven't had an internship yet, but my school is great for helping find and apply to one."
College Sophomore,5,You take a class and you're in
College Sophomore,5,We are all different and that makes us Awesome
College Sophomore,5,"The financial aid process is easy. Salem provides you with all the forms you need to fill out, and there are people who help you complete the process if you need it."
College Sophomore,5,"Salem College is very close to downtown Winston. You can walk to several restaurants that have a variety of options. Also, there are several places downtown that will bring the food to campus so that students do not have to leave."
College Sophomore,5,"The computers run very fast, and printing is free! There are three computer labs that are always accessible, and the labs have assistants in them if you need help."
College Freshman,5,Public safety is everywhere! you can always find them and they are so helpful and nice!! 
College Freshman,5,"downtown has so many options! mellow mushroom, senor bravo, and tropical smoothie café are my go to places!!! There is a great variety just a few blocks up the way"
College Freshman,5,"Political Science is amazing!! Dr. Foley is awesome and helpful, but very sarcastic. teachers expect a lot out of you so be prepared. they make you into better women and you learn a lot! everyone is required to do at least 1 internship. The classes here are amazing. they help you do a 4 year plan  "
College Freshman,5,Everyone comes from different places.
College Freshman,5,I love everything about my school!
College Freshman,5,"We, the students of the school, makes Salem what it is today."
Sophomore,4,Very small community with sweet and educated girls. The campus is absolutely beautiful and I loved waking up every morning with a fresh cup of coffee to start my day with my scenic walk to classes.
Freshman,4,Salem college is a beautiful all-women school. Full of history and fun facts. Salem offers a wide variety of help and support from administrative staff! People are nice and you get to start your own club in a space of comfort and excitement. You get support also from peers around.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Salem College is one for the books. I have been absolutely ecstatic my entire time here. The academics are wonderful and brilliantly curated. The campus is beautiful and historic and full of tiny woodland creatures that I wish I could befriend. The school is peaceful and the learning environment is one to cherish. As the student body population is not too large, it is very easy to be involved with extra-curricular organizations as well as finding open study spaces. The facilities and resources offered to students are lovely. My only complaints would be the lackluster food offered when you are directed to purchase a meal plan and the outdated and typically dirty freshman dormitories."
Freshman,4,"Lovely campus but it doesn't have inclusion, but they try to have diversity. It offers you to be whom ever you would like to be. The behind the scenes people are lovely and treat you with a due respect. I appreciate everything they offer for me."
Freshman,4,"I love Salem College, I really do but there are a few things I thing they should change. Being a freshman in the dorms, we do not get central ac or heat at all, we just have the ac units in the hallways of the dorms. The wifi sucks, sometimes you cannot get your work done because of it. The faculty is very friendly and resourceful. This is a really good place to be at but the dorms and wifi and some people at the cafe aren't that great."
Alum,4,"Wonderful school, beautiful scenery, understanding professors. If you plan on going, expect all of the above, if you’re a Minority expect support from some classmates and professors. However, administration is bigoted and racist, preferring the silent treatment on POC & LGBTQ issues."
Junior,4,"Salem is a really great school! However there have been issues with student living conditions, and school funding. Things are improving though!"
Niche User,4,"Salem has a beautiful campus and I met a lot of wonderful people there. I had the chance to step out of my shell and be myself. My classes were excellent and fun at the same time. However, it all became a bit too overwhelming for me. All in all, Salem College was a wonderful experience."
Junior,4,"I've enjoyed my time thus far at Salem, I love the classes and the environment. The professors and the students are generally very caring and there is definitely a diverse community at salem."
Senior,4,"Awesome school with a great atmosphere. The smaller size means a more personalized experience, and a closer bonding with fellow classmates and professors. The campus and location are beautiful, adding to the overall experience."
Niche User,4,"Salem College made my daughter feel like she belonged and that she mattered. I never worried about her when she was on campus and I know that if a student misses class, the professors will track them down and find out why. I would recommend this school to any parent looking for a place that will transform your daughter and help her unlock her potential."
Freshman,4,I love the unique classes and caring professors. I love that I am encouraged to be different and have my own individual beliefs. I chose Salem for its liberal arts; the unique environment is perfect for anyone who wants to not only get a professional education but also to grow personally. The all-female atmosphere provides a worry-free classroom experience and feminine support system. It is an excellent place for learning.
Senior,4,I love the investment that teachers have on individual success. The bond that you create with Salem Siblings lasts a life time.
Freshman,4,Salem College is a college that helps empower women and has a faculty of professionals that constantly work with the students. It is a college that I am happy to be a part of and the sense of community is wonderful. I feel right at home.
Freshman,4,"The professors know what they're talking about, and many are very willing to help students who may be struggling. The biggest con would have to be that many of the girls there are extremely critical of anyone who disagrees with them, even to the point of being flat out rude. It's hard to feel accepted when you have a less than liberal opinion."
Freshman,4,"So far, freshman experience is very well going. There is not much to do around campus, but as long as you make friends you will never be alone. But if you do like to be alone sometimes, everyone is incredibly understanding about it. The campus is small and beautiful and you always see your professors around campus and they never mind you coming up to them to ask questions."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes, the friendly nature of the students, and I love Jan term. I would like the approach to scheduling and payment plans to change. You can't register for another term without being up to date on your payments and work study doesn't allow you to work for long enough."
College Freshman,4,"I am extremely happy with my choice to go to Salem. I love it here and until now there is nothing bothering me about the school. My professors are great, the campus is clean and beautiful, I love my room and all the girls I have met here are friendly and open-minded people."
College Sophomore,4,I didn't really have any problems getting my application and acceptance done.
College Junior,4,"Salem has one ""sorority"" and it's called Gamma Kappa Delta. We're pretty much your average sorority with less drama and no brother frat :( We throw formals, have big and little and do coolers. You don't have to be in the sorority to attend our formals either. I wish there was more of the sorority life brought into everyday life at Salem it lacks a little there. The winter formal we throw is awesome! This past year, we rented out a baseball field had great food, picture both and fireworks... like okay Salem."
College Junior,4,"Overall experience, Salem is a great school for an education. Education wise I am very happy and enjoy going to my classes, I do however wish we were a coed school... but you can cross register at Wake Forest and I'm glad we have that opportunity. I wish we had more to do with the other three colleges a few miles away and that there was some kind of theater major and an audition process for the music and dance department. This is also a very liberal school, so if your values fall into the more traditional route be prepared to be judged a little and to stand up for what you believe in. Overall I'm happy here and glad I found Salem."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my time at Salem College has been engaging. I take classes that focus on race and ethnicity and how those concepts alter the way in which society interacts and thinks and changes throughout time. I have enjoyed establishing relationships with upperclassmen and my professors/advisors who are ware of these issues in life and on the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I am extremely happy to attend this College. It has all the things I was looking for in a school. These include: small size, good location from home, major (Interior Design), beautiful campus and great connections. I enjoy spending time here and though there are a few things I would like to change, like the amount of available food options, I know that no campus is going to be 100% perfect. However, this campus is the closest I've gotten."
College Sophomore,4,"The sports department is relatively new, yet the teams typically do well in tournaments. They often come in first, or the top rankings."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the Salem College campus because it is beautiful, inviting and historic. Known for being the oldest Women's college, Salem is a great place to be a part of when looking for a school with great connections and opportunities."
College Junior,4,"Salem is a wonderful community, filled with trust and sisterhood. I would chose it again in a heartbeat. The wonderful one on one time with professors to our traditions such as fall fest, and founders day. Salem college is a unique and empowering institution for women of any background. We are a diverse and accepting campus, with a wide array of people, it is welcoming and unique environment you can't find anywhere else. 

The only real down sides are the difficulties of renovating buildings form the 17 and 18 hundreds to accommodate modern technology and living expectations. That is not to say  the dorms are terrible.... just historic building aren't allowed to renovated with elevators."
College Freshman,4,With the campus being small it is easy to get public safety there if you need them. Public safety does an awesome job. I personally had my own incident with a crazy ex boyfriend and I went right to public safety and ever since then I know that I can go to them for anything and they will take care of it for me.
College Freshman,4,I love the classes and all of the opportunities Salem gives all students. The classes are so small and you really get a one on one experience with the professors.
College Sophomore,4,The campus feels safe other than the threat of the occasional lewd man.
College Sophomore,4,The one-on-one teacher to student is very well. You literally cannot hide in class. Most teachers go above and beyond to help students grow. The general education courses are rather annoying.
College Sophomore,4,There are always job openings and internships being advertised to students.
College Sophomore,4,Overall it is well for being a historical campus. There are lots of bugs and problems with amenities. For money's sake I would expect better response to problems and for the fixtures to last.
College Sophomore,4,"You get what you pay for. The classes can be challenging at times, but the professors make sure you understand before moving on to the next course."
College Sophomore,4,We are all one big sorority.
College Sophomore,4,All the athletic teams and friendly and accepting to incoming freshman and transfers.
College Senior,4,"I am not sure how I will participate in ""life after Salem."". As an older student I was not required to do an internship, but I have talked to other traditional aged students that had great situations in their fields.

Salem College is a very well respected institution in both the United States and globally.  There are jobs posted by Salem staff and faculty frequently and sent to all of the students through email.  There are corporations active on campus doing recruitment many times during each semester and those opportunities are well publicized for students.

The historical significance of Salem cannot be denied.  Teaching women since 1772!  Amazing.The world has/is catching up with the vision of those progressive Moravians!"
College Senior,4,Security takes their jobs very seriously.
College Junior,4,Salem is the type of school you go to and find yourself. If you're looking to party then move right along. Our idea of partying is going to a friend's room and studying. Or if you've got great friends like I did then 3am trips to go get food.
College Junior,4,I enjoy going to Salem. There is a lot of diversity and the academics are great. The only thing that I would enhance is the food.
College Junior,4,Salem College is a wonderful school! It has small class sizes and professors that take direct interest in you. It's a woman's college but you don't even realize it plus all the more it makes you feel even more comfortable with your surroundings. I don't think I would choose another college if I had another choice unless it was an exact replica of Salem just in a different city.
College Sophomore,4,There are many places downtown where students can get good quality food for a decent price. I enjoy Mellow Mushroom (a pizza parlor) and Caminos (a coffe shop and bakery).
College Sophomore,4,"Campus administration truly cares about the safety and well,being of students which is why they emphasize the importance of abiding by the laws and preventing any accidents, injuries or damages to students and the property on campus. They are serious about enforcing the law in conjunction with protecting students and faculty while on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The school has it's ups and downs, like any other school. The value and integrity of the college is phenomenal! Something that I personally do not like is the cleanliness of the bathrooms, although this has more to do with the girls living on that floor. Also, sometimes the food can be very repetitive and not the best at times."
College Junior,4,We are well within walking distance from downtown and have within our reach anything from fast food to more high end; it's really up to us what we choose but we definitely have plenty of options.
College Junior,4,Our Honor Code is a huge part of our campus which gives us the independence and flexibility to do many things. It provides us with accountability and responsibility that we have to face if we fail to adhere to it.
College Junior,4,The financial aid process is very clear cut. The people in charge are approachable if you're having any conflict and are even willing to recommend you to other scholarship options to make sure you receive the most scholarship/ financial aid you can.
College Junior,4,"Going to a party is determined more by your desire to attend than the proximity or availability. Wake has Greek life with plenty of party options. There are several night clubs in downtown Winston Salem and Greensboro, which is within good driving distance, has options as well."
College Junior,4,"The food in the refectory is buffet style and offers items that suit most dietary needs. Even if you don't like the particular theme of the day, you have a choice of a variety of salads, wraps, pizza amongst other things. The new student café is super popular and offers great options such as Camino Bakery desserts and Newk's coffee."
College Junior,4,"Yeah, we'd all love more money, but at the end of the day, that's not what this review is about.  I'm giving our financial aid PROCESS a great review, because (unlike the process at a lot of other institutions) our financial aid faculty are approachable, personable, and kind.  They are able to be businesswomen, but also offer appropriate explanations, give good advice, and are extremely knowledgeable in what they are talking about.  Seriously... I couldn't imagine a better experience."
College Freshman,4,When it comes to financial aid at Salem most students will tell you that it is a hassle. If you have all your information correct it is not.
College Freshman,4,Public Safety at Salem College is very sufficient. You personally get their number and can call them for anything when you're in trouble.
College Junior,4,"We have 2 options for dining, the Refectory (The Rat) and the Student Center Cafe!  The Rat is a part of the meal plan with swipes, and the Cafe requires cash or meal plan dollars (monopoly money if you will).  

The Rat may not be gourmet, but they always have a salad bar, pizza, cereal, and a sandwich station!  The vegetarian station is nice and rotates the menu as does the 'home line'.  They also have a grill section every day with rotating items.  Basically, if you can't find something to eat in there, you're probably being picky (sorry if that offends you).  You may not eat your favorite meal in there, but the food is well made and available when you want it!  I enjoy eating in there!

The Student Center is new and has higher quality items (specialty salads, rice bowls, grilled sandwiches, etc.).  I really like to go there when I have time to chill and eat as it is a more laid back atmosphere where I want to hang out for a while!  

Long story short, the food is good and I have never gone hungry!  Yes, some dishes may be a bit off (fish tacos?) but other people really like those items!  I love the variety and thankfully there are 2 options, so if one is extra packed or having an off day, you can go to the other one!  

Lots of options, little headache, yum!"
College Junior,4,"Our campus, like most, has a few loud voices from each major group, so it is hard to tell what an 'average' student is or what she believes.  Our ladies come from many beliefs, backgrounds, and standpoints that need to be respected and accepted.  As a whole, Salem tries to make students feel at home through various clubs, outreach events, and socials.  Like I said, there is always a loud extremist in a minority, but for the most part, the minorities are well heard and respected.

As a whole, we tend to respect each other's beliefs and feelings.  Occasionally you have a black sheep (it's a phrase, nothing else) pop up and start trouble, but that is usually squashed quickly by an accepting and cooperative spirit.  I was not aware of a lot of thoughts outside those of the majority of my hometown, but Salem really opened my eyes, and I think I am a much more tolerant and accepting person now!"
College Junior,4,"It is required to live on campus all 4 years unless you live with your family in Winston-Salem.  I love living on campus, but I prefer the suite style buildings.  

We have these options: 

Hall Style: Gramley, Babcock, South, Clewell

Suite Style: Bitting, Bahnson

Apartment Style: The Flats, our new building in 2015!  

You are required to live with a roomie, so we fill out a survey to be matched up or you can select a roomie!  Every room has a sink in it...this seems weird to say, but it's AWESOME to not have to leave your room to wash your face.  The Flats are a whopping 5 minute walk from the heart of campus, but all the other buildings are very close to campus and are an easy and short walk!  

As a first year you start out in Clewell with ALL THE FIRST YEARS, so you can adjust together!  It was renovated over the summer and we are all super jealous of the upgrades in flooring, paint, etc.!  After that you use the lottery system to pick your room over the next 3 years.  Sophomore usually complain a lot about this because they want the nicest building (we all do), but they have the highest numbers, so they go last and get what is left after the Seniors and Juniors pick.  I find this very fair!  I had a decent room my Sophomore year and it got better every year after...basically, I paid my dues and it paid off for a great senior room!  

We all get together regularly to watch movies and eat junk food and I love having study buddies right down the hall if I need them!"
College Junior,4,"I love Winston-Salem!  I grew up nearby in a small town, so Winston was the big city to me!  Getting to live here is a dream come true and I hope to get a job in Winston after I graduate so I can stay near my family and alma mater.  I think it is fairly affordable to live here and you can always move in with a fellow sister after you both graduate!  There is a lot to do downtown and the shopping is divine!  I love all the outdoor art Winston-Salem has!  You have to dig a bit to find the good stuff, but those gems are worth it!  I would share, but I don't want a ton of people at my favorite fountain or coffee shop...happy hunting!"
College Junior,4,"Our Public Safety Officers are awesome and are on campus 24/7.  While they do not carry weapons on our campus, I have never seen a need for them to have one!  Salem is in a bubble of safety where fellow sisters look out for each other and stranger danger is taken seriously!  All our guests must be escorted around campus by their hostess and if a guest is found without a hostess, public safety or a Residence Coordinator (Dorm Mom) will approach him and ensure that his intentions are pure!  

I have NEVER felt threatened on this campus no matter how late I arrive back after work, a game, internship, etc.  When there was a need to be concerned (Like my first year when a gas station was robbed 2 miles away), Public Safety alerts the entire campus and will sound the alarm to keep us safe!"
College Sophomore,4,Salem really works hard to get it's students internships that could easily turn into jobs after graduation. We actually have to have one internship to graduate so props to them for that. It's a realtively small college but they do add majors when there's demand. Also! Salem students can take classes at Wake Forest at no cost to them (obviously it's included in tuition but ya know...)
College Sophomore,4,"Since Salem is a private school, they know that most accepted students will need extra help to attend. Also if they want you they will make it known and do everything they possibly can to get you to come."
College Freshman,4,My one and only tip is to get great grades there aren't really any sports schloarships. Though I do believe that everyone gets at least one grant to come to ssalem and it is usually a pretty hefty amount you will still need many more loans and grants unless you just so happen to have 20 to 30 thousand dollars laying around.
College Sophomore,4,"After visiting Salem for a scholarship weekend I received several mailers with more information about the school. Within the pages I saw pictures of women I had actually met and spoken to, who had passion and vitality, and it already felt like home."
Freshman,2,"I'm a current student, and there is so much that I go over the character limit. Please, go visit the Salem Sits Protest Page (or look up #salemsits) to see what's completely going on. The student body is pretty decent and we want to work to get issues solved. Administration is muzzling us. So,e of the issues addressed have been going on for 10+YEARS, and they still refuse to take ownership for them."
Alum,2,"Salem is mostly worried about creating their image and portraying to be this elite institution but yet lacks in basic necessities for students. Dorms don't even have A/C, they are completely outdated & uncomfortable. The tuition/room and board costs are definitely not comprobable to what Salem has to offer. Especially for being a private institution. Do better Salem college. Treat these women fairly and make our money worth it."
College Freshman,2,"Like I stated before, if it was not for the classes and the professors then I would have left a long time ago. I really do hate everything else about Salem though."
College Senior,2,Never felt like I would get into grad school with their help.
College Senior,2,Some good sports but athletes don't hang out with non athletes.
College Sophomore,2,"Not many parties take place on campus and when there are events, it's usually just the students at Salem who attend. As far as clubs and off campus parties, it's usually best to know someone from another campus in order to stay in the loop of such events."
College Sophomore,2,Our health center let a girl walk around with a rock in her knee after she fell. They put a bandaid on it and sent her out.
College Sophomore,2,"THEY NEED TO DO BETTER, maybe they could start by ANSWERING THE PHONE!!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"It's an all women's campus. Most of the females look very manly. As per stereotype, most girls cut their hair very short and begin to dress very homely. Rarely any attractive people on campus at all."
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are incredibly small and we aren't even allowed to have air conditioners, which is ridiculous because it can get extremely hot in the crowded dorm space."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone seems to be either drunk or high around 95% of the time. People are constantly getting busted for underage drinking or drug possession.
College Freshman,2,I have gotten sick a few times. very redundant. the one thing I hate about salem. Some days are great others suck. 
College Freshman,2,There is a shortage in parking spots on campus and the parking areas are a long walk from dorms and class areas.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many options for students without cars.
College Freshman,2,The technology is wonderful but the internet doesn't work all the time.
College Freshman,2,"Sports are highly exclusive, and the facilities are small and confining. Club sports are rarely seen and are not often recognized."
College Freshman,2,"The housing is poor because there is little space, and the rules of hygiene are poorly enforced. Also, the heating system is too hot and the showers also cause burns."
College Sophomore,2,If you don't have a car then you are pretty much stuck on campus. There is a shuttle that runs on Wednesdays and Sundays but it is a bit unreliable because sometimes it doesn't always come on time.Plus it is the only shuttle on campus. It is mainly because Salem is so small.
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene at Salem College really depends on what occassions taken place as well as the people you hang around.
College Freshman,2,"The classrooms are small and i'd say just average. The housing and dining halls are average as well, but its manageable."
Sophomore,1,"My experience at Salem College is what lead me in deciding to transfer schools. The dorm living is riddled with mold, and work orders take forever to be fixed. There are not enough administration so too much work is loaded onto one person. Not the required level of faculty in each major. The school is behind on its equipment. I did not feel as if I had gotten my money's worth from Salem and I am disappointed in how this school treats its students. Enrollment rate is declining and soon enough this school will have to close down. The campus is beautiful since the state pays for it, but where Salem puts its money is not benefiting current students. Every week, students would fall ill with food poisoning from the provided food. Overall, Salem is not a place to go to if you are looking for a college that cares about their student's physical and mental health."
Freshman,1,"The administration at this institution is deplorable. Living conditions: unacceptable. There's food poisoning that leads to hospital visits; there's mold, snakes, rodents, bugs, etc in the dorms; the floor in my room is bowing, no hot water, some faucets have dark water coming out, ineffective and inefficient systems of heating and air, plaster falling from ceilings, floors that can be so hot that they can melt the bottoms of shoes, etc. Programs and degrees at this school that aren't actually feasible (or really exist), INACCURATE information that's used in the museum and by admissions, such as the HISTORY OF SALEM COLLEGE, especially regarding the college's participation in slavery."
Sophomore,1,"Salem will poison you with their food, the mold in the showers and the A/Cs, and then tell you to sit down and shut up because they're ""working on the problems"" and ""thinking about"" policies that have been introduced by the students. There have been multiple, unanswered accounts of racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, and sexual harassment. Administration doesn't care about the students. Go somewhere else for your own health and safety."
Alum,1,"it's amazing how many people review & say salem is a ""close"" environment that's ""warm"" full of opportunities...okay WHERE?? there have been more heinous acts this year alone towards the diverse students. salem does a great job of hiding the phobia that happens DAILY by students AND staff, and telling historical lies to prospective students. as a trans poc i NEVER would've attended a school that was BUILT on the backs on SLAVES THAT STILL HAVENT RECEIVED proper notice! don't attend salem. it's a JOKE. 40k a year to be surrounded by a beautiful campus filled with ignorant people, BUGS (roaches, termites, bed bugs, and MORE), really really REALLY bad food (prepare for food poisoning), constantly fighting the wifi (get an ethernet cord, and CONSTANT racial/lgbtq/religion phobia."
College Freshman,1,"Salem has so many strict rules that it has made my experience here terrible. You would not believe how many things they consider fire hazards that other colleges do not. And we have to have a doctor's note to have an AC unit! We are also not allowed to walk on the grass.... which is completely ridiculous. The social atmosphere is not the best either; most of the girls that go here are stuck up and talk down on you. Salem also makes it hard for you to live off campus. My roommate and I are wanting to get an apartment next year but they are making up all of these reasons to why we can not do so. I am 20 years old but they treat us like we are 10. Everything about living on campus is ridiculous. I hate it, and do not even get me started on the cost of living there. Lets just say if it was not for the small classes and awesome professors then I would have left after the Fall semester."
College Senior,1,Bad location. Dangerous area b
College Senior,1,Terrible. No air in some buildings. Small and tight.
College Senior,1,It doesn't exist. And it should.
College Senior,1,Hate it. Can't imagine a worse experience.
College Sophomore,1,Salem does not allow off-campus housing which is one of the biggest problems in my opinion. Kind of makes me regret coming because i don't want to be stuck on campus all four years although the dorms are nice and very well taken care of.
College Sophomore,1,"Salem students are only allowed to live off-campus if they are commuter students, Fleer students, or are traditional students who have family that lives in the Winston area. Even then, school scholarships are tied to you living on campus."
College Sophomore,1,There are a TON of women on campus that want Greek life. The problem is that Salem doesn't have the cleanest track record when they were apart of campus life so the board is very reluctant to bring them back.
College Sophomore,1,Salem is the school you go to in order to get away from a party scene. I really love it because that means quiet hours are respected (for the most part) and you can choose when you do or don't want to party. Salem is NOT the school for you if you're looking to party every night/every weekend.
College Sophomore,1,"One philosophy professor, only one"
College Sophomore,1,"I'm vegetarian and I have a very difficult time finding decent food to eat. The last couple times I've had the vegetarian dishes, I've found plastic in them."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm transferring. I definitely would not recommend this school to anyone. They lie to you on the phone and only tell you things that you want to hear. Overall, very unwelcoming and very exclusive."
College Sophomore,1,"This campus is extremely intolerant to any student who doesn't fall into the majority of the campus (which is homosexuality). They will harass you and spread rumors that you are intolerant. Despite the other reviews, I've yet to see an actual sense of sisterhood on Salem's campus. Instead, it's teeming with drama."
College Freshman,1,There is no availability of Greek Life on this campus.
College Freshman,1,"The school gave me one impression of how much the year would cost, but when I arrived a much higher cost was applied to my account. We had to adjust family finances in order to struggle through the ordeal and I had to apply for student loans."
College Sophomore,1,"I never paid much attention to any of the athletics. Unless you were a hardcore athlete or sports fan your whole life, Salem athletics, as well as any other college athletics, can be easily passed over."

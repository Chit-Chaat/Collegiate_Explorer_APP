Sophomore,5,"The best part of Morningside is the people. Professors, staff, and students alike make you feel welcome as soon as you walk on campus. It truly feels like a home away from home."
Freshman,5,I learned that they have many different majors and many different clubs and activities to get involved in.
Freshman,5,I love Morningside!  Best cross country and track coaches!  The professors care about their students.
Freshman,5,Morningside College is an amazing college with lots of great opportunities for all students. Morningside is always making sure their students are safe and well educated.
Freshman,5,Morningside is like a second home. They know how to make you feel comfortable and like you belong right away. The classes are not too big so if you need help with something or have a question over something then shouldn't hesitate to ask a professor.
Junior,5,Morningside is a great fit for me because its close to home and offers everything I could ask for. The small campus allows for the opportunity to get to know as many people as you'd like. The president is very involved in the schools activities which is really nice to see. At Morningside it truly is all about your future and taking the steps to be successful.
Niche User,5,I think Morningside has a great atmosphere. I have attended visits to Morningside and it offers many things that ease the nerves. I am a senior in High School and my top choice is Morningside. They are a great school with much to offer. The campus is large and it is visually nice. The people are friendly. The professors that I have had the opportunity to meet were very helpful.
Niche User,5,Excellent Music Education program and teachers.  Teachers are easy to approach and are genuinely interested in helping the student to become the best that they can be.    The theatre department is also amazing.  Wish the music would get big scholarships like the athletic do though.
Freshman,5,The enrollment process was very easy. The staff and people are extremely helpful and friendly. I am overly excited to start classes and meet my professors.
Freshman,5,Morningside is an amazing school! Everyone is very welcoming and all the professors are great. If you attend Morningside it will end in up feeling like your home away from home because you’ll meet people that will be your friends for life.
Niche User,5,"The college visit on their senior day was amazing! My admissions counselor had made my visit made just for me and made sure that I got to do what I wanted to. The class I got to sit in on was eye opening because I got to see college students actually asking questions and one thing that really stood out to me was that the professor went back and went over a section of the lesson that some students were confused on. And that is what I look for in a college, how the professors interact with the students and how the students interact back."
Freshman,5,I love the small campus size and the small class sizes. My professors know me and are more accessible to me when I need help. The campus activities are amazing and always free with my student ID. They treat you like family here and not just like a number.
Niche User,5,"I went to visit Morningside College in the fall of 2017. I was able to tour the campus and obtain more information about the art programs there. I was also able to meet with the soccer coach and the team. Overall my experience visiting Morningside was so great, that it is now my top school choice."
Freshman,5,Morningside College is a very friendly campus.   Everyone is willing to help & see students succeed.  Professors are easy to talk to & class sizes are not to big not to small.  I don't live on campus so I can't give any info about campus living.  There's plenty to do if you want to get involved.
Niche User,5,"Great campus! Everyone was nice there. Food was also really good. ;) When walking around the campus I felt like I was at my home away from home. It didn't feel like you were in Sioux City, Iowa. The dorms were also a decent size and were very nice. The teachers that I talked to were wonderful. Guaranteed a job in your field before or after graduation."
Sophomore,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment I've had here at Morningside. The people are so nice and the professors are very cooperative to get you the help you need in all classes.
Junior,5,"I currently attend Morningside. Because it is a small college, professors get to know their students and advisees on a personal level."
Freshman,5,Very friendly atmosphere and amazing programs! The admissions staff is top notch and always there to make sure you're on the right track for your first year. The campus is gorgeous! The dorms are a decent size (lots bigger than Iowa or Iowa state's). Definitely worth the money and time!
Alum,5,Wonderful online graduate program for teachers.  My education from Morningside transformed my teaching career!
Sophomore,5,"I chose Morningside College for their stellar Music program and they have not disappointed. 
On a more general note, they teachers work with you, and the subjects make sense. Mside also offers many tutoring opportunities, including a writing center where you can workshop your papers with teachers and students in the English department. All of these tools have helped me so much throughout my first year of college."
Sophomore,5,"Morningside is a very friendly college; I personally have made relationships with my professors, which provides a more hands on, helpful experience. The campus is great, and they offer many things to help you; For example, Morningside has a writing center. This is helpful because you can have others look over your paper to help you improve it.  Morningside also offers many ""experiences"" by bringing in past grads, or people from local business to help provide a sense of what they do, which can help one decide if they are interested in that field or not."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so friendly, the professor to class ratio is perfect. They get to know you personally and there are such great tools to help you succeed !"
Niche User,5,"Everyone one of the Faculty members I had met was super excited, helpful, and willing to do anything for me. It was an amazing experience."
Junior,5,"It is a fabulous private college. It is small, which is great for the classes because the professor knows you on a more personal level. They want you to succeed here so they do everything in their power to help you in any way that you need it."
College Senior,5,"The professors on campus truly care about the learning of the students, and want to help in any way possible for all of us to learn and succeed."
College Senior,5,"The only reason I marked some of these as lower is because I personally don't like going outside at night alone on campus, not necessarily because there's any real problem on campus, but because that's just how I am."
College Senior,5,"We have a small school feel with a lot of connections to other places that not only gives a good chance for placement after school, but also helps create new experiences as you continue with learning."
Recent Alumnus,5,"there are quite a few options for housing on campus. for the people that like a smaller community the plex is a good option, for a more social atmosphere Dimmit and Roadman fit the mold. they also offer apartments and also there are 2 houses the College owns. there are residential assistants in each of the dorms as well as the apartments so if you lock yourself out (it will happen to you at least once) there are ways to get in without having to call security"
Recent Alumnus,5,"my 4 years at Morningside College were the best so far. I was involved in many groups on campus and made many friends in my time spent there. The teachers there are easy to get in contact with outside of class and are willing to work with you. My favorite memory was participating in the women's soccer team, my senior year we were the GPAC Conference Champions and we worked hard to get to that point. If I could do it all over again I would still pick Morningside!"
College Freshman,5,"I love going to Morningside. I was able to finally decide what I wanted to do, with the new major that was added this year. My first year adviser put me into very different classes, and this way I was able to choose a major that I really love and am excited about. The career center is extremely helpful in finding internships and jobs after graduation."
College Freshman,5,Love my teachers and the care they put into my schooling.
College Freshman,5,I honestly love it here<3
College Freshman,5,"Everything is amazing, I can't express how awesome the academics are enough! The professors are amazing, the registration process is pretty easy, the workload is manageable, the library is a very awesome place to study, and the study areas are very comfortable! Like I've said before, the academics were a major part in my decision to attend."
College Freshman,5,"Because I am only a freshman, I haven't had a chance to really explore internships, but I have heard about them. I do know that the alumni are very involved and graciously donate money so we can have the campus we have now. The career counselor is very fun to work with and is definitely willing to work with you!"
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about the class sizes! This was one of the reasons I chose to attend Morningside. The professors are so easy to work with and are very willing to help you out. I emailed my professors and went to their offices every time I had a chance, and they were always welcoming. The ratio of students to teachers is 13:1, which is amazing! Morningside encourages students to take a variety of classes, so they provide a lot of different types of courses. I am beyond satisfied with the classroom experience!"
College Freshman,5,"Many students participate in either playing the sport or supporting the team. Everyone cheers on the sports because all of the students are close with one another. Because Morningside is a small school, students who cheer actually know everyone who is playing. The athletic teams are very successful; the cross-country and football teams were amazing this year. The facilities are amazing and extremely friendly to students who don't participate in athletics. The gym is always open and has some very nice equipment that is definitely up to date!"
College Sophomore,5,"All of my professors know my name and know things about me as a person as well as a student. They take the time to get to know all of their students and are always willing to help. The campus is small enough that you get to know people and always see someone you know, but big enough that you do not know everyone. A lot of people are student-athletes and it is a really good way for people to get connected."
College Sophomore,5,"It's the best college! The housing is fantastic, and I love being near so many people."
College Freshman,5,"I love the off-campus dining places that are close to campus; we're close to two malls (one strip, one indoor) and a lot of restaurants surround both places, so we have a great variety here."
College Freshman,5,"I got great help with financial aid, especially coming as late as i did to this college!"
College Freshman,5,Morningside will make sure your schooling is affordable.
College Freshman,5,"We have good teams and good coaches. For football, for every point we win by, we get 1% off on their clothes, with a limit of 30% off."
College Freshman,5,"I feel like most of the boys are respectful of the girl's wishes, at least I haven't seen or heard a problem with it on campus."
College Freshman,5,Sioux City is a pretty solid place to be!
College Freshman,5,No problems with Health and Safety!
College Freshman,5,Its good because of all of the amazing people.
College Freshman,5,One of the best NAIA athletic programs.
College Freshman,5,The professors are very personable and very kind.  Classes are not too hard but definitely keep you busy
College Freshman,5,Best athletics and athletes around!!!
College Freshman,5,This is a top notch college to go to. I feel extremely safe.
College Senior,5,"From what I have heard from my friends is that there is quite the selection of off campus housing. However, the school tries to keep people on campus and does not help AT ALL in helping you look. However, if you find a place with people you like, then it is great!"
College Senior,5,Morningside is expanding their major selection. The advisers are also very interested and involved. The career services department is also second to none. There are also a lot of people able to graduate in three years!
College Senior,5,"We are a very athletic campus. The statistic places over 3/4ths of the campus in a sport. However, as the years progress, like any college sport the retention falls. This is why the athletic atmosphere at Morningside is very energized."
College Senior,5,"Everything you need is fairly close on campus. There is enough room for personal space, but yet people are close enough that social life is easy to become involved. The campus also tries to support getting closer to the people you live with."
College Senior,5,"The main reason why I chose to go to Morningside College was because while they were hosting a golf tournament, I went as part of Iowa Western Community College team and loved the indoor practice Morningside showed us."
College Senior,5,"Security in our campus is big, we always have security around campus, even at night."
College Sophomore,5,"I think the academics at Morningside are great. They offer a lot to students from all different areas. They have special groups for international students, which is nice so they have people to relate to. I also think it's great that Morningside offers study abroad schooling. I think students should be able to have other options to get an education rather than in their home country. The professors are highly skilled in their topics and are always willing to meet with students outside of class hours."
College Sophomore,5,The education program at Morningside is fantastic. All of the professors are highly skilled in the field. They have a set curriculum with requirements for all education students. I think they are highly organized which is beneficial to students who need advice from education professors. They are always willing to help point students in the right direction that will help in their career field.
College Sophomore,5,I would choose my school even if I had to choose schools again because the professors at the school are very personable. They know you and call you by name. Professors are always there when students need assistance when it comes to signing up for the most beneficial classes. It is also nice to know that the professors are some of the biggest supporters.
College Junior,5,"We have great athletes, but I don't attend events"
Sophomore,4,"For the most part, the transition to online classes was very smooth and easy. Academically the switch to online was seamless and the professors were very helpful and were always available to call/video chat/email."
Junior,4,"The professors are well educated and experienced and will help students who are struggling. There are plenty of professors/advisors and other staff that will help answer questions about classes, financial aid, and other things. Professors and advisors often help students build resumes and find internships/jobs. Campus is dead at night and there really isn't greek life. Hard to find parking if you're a commuter. Dorms are small and some need updating."
Freshman,4,I like that it's a small campus which makes it possible for professors to actually care about students.
Freshman,4,I love how you make your own schedule. They are very good about fitting in classes with where you need to be. I also love the environment and how comfortable it is.
Sophomore,4,What I really like about Morningside College is there is always something going on that is cheap or free so you can meet new people and interact in a big setting.
Senior,4,"Morningside has a strong standing in both academics and athletics. In 2018, the Morningside Football Team became NAIA National Champions and were the only undefeated team in the state of Iowa. Morningside also has many opportunities to learn out of the classroom through study abroad and internships. With around 1,300 full-time undergrads, each degree program has a close, family-like atmosphere. The top programs are Nursing, Business, Education, and Bio/Chem. The campus itself is small but beautiful. The city of Sioux City is relatively large, but everything you need is within a 15-minute drive."
Sophomore,4,"Small, Expensive, But overall a great atmosphere to learn and grow in both your academic and personal lives."
Sophomore,4,"Morningside College is a friendly, academic campus. The staff and facility are welcoming and friendly. With the campus being small, students can get lots of help for professors and tutors. This campus is great for students who really want to focus on their studies and be challenged."
Senior,4,The financial aid help at this college is laughable. It seems like some departments do not want to see you succeed. I have stayed because my classmates are amazing people and the sports teams are like no other.
Junior,4,My experiences here are ones I would never trade. There is a very close connection with professors and everyone truly wants you to succeed. The campus is beautiful and everyone is kind.
Junior,4,I enjoy Morningside a lot. It all depends on how you feel on campus. I felt at home and I still feel that way after two years here.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman here at Morningside College and I can honestly say that professors will go out of their way to help you in any way and will reach out to you if asked. The campus is also beautiful and our athletic teams always perform well.
Junior,4,"Morningside college is a great private school. The class sizes are small and very teacher to student oriented. The teachers and staff at Morningside College actually care about you and your future. They are willing to do what it takes to get you on the right path; they will work with you! One thing I would like to see change on Morningside's campus is the outside activity in the fall and spring. Morningside has a beautiful campus and there is always students walking around. However, I would love to see more activities outside and involvement. Perhaps this could be done through groups and organizations on campus!"
College Senior,4,"Sometimes it gets a little much for workload, but we can't expect all professors to talk amongst each other regularly to see how heavy the workload is for one student in one class in one week."
College Senior,4,"There are a few people who aren't very tolerant, as there are everywhere."
College Senior,4,This school does everything it can to ensure that you leave campus at the end of your senior year with a job. The only reason I might not be able to get a job is because the school is perhaps too small for some companies. Hopefully that will be remedied by the excellence of my degree here.
College Senior,4,"There are still some rooms in buildings that don't have air conditioning-- not a big deal in winter, but when the days are still up in the 90s, it can be a little disconcerting. Other than that, the apartment option on campus doesn't have a full kitchen: no oven is provided or allowed, and sometimes the maintenance orders take weeks to fill, though that might be more due to the fact there aren't enough people working there."
College Senior,4,They're awesome for the outdoor times of year.
College Sophomore,4,"Only been there for a year, but so far it is great!"
College Sophomore,4,"Due to being a liberal college, students are required to complete distribution requirements, which are achieved by taking certain classes. The class sizes aren't too big. I graduated high school with a class of thirty, and my biggest class at Morningside has been 32. The professors enjoy having conversations and most really do care about the students succeeding."
College Sophomore,4,"Dimmitt dorm is really nice, and newly renovated. The only problem is dimmitt, I think, is the farthest housing. Also, it's pretty expensive.."
College Sophomore,4,"Emails are always being sent out about when the next sporting event is, and how well the sports are doing."
College Sophomore,4,"It's not a very cheap school, but campus is beautiful, the people are very friendly, and a lot of activities go on."
College Freshman,4,So far I haven't had any issues with any of my classes. They have all been a good balance of difficulty and easiness.
College Freshman,4,"I have never been very excited to watch athletics, but coming to Morningside has made me realize how much I love watching men's Volleyball!"
College Freshman,4,"So far my school has been great. I love all of the professors in my department. Because I am a Trustee Scholar, I had the opportunity to take a topics course called ""Philosophy of the Undead,"" where we got to take basic philosophical topics and discuss them in the context of a zombie apocalypse. That class was fun yet challenging, and I met many of my friends in this class."
Recent Alumnus,4,"in my time at Morningside I generally felt safe. the only security issues were that on a few occasions people's cars were getting broken into, when that was happening campus security was on the lookout and the sioux city police as well. overall i never had to question my safety there."
Recent Alumnus,4,the teams at Morningside College are very competitive. We offer a lot of sports to participate in so just about everybody that wants to get involved can. the fan support and school spirit are wonderful our stands are usually filled at the sporting events with students and the surrounding community. the facilities could use some updates but they work for what we need them for.
College Junior,4,I feel perfectly safe walking alone across campus.
College Junior,4,"Everyone usually makes friends if you're tolerant and friendly, though you make more the more you're involved."
College Junior,4,"Campus is safe, small, but there's just so many hills it tires you out regardless."
College Junior,4,"There are not a lot of Greek groups, and they aren't a huge deal whether you join or not."
College Junior,4,"Sports are a major aspect of campus life, and football games are major occasions."
College Junior,4,It's a small close-knit campus but tolerance for minority groups is hard to find.
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt unsafe at this campus. There are plenty of resources in place in case anyone should ever feel uncomfortable walking alone, or walking in the dark."
College Freshman,4,"The career center here is very helpful in informing us of all the different career paths we can take with our majors, and they let us know when internships or jobs become available. A degree from here says a lot. This is a great college and people with degrees from here are taken very seriously."
College Freshman,4,I love the fact that my class size is small. It really helps me focus in class and not afraid to speak out. All of the professors that I have had so far have been very helpful when I needed help and I like that we do not do the same thing every day in class. The professors switch things up so classes are never boring. There are also a wide variety of classes that are available. I like that we have those classes that are just for fun.
College Freshman,4,"I really like the campus housing here, Dimmitt is such a nice building and so big, it has really made me feel at home."
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate in sports personally, but all of the sports teams here are very good. Morningside does a great job and recruiting the best possible students."
College Junior,4,I will get to choose with the assistance of my college where best to do my internship
College Junior,4,I will get to choose with the assistance of my college where best to do my internship
College Freshman,4,I feel safe and sound.
College Freshman,4,The housing is very good.
College Freshman,4,Campus security is available and helps keep you feel safer at night. They give rides if you don't feel comfortable walking in the dark alone.
College Freshman,4,People that have graduated say that college prepared them for their jobs.
College Freshman,4,I like the one on one attention from the professors. Advisors get to know you and help find things that fit what you want.
College Freshman,4,People are encouraged to go to sporting events and the bleachers are usually full.
College Freshman,4,Advisors are helpful and professors care about student success.
College Freshman,4,I work campus security so I know all the ins and outs and Bret Lyon does everything in his power to make campus safe. He's seriously an awesome person and boss.
College Freshman,4,The staff definitely do everything to get you ready for a job in your field and help you get there.
College Freshman,4,"This school is amazing and I am so happy I chose this school! The professors are amazing and even the President of the college is so welcoming! I wouldn't change this school in any way but the cafeteria food. Morningside is so unique because of the many resources that this school provides; there are tutors for every subject available every day, a writing center that is available every day, and the professors have an open-door policy. The activities committee plans extremely fun events that range from comedians or stunt performers to politicians. I am very happy with Morningside, and I feel I made the right decision for my future."
College Freshman,4,"It's like a family, everyone cares for each other and it a loving environment. I have become involved in so much, student gov and work study are just a few. The professors are the best, so caring and make sure that a student is understand the material. Everyone is so friendly and I would defiantly make the choice of Morningside again!"
College Freshman,4,A lot of the parties that I end up going to are ones with friends and not a lot of big parties. Most of them happen at houses of people who live off-campus.
College Freshman,4,There are no complaints that I have or that I have heard from any of my friends.
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid went smoothly and I have no complaints about it. I would have wished I was able to receive more, but a lot of it is hard to come by from the school other than the packages that they have."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is really good and you are able to get around the campus pretty quick, and if you have friends that live in other dorms, you are not far away at all. There are a few things that I believe are not up to par, but I feel like I am welcomed there."
College Sophomore,4,I don't see a problem
College Sophomore,4,A lot of hands on application
College Freshman,4,"The campus is quite beautiful, but the housing dorm i am living in is a bit, how do i say, out of date? It has its perks, but some improvements could be made."
College Freshman,4,It has been great so far. I would definitely choose Morningside again. Small campus and very caring professors.
College Freshman,2,"I don't think I am going to stay here another year, I wish I would have done more research when I was deciding colleges because I probably wouldn't have picked Morningside."
College Freshman,2,"White Rich Kids – There is a variety of races, I don't think there's much religious diversity. The school is Methodist affiliated so that's sort of expected, but the only kids that are of any other race than white are typically associated with Morningside's SHADE program."
College Junior,2,"During the day, parking is ok. There are lots where overnight parking isn't allowed so you need to move your car before 10 pm. Parking around the dorms isn't great either."
Sophomore,1,This is PERFECT for when you don’t want to do anything with your life. Can’t wait to see all the graduates stay in the same area making a low income.
College Freshman,1,I hate the campus food.
College Freshman,1,"The school does not help you with applying for finical help. They think as if everyone knows what to do already so why waste their breath. It is very frustrating. I am the first one for 12 generations to go to college, therefore I had no clue what I was doing. The school did not help one bit at helping me know what to do, how to get financial help, etc."
College Sophomore,1,The greek life is a joke. They are mostly nerds and weirdos
College Senior,1,"As a math major at Morningside, I would do it over, somewhere else. They have caused me many headaches because they decided to change the math program there.  I plan on becoming a math teacher and graduating in three years. I hope I can find a job in my field right after graduation because I will have all of my loans to start paying off. I have heard of a few students that have had a problem finding teaching jobs in Sioux City so I am slightly concerned about that."
College Senior,1,There really isn't anything special it is a college that has a few activities on occasion.
College Senior,1,If you live on campus you don't need transportation unless you need something - especially on the weekend because nothing on campus is open on the weekend. If you commute good luck parking.
College Junior,1,"If you live in the on-campus apartments, there are close to 20 parking spots in front of the complex, otherwise you have to park half a mile away and those ""closer"" areas aren't always all that accessible either."
College Junior,1,"Food for Your Buck – The food service is excellent, but the food itself is not. The menus are very repetitive from week to week. Frequently, come Fridays the menus consist of leftovers yet the meal still cost over $8. That is ridiculous. Additionally, there is a sack lunch option of which the sandwiches are nasty!!! Yet again these sack lunches cost the same as a regular meal in the cafe without the options or quality. The food served definitely needs help!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Residence Halls – The residence halls are outdated and old. Especially the ""Plex"" is needs serious work. The bathroom stalls and showers do not look clean. Overall that residence looks dead."
College Freshman,1,"Advisors Aren't So Helpful! I am in the nursing program here, and not everyone is on the same page, when going to sign up for classes I got told two different things. It ended up screwing me over for getting into a class I needed to take in my first year."

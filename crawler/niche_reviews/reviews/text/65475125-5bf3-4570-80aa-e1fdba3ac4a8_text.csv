Sophomore,5,"UC is amazing. I’ve made so many friends and so many great memories. I feel at home on campus, which is huge considering I moved to Cincinnati from a very small town."
Sophomore,5,"Online learning as a fine arts student in UC DAAP has obviously been a difficult thing to get used to, but my professors and advisor have helped me so much in figuring out how to face these changes. It isn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but I still wish we were in person for critiques and such."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love The University of Cincinnati. The school provides you with all of the resources that you will ever need to be successful in college. The professors are very understanding and helpful and do a great job helping you learn the material. It is such a great place to be at if you love life in the city as it is located very close to downtown. Make sure you at least visit it because it is absolutely beautiful and shouldn't be passed up on!

Freshman,5,"I take several classes online, and the professors make it very easy. The expectations are clearly written out for you, and it's easy to contact your professors if you have questions or need assistance."
Sophomore,5,With online learning it has been different. However it is very easy to understand the due dates. You have to be a little more motivated to get everything done but it is easy to get done and still work. I am able to still work and do classes on my time.
Sophomore,5,Great Atmosphere and Excellent in terms of resources available for students to expand their knowledge!
Sophomore,5,Took a couple of online courses and the professors did a fantastic job! They were available to help in any way that was needed.

I personally love the surrounding city area and the apartment building that I currently live in."
Junior,5,"depending on the professor the class would be fairly easy to navigate, flexible schedule. It makes working a lot easier while being in school"
Sophomore,5,Online classes were very easy and the professors communicate very well with you still. The courses online are very easy to navigate and turn things in.
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman to the University of Cincinnati, my experience with online classes has already been good. It's a little less than a month before the first day of classes and I've already had professors reach out to me in regards to their class and what they plan to do."
Freshman,5,"As I'm starting my first year with the University of Cincinnati, so far I have loved their communication! It is a scary and confusing time we currently living in due to COVID-19, and I feel as if the University of Cincinnati has handled that very well. They have been open with incoming freshman about the new changes and the challenges we are most likely to face."

Senior,5,Classes online are easy! A lot of professors struggle a little bit though with making things easily understandable for assignments but work is easy

Sophomore,5,"I loved my first year experience at the University of Cincinnati! I was in the college of DAAP- Design, Art, Architecture and Planning and although the whole University is quite large, being in this college was very comfortable and easy to transition into. My classes were quite rigorous, but were very rewarding and taught me many skills necessary for my future career path. I quickly made many close friends and was very comfortable on campus! The area around Cincinnati is not the safest, you do have to be careful and aware, but as long as I stayed on campus I felt quite safe. Cincinnati does have some very fun areas as well to explore and hang out in, such as Over-the Rhine. The main reason I chose Cincinnati was the co-op opportunity. In my major I have 5 built in co-ops where I will gain real life experience as well as get paid. Co-ops ensure rich learning experiences as well as the chance to have a job lined up after college."
Sophomore,5,University of Cincinnati is such an amazing university to where they are always making everyone feel comfortable and accepted for who they are. They give you all the support you need to anyone's goal of who they want to become once they gradute.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and the atmosphere. You can tell that the professor’s really care about the success of their students. Everyone goes above and beyond to help those in need, especially the academic advisors that are present. I would definitely recommend a friend or family member to go here if they were searching for a college to go to."
Junior,5,I personally love the resources that are provided at the campus.  I would have definitely struggled in calculus without the math lab.  All the professors have helped me strive towards success.  Beautiful campus and friendly environment!
Freshman,5,I love the people and the community. I feel welcomed wherever I go downtown. The social environment is awesome! Gameday's are the absolute best.
Freshman,5,I like the large campus that offered many opportunities to the students. The staff is very  friendly and very helpful. The smoke free campus is very easy to study on. There’s even a helpful math lab to help people like me who isn’t that good at math.
Junior,5,UC has been an awesome school to attend. The campus life is phenomenal. We have many amazing facilities that offer students and faculty a great experience while being on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I just started here after transferring from University of Kentucky, and I have to say that I love being at UC. It feels like home. The environment is welcoming, the teachers are friendly and helpful, and the people here are overall great. I love it here!"
Freshman,5,"Being a student at such a large University can be overwhelming but UC has so many opportunities to make it feel like home! Campus is so diverse, with more modern and more traditional buildings/scenery. There are endless clubs and organizations to become a part of, and you really get out what you put in to your experience."
Freshman,5,I am currently transferring to the University of Cincinnati from Eastern Kentucky University. I have had a very easy and helpful time applying and enrolling in the University of Cincinnati.

Senior,5,"It was a great experience, and I am coming back for my graduate degree. Currently I am a senior student athlete in the Women's Golf Team.  I love the University of Cincinnati, it is a great school with amazing student life."
Niche User,5,UC is an excellent school that motivates and encourages its students to success. UC offers more than 300 different majors and over 100 certificate programs. They even have a special program where you can create your own major as long as it follows specific guidelines. The University's main campus has a wide variety of clubs and interest programs ranging from medical exploration to ultimate Frisbee. This institution is absolutely a return on the investment of your future. I completely recommend the University of Cincinnati.
Sophomore,5,"Professors are amazing! All of my professors care that I successfully graduate. The University has so many resources that help students be successful. Going here is amazing, I learn something new and useful daily. I transferred from another school in Ohio that was the opposite of UC. The professors there seemed useless and that they were just there for a paycheck. I'm glad to see not every college is like that."
Niche User,5,Cincinnati was a great choice to finish my bachelor degree. I was able to gain the knowledge and confidence to advance my career and meet my professional goals.
Junior,5,"The University of Cincinnati is a diverse college with great programs, facilities, and extracurriculars. At the College-Conservatory of Music, I get a focused yet well-rounded education in all things Commercial Music Production, from composition, production, arranging, engineering, songwriting, and film scoring. The program has been exactly what I've been looking for to better myself and prepare me for my professional career goals."
Sophomore,5,UC is the perfect college for someone who wants to feel like they're in the city without being overwhelmed about actually having to navigate a huge city. The campus is always bustling but there are always places to get away from the excitement. College life has many things to offer to keep you busy when you're not completing assignments. The campus is compact if you're not interested in long walks to class or riding a bus. Everyone on campus is friendly and willing to help with any questions you may have. Campus is inclusive and is a safe space to be yourself and a place where you will meet your best friends.
Freshman,5,"I personally love the University of Cincinnati! The area around the campus is great, I love walking around and seeing all the restaurants and people!"

Niche User,5,The campus is amazing and I feel incredibly welcomed there. I hope to attend in the fall. It is undoubtedly my first choice with its excellent programs.
Sophomore,5,"Great school, especially for engineering. The Coop program is unmatched by any other school. Working and getting paid during your college career is a great way to earn experience and have money to put towards paying for school."
Sophomore,5,The University of Cincinnati has created a welcoming and vibrant environment. It holds great professors who truly want to see the best for you and will help push you in the right direction.
Freshman,5,"I really love the University of Cincinnati for a lot of different reasons. First of all, I love the campus life and all the activities and opportunities they give you in order to feel apart of the UC family. Second, I really enjoy watching all the sporting events. Our teams here at UC are very talented. Although UC has a very big class size average, all the teachers put in their best effort to make you feel as if they care about what is going on in your life academically and non-academically. Lastly, my favorite thing about UC is that we are able to walk onto our football field a majority of the week until the football team is ready. These are just a few reasons why I love the University of Cincinnati."
Junior,5,"UC has so many opportunities in all the areas you could imagine. They have a wide variety of majors and minors, have amazing campus amenities and facilities, great professors, great sports, and lots of work opportunities and career support. The cost of attending is lower than some big name colleges that offer less than UC does. It's so worth it to go here, for more than just the education."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the surrounding area of UC as there are many things to do in downtown Cincinnati. I am a nursing student so I particularly enjoy UC's medical campus.
Senior,5,"Great communication with online students. They really ensure that you feel supported, no matter where you live. They want you to feel like you are prepared and part of the community not only academically, but also socially."
Sophomore,5,The University of Cincinnati is an amazing college university. Their campus is large enough to walk around but small enough to know where everything is. UC is very good at communicating with their students and has a lot of involvement. The teachers and the community as a whole is supportive and encouraging the best out of everyone.
Junior,5,I love almost everything about the University of Cincinnati! The environment is positive and friendly. The professors are dedicated and really want their students to learn. This is an excellent school to attend.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to school at the University of Cincinnati. It is a huge school fit into a small campus. The academics and professors are great. Every professor that I have had genuinely cares about me and my success in the course. On top of that, there are plenty of resources for internships, co-ops, and jobs after graduation. Every academic advisor and faculty members cares about success. Also, the sports are great. Going to football and basketball games to cheer on the Bearcats is one of my favorite activities to do."
Junior,5,The University of Cincinnati offers one of the most unique experiences a college student can have through its large and diverse student population as well as its location right next to downtown Cincinnati. The only thing I don't agree is the seemingly-endless amount of money they spend on the athletics department.
Junior,5,The university of Cincinnati is an educational institution filled with the finest and most caring professors. At the university of Cincinnati you will be given the best education while being surrounded by amazing resources.
Freshman,5,"The University of Cincinnati was my dream college, and now that I’ve finished my first semester at my dream school; I’m even more in love with the university than before. The campus is beautiful, the professors are great, and there are so many opportunities around campus for students. Also, the nightlife is great at UC, as long as you know the right people."
Freshman,5,"The University of Cincinnati has amazing academic programs.  I am honored to be part of DAAP (School of Design, Art, Architecture and planning).  DAAP has challengeD me to be a better person and a better artist.  The professors are very helpful and true. They have pushed me to bring the best of me out in my work.  
There is something for everyone on campus. Being involved in many activities has helped make my time at UC even better.  
I feel UC has a very safe campus, if the need arises there are many programs in place for the safety of students. Being a bearcat is such an honor!"
Freshman,5,University of Cincinnati is a great place to study. I have never felt so much freedom of choice as I have there. I am done with the first semester and looking forward to starting the second!
Junior,5,I love the programs the school has to offer. They work a lot with CO-OP and getting you right into the workforce.
Freshman,5,I have loved the environment and all the support everyone shows. As I walk the campus it feels so homey and now with on the green the food is a lot better.
Freshman,5,Cincinnati wasn't my top choice college but I am really glad I ended up here. The people are friendly and the campus is clean. The classes are interesting but also challenging and the professors are helpful.
Senior,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and there is so much to do close to the school. Many of the professors are excellent and the courses are interesting and challenging.
Sophomore,4,I believe that there is more that the university as a whole could have done for the students than they did but the individual professors are mostly very accommodating. Most of them understand the struggle that comes with online learning and they help you the best that they can.
Sophomore,4,I love that the University of Cincinnati is such a small campus with a large amount of students. It is very easy to get around and make it to classes on time. Even with a large amount of students it is still possible to make friends and a relationship with professors as long as you reach out and make an effort.
Freshman,4,"The University is very serious about student health and safety, it includes many services for its students, and the option also to go online or hybrid also helps in these times. There are a lot of places to visit on campus and is easy to find where to go. It is also very easy to join a club since there are hundreds of diverse groups of people. You can make friends easier."
Sophomore,4,I took some online courses and my teachers made it very easy to get my work on time and if i had any problems I could easily contact them.
Junior,4,"There are some very good professors at UC but there are also a good amount who clearly do not care about the student. I love the Black culture there, if you go to the AACRC you know everybody, UC is not as diverse as they claim to be but are getting there."
Sophomore,4,I think UC has very good professors that are very helpful. They did a very  good job at transferring classes all online in the middle of the semester
Senior,4,"The University of Cincinnati has great professors. From design to international relations, you are sure to find some accomplished people."
Senior,4,"My online experience at UC during the ending months of March (due to COVID), was quite exceptional. Teachers were understanding and tried their very best to make all learning material accessible."
Freshman,4,Online classes are available and the platforms are easy to access. The teachers are very accesible and always willing to work with you in case you need some extra help.
Freshman,4,"Very good environment . Their co op program is one of the best.
The neighborhood is very walkable and lots of public transportation."
Niche User,4,The school has excellent programs and faculty who care about heir subject and their students. The campus is nice.
Sophomore,4,Amazing campus with so many opportunities to try new and exciting things. Also having and excellent program of studies.
Alum,4,"I really liked my program at UC - the medical sciences program. It was nice because it was small, so I felt like I got to know the professors and my fellow students better because of that. We were taught by some great professors who taught in the medical school, and there was so many interesting and fun classes to take."
Sophomore,4,The online classes need work in order to revise kinks and be more suitable for student and be flexible to different needs. Teachers are very attentive but need to work out some problems with the online system.
Freshman,4,I did not personally take online classes with the University of Cincinnati but I did hear that they were just fine and not too too different than the in person lectures.
Junior,4,I have taken a few classes online at UC.  My experience with online classes is that it is definitely more independent learning and less structured when it comes to deadlines so the professors really put it on you to keep up with your work.  From what I've seen most professors for online classes are very good about responding to students questions and answering quickly.  The professors at UC are very dedicated to their jobs and want their students to succeed.
Junior,4,"My overall rating for the University of Cincinnati is a strong 4 stars.  Being in the city the location is great for getting internships, co-ops, and ultimately a steady job after college.  There are loads of restaurants to go to just minutes off campus, and if you ever  feel like you need to get away from the UC life, Downtown Cincinnati is only about a 15 minute drive away.  
	If I could change one thing about the University of Cincinnati it would be the dining halls.  There are four dining halls on campus, however they all serve just about the same things with little variation in the meals day-to-day.  There isn’t a whole lot of healthy food options either.  Another downside to UC’s dining halls is that only one of the dining halls offers to-go boxes.  Overall, UC is a great school and has a lot to offer students.  Picking to attend the University of Cincinnati was the best decision I’ve ever made!"
Sophomore,4,"Since the pandemic with COVID-19, all classes were moved to online for the rest of the spring semester and summer semester. I think that my professors did a really good job at the transition and still making sure that everyone understood the content that we needed to know for finals."
Senior,4,Quality education at a reasonable price. Amazing campus life and sports with really supportive professors and staff. Internship and co-op opportunities are endless. The location is close to downtown Cincinnati is a plus but Clifton can be sketchy at times but just be smart and aware of your surroundings.
Freshman,4,The university was very helpful in helping me return to school after a couple years off and my advisor was a real advocate for my return to the college of my choice!
Freshman,4,"I love the area and the environment of the school. However, at some sporting events school spirt was lacking. I miss being on campus everyday and wish I could relive those moments."
Freshman,4,"Going online was a struggle, as it was for everyone. However, my professors made it to be an essay transition. I was able to finish my online classes successfully and I got the grades I thought I deserved."
Freshman,4,"While my professors did do everything they could to help us learn the material, I found the online courses to be extremely challenging. Not because of the course content but mainly because of the increased workload and the lack of physical interaction with the professors during lecture time to help with any underlying questions ya students may have had. Overall it was still great other than the previously mentioned challenges it served as for me."
Freshman,4,"My experience with the University of Cincinnati has been amazing. The school has been very great to me during the Covid-19 crisis. They have been keeping me up to date on everything that is happening, and letting me know what I need to do to make my introduction into college as easy as it can be. Not only is the University of Cincinnati a great college, but the city of Cincinnati is a plus. The administration at Cincinnati have been very helpful along my journey to be a bear cat. They are always quick to reply to an email or phone call. They always have an answer to my questions, and are very patient with me even when I can be annoying. They are going to make the next four years of my life and easy, and exciting as possible."
Freshman,4,The University of Cincinnati is a great place for someone looking for the big campus feel but also the city life.
Junior,4,UC is a great school overall. It has a lot of opportunities to offer on and around campus. There is always something to do on campus and an organization for everyone to join. There are always great events held that all students can attend. The campus is not too big so navigating around it is easier. The hills around campus maybe be hard to walk on at first but makes for a great exercise after getting used to them.
Junior,4,"My experience at the University of Cincinnati overall has been a good one. I have had my ups and downs throughout my collegiate career there, but I still enjoy attending. At times I do feel that I wish I a little more guidance from faculty to help me through my journey as I receive my degree. However, I do enjoy the atmosphere and city life feel that the University provides."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the environment and experience of being at the University of Cincinnati. The location is great and allows for a close to home college experience. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to eat on and within walking distance of campus. The only thing I would change is the extra costs outside of tuition. Parking passes and other general fees can add up quickly. I have lived at home while attending the University of Cincinnati because the dorms are just too expensive.
Freshman,4,The University of Cincinnati has a very small campus with a large student base and a great amount of diversity. There are so many new experiences to be had and very many educational and career opportunities available.
Alum,4,"The campus life is amazing, so many things to do and great people who are willing to help you. The student body is fun and it is easy to find people who like the things that you like."
Niche User,4,"Overall, I'd say, the university is a great college. It is neither too big or small. Having a wide array of classes to fit most, if not all, your needs. I work while attending classes, so I cant comment to much on the, ""party"" seen. My friends seem to have a great time and I do get to participate, on occasion. I love the sports (games) there's a real sense of community surrounding it. I would highly suggest the University of Cincinnati to be added to anyone's college search."
Sophomore,4,"I took online classes, and while some of them were good, I feel like others were marginally instructed. Some professors cannot seem to figure out the technology. Overall, however, I loved quite a few of my classes, and the professors respond pretty quickly to emails."
Niche User,4,"I am enrolled at UC Clermont CCP program.  Although this campus is small, its big in academics. The smaller campus allows for smaller class sizes with a more one on one experience."
Sophomore,4,Great resources to use for anythings. Everyone is super friendly and work with me to try and find the most beneficial options towards my future college experience and career.
Niche User,4,I plan on attending in the fall. When I visited campus the students were very welcoming and answered any questions I had.
Junior,4,Online bachelors degree is pretty basic. University is nice. Food and public transportation is close by. I plan on applying for the doctorate of anesthesia program at UC.
Freshman,4,"The professors are great and so is the supporting staff (Advisors/TAs). There is always something to do which keeps me very busy with school work and friends/clubs. I do not live far either so it is a great way to get away if I need to, but also I can go home if needed. This is also a great college for internships and Co-ops because of the business environment Cincinnati provides"
Freshman,4,"Great teacher, small classes. Lots of programs in place to help students improve in classes including free tutoring services."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the faculty and staff, the professors all want to see you succeed and are very helpful. All first years are required to sign up in a Learning Community which is a great way to make friends and provides guidance from the LC's peer leader (an older student who can provide a perspective that professor's typically can't)."
Sophomore,4,UC is a great college that offers a lot of unique and interesting courses. They seem very dedicated to giving each student the most information about the variety of degree choices.
Senior,4,"The university is centrally  located and offers mostly modern renovated classrooms and laboratories.  Parking is a problem and somewhat expensive. Overall, a good university with competent instructors."
Sophomore,4,"I love attending University of Cincinnati! Because it's located in the middle of the city, I never feel stuck and love how there are plenty of places to go when I have free time. Cincinnati is a beautiful place to live and is easy to get around. The campus is very convenient, and their colleges and opportunities couldn't be passed up."
Freshman,4,"So far I would have to say I believe the University of Cincinnati is a very good choice for me. I chose this school mainly for the COOP program, but now I see there are also many other great aspects of this university. Although it is a great campus one thing I would like to see change would probably be transportation for the disabled students on campus. I see so many disabled students walking around on campus when it seems challenging and difficult for them."
Freshman,4,"The university of Cincinnati is your average state school, the food in mediocre, and the dorms scene is questionable. However, academically I feel the university offers many alleyways for students to be successful, and have enjoyed my time at this institution."
Freshman,4,"I am really enjoying my time here at the University of Cincinnati. The campus itself has a very modern feel to it, with lots of interesting architecture. All of my professors have been very intuitive and helpful, and seem to be experts on their given topics. I have been able to make many connections here at UC and there are plenty of ways to become involved on campus."
Freshman,4,"I'm part of CCM at University of Cincinnati, and while it's overall been good, there are things that could improve. CCM could always use more funding. All the sports teams have tons of funding, but the arts here? Not so much, which is unfortunate because we are nationally ranked and bring in a lot of money. But I'm very lucky to be here because I know lots of other students aren't as well off as CCM. The people here to have been pretty nice overall, so it's a solid school for sure."
Freshman,4,The academics offered at UC are exceptional. The Lindner Fast Track program is great and I feel as though I am getting real world experience only as a freshman. There are a lot of resources on campus that are easy to utilize and helpful to use. The career services are phenomenal and useful. Students actually get the feeling that they have someone who is always there for them in the sense of academics and future in career. The food is not fantastic and the meal plans are not great.
Freshman,4,The application process was easy.  The response is good when contacting them for information.  There are lots of opportunities to visit the campus prior to beginning.
Freshman,4,The school has a lot of opportunities for academics. Professors are a hit or miss. A lot of new buildings
Freshman,4,"I have lived in Cincinnati my whole life and I like the city. The school is famous for its co-op program, which I have already started to look into as a freshman. There are lots of possibilities for students, lots of organizations to get involved with."
Freshman,4,UC is a very great community that offers tons of resources for students to be successful both in and out of the classroom.
Freshman,4,"I like being in the best of both worlds at UC - I'm one of tens of thousands of students at an enormous university, but as a CCM student, I'm also part of a smaller, close community."
Freshman,4,I loved most of my professors this first year and the energy in campus. I would say the only changes are the constant construction and safety issues.
Junior,4,"Although I switched majors, Uc is such a great choice because the people there are so nice and I love the environment that the University provides."
Junior,4,"I am so happy I enrolled at UC! The campus life is a perfect balance of traditional students, commuter students, and non-traditional students. There is a corner of campus for everyone. I live in the residence halls as an RA and love all of the different on campus living situations. The gym is also fantastic. Sometimes the food is not as good as I'd like (I am vegetarian), and there were a lot of health violations found in dining halls this year. My major, Medical Sciences, has set me up perfectly for a pre-health pathway, with a rigorous course load, shadowing opportunities, and great mentorship. I am also very happy financially because I was eligible for in-state tuition!"
Freshman,4,I love attending the University of Cincinnati! The professors are great and genuinely care about there students well being. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate.
Freshman,4,I think one thing that could definitely be worked on is their dining. The overall health and safety within the dining courts are not as to par as they should.
Freshman,4,"Cincinnati is a great place to be with a great school. They are always on top of things, the food is great, and the learning is even better. I appreciate all the help the professors have given me at UC."
Freshman,4,I'm currently honing in to what I want to study and developing skills that will help me in my career field. I am involved on campus and I am connected to numerous resources and opportunities which allows me to experience community and my own passions.
Senior,4,"Great professors with a lot of unique experience. Admission/financial aid is awesome. Main campus advising is very good. Beautiful campus, very nice athletic stadiums, and student life events."
Freshman,2,The professors clearly aren't familiar with the software and make it frustrating especially when it costs thousands of dollars. High School teachers were better at this and they aren't try to take your kidneys with these prices.
Sophomore,2,"I am only through my first year at Cincinnati, and I can say that freshman engineering is not the most fantastic program at this school. The math department is way over standardized up until calculus II. What I mean is that everyone takes the exact same exams and are graded by the same person, but everyone has different teachers and is taught in a different way. Any person you ask about the freshman engineering course, ENED, will tell you how poorly it is put together. They try to teach you s myriad of subjects that the teachers are not qualified to teach. An example of this is how they try teaching us statics, statistics, and programming, but your teacher may not be well versed in all of those subjects. They also try doing a flipped learning environment, but the videos they provide for learning are explained by google's text to voice program and are impossible to follow. The dorm life is fun, and the food isn't very good."
Sophomore,2,"The University of Cincinnati has great opportunities - they have co-op programs and ways to get involved. However, the administration, as well as most professors, are seemingly inconsiderate of students. Compared to other universities, the courses at the University of Cincinnati include much more unnecessary work, as opposed to incorporating more learning materials. Many course as well as official guidelines are very regimented and there is not much room for ""equivalencies"" or understanding. In situations I have encountered, professors have not been able to meet or have simply not shown up for extra help sessions. The university does not do well with change, and is not too great at coordinating with its students on relevant topics outside of necessary things such as safety."
Freshman,2,"If it weren't for the professors, students, and sports this place could probably qualify as a landfill. Personally watched a worker drop a pizza on the ground and put it back in the oven. I don't understand why I chose this school as I really do not think the school cares about the well being of their students. To the students, professors, and sports thank you salvaging a little bit of fun and made my year somewhat good. Peace out I'm transferring."
Graduate Student,2,"I went to architecture grads school in DAAP. The working load in insanely heavy. I did 78 credits within two academic years for five semesters. Yes we did have another one year internship for 3 semester. It seems that the UC’s architecture school go down the road. The professors desperately want to go back to higher ranking by slaving grads students. We have endless workload and never get any rest in school, have no time to focus on personal research. All we did is to survive in school. I don’t feel Ilearned valuable knowledge. I highly don’t recommend to go to UC."
Freshman,2,"They let in a TON of students every single year without actual acknowledgment of academic or creative talent, which leads them to be very disorganized in departments such as financial aid and school to student communication. Very Crowded and not enough space for everyone in dorms, parking garages and sometimes even classrooms. The campus is very beautiful and modern, the Clifton area can be great as well as sketchy at times. Academics and professors are good, although the one full year of foreign language requirement for every major can be a bummer."
Alum,2,"I am qualified to review UC because I took five years of courses at UC-Blue Ash, plus another year at UC-Clifton.  At UC-Blue Ash, I earned two associate technical degrees in related fields, but these degrees turned out to not be salable for most of us who graduated circa 2004.  At UC-Clifton, I was accepted to DAAP, but the UC bureaucracy decided I was ""not making satisfactory progress toward a degree"" (after they refused to take credits from UC-Blue Ash!), then they stopped my financial aid around summer 2008.  Overall, UC is a bureaucratic and sometimes arrogant institution.  They discriminated against Generation X and anyone who is not Democratic/Socialist.  They also have a lame ""party scene"" where people in row houses acted rude to me.  Finally, Clifton/Corryville is a high crime area, to be avoided if possible."
Freshman,2,"Financial aid is TERRIBLE!!!! If you can't afford to pay 30K a year, then do not go to this school. My financial aid has not been subtracted from my bill and it is making me so anxious. "
College Senior,2,"Only college bars, no places for grad students! UC has a shuttle for nightlife transport"
College Freshman,2,"Housing options are limited because of the small campus size, and there are more bad dorms than good ones.  Off campus housing is a good financial choice"
College Sophomore,2,"As I've stated before, how the faculty refuses to address the excessive drug and alcohol abuse on the campus, supports a community where sexual assault is prevalent."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are very small, whether you have a double or quad, you won't have much space at all. Very little money has been spent on keeping the dormitories up to date, clean, technologically savvy, and aesthetically pleasing. With all this considered, the dining plan and room and board fees are extremely over priced."
College Sophomore,2,I know sorority girls and all of them were/ are well known for how they dress and how drunk they got and the stupid things they did when they got drunk. The fraternity boys are almost always included in these stories.
College Junior,2,I hate Greek life. They are obnoxious and very prevalent in the Design school where I take classes.
College Senior,2,"Old dorms, small, TERRIBLE freshman placement, only perk is they're fairly close to class buildings"
College Junior,2,Clifton is NOT the safest area out there. As long as you stay around people and inside the campus limits it is safe. Lot's of crime around Clifton and a lot of homeless people wandering the outskirts of campus.
College Junior,2,"As a international student, it's not easy to get information and opportunities.

Most of the services focus on native people."
College Freshman,2,"I've had the feeling from some (not all) fraternities, that they think very little of you if you don't join one for yourself.  They sometimes come off as snobby, and annoying.  However, I have some friends in frats and srats that are totally accepting of everyone."
College Freshman,2,"I don't feel safe here, lots of incidents occur & there never seems to be any solutions. I barely ever see patrol on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Not the standard of Greek life as seen in south
College Senior,2,"I can't believe not one building has paper towels.  Gross.  The toilet paper is sooooo cheap.  As far as building maintenance, no floor mats when you come into a building so you can even wipe your feet from the rain or snow.  Hazard.   The artwork is non existent in the buildings. And,  may I please see some diversity?  Why not recruit from poor schools?"
College Student,2,So far things haven't been going so well.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of open parties.
College Junior,2,The awarding system isn't what they say it is. Awards don't appear to be given based on merit and need.
College Freshman,2,High scholastic standing; received no aid at all
College Freshman,2,"Unhealthy food selection, and unfriendly staff."
College Freshman,2,If you want something really nice be ready to spend
College Freshman,2,the dining hall places dont alwasy hove good food the workers are slow or carelessadn food is average or repetative the leave many no choice but to eat out for good food.
College Student,2,"There are three dining halls which is a decent amount but there is a lack of variety of food among them. As well, the cost of a meal there compared to the quality of food being provided seems outrageous. Many students complain that there are not enough healthy options, the fruit seems cheap and not ripe, and the only attempts at health are usually ruined by the workers covering the food in some sauce or tons of seasoning. The biggest problem is that the most common foods offered are unhealthy such as pizza, grilled cheeses, fries, and pasta dishes. Another big problem is that the workers are typically cold or rude. They seem severly disinterested in their job and often treat the students as if we are an inconvience to them. I have seen many workers blatantly yell at students, or ignore them when they approach their counter because they are too busy causally talking with other workers. They also frequently cuss and talk inappropriately for a work setting."
College Freshman,2,"The school barely gives me anything, and almost took away the one scholarship they did give me due to a miscalculated mistake on their part. It is usually a hassle."
College Freshman,2,The process for applying the year before was complicated with submitting the application and writing assessment separately. I lost out on scholarship opportunities because of it.
College Freshman,2,I think the food could be more diverse and have better quality. I really wish that other restaurants were included in the meal plan like OSU or Miami Oxford.
College Junior,2,"Crime is a regular part of the Corryville neighborhood located by UC, and much of that tends to spread onto UC's campus. A serious burglary or assault takes place at least twice a week, and almost everyone knows someone whose house or car has been broken into.  The heads of security at UC regularly promise to increase patrols and crack down on crime, but crime doesn't seem to be decreasing.  However, there are little emergency telephones around UC's campus to aid people who need emergency help, as well as a service called Nightride that gives UC students free late-night transportation around UC's campus so that they don't have to endanger themselves by walking."
College Freshman,2,"I would say the local atmosphere is not very safe at all but could have some potential. There are, though, lots of good sporting events in the city, great shopping, and cool events if you look for them."
College Student,2,Shopping is good. Crime rates are terrifyingly high.
College Student,2,"The dorms are gross (mostly because a-hole students trash them). Trash was always left in the halls for days by housekeeping staff, smoke alarms don't work in areas, sewer smell is awful in areas (especially on campus), people are rude and stuck up. Food is okay for a few weeks, then they serve the same old stuff every day (lots of grilled cheese). The buildings are beautiful on the outside. Professors can be nice, but some just let Graduate students run the class and are difficult to contact."
College Freshman,2,scholarships from the university are hard to come by.
College Junior,2,it took for every just to find out what i had to do and where i had to go
College Freshman,2,"Crime is very abundant in the areas around campus. On campus, crime is less common however, serious crimes do occur on campus around once a month."
College Junior,2,"High prices, old houses in a very dense area. Close to campus though"
College Freshman,2,"The neighborhood around campus is rough. There is UPA, but that is pretty much living on campus, and the price is outrageous."
College Junior,2,"if your family lives even one dollar above the poverty line, you're not going to receive any aid. scholarships only go to science geniuses and sports heroes."
College Student,2,"Maybe it's because I was a transfer student, but getting any kind of aid was a hassle; I've had to fill out a Dependent Verification Worksheet three separate times, and it took even more attempts to get it submitted. The school didn't help me personally with scholarships or aid or loans."
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive for the quality and space that you are paying for.
College Freshman,2,I attended a price school in which I took advanced classes and got good grades. I did not receive any aid from UC and I am still trying to get some to help pay the costs
College Freshman,2,"Just like any college town, off-campus housing isn't luxurious but it's decent.  I will be living off campus in a house with 3 other girls next year and I can't wait for the experience! On campus housing (dorms/apt.) can get extremely pricey and they are very sneaky about pulling you into a lease that is hard to get out of or find a sublease for the summer if you plan to go back home.  I felt extremely safe in my apartment but the cost was awful.  I had to pay extra to park and it was very pricey too."
College Freshman,2,"Cincinnati is a very lovely place to explore and try new things but the old saying is true ""travel in groups"".  Safety is horrible.  There are campus police everywhere ALL. THE. TIME but crime is out of hand!! There are many activities depending on your interests and there is no way you could ever get bored!!"
College Sophomore,2,"I grew up in Michigan, so I was used to the awful winters. If you aren't from the midwest, the weather will definitely be a shock for you. I suggest packing something for every season. Our summers can get really really hot. Just always check the weather before you leave and be prepared for anything. 

I'm serious."
College Freshman,2,The hills on campus makes it hard to get to class when it rains due to puddles and poor drainage.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is expensive, and not clean."
College Senior,2,There should be more scholarships for summer semester and easier access to them. Financial aid needs work.
College Sophomore,2,The football team is not that great and there is almost no school spirit. The stands are not even a quarter full after half time.
College Student,2,The food is unhealthy with very little variety and tastes horrible
College Student,2,Wind and cold is horrible
College Student,2,I received no financial aid
College Student,2,You will feel left out otherwise
College Student,2,You are safe on campus but not off
College Student,2,They are viewed as stuck up and annoying
College Student,2,They aren't strict at all
College Student,2,It is unsafe at night due to theft and crime
Alum,1,"Their architecture program was a mess. So many things were thrown together last minute. You were just given a grade at the end of the semester. Professors cared more about us working 80+ hours a week on a project for 1 class instead of our physical, mental, and emotional health."
Alum,1,"I was not a big fan of UC. The campus itself is safe, but step off and you never know what is going to happen. There is so much crime that happens in the area. We had our district police chief's phone number because our house was broken into and the cops said they don't think the area is safe. But the thing is, you have to pay over $1000 a month in rent to be safe. Would not recommend unless you can afford to live on campus for 4 years."
Works Here,1,The medical training side is the most racist environment that I have ever witnessed. It is ran and directed by a bunch of white supremacist power hungry pigs who have no shame in treating their trainees like trash and then covering it up. Shame on the DIO for being a part of this type of behavior and for supporting it. Shame on the directors of the programs who comfortably abuse their residents and fellows and feed their own ego by putting others down. None of you should have become doctors. I hope no patient ever suffers from your behaviors the way that your trainees suffer.
Senior,1,"Horribly run! The healthcare program I am in is poorly put together! Words are missing and spelled wrong in tests abs assignments, the professors do not care if you are permitted extra time on tests through the disability services and they are just plain rude! I would not recommend this college to anyone. It has been the worst 2 years and I am so upset I spent my money at this place."
Freshman,1,"I went to this school when I was in freshman year. The whole academic curriculum in this school provides bad treatment to students. I graduated this school, but I have not getting job yet."
Freshman,1,"The computers in the library have a mac desktop but windows 98 operating system. Instead of spending money on academic resources, the school uses money to build a better soccer field to that the city of Cincinnati's soccer team can play there."
Niche User,1,My son was an Engineering major and after 4 years was put on academic suspension with no written or verbal warning. The academic guidance he received was laughable. She was rarely available or interested. I would not recommend UC Engineering even though it is ranked well.
College Sophomore,1,Drugs are rampant on the campus and there are a lot of public issues. The professors don't address the issues with excessive drug and alcohol use even when confronted with it. It shows a lack of interest for the well being of the students.
College Junior,1,"I don't like Greek life.... My answers for this were probably wrong, but I honestly know nothing about Greek life besides annoying frat boys and stuck up sorority girls."
College Freshman,1,My residence hall is filthy and disgusting.
College Senior,1,You never see a security guard anywhere.
College Senior,1,Sick hazing. Only for super rich kids.
College Senior,1,I think freshman get excited about it and then it fizzles.  You never see spirit teams running around trying to promote the game or the team!  So lame.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am taking my masters here, and have found that my experience with the overall university is that those at one-stop, the bursar, parking services, and other similar areas have no interest in actually serving the students.  They are out to make the university money, and all regards for customer service is disregarded.  I like my individual program, but I have no respect for the University as a whole.  I will never proudly identify as a bearcat."
College Junior,1,"Daniels ALWAYS had a weird smell about it, like years of vomit had been ingrained in the peeling linoleum tiles."
College Student,1,"Guys are idiots. A few nice ones, but it's extremely rare to meet one."
College Student,1,Someone saw a rat. In CenterCourt. End of story.
College Student,1,"freshmen ""aren't allowed to live off-campus"" but they accepted over 6,000 freshmen and they couldn't accomodate at least 1,000 of them and were no help with the off-campus housing finding-process."
College Student,1,Snobs. All of them. they're loud and have parties every frikken day. loud music. Chanting. Creepy black robes and candles in the commons by McMicken (a little girl CRIED because of them. And the guys in that group laughed at her. Like really - show some respect. Hold your freaking creepy-ass ceremonies elsewhere and in private).
College Student,1,"They say they have restrictions. It's for show, though. 24-hour quiet hours started the Friday night before finals week and people were shouting in my floor's hallway. I told them to stfu because my boyfriend was sick and trying to sleep (this was mid-finals week, by the way. Not the Friday before) and I was studying for a math final that I had at 8am. They listened, but made some rude remarks. But no one else did anything about it until me, and I'm a freshman - NOT  a hall RA, NOT an administrative member. I had to enforce things. It shouldn't come to that."
College Sophomore,1,"The crime off campus is pretty horrendous. Students get almost-daily emails about crimes, burglaries, robberies that occur around campus in areas that most students live. There's plenty of police and off campus security and it keeps increasing but crime and safety is still a big concern for most students."
College Junior,1,i don't care about sports
College Junior,1,internships aren't offered for fine arts majors :) how nice
College Freshman,1,The year of the polar vortex.
College Sophomore,1,Campus housing is a huge rip off. I would never live on campus and waste money this way again.
College Sophomore,1,I never have working WiFi in my dorm room. It is a huge hassle. Also the cost for prints is pretty high.
College Sophomore,1,"You can very obviously see many students, including minors, engaging in excessive drinking during the weekend in Clifton."
College Sophomore,1,There were no scholarships that I was eligible for.
College Student,1,Dabney is the worst dorm ever
College Sophomore,1,"In the winter time, it is so cold, it makes it hard to walk around campus. The summers are great though, sometimes it too hot to go outside. Glad the building have both heat and air-conditioning."
College Freshman,1,You have to walk everywhere and if the weather is bad you're going to have a bad time.
College Freshman,1,I hate the food! They use way to much grease and oil.
College Freshman,1,Too many underage people drinking.
College Freshman,1,"Parking in Clifton is by far the biggest headache about being a Bearcat. Prices are ridiculous for garages, tickets are given out liberally, spots on the street are EXTREMELY hard to come by, and you usually have to park in inconvenient areas. Just not a bright spot for an otherwise great school"
College Freshman,1,"The $$ available for the arts is practically non-existent. As Valedictorian, I thought I'd get a lot more support."
College Freshman,1,We get very frequent emails about robberies/muggings/shootings/stabbings and it is a rather unpleasant atmosphere to attend college in. 
College Senior,1,"Over crowded buses, and the schedule is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,"They think they are all that. Everyone else knows they aren't and only goes to their parties for the free drinks. There, of course, are exceptions."
College Senior,1,DRUGS ARE EASILY OBTAINED. I DON'T DRUGS BUT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS ON CAMPUS
College Junior,1,"There is little to no where to park during certain hours. Parking permits are available, but they cost 250 to purchase. The pric on parking is way too high."
College Student,1,"The University is safe, but authority is very ""don't ask don't tell""."
College Senior,1,"I personally would do it all over again if I had the chance.  I do not feel that the advisors at UC were very helping in directing students down the right path.  As a student, I do not know everything to ask about school and a future career because I have not been through this program before; therefore I would think advisors would guide you and tell you things that you need to know.  It was not like that at UC.  Other than the advisors, I feel that some of the courses were repetitive throughout undergrad and more could have been taught; especially about the licensure exam process."
College Junior,1,Good amount and access to financial aid but does not offset fees and required student health insurance.
College Senior,1,"Awful.  In the summer it's hot and the winter, there is ice and snow and rain which makes it a terrible experience getting to and through school.  If the weather is bad, traffic will be bad, which means the chances of being late are much higher.  I feel like many students don't come to class when the weather is bad."
College Senior,1,"Every year something goes wrong with my financial aid somewhere down the line (I am definitely not the only person this happens to).  Every year I have to talk to the people in charge of it, they are extremely rude and you can tell they hate their jobs.   As of right now, I am STILL facing trouble with my FAFSA and because of them (my parents have already been in contact with them and they apparently say everything is fine even when it is not) I may not get ANY FINANCIAL AID this year! I filled out my FAFSA in February! It's JULY!"
College Sophomore,1,The diversity here sucks! look up the demographics. I believe they are trying to send the diversity to either Blue ash or Clermont with the exception of Asians they are everywhere! But as a African American you may feel out of place thats why its important to get involved early... i wish i would have
College Junior,1,The University isn't too bad in general... But Clifton is a terrible area... Get me Out of here
College Freshman,1,"I have had a hard time applying for financial aid because I come across a problem and the people are not very helpful. My aid came out to be low and did not cover all of my tuition, which was frustrating. Being out of state this is very important to me. I love my school, but do not want to have to leave due to lack of money."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is insanely expensive on campus, and parking on the streets is even worse; inconvenient."
College Junior,1,"I wouldn't live on campus for anything.  There are frequent robberies and attacks.  Live in Hyde Park, Clifton, or Oakley."
College Sophomore,1,"The off-street parking in Cincinnati can be very frustrating. There are many streets around campus to park on, but after around 10 pm on weekdays, it is challenging to find a spot nearby your location."
College Senior,1,"I feel very unsafe on the UC campus. The security office does a great job of keeping faculty and staff updated on recent crimes, but that doesn't make the campus any safer. I am always worried walking to my car after my night classes. Once, a student contacted the UC police for help with her car and then proceeded to wait for over a half an hour and they never showed up. This was 10 o'clock at night in one of there parking garages. She finally found help from other students and left, never even seeing campus police. This really worries me."
College Freshman,1,"It seems nearly impossible to find parking on or near campus. If you do happen to find a spot, you always have to pay an unreasonable price. I think we need more free parking or at least areas that will be free under certain time restraints."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking garages are expensive. Some run about $450+ per semester, which is  not a good deal for students. Meter parking fills up fast but is cheaper. Living on campus without a car is better. If you live off campus, live within walking distance.Traffic is terrible during the morning and evening peak hours."
College Student,1,I don't drink and that seems to be a lot of what there is to do at night.
College Sophomore,1,"It is a high price to park anywhere on campus and if you can prevent it, DO!"
College Junior,1,You have to be very careful about when you choose to drive because parking can be impossible on certain days at certain times. It can also be very dangerous depending on where you park.
College Junior,1,"I received nothing but loans because I was a transfer student. As a student paying for my own education, it was better than nothing but I'm having to work very hard to try to find money."
College Sophomore,1,They need more people working in the financial aid area.  I waitied over two hours in line to talk to someone about my financial aid only to find out that I had the wrong paperwork.  When I came back with the correct paperwork I waited another 2 hours for them to tell me they will process it and get back to me.  I got no answers and classes started the following week.  It took them 3 weeks to get me my aid award and in that time I had to withdrawl from classes because I couldn't buy books or parking pass.  While standing in line for the two hours with a line the advisors would get up and leave their area and not return and just leave the line go like it is nothing.  I was very frustrated with the entire process this semester.
College Freshman,1,Parties Blow ass their horrible

Graduate Student,5,"The interconnectedness of the the staff and students and the focus on contemplative practice. This school is the type to not only give you the skills and techniques that you will need in the real world, but also the presence of mind you will need in order to be of service to yourself and others."
Alum,5,"Studied here for 2 years to finish my undergraduate degree. Had many life changing experiences. Teachers and staff were phenomenal. Classes always had great content and very enlightening discussions. Naropa is a rare gem in a sea of samsara, grateful to have been able to spend time here.

Senior,5,"Naropa is by far, one of the best experiences I've ever had with a University setting. Naropa gives you the space and the creative tools to allow yourself to dive into parts of the psyche previously unexplored. I was able to learn so much about myself that I had never known to existed, and in turn, it has improved my relationship to my family, friends, and my own self-esteem."
Junior,5,"Naropa University is a wonderfully inclusive and non-traditional institution. Offering a variety of insightful and inspiring courses, I have experienced an immense amount of academic and personal growth. Additionally, Naropa celebrates diversity, encourages community-learning, and nurtures spirituality."
Senior,5,I am now in my senior year at Naropa and can safely say that I fully endorse and appreciate the unique experience that Naropa provides. The professors are amazing and my favorite part. The class sizes are small and every class brings in a mindful practice of some kind
Graduate Student,5,Amazing graduate counseling program. Very unique and transformative. Professors truly care about your acquisition of knowledge and your wellbeing. Lots of hands on experience when working with different therapeutic modalities.
College Student,5,"I love absolutely everything about this school, from the foundation of it, to the class size, to the courses offered. I appreciate spirituality more than anything else in life so to be able to go to this school would mean the world. I love the experience to best understand ourselves in order to understand others."
College Student,5,I love that we live in apartments.
College Student,5,"I haven't stated school here yet, I am planning to attend in the fall. However, even before I visited the campus I knew this is the only school for me and in order for me to flourish and fulfill my life purpose in the best way possible I know it is vital for me to attend Naropa University."
College Junior,5,"The Naropa University community cares as much about the individual's transformation as much as the learning process. I have never felt so connected to an educational institution as I have with Naropa, and I have yet to start classes!"
College Freshman,5,We really have great choices
College Freshman,5,"Couldn't ask for more, they were the best"
College Senior,5,I love the housing off-campus
College Freshman,5,"Incredible places to chose from too eat, beautiful mountain scenery, great biking and warm people."
College Sophomore,5,The Academic approach at Naropa is different than any other. Its unique classes and curriculum create strong educations in graduates. 
College Sophomore,5,One of the best things about Naropa is the faculty. Whether its a professor or a counselor they really are there to help. 
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, I truly enjoy this University and experience. I wouldn't change. "
College Sophomore,5,Naropa is a small school and so is the food truck but boy is it good! 
College Junior,5,they have escorts and i feel very safe
College Junior,5,"I thought I'd want to be involved in the writing program, but after taking a class with the Dean of Peace Studies, I changed my mind. I will get a bachelor's in Peace Studies, and a master's in Somatic Psychology. I would like to work with peace concerns at the international level. I know I'll be able to find a job."
Junior,4,"Naropa encourages tremendous self-growth in a creative and collaborative environment. While they are working toward addressing diversity and inclusivity, this is an area in need of attention. The professors are extremely knowledgable, honest, communicative and engaging."
Senior,4,"Very expansive possibilities for growth, and a huge amount of support from staff and teachers to achieve what you put into it."
Junior,4,"I love the inclusion you feel in the school and the accreditation of the teachers, but would like to see more community within the student body."
College Student,4,"I know I will impact many people's lives with my future career, and I know this school will set me up with the best possible outcome."
College Student,4,It seems very safe and I feel protected in case of something happening that could be potentially dangerous.
College Junior,4,"For my degree, we have a wide range of classes offered and teachers from various religious traditions. They allow us to go into the contemplative practice of these religions. This will be helpful for my future as a chaplain. We are lacking in learning to do counseling type work. For example, we have a communications class that is relying on a book from the '70's to discuss family systems. This should be updated. There are lots of great study areas around campus with students who are focused. The workload isn't overbearing and allows the students room to study more intensly if desired."
College Junior,4,I will have the opportunity to have internships at hospitals as a chaplain or through hospice.
College Junior,4,I never feel threatened on campus. I also feel that my belongings are safe. I've had friends leave their belongings out multiple times while visiting another building without anything being stolen. I don't feel sexually threatened on campus.
College Junior,4,"My favorite experiences are with the teachers who are obviously masters in their subjects. They listen to my personal story and help me find inner strength based on my experiences. I appreciate that we practice meditation, but would like it to be taken more seriously by the student body. I feel that the teachers have more to offer than what the student body recieves. This is partly due to the ability to get away with less study and reading and still pass the classes."
College Junior,4,"Naropa is great for those who want to attend a small school and practice inner work alongside academic work. It integrates our life experiences with the academic material, which is what makes this school life changing. There is little opportunity for department led research and the library resources are lacking. The teachers are excellent and approachable. Overall, I am happy with this school, but would like to be more academically and professionally challenged."
College Senior,4,"I don't think I know a single person at naropa, or any school really, that doesn't have a love hate relationship with it. Naropa is undoubtedly the best choice I made (transferring here), but there are still days when I wish that I was able to sink in to 300 student classes and not have to talk to anyone. On that same vein, Naropa doesn't allow students to fall into the shadows, community is prevalent, and conversation plays in active roll in all classes. 90 percent of the time I think this is the greatest gift that naropa offers to its students."
College Freshman,4,Housing is it's only downfall
College Senior,4,They encourage one to be involved
College Senior,4,The one interesting component is that it does not offer math though you can take classes at CU
College Senior,4,The campus housing is like renting literally your own apartment but it's only with students and sometimes you share bedroom space
College Sophomore,4,Boulder Colorado knows how to do food
College Freshman,4,There is no Greek system.
College Freshman,4,"I am in a relationship, but I am sure there are people to date on campus."
College Freshman,4,A lot of organic and vegan options.
College Sophomore,4,There is lots of variety and you can search out good deals. 
College Sophomore,4,Boulder is no big city but the options for nightlife opportunities still offer a great deal of fun. 
College Sophomore,4,Naropas facilities are quaint but it adds so much character to the overall experience. 
College Sophomore,4,Naropa has a completely different approach than any other University in the country. Its uniqueness can be seen in a variety of ways. 
College Sophomore,4,I didn't actually live in Campus Housing myself but I heard it was great. More of apartment style housing than dorms. 
College Sophomore,4,Everyone that I have met has been very friendly.  
College Sophomore,4,I had no problem finding off-campus housing without the Universities help but they offered as much help needed
College Junior,4,there up to date and printer friendly
College Junior,4,"Older buildings for classrooms, the grounds are beautiful, due to eco awareness and planting."
College Junior,4,"We have a great computer lab, and free copies. IT support works well, too."
College Junior,4,Bus routes work pretty well. I drive due to disabilities that prevent me from comfortably getting on and off the bus.
College Junior,4,"The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics has phenomenal, down-to-earth professors. I definitely have no regrets being at Naropa. Though some people feel as though Naropa is not solidly-grounded in academia, the writing programs certainly are. Though I'm majoring in Writing & Literature, I plan to stay at Naropa for the MA Transpersonal Counseling Psychology program. Most students at Naropa are really interested in multiple majors, and if I had come to Naropa as a freshman, I certainly would have designed an Interdisciplinary Studies program. However, I transferred in with 57 credits, making it difficult to have enough time take all the necessary classes."
College Junior,4,"Boulder is a haven for artists, entrepreneurs, nature enthusiasts, and sustainability advocates. The CU atmosphere can be a blight on the landscape, especially if football, beer, and barbecues aren't your thing. Other than that, the town is one of the most progressive in the country, particularly the startup scene. People here are innovative and passionate. There are tons of gyms and yoga studios. People like to keep everything local. There are many small businesses that are thriving. The architecture and city planning is superb, and the public transportation system is efficient and easy to use. There is a lot to do in Boulder."
College Sophomore,4,"I pursue a MA degree in Transpersonal Counseling Psychology at Naropa University. It is my first semester here at Naropa, but I love everything so far. It is very experiential  school. Starting with the first month of studies we already are practicing the skills we learn in classes. Although the assigned literature is very interesting, it is hard to keep up with readings (grad school). The professors I've had so far are all amazing. They are very personal, intelligent and kind people. Overall, I am very happy that I chose Naropa University."
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus . this campus is very cozy and beautiful.
College Junior,4,"Eclectic Group of Individuals – There is an eclectic representation of all types of people at Naropa. There are artsy hippes, bohemian, eclectic, reserved, average joe americans. I love that most people at Naropa really represent their individual true nature in their own unique way."
College Junior,4,"There Is a Small Cafe Where Food Not Too Expensive, Fresh and Delicious; With Vegan and Vegetarian Options. The food is always fresh made each day. There are salads available, sandwiches, bagels and pastries. There are also vegan, vegetarian and meat options available for all dietary choices and lifestyles. The cafe is ran by one employee whom is always pleasant and nice."
College Sophomore,4,Open Minded – No peer pressure at this school. There are kids who are very experimental and open to wild experienes but everyone is respectful of others' choices.
College Junior,4,"Boulder, Colorado is one of the healthiest and best educated cities in the healthiest and best educated state in the country. Which also means bring your wallet, it is a fairly expensive place to live.

With the dramatic upheaval of the Rocky Mountains forming the boundary of the city to the west and the wide open prairies to the east, there is something for everybody. I don't even need to talk about the hiking in the summer and the skiing in the winter, it's ridiculous.

Both culture and collegiate dominate the ethos. Screams of ""GO BUFFS!"" have a subtle accompaniment of a distant violin."
College Junior,4,"One of the founding principles of Naropa is to recognize the world as basically good and that one has a place in it. This is supported and demonstrated though an acceptance and openness to other people and oneself. This creates an atmosphere of caring for the health and safety of the others. This creates what is called a Sangha or community. With the support of a caring and diligent staff, a caring community provides the greatest strength."
College Sophomore,4,All three campuses are safe with active security guards. There are emails that are sent out if there is any suspicious behavior on campus or in the town.
College Senior,2,I don't' think we have sports
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of an Athletic scene at Naropa, as the focus is very different. "
College Sophomore,2,"There Is None! The process is easy and staff are helpful, but for graduate students the only aid available is LOANS with the lowest interes rate at 6.8%. You must look elsewhere for scholarships. Tuff stuff."
College Junior,2,"I am an older returning student. I have gone to four different universities and never have there been enough computers. I just can't really imagine being able to operate in American society without one these days. So, I would say that if possible BYO but there are some available and you can get to them. I just wouldn't want to rely on it for my final grade. The upside is that you can print easily there which is great for saving on printer ink."
College Freshman,2,A Little Too Much – It seems like although they try to not have that kind of thing on campus it just keeps coming up and I think to many people do it!
Junior,1,"I came to Naropa hoping to learn about contemplative education and to be a great teacher after I graduate but instead, I found that their contemplative education and spirituality became a cesspool for spiritual bypassing and that it transforms people into snobby individuals that does not learn how to adapt to the real world. If you want to change the world, I would find a way to see how the school change myself because I became a burnt-out ""out of the cloud"" type of student after leaving and it took me going to another school to get out. The leadership needs to realize this before they are going to make their students become useless graduates."

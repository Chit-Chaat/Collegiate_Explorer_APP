Sophomore,5,I liked how the class sizes were not to overwhelming. I enjoyed meeting new professors. I made new friends while attending this university. This is a university that I would tell my Highschool friends about when looking for a school to apply for.
Alum,5,MHU assured that all online learning aspects were easy to maneuver and helpful. I always felt supported by the faculty and teachers.
Alum,5,"I loved the small, intimate class sizes. The faculty and staff were communicative, punctual, and helpful. My entire experience there was like family."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the teachers and the coaching staff. the campus is very pretty and in a college town but also near a major city which is nice
Niche User,5,"I love the small, closeness of the town. I love the classroom atmosphere. Seems very home like to me"
Niche User,5,Mars Hill is absolutely amazing!! Everyone is so welcoming and so down to earth. Mars Hill gives me the freedom to be myself and exploring new parts of who I am.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my Mars Hill experience so far! Mars Hill is a pretty small college and thatÂ´s in fact something I learned to value. You get to know a lot of people and everybody welcomes you. We have students from all over the world. There are a lot of South American and European students as well as Canadians and of course Americans.
The classes are really small. You barely find a class with more than 25 students. Through that the professors get to know each student really well and can help you learn the course materials easier.
Sport plays a big role in Mars Hill. We have several competitive teams that play in the second division of the NCAA. These sports are for example Swimming, Football and Baseball among others.
Talking about the campus, we are located in the Appalachian Mountains, around 30 minutes from Asheville, NC. If you walk around campus, you will have amazing views. We are surrounded by many mountains peaks and everything is green. You might  also see some squirrels."
Sophomore,5,"Over all very great academics and wonderful staff. I have enjoyed my time here and would recommend this school to anybody who wants a place to further their education with in my opinion, some of the best professors around."
Alum,5,I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to combine my studies with my passion for soccer at Mars Hill University. MHU really has an opportunity for everyone to get involved on campus! I could not have had a better education and college experience! GO LIONS!
Niche User,5,Mars hill university is a great school. The people are very nice and will help you with anything. The dorms are well kept. Along with the entire campus itself. The cafeteria was delicious . My over all experience has been wonderful.
Freshman,5,I am a first semester student at Mars Hill University and I have not yet found anything that I do not like about this school. The education here is wonderful and I am already learning so much. The professors are very friendly and are willing to help to ensure that you succeed. I also love the fact that there are a wide range of student services offered. I have taken advantage of the math and writing centers many times already! The students in these centers have helped me so much and I am thankful to be at a university that has these programs. One last thing that I have grown to love about Mars Hill is the diversity. I have met people from so many different places and backgrounds. It is so interesting learning new things from new people you meet.
Senior,5,I am in the Adult Non-Traditional Program for RN-BSN. The atmosphere and class size is great and good for learning I feel the staff want the best for you and truly want you to succeed. I would strongly recommend this program for anyone seeking advancement of their education.
Junior,5,"Great school, it has a lot to offer. There is a variety of majors and clubs and sports teams. I am in the nursing department and really love it. Mars Hill is constantly making upgrades to their campus and facilities. The student population is diverse and everyone seems welcoming. The new buildings on campus are especially nice places to study at and spend time at. I have enjoyed my experience at Mars Hill and would recommend it to anyone thinking about applying."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are very caring and just want their students to succeed. The campus is fairly small, so everyone pretty much knows everyone."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy being at Mars Hill, everyone is friendly all my professors are great and the people are very friendly. It is not a party school but the staff has a lot of fun activities set up for the students. The meal plans are wonderful, I feel like I am at home here!"
Freshman,5,"I love Mars Hill because I can stay close to home and still get a college education. Mars Hill is a very small University, which is great because the professors actually know who you are and can offer help to their students much easier."
Junior,5,"Great school in my opinion, it offers a lot weather people choose to see that or not. It is what you make of it- if you care more for a party than an education, you won't like it."
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful, but the on campus life is boring and the dorms are terrible. There is hardly any partying at all and is not much to do. Asheville is the nearest city and there is lots to do. If asheville wasn't near, boredom would definitely take over one who is used to do stuff all the time. Asheville is is 15 minutes away and has tons of stuff to do. Also the social work program is very good and i enjoy my time in it."
Niche User,5,"Mars Hill is a very welcoming college with a variety of people. Located in the mountains allows the campus to have great views. The campus is very small, with an 11-1 student teacher ratio. If you are looking for a quite, yet fun college experience, Mars Hill is for you."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small classes, because it is a more one on one environment and the teachers know your name."
Sophomore,5,"It's a beautiful college. Nature surrounds you. Not to mention the anatomy of the college is excellent for exercise. Just hiking up the hill to my dorm from August til November, I lost 50 pounds. The classes themselves aren't too different from a typical high school class. Most of them take place in smaller rooms, with an instructor who cares about your course progress."
Freshman,5,Mars Hill University is a wonderful university. The university is the most diverse campus that I have visited in North Carolina. The campus is very beautiful and the people here are very nice and respectful to others. I like how there is a reasonable professor to student ratio. The professors are very hands on and if you don't understand something that you are going over then they will take their time to go over it with you and break it down so you get a better understanding. The athletic teams are great as well. They train and practice really hard to make sure that they know what to do when game time comes.
College Freshman,5,I think I will have the tools necessary to make it far.
College Freshman,5,Pretty much all of it is great quality!
College Freshman,5,It's a big part of the campus.
College Freshman,5,Much more freedom but still feels like school.
College Freshman,5,"I have visited campus twice and I'm in love! It is so waiting up, the Professors actually care for their students, and my fellow classmates are so welcoming."
College Freshman,5,My Greek life experience has been one of the best things on campus. Connecting me with many new people and meeting people from across the nation
College Freshman,5,I love just about all of my classes. What I really like is the size because it is more one on one then being a number instead of a person like other schools.
College Freshman,5,Great networking and career opportunities.
College Freshman,5,I love this school it's amazing. I couldn't want anything more. The teachers work with you and the school and teacher truly care about you. The campus is beautiful. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a school that is small and a lot of opportunities.
College Sophomore,5,"The education department is great. All of the professors want to help you succeed, and the teaching license transfers to over 40 states!"
College Freshman,5,My professors are amazing. the facility here in general are so welcoming and friendly. the work load has not been a issue if you do your work when assigned and manage your time wisely.
College Freshman,5,I love my professors! They really want you to succeed in life and in school.They are almost always available to meet up with you and help you. This school is small and I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't like large schools. The only downfall is that it is so small because you know every ones business
College Junior,5,I love the opportunities that I have been exposed to here through my professors and other students. Some of my favorite experiences would be getting to know the professors and the Mars Hill community. Mars Hill is unique in its own way. Everyone has a place here. I love the small school environment! The professors are very available and are always willing to talk. I have been able to grow spiritually and mentally through attending this school. I would definitely choose this school again if I had the chance.
College Freshman,5,The combination of great professors and amicable students on campus makes the college experience makes it an experience to remember for the rest of your life.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the students, staff, and professors."
College Sophomore,5,"The way to get in is to just audition. After that, you really need to work hard. It's frowned upon if you just try to get by."
College Freshman,5,This college is very aware of the problem of sexual assault and have warned about the consequences and the support services for victims.
College Sophomore,5,The teachers for my major are supportive and help me when I need help.
College Sophomore,5,I had to obtain good grades in my English classes. I just had to do my school work.
College Junior,5,"The ONLY problem is they do not recognize clogging as a sport. But in all actually it is! As a clogger I can tell you we practice just as much as all the other sports teams, and we put on show, run, and workout just like all other sports team. It is a lot of work, and it takes a ton of energy. Clogging needs to be recognized as a sport, and there should be a scholarship!"
College Junior,5,I am able to get my major and a minor of my choice. They really work with you to make sure you graduate on time.
College Junior,5,I spend it at clogging practice!
College Sophomore,5,I honestly think it is the best because as a social work major there are many opportunities to volunteer and be apart of the community.
College Sophomore,5,It is the best because as a social work major we get opportunities to engage within the community and volunteer.
College Sophomore,5,"I love it! I made the dean's list and had some of the best instructors! They know me by name, and I feel comfortable there. I also work on campus and enjoy it. The campus is small and friendly, and I love it."
College Junior,5,It's been great because I hate big campuses and lots of people. I came from a small mountain town and a high school of 997 students. Appalachian State University would have been too much in space and population for me.
College Junior,5,Small mountain town where the college is pretty much the whole place and it's relatively quiet. Has a main street with two stoplights and it's perfect for people who don't want to be in the midst of a lot of hustle and bustle all the time.
College Junior,5,"The professors at Mars Hill College are all pretty much awesome. Most of them, if not all, have the student in mind."
College Junior,5,"My program is in the top 10 southeastern colleges and universities. The music department is one of the best on campus. However, the workload is insane compared to other programs. With a total of 169+ credit hours along with all the performances, lessons, concerts, and practice hours, most of us have no time for anything else. I switched to being a Music Education major at the end of my third year into being a Mathematics Education major and since then all my free time has gone out the door. Everyone else on campus thinks we do nothing at all when we are the ones with the highest workload and most involved degrees. But, of course, not many people really care about us anyways, besides the music faculty of course. They love us."
College Freshman,5,Very easy small town within walking distance 
College Senior,5,The process was not easy so I appreciate they just do not take anyone.
College Senior,5,I feel they are giving us the cutting edge in education for what we will need for when we are teaching ourselves.
College Freshman,5,"I love being in my Apparel and Interior Merchandising major because it gives me the opportunity to explore both fashion and art in the ways of clothing as well as decorating. I love how the program mixes training the artistic eye with the business side of ""how to make people want to purchase something"". The combination of art plus marketing is unique and Mars Hill offers that in abundance. I also love my professor, she heads up the entire program and does an amazing job at providing insight and inspiration."
College Freshman,5,"Mars Hill the town is very quaint and cute. The little downtown section offers some nice dining options as well as a piecing/tattoo shop that seems to be popular enough. The main local attraction however, is being a mere 20 minutes away from Asheville. Asheville is one of the most free spirited cities in the world and has an endless list of awesome things to do. I could not imagine going to school anywhere else if only because Mars Hill College is close to Asheville."
College Freshman,5,It was not very difficult getting into the Apparel and Interior Merchandising major. Mars Hill is one of 3 schools in North Carolina that even offers a major in that area so I knew going into being a freshman that that was what I wanted. I declared my major early on (first semester freshman) and was immediatly placed into an AIM major class. That was awesome and is a great asset of Mars Hill.
College Freshman,5,"If your 21 and older Ashville has a lot to offer with night life. Mostly clubs, bars, and other places to drink. But when when your 18 they still have alot to offer. There are always concerts and events like the durm circle (which alot of the sudent go to) that you can attend. On campus its always nice to hang out with friends. And almost every saturday there is a dance party in the loft. Of course we are a dry campus so no drinking is allowed in any matter. But we always find something to do, and we make memorizes that last a life time."
College Freshman,5,I have work study in the Fitness center. It is a very welcoming place and is open almost anytime you need to workout. The library is a good size for Mars Hill and it is easy to get help when you need it. Beside the library is a writing center and a math center that has free help. Mars Hill is a college where it is easy to meet up with someone. If you meet someone and forget their name it is very possible you will see them the next day.
College Freshman,5,I do not see how a student could live off campus. Mars Hill is easy to walk from one side to another so you do not have to worry about driving to class and finding a parking place. Also if you live on campus it is easier to get scholarship money and it is cheaper to attend Mars Hill. There is a lot of activity's at Mars Hill at night that help students to get to know one another. the better network a student has with the people around them the better chance they have at graduating on time. Getting a place to live is very easy and there is very few cases where room mates do not work out and it is easy to find a new one any time during the year.
Freshman,4,"the classes are small allowing the professors to get to know you and help you on another level, they are understanding if you have to miss a class for athletics or for other reasons. the university also offers free tutoring for math and for writing. most classes have S.I. session with it which are study sessions for the classes."
Freshman,4,I love playing soccer and the many international friends I have made.  Looking forward to three more here and hopefully a conference title in soccer.
Sophomore,4,"I am in the Honors program at Mars Hill University.  The professors are great.  I was able to achieve over $30,000 in academic scholarships."
Junior,4,The faculty and staff are very dedicated and passionate. They work hard to help their students learn the materials and truly get the best education for the money that they pay for it. The university is very rich and diverse with local history and the history of the university.
Junior,4,I am a transfer student at Mars Hill University. I have been so welcomed  and have loved every minute. My professors and coaches are incredible and are dedicated to seeing me succeed and be happy.  Campus life is extremely inclusive and the location of campus is great!! The only thing I would change would be more food options on campus.
Freshman,4,"Mars Hill is so beautiful and so peaceful, everyone just looks nice, and itâs nice going to a small school."
Junior,4,"I am actually a part of the Adult Studies program.  They offer evening classes to working adults.  Being a mom, employee, wife, daughter and carrying for two grandchildren full time and a sick grandmother, flexibility is crucial for me to be able to complete my degree. This program has been life changing for me to do this and to reach my career goals of being a social worker.  Is it hard?  Yes there are somedays that I feel overwhelmed, but the advisors and the support you receive from the staff and instructors is amazing.  If you area working adult, I would so recommend there programs to you."
Sophomore,4,Mars Hill University offers a great academic life for its students. The university gave me a great scholarship to attend the school which I would have never been able to attain anywhere else. The school prides itself on its service and how they treat their students. I have enjoyed my first year at MHU and look forward to the next 3 years and the opportunities to come.
Sophomore,4,the educational experience is great but the cost of attendance is very high. The school is surrounded by beautiful mountains and great hiking trails. Its about a 30min drive to Asheville.
Senior,4,"I like the small class size, the teachers are always open to helping you. You get to experience 1 on 1 understanding of concepts. I wish that there was more parking for those who live on campus. Mars Hill has a wonderful Nursing Program and they help a lot with financial aid."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Mars Hill was better than I expected from a smaller college. I love being at Mars Hill because of the the size of the campus. Everything that you need or need to be is within walking distance. The school offers tutoring in math and English which is a huge help and it's already provided in the tuition. The classes are small so you have more of an opportunity to get to know your classmates and professor. The main worry you will have to be worried about is that you are on a mountain which means it gets cold and hot very fast. Other than that I would recommend Mars Hill University to people who feel comfortable in a small community, knowing almost everyone on campus because of the size, and having access to most resources that other colleges may not offer."
Sophomore,4,It is a great view and atmoshpere around the campus. A lot of other places to visit that are near the campus or in near by towns and cities that have great views. Going hiking through the mountains was probably my favorite part of Mars Hill. I'd like to see them change the variety of for that they serve in the Cafeteria and in the Lion's Den but it's still a good school and I'm sure that you'll have no proble studying there.
Freshman,4,"Mars Hill College/University is a very small school, but just because it is small does not mean it is boring.  Everyone on campus is very nice and caring, there are no specific groups of people, and everyone blends in nicely.  The school is expanding and constructing new buildings for athletics and academics.  The professors take the time to help the students in any way possible and the staff on campus is very nice.  The cafeteria food needs some improvement but overall you will not starve while you are there.  It is a very clean and calm atmosphere and the best bang for your buck private college."
Alum,4,"Mars Hill is a small tight-knit community.  Campus is small, but the professors are great.  With the small classes, the professors are able to get to know each student and help them succeed."
Freshman,4,I currently go here and everything is very nice. The campus is beautiful and teachers are very interactive.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Mars Hill College was definitely one of a kind. It is important to know that the people allow you to feel like they are your family, and the mountains provide a nice environment."
Junior,4,"Personally I love mars Hill. Although they need to work on the cafe food, they have renovated a lot of the buildings and more plans to continue. The area is great, it's close to downtown Asheville and other places and the views almost everywhere are so gorgeous! The professors are very good depending on your major. One of the major problems is when you try to transfer credits, Mars hill doesn't do a good job with transferring credits in or out. They are big on athletics and over half of the student population are athletes. I give Mars hill a thumbs up because I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and I would recommend this school to others!"
Freshman,4,This is a very small college. All the professors are required to have office hours where they will help you with any questions that you have and they all are very helpful. Mars Hill does a lot of things to make sure that it's students get the best experience.
College Senior,4,"Getting a bachelors degree from Mars Hill is my main goal. Recieving my degree proves that I have taken the time to expand my knowledge so that I may grow in life and help others in my field of work. When it comes to internships and jobs, Mars Hill has great connections with the community in which they are always willing to help the students in any given way."
College Senior,4,"I have been lucky enough to have some of the greatest professors on campus. They are available outside of the classroom, and try their best to help the student succeed. Many courses for both majors and minors are offered to every student. The classroom sizes usually have 20+ people in them, but no more than 35 at a time."
College Senior,4,"Being a Mars Hill cheerleader, I get to see the schools outlook on sports during events. During any game, whether it be football, basketball, baseball, or lacrosse, many students are there helping to cheer the team on to victory. Mars Hill has great school spirit and pride in athletics."
College Senior,4,"My experience so far being at Mars Hill has been great. The teachers, my colleagues, the atmosphere, are all just simple, yet great things that make up this small university. It's truly an honor to get the provilage to expand my knowledge in a place such as Mars Hill."
College Freshman,4,"For me as a music major, the big name people we have as instructors make getting a job or recommendation letters that much more important.  If one of our music professors talked about you to amother person looking for an employee, then you most certainly can expect a call or opportunity."
College Freshman,4,The courses at Mars Hill are good and plentiful.  Some teachers seem to just want the paycheck but I've only come across one of those types.  The classroom feel or vibe is usually good and works well as a discussion group.
College Freshman,4,"My school had an excellent music program and is teaching me amazing things about how to be a better teacher and player. I think some updates to the campus are needed, facilities wise, but other than that it is great!"
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the school and the faculty is great. Educational programs could be better.
College Freshman,4,I feel really safe because everyone is there for you if something does happen.
College Freshman,4,They help us be able to do what we need to do.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are nice and there isn't a far walk from all of my classes.
College Freshman,4,Everyone supports our lions even if they don't do so good. Our facilities are very nice and clean.
College Freshman,4,"Its going pretty great right now, I feel like it can always be better"
College Freshman,4,Its a lot better now that I got to move into Huffman. My old dorm (Stroup) was very old and unpleasant. Huffman is definitely way better
College Freshman,4,I love my school because of my friends and tennis. If I didn't have those two things I would be homesick and miserable.
College Freshman,4,"Many different housing options depending on tier levels. Some are better than others but overall, great."
College Freshman,4,The Greek life is getting bigger and bigger every year.
College Freshman,4,Sport teams here are great and the people on them are respectable.
College Junior,4,"I think the safety team at Mars Hill is good. Sometimes they take a while to respond, but they are good workers who help the students out when they need it."
College Sophomore,4,The academics are amazing. The professors are willing to help and there are several places on campus that help students with any issues they may have with their work.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is over all pretty safe. There are cameras in place in the buildings to help prevent thefts and other issues that might happen. Lighting can be a problem in some areas, and I do not feel totally comfortable walking in certain places alone at night."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the classes I have taken have been great. The professors are friendly and want to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,there has not been any safety issues while I've been here
College Freshman,4,"I like it, but it is not where I wanted to go."
College Junior,4,"Mars Hill University is a very good school. It is small enough to where I see people I know all the time and also the professors remember you and are eager to help. This is one asset of the campus that makes it unique in my eyes. Knowing that I have the close relationship to my professors to ask/email them with questions and they actually care and know who I am really helps. One of my favorite experiences is our late-night breakfast on campus. A few days before we take our finals, the professors and staff of the university make and serve a late-night breakfast for all the students. It is great because it helps add some relief right before final exams start and it also shows that the staff and teachers care. If I could do it all over again, and decide on which school to attend, I would more than likely attend Mars Hill University again. I have made great friendships so far and I am currently involved with a competitive dance team. I love the area and the atmosphere of the campus, and because of this, I really enjoy attending this campus."
College Freshman,4,I don't go to parties.
College Freshman,4,Living in the dorms are great. There is plenty of space in the rooms and bathrooms.
College Sophomore,4,I love my major. It's difficult at times but I always try to pull through. I feel creative and I purely enjoy my major.
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity is on of the best things this campus has to offer but that in itself is bad, especially if the campus is socially dead and only held together through worthless parties and drinking."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is different in their own way.
College Freshman,4,There are several food places for students.
College Junior,4,"I'm an Art Therapy major. It is a new major that they just started a few years ago. It is a really good idea if you are into psychology and counseling but are also artsy and enjoy making art. There is a lot of hard work involved, but if you like the subjects already it is very rewarding."
College Junior,4,The campus is a little remote but the scenery of the mountains is really beautiful. Also Asheville is a fairly short drive away so there is fun stuff to do if you can get to Asheville.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a free gym open to all students. They also have three basketball courts and huge field and a vollyball court.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the campus is so small you know everyone. Most people you stay with will probably become some of your best friends because you will see them all the time. An alumni said that he is still in touch with the friends he made hear but, he does not talk to any of his friends he made at the schools he transferred too."
College Sophomore,4,Living off Campus is great. You can go shopping and you can throw a party without worrying of security is coming. Also the rooms are nicer than the cheap dorms.
College Junior,4,"It is very diverse, but its not a mean place to be"
College Junior,4,There is all types of races here on campus.
College Junior,4,"I got locked out of my dorm and the security guy, didn't take long to get me safely inside."
College Sophomore,4,The athletes rule this school. They are given huge advantages over the non athletes and they don't take advantage of the opportunities they get. Most people i have met that play sports only care about the sports and are very rude to people who aren't interested.
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers here are mostly great. There are some exceptions like at every school, but almost every teacher i have had is very attentive to students needs and very willing to help out where needed."
College Freshman,4,"we are in a small town, not much going on"
Senior,2,"Mars Hill University seems to only care about getting money from their students. The price of this school is no where near worth that much. Dorms are disgusting- I've had bees coming into my room for the first three months. The cafeteria uses leftover food from lunch for dinner. The options are the same every day, you can almost predict what they are going to have. Every time I see a tour group I just want to yell to them ""Leave and don't waste your time coming here"". Once you are a junior don't even bother trying to transfer because chances are half of your credits wont transfer and that will put you more behind in school. If i could do it all over again I would've never came to Mars Hill University."
Junior,2,"Personally, I have enjoyed the school in terms of meeting different clubs;however, for the price the school is really poor devolped  over the years and isnât inclined to push students for academic success. Most students are pass along athletes who usually donât care what their grades are and some of the professors have embraced this more specific lower classes such as intro to visual arts. If a professor seems shady leave immediately as they are not really supportive unless you demand it at times. The food is terrible: 40,000 a year shouldnât allow me 5 food options every day itâs quite sad. Housing is okay but compared to other schools is very low quality. Local area is beautiful but small, the party scene is non existent. Honestly wingate or Gardner Webb are better options regarding a private school and WCU or Appalachian for state school. Take my advice on this ð¤ð½"
College Sophomore,2,"My freshman year I lived in a horrible dorm. The bathrooms were never cleaned. Also, there was no respect for peoples sleep, as music was blasted at all hours of the night."
College Sophomore,2,"The level of play is average for most varsity sports on campus. I would say not many people attend the games, so the atmosphere isn't special by any means. Personally, I like sports so I go at times just watch the competition."
College Senior,2,"During the day, Mars Hill is a great campus. During the night that all changes. Mars Hill has hardly any lights throughout  the campus so it's extremely dark. There are maybe 5 total security buttons/phones around the whole campus. This does not make me feel safe walking through campus at night alone, or even with friends. Many sexual assault cases have happened just within the short years I've been on campus. Majority of the time nothing happened to either person, just counseling which doesn't help at all."
College Freshman,2,"There are many housing areas that need to be remodeled or taken down because of health issues or other factors.  Many of the buildings are old, but are still in working condition.  Some dorm social life is bad and the rule enforcement is awful.  The residence life in the male dorm I stayed in is not good."
College Freshman,2,"Mold in buildings, small rooms, students can not feel at home because they are not allowed to decorate with lights or candles, no rule enforcement."
College Freshman,2,Are not known for their parties or social events. Do little for the community and don't live together.
College Freshman,2,People just get drunk and high in their rooms.
College Freshman,2,"Everything is fried and covered in gravy. I have gotten sick from it. They show a poster saying they have a B rating for vegetarians/vegans, but there are seldom any vegetarian/vegan options. If you want to remain healthy buy your own food, and cook your own meals."
College Sophomore,2,People aren't very friendly with each other other than their friends. Most people just aren't accepting of others mostly because they don't know them. Everyone seems timid and no one wants to get out of their shells.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the buildings are really old and they show it as well. The social scene is close to non existent in my opinion but this may be because I'm a music major and am shut in Moore all day. The cost is ok but compared to the nice facilities that UNCA has to offer, it 's a rip off."
College Freshman,2,"A dorm on the other side of campus had break-ins this year. Stuff was smashed, stolen, people were injured. The guy students are creepy. Ugh. Do NOT walk around at night alone! Lampposts are in place but there is no one on duty, etc. to watch you. Not enough cameras. If I travel around campus at night, I make sure that one of my friends escorts me."
College Freshman,2,"There are a number of restaurants but nothing well-known except Bojangles. What is Jack Rabbits anyway? Seriously, a Chick-fil-A or Olive Garden would be great."
College Freshman,2,Not enough cameras on campus to make it safe enough
College Sophomore,2,The only way to get anything fun to do is to drive 30 minutes to Asheville.
College Junior,2,"This school is very expensive, and even though they offer almost everyone scholarships they also raise tuition after each year and don't raise scholarships to go with it. So if you cannot afford it without scholarships you will have to take out more loans each year. And If you ask for help for getting more scholarships they just point you to a few websites and tell you to look to outside scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,Some of the builidngs are not worth the amount you have to pay. Edna has holes in the wall and ceiling of the bathroom. The toilets were white when they were purchased but have turned brown.
College Sophomore,2,It is a prodominantly white school. The second largest group is African Americans after that we have asian. It is hard being a minority at this school.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the facilites are old and it costs more to fix  them than to tear them down and make a new building. We have Hephaestus  in almost all of the buildings. If we called a health inspector I think the school would be closed for a few months.
College Sophomore,2,There are only a few restaurants and they vary from ultra expensive with not much variety to relatively low cost with low quality.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is sadly empty, there are only three different houses for each gender, and they are mostly snobs, so not worth joining."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything in town except for Waffle house closes at 11. There are only 6 resturants in town, and they aren't very good. Food shopping is overpriced, and there aren't many activities to do outside campus."
College Sophomore,2,"They could be a little bit more helpful. The only time we ever see security is if they bust a frat party, or to give out tickets. Other than that, they are ghost."
College Sophomore,2,I do not receive as much financial aid as I need. The financial aid office is never organized and it is a headache.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather here is so bi-polar. One day it is snowing, and then the next day it is warm and the sun is shining."
College Sophomore,2,"People rarely show up to the party events, that we do host on campus. Most people just go to the club or to another campus to party."
College Sophomore,2,The dining experience on this campus is horrible. We only have two big places to eat. When we go off campus its like 3 different places.
College Freshman,2,The only transportation is by car.
College Student,2,"You have to drive about an hour to go some where to find some enjoyment and if you want to find something near the campus, there's nothing to do."
College Student,2,My stepdad was telling me all that they have told him about grants and scholarships that I received and how I won't have them for the next school year when my financial aid counselor that I would have them for next school year. Plus they are charging me more and my parents and I don't know what they are charging for.
College Sophomore,2,I would have to say that Mars Hill needs some major improvements when it comes to the dorm life and the safeness thereof.
College Senior,2,"Many of the University's ""student centers"" are academically focused. There are few places for students to really have fun and unwind. The outdoor/game center is small and highly regulated to the point that few people want to go and those that do want to are always there and reluctant to give up a pool table. "
College Senior,2,"Night life at the school is ridiculously limited. It comes down to who you know and if you are ""in"" with that group of people. The night life in Asheville is also limited if you are not 21. "
College Senior,2,"The community around us is small, and the few apartments that are close to campus fill up quickly and tend to stay full for 2-4 years. So to live off campus would mean atleast a 20 min commute one direction to campus. and the cost would probably be very expensive, I know in cases I have looked at it has been, and that is why I continue to stay on campus. "
College Freshman,2,We dont have police their are security officiers since its a private college 
College Freshman,2,Not sure just got into it
College Freshman,2,The food is not bad but their are no good options other than the cafe to eat at. Its sad that they cant invest in a good eatery besides the cafe. 
College Freshman,2,The campus does not provide transportation for its students. This is always a problem because the campus is located 15 minutes from the Tennessee state line in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. Everything off campus is atleast a twenty mintue ride to Asheville and if you do not own a car or have a friend with one you are stuck on campus. To have a car on campus is 250 dollars a year. As for long distance transportation the bus station is in Asheville and the airport is in Hendersonville. Each of these locations are atleast twenty mintues away from the campus with the campus providing no transportation. The town does not have transportation because the town is a small mountain town that revolves around the college.
College Freshman,2,The dorms are very old and they just repainted them when we moved in. The social atmosphere is pretty good. The RA's seem nice. The cost of living is very high.
College Sophomore,2,Most students are sheltered in their views of the world around them and lack respect for the views of others. Because of this cultural ignorance they preach their own beliefs and close others out.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no specific way that non-greeks are treated by greeks and visa-versa. There is no Greek housing on campus, also there arent any Greek life that cater to blacks or African Americans. In addition, the Greek Life that Mars Hill does have are full of very fun people that like to serve the commuinty and have a good time!"
College Senior,2,Expect snow but not too much of it.. in the summer is is HELL. Esp from the time you move in to about middle october there is NO AIR conditioners so if you are a girl trying to blow dry & straighten your hair then put make up on... have fun with that you sweat ALOT  I had too shower at least 3 times a day
College Senior,2,"Not many places too offer, a few apartment complexes and housing but it is a small boring town with absolutely nothing fun nor exciting for college students looking to party & enjoy themselves"
College Freshman,2,"Mars Hill really holds you accountable for your own actions. It is a dry campus, though. They do monthly roomchecks and if they find alcohol in your fridge you can get in really big trouble."
College Sophomore,2,"If the campus was bigger than what it is now then parking would be amazing but other than that parking is pretty good. When parking make sure you park where your parking sticker says park, so for instance if you live in Fox (dorm) then you have to park at fox not at Gibson (dorm) other wise you get fined. If you get 3 tickets your car will be booted and you can't use your car on campus anymore til the next semester and you have paid your tickets."
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the facilities are older because this is an older private college.  I have not been in the newer buildings yet.
Recent Alumnus,2,If I had to do it over -- I would select another school.
College Sophomore,2,"The safety around campus is relatively alright. However, the amount of black mold in the buildings is way too much to be safe and healthy. Especially for an asthmatic, like me."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at Mars Hill are old and outdated. Things are constantly breaking and maintenance rarely shows up to fix them. For example, the first week of classes my roommate tried opening the bathroom window to get some air (oh, and most of the dorms don't have air conditioning) but when she did, a window pane fell out. We sent a report into maintenance but they have yet to show up. It is now 32 degrees and we can't even close the window."
College Junior,2,"There people from different countries that attend Mars Hill College, because of the exchange program and the athletics. If it wasn't for the athletic teams Mars Hill College would have no student diversity."
College Junior,2,"There aren't many choices for off-campus housing, and the ones that are available usually cost too much or are too far out from school."
College Sophomore,2,"Too Much Money Does Not = Awesome Living Quaters â All dormitories are not co-ed, which sucks.The oldest residence hall was built in the 1800's ( Edna Moore/ Stroup). This building is devoted to all girls. The building itself could use a face lift and some internal help as well. However, I will say the lobbies are very large and have WIFI. Brown and Fox residency halls are considerably nice and offer average sized dorm rooms. or you could pay an extra $1000 or more for a single or private which is deff not necessary. The Men can stay in either Gibson, Turner or Myers. Gibson looks like a prison and the Lacrosse team dwells there. Prepare to receive no sleep and don't even think about studying there for finals. Myers is disgusting, the students do not take care of it at all and I believe I heard it had rats. But that could of been a myth. Turner on the other side is very expensive too live in or even have a chance of living in. It has large dorm rooms and an awesome kitchen and lobby. 
If your the type of person who doesn't want to live in a dormitory try Dickson Palmer or Bailey Apartments. These are the most hardest residencies to get in, mainly because they are meant for upper class men. Plus the Dickson Palmer Apt come with a very large deck and volley ball court behind it. It also has available grills."
College Sophomore,2,"Bring a Labtop or Don't Bring a Labtop, Doesn't Matter! If I were entering Mars Hill college, it would be smart to bring your own laptop. The Library has odd hours. It may be open from 8:00am-10:00pm which is dumb considering its a college and students rather go to a 24/7 Library to work on homework or study for finals. The Computer Lab is usually crowded and many of the available computers in the lab are taken. The staff do allow students to rent lab tops for a certain amount of time while staying in the computer lab. Having my own lab top makes it easier to finish or start work on my time and not the Computer lab's time. However, there is a draw back to bringing your own lab top. First off, the WiFi in many off the dorms suck and requires many students to leave the comforts of their dorm room and waste precious time walking around campus and heading into many of the college buildings. Sometimes, if its too late the College halls may be locked. The second draw back, is if too many people are using the wireless connection with in many of the resident halls. The network runs extremely slow."
College Sophomore,2,"Adult Studies Program â Not something that I notice as an adult.  I notice that all the female students are extremely casual, sport wear"
College Student,2,Asheville is 25 minutes from campus and isn't really convenient.   There are a few smaller towns in between but it's not within walking distance.  The cost to go out and eat would be an averge of $ 15 plus gas money.
College Junior,2,Food That Is Impossible to Eat? The food is many times not cooked all the way but the biggest thing is that they do not think about the allergies that people have.
College Student,2,"MHC Campus Rules â The police are always out and about in the area because it's such a small town. They take drinking very seriously, first time offenders also get in school trouble, second offenders are kicked off campus, no third chances."
College Sophomore,2,"Needs Help â The food is repetitive and some of the food is untouched by anyone. All the food tastes like it comes out of boxes. There are only certain foods that are edible enough. They also do not cook the food in front of you, they cook it in the backroom and the backroom does not look big enough to have a lot of equipment."
College Sophomore,2,Black and White â The majority of students are black or white.  There are a decent amount of other races though.
College Sophomore,1,"Fraternities and sororities are not very popular on campus. I assume because the school population is small, there is not enough funds to have a legit fraternity."
College Freshman,1,Professors and counselors will do anything and everything to help you out.
College Freshman,1,The only time I have had an interaction with campus security was when the whole Cross Country team received a ticket for parking in a community lot on a football game day.
College Freshman,1,"The athletics here are very poor (just like high school OMG!) The football team plays poorly, the marching band is only 1A- they have about 40 members, and while people do attend the games, they are not hugely popular. You're better off joining a club then a team."
College Sophomore,1,They would rather not have it get out then taking care of someone who has done something wrong.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much housing off campus, and the few places there are, are extremely expensive for a college student."
Recent Alumnus,1,The school is more likely to tell you to pull out loans than explain other options to you about what you can do to alleviate financial stress.
College Sophomore,1,night life is what you make it. The school does not assist in any nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,If you stay in a bad dorm parking is horrible. you might hit someones car while trying to pull out if someone is speeding down a hill carelessly.
College Sophomore,1,The School provides no transportation for students because it costs to much.
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't have a car, you don't have a way to get anywhere. There are no buses, taxis, or any other public transportation."
College Freshman,1,"There's no transportation options. If you don't have a car, make friends with people who do."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to do in the community or campus at night.
College Senior,1,"Many of the buildings on campus are way out of date. They need to be shut down and completely rebuilt on the inside. The plumbing is lacking severely, the fire systems are practically nonexistent. It's quite obvious that the buildings are in extreme disrepair."
College Senior,1,There is no school offered transportation that goes anywhere. The only way people can be transported if they don't have a vehicle themselves is by friends that do.
College Freshman,1,I dont like the cold weather so thats why im hating it. 
College Freshman,1,The wifi connection is very poor 
College Freshman,1,No straight clubs in Asheville
College Freshman,1,"Parking is terrible due to the fact that the college has expanded and their is limited parking. Its like high school parking, no assigned space and you probably will have to park in the gravel at least once. "
College Sophomore,1,The parking on campus is terrible. There are more students than parking places.
College Sophomore,1,"There is virtually no off-campus dining at MHC. There is a subway, but that is pretty much it."
College Sophomore,1,"The dining areas around campus are few and far between. The dining hall only has good food about once a month, and there is only one other place to eat on campus, and it is really expensive."
College Sophomore,1,There are very few restaurants off campus and of the ones that we have they are either a bit pricey for a college student budget or they are open on odd days or at odd hours.  The only place that I know of that is always accessible is Waffle House.
College Freshman,1,"The night life of my college consists of nothing. We can't party, we barely have any dances, there simply is not much to do on campus, but heading to asheville, or Tennessee may introduce you to a great time."
College Freshman,1,"The college's student body is growing immense, and it is simply not enough parking for the number of kids to come. Even if it is, the designated parking for the moment would be far away from the dorms/classes."
College Freshman,1,the dorms are terrible. you for sure are not getting your moneys worth
College Freshman,1,way too many hills. you think you can handle it until a mounth later your sick of it.
College Junior,1,"Since I have started at Mars Hill, I have had 3 different financial officers. I have been there 3 years starting in 2010 summer. I have had problems with my financial aid out of the 9 semester including summers 5 of those. If I was you I would keep copies of everything and keep copies of all emails from the financial aid office."
College Senior,1,"nothing at convenient, subway, oshaka, and the wagon wheel are walking distance but may take about 20 mins there is a waffle house as well but we are in dier need of some fast food like come on town of mars hill.."
College Freshman,1,"The campus doesn't have a whole lot to do, but the best place to go is Ashville"
College Freshman,1,"The closest place is the Waffal House that is down the road, and it is so nasty."
College Sophomore,1,"The Lion's Den is good, but it is overpriced for the amount of food that you get. the dining hall is disgusting, except for when they make patty melts. The dining staff is very nice and they really try to make the food decent, but there is only so much they can do with the bad quality food."
College Senior,1,There is not really any public transportation options around Mars Hill. If you need to get any where other than campus it requires having a car or asking for a ride.
College Junior,1,"There is no public transportation in the town of Mars Hill, so if you want to be able to go anywhere you must have you own mode of transportation."
College Student,1,There is no off-campus housing offered and the closest town is about 20 minutes from campus.  It is not recommended at all.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks Are Not Worth the Time â There is no housing offered.  The fraternities and sororities are also not as popular as on larger campuses.
College Sophomore,1,They had to ask me whether or not i was living on campus AFTER i moved in and school had started. They add additional charges with out accurately explaining what they are from. They cut academic scholarships if you live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The departmental scholarships for arts were all taken away except for the athletes, they still get a lot of money."
College Sophomore,1,It is too expensive for the lack of quality we receive as students.
College Freshman,1,"Mars Hill parking availability is absolutely inconvenient and unjustified. There have been many instances where my room mate has to literally search the whole campus just to find a parking space only to realize it is at least a mile from her dorm. You would think they would not have a problem to make enough parking spaces for everyone since our college is so small. Of course if you are a commuter there are plenty of spaces available, but if you live on campus and drive a car, be sure to come back early from where ever you are going because by 7:00 all the spaces will practically be taken."

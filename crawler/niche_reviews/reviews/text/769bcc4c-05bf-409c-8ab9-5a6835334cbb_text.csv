Sophomore,5,"I greatly enjoyed my experience as a student at College of the Ouachitas. The curriculum is easy to follow through and there are many student lead organizations that help you engage with others. Along with having a friendly staff and engaging classes, it is also an institution that is affordable in accordance with tuition and books. Also if one finds themselves struggling financially throughout the semester, they can visit the ""COTO Pantry"" and get the things that they need at little to no cost to them."
Freshman,5,I am starting my nursing career again at this school. I have only heard good things about them. The Dean and teachers all seem eager to help us become great nurses. I am looking forward to graduating in December 2019. Then returning for my RN also.
Freshman,5,I love the fact that your teachers want to see you succeed. The program that I am currently taking is the LPN course. I love the fact that you have to be an LPN before you can even apply for the RN class. That way you have an experience with dealing with people and caring for your patients
Junior,5,COTO is a great local college. No need to commute or pay twice the price per credit hour when you're working on GenEd courses. Most courses transfer to 4 year schools and many courses are offered online or hybrid.
Freshman,5,"Great local college, very affordable and the admissions and financial aid people  have been very helpful so far."
College Junior,5,They take time to make sure you understand

College Sophomore,5,"I Have a Part Time Job – i have a part time job and i got to school its very hard for me, and money is very tight."
Niche User,4,"I'm a high school student that is taking classes at College of the Ouachitas on some scholarships that the college has offered through my school to get a head start on my basic classes. The class schedules were really flexible and I was able to fit them into my school day pretty easily. The professors that I have are among the best that I have, and I'm excelling in both of the classes that I'm taking (Freshman Composition I and College Algebra, which are both arguably challenging as fundamental classes). The school is fairly cheap as well, and although there isn't a large selection of programs, it's a great choice if you're looking to save some money on your basic classes."
Sophomore,4,At college of the Ouachitas the professors are very nice in many aspects. They have expectations of you but they dont make them impossible to accomplish. They push you to do your best in every aspect and give you the right push you need. They are always there when you need them. They will help you on anything in which your struggling in. It's a safe and friendly environment. All the student are nice and helpful. We have on campus other studies who volunteer there time to help tutor other studies which is a really good benefit because it helps a lot.
Freshman,4,"I liked the fact that the coursework is rigorous. You will definitely have to use your brain when you're in any class at COTO. The atmosphere is calm, with very little student activity or engagement. Something that should change, is the student diversity. It kind of feels weird being in an non-diverse environment. This school , COTO lacks minorities."
Freshman,4,"College of the Ouachitas is a great community college. It is in a remote area. During the lunch hour, there are many fast food restaurants near by and also a park to relax and/or do homework. College of the Ouachitas also have a room with WiFi to do homework, eat, and get to know a few classmates. The classrooms are also easy to find."
Junior,4,The school is okay and there are a lot of nice people attending and teachers. I would like for it to be more activities for the students to get involved in.
College Junior,4,I have not dealt with this yet
College Senior,4,Everyone is very respectful and full of enthuasism
College Senior,4,The tuition is very reasonable compared to other schools.  The FASFA process is quick and easy.

College Junior,4,Great School – I feel like this colleg is a great one and they are fair with tuition cost and finalcial aid process.
College Junior,4,"Everthing is great, everyone is very helpful, and friendly."
College Senior,2,"I was told on two different occasions in 2014 , that the money showing 4000.00 available on my FAFSA letter that I presented to financial aid officer during our visit, would in fact be there. I was chosen from an alternate list very late in the game . I received my acceptance letter on December 20th. The college was closed until January 5th. On January 5th I was there only to find out that my financial aid was in fact NOT there, with the exception of 720.00 only. Because I have reached my limit. Had I known , I could have applied for scholarships as I have a 3.29 GPA (also completed the LPN program with a 3.85 in 2002-2003). But , since I had no idea there would be no PELL available I had not applied for any other funds and was told it was too late because all of the scholarships have been given out already. I was forced as my ONLY option to apply for loans on January 7th in the hopes that money will be there by January 9th because classes start for me Tuesday January 13th. I still have only 720.00 funding available for greater than 1900.00 costs of attendance."
College Freshman,2,"Tuition is affordable for a resident, but the tuition for out-of-state and international students is highly overpriced, what influences low level of diversity in my college. Financial aid process is long and complicated, variety of scholarships is also poor. Also programs like federal work-study are hard to start. But with a federal or state scholarship there is no problem."
Freshman,1,"Financial aid is Horrible Very unorganized.  The nursing program is horrible. The nursing instructors test above the level that they are teaching . They are always failing nursing students, the content they focus on isn’t even on the exams. Tutors can’t be contacted calls and emails never returned. All a scheme to make students repeat classes so they can rake in more dough!"
Works Here,1,"Terrible service to students, calls and emails aren’t returned. Not recommended. Students are a bother to administration.  I worked there and I definitely would not recommend it. It’s a waste of tax dollars."
College Senior,1,again. financial aid I was told was available was NOT available. I was told 4000.00 would be there . only 720 was there because I have reach my limit. But I was not told that until the day of registration. It was too late to apply for scholarships despite my 3.29 GPA . Now I pray for my loan apps to be approved/ dispersed in only two to three days remaining before classes start. I still have on books.
College Senior,1,"The entire process of registration as far as my personal experience is concerned turned something that should have been fairly easy, albeit complicated into something that was so very nerve wrecking and stressful that I have been physically ill at times. This was all due to two things: 1. complications / misinformation provided through financial aid 2. the late date at which I was chosen from the alternate list and received my acceptance letter into the program.  These two factors all but destroyed my chances of any financial aid / funding.  If ones financial aid is not correct and the funding is not available then ones six months of efforts to accomplish all other requirements for the LPN to RN fast track program are in vain. A physical, emotional , and financial waste if my loans don't ""come through"" in two more work days. And then who knows when I would be able to re-test and return. I even resigned from full time employment to PRN employment in order to be more successful in my studies.  Yes, at this point I would say the ""worst""."

Freshman,5,"Awesome faculty especially in the engineering and physics department. They love to help and guide you with whatever you need. In terms of college life, It just doesn't feel the same with Covid-19 but people are still welcoming and friendly inside the community."
Freshman,5,Online curriculum is pretty well laid out and makes it easy to follow along despite the obvious learning barriers.
Sophomore,5,"Campus is great, small classes make it easy to learn, proximity to New York City makes it easy to go exploring with friends"
Sophomore,5,Love this school! Most professors are inspiring and helpful- but make sure to check rate your professor before signing up for a course. Some professors can be tricky. Beautiful campus as well. Great community.
Sophomore,5,Online classes were very interesting. Professors put loads of effort into their virtual classes. Some technical difficulties arose but luckily lectures are recorded and accessible at any time.
Freshman,5,"After COVID-19 occurred, most of my classes were transferred to online courses, for which I had a pleasant experience because the classes were concise and organized. Even though the work load had doubled, the teachers at Manhattan College were  very understanding with the current situation happening in the world and would give extensions on work and would try to acknowledge everyone about how they were doing in class and whether or not they needed help, etc."
Freshman,5,"I love my Manhattan College experience, I was a bit surprised because Manhattan College was not my first choice but it should have been because it was the type of school that I had been looking for. The campus is amazing, the people (a.k.a. the students and faculty) are beyond nice. There are different places for the students to study including an internet cafe with a balcony and a big library with 5 floors."
Senior,5,"I really like how they care about their students.  They really try to go out of there a way to help you succeed /strive in life.  They really try to provide the best quality education to ensure that there students succeed where ever they are at.  Overall, Manhattan College is just such an amazing and peaceful community."
Alum,5,"I completed my master's degree at Manhattan College recently. My experience there was everything I wanted and more. Faculty and staff are very warm and kind, the students are very helpful and nice to one another and everyone works together very well. I've had professors that went above and beyond for their students, including helping us tackle challenging homework assignments late nights during the week. Everyone here has positive outlooks and really cares about each other's success, and I felt so happy and comfortable while I was here. I went to a very large school for my undergrad degree and wish I had just gone to Manhattan as class sizes are much smaller and the learning is much better. VERY highly recommend... this place became a second home to me."
Freshman,5,"I am in my freshman year second semester. So far being at Manhattan College, it is more than what I expected it to be. I love how the College is diverse inside the classrooms as well as on campus. Manhattan College is located in the Bronx which is not far from the city which I enjoy as well in case I would like to go walking in the city. My major is one of the most sought out majors on campus."
Junior,5,"I love Manhattan College. The professors all want you to succeed and I have been given opportunities to grow academically, socially, and as a person."
Freshman,5,I love this college and are very happy here.  I've participated in a lot of service opportunities here. Manhattan College opened my eyes to the importance of giving back
Freshman,5,"I am very happy with my choice of Manhattan College.  The smaller campus and class sizes make it easier to get to know people and to connect with professors.  There is a very friendly vibe on campus.  Lots of opportunities to network with alumni, and great location in NYC."
Junior,5,The professors seem to care more than any High School teachers I've come in contact with. Living on-campus is great. The food in Locke's cafeteria is about a 3/5 but there is a kitchen so if you don't like the food you are always welcome to make your own. The hours of the dining hall are great and when you live in either Lee Horan or C-Block you have an unlimited swipes meal plan. Student life is very fulfilling.
Freshman,5,"Manhattan College is a phenomenal school which has a place for everybody. The values and morals at this college is something that all students can relate to. The majors and education provided at this college is also very well reviewed. Professors here love their work and actually care about their students. Community is a big part of this campus as well, which gives students many opportunities to attend social events and be a part of campus life. What I love most about Manhattan College is that they really prepare you for your career. Through internships, meetings, and interviews, I have the utmost confidence that I will be in a good foundation for a career job once I graduate."
Graduate Student,5,"The best thing about Manhattan College is the community of both teachers and students. The school is small, about 4,000 undergraduate students who are diverse, friendly, and so open-minded. At this school I have found life-time friends, and teachers who have inspired and assisted my growth in ways that I hope to inspire my own students one day."
Graduate Student,5,"Great experience with a lot of interactions from the teachers. The classes were very small which gave us a closer relationship with the teachers. I did not attend parties all that much, but I did study a lot which paid off.  The curriculum here was great, learned a lot, and it was right next to Manhattan, which is the heart of Civil Engineering. This gave me an experience that I couldn't find anywhere else, and definitely put my foot in the door, over other schools."
Freshman,5,"It is good,the professor is funny, always make it fun when I am in class. The campus is safe.I've loved my experience at MC! The professors and classes are amazing, the professors want their students to succeed and are very helpful in and out of the classroom. The learning environment in very friendly and opening. Also, the location is amazing, and provides for great experiencesI have had a great experience at Manhattan College. The only thing that needs to change is how expensive it is,especially if you live on campus and have to pay one price for room and board when you could eat cheaper on your own. There are no food plan options, everyone pays 15010.00 a year for your spot in a dorm and food, even if you don't eat there."
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman at Manhattan college next fall and couldn't be more thrilled. I have been around the school since the 7th grade with all intention of attending the school. The community is great, the faculty shows much care for their students, and they do an amazing job at preparing students for the rest of their lives in a career."
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the people who showed us around the school was very nice. I think they have the best campus in New York along with Mercy College. I would like to see more diversity and it be more affordable. I really wanted to come to this school but I didn’t want to take out extended loans just to come here. I may come here for there graduated program.
Freshman,5,"Through the time I spent at manhattan college, I can safely say that it is definatly one of, if not the best school in New York. The campus is absolutely stunning and the older building are being rennovated to depict a modern design. As for extracurricular activities, Manhattan college has an abundance to choose from. Some of which range from course based to sports based and even culture based."
Sophomore,5,"Manhattan's great location provides endless opportunity. There are so many jobs and internships available in NYC as well as restaurants, bars and entertainment for the weekends. All the students are friendly, and professors very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"I've loved my experience at MC! The professors and classes are amazing, the professors want their students to succeed and are very helpful in and out of the classroom. The learning environment in very friendly and opening. Also, the location is amazing, and provides for great experiences."
Freshman,5,I love MC it is a close knit community and i feel like i belong. there many opportunities to get involved both in out of campus.  the only downside is the commute into the city.
Junior,5,"I love Manhattan College! I feel so welcomed here by all staff, faculty, students, neighboring community members, etc. This area of NYC is perfect because it offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle while still providing convenient and easy access into the city via the subway system. I am proud to tell people I attend Manhattan College. Go Jaspers!"
Freshman,5,Manhattan College is a school with a great environment and bright community. The campus uses up all its area efficiently with everything we need. Its next to the 1 train and 9 bus and this makes it very convenient. The school is 20 minutes away from Manhattan and Yonkers. Overall it's a great institute and I'm happy with what I received.
Senior,5,"Well known and respected school in New York City, Manhattan College opens a plethora of opportunities for its students and graduates."
Alum,5,"Fantastic education. Brilliant Professors. Close to the heart of the city. Comfortable dorms. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to experience NYC, but not live in center of the city."
Sophomore,5,"I like that the school is not huge, and students are just a number. You get to know the teachers, and they know you. Advisors know you by name and is a small big family.  Teachers are very knowledgeable and the school has great connections for internships, and summer jobs. I also like that you are not forced into a major. You have an opportunity to switch at any time, and in my case, you can complete your master's degree in 5 years."
Alum,5,I could not have had a better college experience. Manhattan is a great school full of great people. I was an athlete and education major and from day one the school fealt like a community.
Niche User,5,"I visited this school last Friday and I actually liked it a lot. Before visiting, a few of my friends told me I would hate it and that it was not a nice school. Right when I stepped foot on the campus, I had no idea what they were talking about. As I toured the school, I fell in love with it more. It seems like everyone knows everyone. Each place I would go, my guide was waving and saying hi to everyone. Students stopped me and told me that Manhattan is a great school and I should attend it. It made me feel warm and welcomed."
Niche User,5,Manhattan College is a very productive and interactive school with a great environment. Students have great professors to guide them and help them become great professionals. 
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors really care about my success, connecting with the professors have brought forth lots of opportunities for me. They're tough when it comes to learning, but very supportive, inspirational, and positive at the same time."
Recent Alumnus,5,"A very safe campus, admin does their best to constantly monitor and ensure the safety of all of the students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I'm currently doing my Masters in Organizational Leadership (MSOL) at Manhattan College; about to graduate in a month! It's been a long and hard journey juggling a full time job and a tough, yet reasonable, work load from the MSOL program. Overall, I've grown a lot from the guided learning. I chose the program in which we are required to physically come to class at Manhattan College; I'm so happy I chose this path since I enjoyed the in-person learning, made great friends, and life-long connections. The class size was excellent, 12:1, it's the perfect ratio for students to engage in fulfilling discussion, and get the attention we need from the professor. I could see that the program did their best to select faculty members that come from the best of the best in their field, I genuinely learned a lot and had a great experience. It's been my privilege to attend this gorgeous campus and learn from the faculty."
College Sophomore,5,Our basketball team is one of the best in the tri state
College Sophomore,5,"Manhattan college is the best option, just a little overpriced"
College Freshman,5,"This school is amazing, my absolute dream school. I would not want to be anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,"I love Chrysostom hall. I am so close to everything and have the best community I could have asked for here. While the room is tiny, it has forced the students to make friends with everyone around them because they are constantly going in and out and have the door open. It's just the environment here to make friends with everyone."
Recent Alumnus,5,All professors set me up with great connections
Recent Alumnus,5,I had the best 4 years at Manhattan!
Recent Alumnus,5,I made the best possible decision by going to MC!
College Sophomore,5,I love the people there they are so family oriented.
College Freshman,5,I have met a lot of people that I like. It is very friendly and I like the easy access to New York City as well as the more residential area that surrounds the college
College Senior,5,"I'm not sure if I simply was dealt a good hand when it came to roommates, professors, and housing, or if I made the most of my experience; but I am in love with my school. I am so happy I chose Manhattan College. Having small classes has helped me feel like I am already working in my industry. I see my professors as mentors and employers. I have had the chance to live in New York City and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I feel as if I am so much more responsible and ready to take on the real world. Having the opportunity to intern in Manhattan during the year really helps get a foot in the door. When it comes to my social life, I can enjoy a comedy show or live music in a jazz bar. My options are limitless and the city is my playground. I think my college experience went above and beyond what most people (including myself) would expect from a small school in the Bronx."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved attending Manhattan College. I graduated in 2014 and still live in the Riverdale/Bronx area. I have made the best friends, have a great job in NYC and had an fun time while learning so much at this school."
College Freshman,5,Best deli really is the best.
College Senior,5,Engineering is hard but the professors make it easier.
College Sophomore,5,"The class size is small, the work is not too overpowering and the registration process is simple except you have to wake up at 7am. The class size, being no more than 25 kids, is one of the reasons I picked this school. It feels like it's pretty much one on one which helps a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is friends with one another. No matter your race, political or religious beliefs, or sexual orientation you can always find a friend on campus. Everyone, including teachers, are extremely understanding and there to lend a hand."
College Sophomore,5,"Our school comes together as one during basketball season. I, being the school photographer, see everyone come together and cheer on their school, hoping Manhattan comes out on top. In all honesty, the school's main focus sports wise is Basketball; the other sports are not noticed by many. Our gym doesn't seem like a normal college gym but taking into consideration we have about 3000 people attending, we're not a normal college itself. Although the students at Manhattan College mainly show their support during basketball season, everyone has school spirit there, all year round."
College Junior,5,So far I was able to land a nice paid summer internship.
College Junior,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus and I use common sense when I'm off campus, especially at night. That's all there is to it."
College Junior,5,The civil engineering program is great because it's small and the professors know your name. It's challenging like every other civil engineering curriculum but help is always available when you ask. Having such a small program with such successful professors helps make connections and internship opportunities are great as long as you have the drive to get one.
College Junior,5,Seriously I advertise for the Philosophy Department because they are just that amazing. Challenging? Of course! But nothing that someone who truly care about what they are learning can't handle.
College Junior,5,"I LOVE my major. Every single one of my professors is amazing and their teaching skills are incredible. They're really concerned about my future and I know they will do anything in their power to help me get to where I want to go in life. I want to teach and learning from my teachers is very inspiring. This goes for not only the Philosophy department, but the Psychology, Spanish, English and Religion departments."
College Junior,5,"It's New York City, even if it is the Bronx, Manhattan is only a few train stops away. There are endless things to do in the city."
College Sophomore,5,"Living in a suite will give you more space but also more security and more people. The traditional dorms are good for a sense of community -- you will definitely know everyone on your floor and probably become friends with all of them. Chrysostom does not have A/C which sucks and the rooms are SO SMALL but the sense of community there is unlike any other. Jasper is like Chrysostom just bigger with A/C. If you don't want security looming over your shoulder pick one of those (great for parties, no bag checks). All dorms are close to classrooms -- it shouldn't take you longer than 4 minutes to get to class from your dorm, unless you have to go to Leo."
College Sophomore,5,"Living ""in"" NYC is great, but you do have to take the subway to be in Manhattan -- the school is in the Bronx, don't forget that. But if you're smart you can find fun things to do in the city and around campus."
College Sophomore,5,"The Sociology department is awesome. The professors are all really cool. The workload varies by professor, but you can expect to have a decent amount of work."
Freshman,4,My professors were very understanding with deadlines and assignments since everyone was going through such a hectic time. They would give open deadlines and reassure me that I'm doing okay. A big help that I got from a few of my professors was constant communication so I was always on the same page with them. This helped me with my assignments and finishing them early/on time.
Sophomore,4,"After school closed due to COVID-19, I felt that a few professors weren’t fully prepared to move online, but many took the change in stride and helped us continue learning. Online summer classes were very good."
Junior,4,"The professor and faculty are hands on. Whenever you need help they are an email away. As for the courses there is not a big selection but, the ones offered are very interesting with professors who are devoted and dedicated to what they teach."
Sophomore,4,"Enjoyable small campus community, good location, good people. Food could be better and so couldn't the party scene but classes are enjoyable and flexible."
Freshman,4,"As an education major at Manhattan College I feel I am receiving a very good education. I just completed my first semester and so far have been very satisfied with my professors, classes, and experiences I’ve had so far. The staff at the school is outstanding and always helpful. Although, If you are looking for a party school, this is not the school for you. It’s a very small school. There is not much to do in the area surrounding the campus, but the 1 train is right off campus."
Freshman,4,A relatively small college that ensures the academic success of its students. The community around is very healthy and supportive. Till now it has been a very enjoyable journey and hoping for the best for the upcoming future.
Niche User,4,When I went in for a tour I enjoyed exploring the campus and the college is overall a great college choice.
Junior,4,"Manhattan College is a great lasallian institution that enables vigorous students to fulfill their academic careers. I highly recommend this college for their high achieving education department. The faculty in the education department are resourceful, knowledgeable, and motivational. The program sets students on track to be the best teacher in their field. Moreover, the program also allows you the opportunity of going out into the education field to gain the necessary experience needed to be an amazing teacher. Students are given the opportunity to observe and work in classrooms that focus on their concentration. Throughout my educational career at Manhattan College I have made great friendships that also contribute to my success."
Sophomore,4,"I have had nothing but an incredible academic experience at Manhattan College. While there are things about the school that could be improved or changed in other aspects, the academic experience has been great."
Alum,4,"Be accepted, do your work, graduate and you will be employed at an A+ company with an above average starting pay. The good jobs are in NY Metro and Manhattan offers that opportunity. This is not a party environment although the opportunity exists off-campus if you want to go that route."
Freshman,4,"It’s a beautiful campus with great people. The experience so far has been some what good but if you’re a commuter, you feel really left out. After all, as a college student that isn’t the biggest priority but it is something that could matter to some people."
Freshman,4,For me Manhattan college is all about community. Everyone there is so helpful and kind. Professors are amazing. They work well with students all the time. I really enjoy Manhattan college.
Freshman,4,Attending this school is the best choice I have ever made! I truly feel that I belong in MC and I have made so many friends. This is a great school with a safe and tight-knit community! People look out for you at this school with connections and work for in your field. The professors are great and understanding! I love my school.
Sophomore,4,"This college is great, but the classrooms needs to upgraded. The environment is fun and the students are great. The college is very expensive. It hard for commuters to associate because most of the programs are very late."
Junior,4,I like that Manhattan has a strong community presence and that most people are friendly. There are a lot of great lectures that happen on campus so you should most definitely attend ones that interest you. What I would like to see change are the living arrangements and the options for food on campus.
Niche User,4,"Over the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity of participating in the Manhattan College Women and Minority Engineering program. I felt very comfortable in the environment and learned a lot about the professors. Being able to engage in a conversation with them made me realize this is a place where I can see myself grow academically and socially. Also, the work connections Manhattan College has for the students is great since, most students obtain an internship by junior year. I figured out this college is the college where I can study civil engineering and accomplish my goals."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience at Manhattan College. The only thing that needs to change is how expensive it is,especially if you live on campus and have to pay one price for room and board when you could eat cheaper on your own. There are no food plan options, everyone pays  15010.00 a year for your spot in a dorm and food, even if you don't eat there."
Sophomore,4,"Manhattan College is a small institution with a strong community. Having a small amount in the classroom develop a strong connection with professors as well as classmates. Professors show an interest for the student inside and outside of class. Its location offers numerous opportunities for internships in New York City. Manhattan College promotes a strong Lassalian leadership. Lassalian is not necessarily a Catholic term, it represents the values that the institution promotes in order for students to become productive members of society."
Freshman,4,"It's a small school so you get to know everyone quickly, the professors are very helpful. The campus is very cute but all on a hill so there are a lot of stairs!"
Junior,4, Manhattan College is a great small college. The professors care about teaching and students learning. They expect you to ask for help and see them outside of class.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Manhattan College may not have the prestige of an NYU, but it is definitely a great college. The school is rising in ranks, and the kids attending starting to become the top kids at their high schools. One of the only gripes I have with the school is the facilities. Some of them, such as the Engineering building, has to be upgraded"
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network is very good.
College Sophomore,4,The administrators have gone above and beyond what I expected to help me resolve any issues or problems I have had.
College Senior,4,"The professors I have had so far are great and the courses are quite interesting! I would however appreciate more variety in terms of the course options offered in my major(chemical engineering) as one approaches junior and senior year as the focus now petroleum, which is great but not all the students are interested in joining an oil company after graduation. It is understandable though, that the choices are less because the department is quite small and intimate which is reflected with the number of professors available.  I love the small class sizes because they make it easier to learn the material being taught and the professors are more accessible for office hours."
College Senior,4,"The career center regularly emails and posts available jobs/interships on the school website, which helps with the job searching as you have somewhere to begin. The center is also open to review student resumes and cover letters. They also offer mock interviews and rent out interview suits. There are a number of career fairs and panels held often for the students to meet prospect employers."
College Senior,4,In general I feel safe while on campus. There are emergency calling boxes (not sure what they are called) in different sections of the school just in case anything happens. I.Ds are required while entering some of the school buildings like the library and dorms. Also security guards are often seen around the school campus. It is also very easy to report any problem including lost property to the security office. The security office will normally notify the school students and staff immediately of any crime or loss. A kind person once found my card and took it the security office who emailed me immediately.
College Senior,4,"This was was one of my top schools and I am very glad I made it in. With advice from an alumni, my high school assistant principal, I'm certain I made the right choice. I especially like the smaller more intimate classroom settings offered here, with easy access to the professors.  The professors all have office hours either set or by appointment and are always willing to help. Also all the disciplines have different clubs associated to them making it easy for students to join and interact with students of similar interests. There hasn't been a meal plan for commuters like myself but there is one being implemented this coming semester, which I'm excited about because it was a challenge having to pay out of pocket each time you needed to buy something on campus."
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors I have had so far have been good. They're very approachable and willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,The perks of going to school in New York City make it easier to create connections.
College Junior,4,Great and fun and nice environment to mingle and study
College Junior,4,In the city  there is a plethora of options for jobs.
College Junior,4,Great courses and really nice professors who encourage class discussions.
College Freshman,4,We don't have any greek life.
College Freshman,4,"Most crimes are often reported and the campus stays within the law. There are security guards in the school, such as Kelly commons, and ID is required in some areas of the school, such as the library. The blue light system  gives access to help in emergency situations occurring on campus. I normally feel safe when I am on the campus and when I go home."
College Freshman,4,The internships given out are helpful for finding a career and being inspired to work towards specific jobs in the future. On-campus jobs are helpful for earning a paycheck . The career center helped with searching for jobs that would accept my resume.
College Freshman,4,Professors are knowledgeable in the courses they teach and helpful to questions asked in confusion on a subject. Each of the courses has a variety of timeslots and can be easily fit into a certain schedule each semester.
College Freshman,4,My school gives the freedom to choose the schedule and includes many events and clubs I can join. There are constantly internships available on the school email which helps me with my career options. I would choose it again to enjoy my time here again.
College Junior,4,Most people went to the city to party since it was only a train ride away. New York is awesome for different nightlife types. Bars are prevalent and so are clubs.
College Freshman,4,I never feel unsafe at Manhattan College. The Campus Security officers are very friendly but take their jobs very seriously which many people appreciate. I have never needed to call them and hope I never have to but I know that they would be there for me anytime I need for anything I feel unsafe or uncomfortable about. They are also very good at sending out emails and informing the campus about things like storm warnings or things that have happened on campus. I have never seen them slack at their job and they always go above and beyond to make sure people feel safe.
College Freshman,4,Courses here are pretty great. I wish they went more in depth but that will come as I venture into harder classes (still just a freshman). The professors are very diverse and encouraged to express themselves so there is no shortage of character here. I also have so many resources here if I am never understanding a class I can get help right away.
College Freshman,4,Greek life on campus is not big at all. Two frats and two sororities but no houses on campus because in the NYC area it is illegal to have more than 6+ girls living in one house because then it is considered a brothel. So frats are not allowed to have houses either to make it fair. But one great thing about the greek life here as opposed to other campuses is how welcoming they are to non-greeks and vice versa. No rivalry among sororities or fraternities and no added drama that they normally bring at other schools.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy it here. The people are amazing and I feel like I joined a real community coming here. If you are willing to go out and join groups or clubs or activities then it is amazing being at Manhattan College. It really is what you make it and I know I chose the right school for me.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Security is good at Manhattan, especially in dorms"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great student involvement, always a great outcome at sporting events, especially basketball games.  School spirit is high, great energy!"
College Freshman,4,"I don't know much about the crime rate at school. I never heard of anyone being assaulted, but there are gaurds everywhere and blue light systems so I'm assuming that helps."
College Freshman,4,"Athletes are definitely given special treatment, but it's worth it when I go to a basketball game and there is a sea of fans chanting and laughing together."
College Freshman,4,The classes this semester mirrored the AP classes I took in high school. They gave me a chance to transition into life on my own. I have made the most incredible friends who help me through everything. I would definitely pick Manhattan again.
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman but I love it so far. I wanted to come to a school that was close to the city, but also had a campus feel."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love it here. I strongly dislike the college I originally went to and I knew the moment I stepped on campus that this was the place I was going to finish out my degree. The people here are so nice, it's unimaginable. The professor's really go out of their way to help you."
College Junior,4,"I have made so many great friends! I wish that my school had a theater major and had more theater/music opportunities, but I'm working hard to make that possible. Some people are very close minded. It is very catholic, but most don't attend church. I really like the teachers and easily found a job that I love and make enough money to live by!"
College Sophomore,4,"My school is one of the best engineering colleges in the United States, it presents a very challenging curriculum that not everyone can handle."
College Freshman,4,Best deli is within a 5 minute walking distance and has great food.
College Freshman,4,It's very easy to have a visitor last minute.
College Freshman,4,You absolutely need a fake ID. Parties are rare and get busted pretty easily. Manhattan College is 100% a bar school.
College Freshman,4,"I loved the suite-style way of living, but I wish people in Horan and East Hill talked to everyone on the floors I can't wait until I'm an upperclassmen so I can live in the off-campus apartments."
College Freshman,4,I think their policies are just perfect.
College Freshman,4,"Situated near to the city, and not far from suburbia."
College Freshman,4,All i need is Thai and Sushi choices.
College Junior,4,The only crummy part about off-campus dining is how expensive it can get. But it's MUCH better than on-campus food.
College Junior,4,"I personally prefer partying in the dorm rooms, but it's a lot of fun regardless."
Niche User,2,"Good for academics, professors basically; no party scene at all, if there is, clubs are terrible, toxic coaching staff all around the sports department, bureaucracy is very very annoying, they keep telling you to pay stuff the whole time, every day there is something new; dorms suck as well, I wouldn’t recommend going there"
Alum,2,"This place is UNCOMMON for sure, but not in the ways they advertise. Overall administration is a series of bureaucratic hoops and getting anything done that is unique or uncommon is impossible. Overall the professors are great and you will have the opportunity to create a personal connection with them; administration is the opposite. At the end of the day you are a $ to this institution. 
Athletics department is extremely weak and brought down by toxic leadership and self promotion. They are only concerned about their losing basketball program and hiding from the systematic problems that plague the entire operation. This can been seen through the endless mill of new hire coaches that only stay for a couple seasons and the crumbling facilities. 
The entire college is so concerned with its outward appearance, but it's all just lipstick on a pig. Don't be fooled by social media or any claims they make."
Freshman,2,"2 stars one for the school of education because classes and professors are great in there and one star for the nyc location that’s the only good things this school has to offer. The dinning hall and food situation is really confusing that the tuition is so high but the food here is so awful. You will be better off spending all your money at the nearby options for food than to risk having to miss your classes because your stomach is so messed up from the food. Another thing that sucks is the residence life staff/RA’s that try to make up fake charges and violations on you any chance they get in order to have you pay their fines and take your money and you can barely even have guest. Lastly, this school is definitely not diverse it is 90% white if you live on the campus. All the black and Spanish kids are commuter students."
Alum,2,Terrible administration and not worth the money to come here for chemical engineering. The department is not that great.
Senior,2,I didn't like my experience here. It's not a great atmosphere for commuter students and the chemical engineering department is not great. Not worth coming here for all the money you have to pay.
College Sophomore,2,"There are only a few sororities and fraternities, making them rather low key."
College Junior,2,"No one participates in greek life, it is frowned upon to be in greek life."
College Junior,2,"Well for a school located in a very diverse borough, it certainly doesn't show. But I really can't blame them for it. It is, after all located in Riverdale, which also has one of the higher median incomes of New York. So mostly affluent individuals live there and it could be expected that mostly affluent kids go to that school. Obviously there are different ethnic groups. From what I've seen mostly white/Caucasian. But there is a good amount of Latinos/Latinas there. I'd say they are the next largest ethnic group there but are still significantly dwarfed by the white/Caucasian ethnic group. Aside from that I've seen a few Black/African-American kids here and there, as well as Asians. But white/Caucasians are definitely the visual majority."
College Junior,2,I don't really partake in those activities so I can't really say but from what I see they don't really do anything or much for the school. I haven't really met many people who are part of the fraternities or sororities at my school. And from what I've heard they're mostly good for parties thrown. Greek life at my school is the complete opposite from what I've seen in movies and television shows.
College Sophomore,2,Only like 3 on campus
College Sophomore,2,Definitely not worth the cost to live there. Over spring break I had to pay to stay in the dorms since I couldn't afford to fly home and some of the workers came into my room without knocking at all three days in a row to set/check mouse traps since the whole building was infested. Three mice died in my room.
College Sophomore,2,"My experience with this school has been pretty bad overall. I moved all the way from Washington state to the Bronx for this school and it left me frustrated and dissatisfied. When you go to visit for events the food is amazing and the atmosphere is amazing but actually being there it completely different. I have found moldy bread in the case that they very rarely restock and generally your only options between noon and 4pm are sandwiches you make yourself or cereal, and even then they're out of milk a lot of the time. The dorms aren't that great either. Some of the dorm buildings are so old that you're afraid to take the elevator for fear of getting stuck (which happened to me multiple times). The people at the school aren't diverse at all. Almost exclusively rich white catholic kids who have been handed everything on a silver platter their entire lives. If you come from a background with any struggling involved, there are very few people on campus who you'll be able to relate with. Even the teachers assume that everyone's parents are paying every cent of the outrageous cost for this school. Getting anything done with the administration is difficult too. I emailed the dean of my school which was pretty small and they never got back to me about anything I asked them about. This school is very overpriced and overhyped and I wish I had known what I know now before I was sent into massive debt to go here."
College Freshman,2,For a division 1 program they do not have adequate facilities or money.
College Junior,2,"We advertise to be a ""diverse"" school, but the only diverse thing about us is the basketball team. Besides that, most of the non-white students are commuters and do not feel as included in the college's activities. Besides this fact, everyone is, for the most part, very respectful of other people's backgrounds."
College Junior,2,Only reently was an LGBT club founded on campus. Students don't seem to be accepting of it or really care.
College Sophomore,2,I don't understand why campus is so strict with security. They seem to push us off campus to cause havoc in the community because they don't want responsibility. Not like most campuses for sure.
College Sophomore,2,They don't really have a presence on or off campus
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are very strict, you can sneak alcohol in but if you're having people in your room it cannot be very loud."
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing in Manhattan is incredibly expensive, for what your options are. The areas around the school aren't very safe either so it is not worth the money or risk."
College Freshman,2,"I don't see the security doing anything useful, sorry I might just be ungrateful. They might be doing such a great job that I don't have to see them."
College Freshman,2,"Again, the city is so close yet so far away."
College Freshman,2,"The aid is alright, but just not enough for what is needed to get through smoothly."
College Freshman,2,"There is no night life, this area of the Bronx can feel very dead if you do not have a car or know people in the area. But, I guess the school is close enough to the city."
College Junior,2,There are Greek fraternities and sororities but they aren't big around here.
College Freshman,2,There's no Greek scene compared to other schools
College Freshman,2,"We're in the Bronx so it can get a little scary at night. The bars that everyone goes too let you in; however, you must take either a gypsy cab or subway to get there, which is annoying."
College Sophomore,2,The sports aren't that popular here. Men's basketball is popular because they've had a good season.
College Sophomore,2,This school really isn't diverse in any aspect.
College Sophomore,2,My school is really boring. I commute so I see it as a hassle to go here. I would go to a bigger school. 
College Sophomore,2,There are about 3 bars that people go to each weekend. 
College Sophomore,2,It is pretty expensive to get a taxi to drive you to the Metro North Train that takes me home. It is $14.00 for a 5 minute ride.
College Sophomore,2,My school is pretty small so there isn't much to do at all.
College Junior,2,Its an old school with lo-tech and outdated equipment.
College Junior,2,"not much goes on on campus, however next year there will be a new student center that looks promising
"
College Junior,2,"Cost is a big part of it, and for what most students pay for a small apartment in the bronx, they would be able to afford a moderate sized house at a larger school where surrounding real estate is not as expensive.  Students on average can pay anywhere from $500 to $900 per person per month on rent alone."
College Junior,2,"The only parking on campus is a parking garage across the street from main campus.  Otherwise, off campus parking is hard to find in the Bronx."
College Freshman,2,"I thought the whole point of Greek life was to be a part of a secret society that does good and promote values, and part of that has to be done through housing and living together and forming that community. There is no housing, and that is a major reason why I will not rush for a sorority. The upside is that you are not isolated from the rest of campus; you can be in a frat or sorority without giving up the connection and closeness you have with the people in the regular residence halls. "
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining frankly sucks, but I guess it could be worse."
College Sophomore,2,"The tuition for this private school is already in the higher price rage, therefore I feel that in order to have a vehicle on campus the price should be much lower."
College Freshman,2,"It rains, snows, hails and the sun also shines bright. All the classrooms are easy to get to though despite the weather."
College Freshman,2,"I will go as far as saying that Manhattan College has the worst fitness gym in the nation, including Division 3 schools. There is one lifting gym for the entire school(including the athletes) and a gym from the 1970's with out of date machines and approximately 15 treadmills under the main floor. Many high schools have better lifting gyms than this one. On another note the library is state of the art, and the basketball gym has a great field house atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,WORST FOOD EVER. the common dinning hall is terrible. there are so many station  but the food quality does not follow up. Ive had cereal more than I expected. blah.
College Junior,2,"Greek life is almost non-existent. However, the few clubs that do exist actually try to plan school events and help out the community, along with students looking for tutors, extra help, people to meet, etc."
College Senior,2,Manhattan College provides many off campus living options. There are plenty of apartments or housing to rent. The cost around the same price as on-campus housing and very easy to obtain.
College Sophomore,2,There are only two options to eat on campus. The main cafeteria gets old quickly and there are not many healthy choices to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Crime – Personally, I wouldn't walk off campus at night alone. There are many blue boxes on campus but I would get e-mails often about various crimes that would occur on and off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The Winter Season Is Horrible – Winter Season at Manhattan College is just gross! The school is located on top of a hill which makes it difficult to get to classes on time especially when a bottle neck effect occurs when you have a class down the hill (can be slippery even when it rains). On the bright side, when the flowers bloom and trees grow the campus can be very beautiful."
College Sophomore,2,"Little Recognition – There is only one sorority and two fraternities due the the small size of Manhattan College. The organizations are known to be charitable and have a good academic standing. Their fundraising efforts are notable, but they lack in being recognized as a united sorority or fraternity that have much importance in the school."
College Sophomore,2,"I think NY its not a place to use cars, but since there are people that commute then you have to pay for the parking and it is expensive or if you rather look for a parking in the street which will be almost impossible to find a spot... you can also get a parking ticket."
College Freshman,2,In one of the dorms if you walk in and appear too drunk they will call an ambulance and have you go get checked out. The security isn't too strict they just care and make sure everyone is acting the way they should be.
College Junior,2,I moved off campus to save money... What a hassle the dorms were much better and cheaper!
College Junior,2,There are two fraternitys on campus and they are not allowed to do much as far as brotherhood and pledging. The school I had attended prior was big on greek life and the overall feel i got after pledging was much stronger and more connected then my friend in a frat at manhattan.
College Senior,2,"Typical Bars – There are typical ""sketchy"" bars around campus. They're the type of bars that you would never go to if school was not in session, but since school is going on you know all of the college students will be there so you go and its actually fun if you go with friends. 

Dorm parties are nothing too serious. They're low key and fun."
College Sophomore,2,Not Enough. At Manhattan College there aren't enough Sororities and Fraternities. I believe there are 2 to 3 of them.
College Junior,2,"Expensive but Nice. Manhattan has one off campus dorm that are apartment style so not many people get their own places, but It's really expensive. It's New York City and although it may be the bronx, it's still a very expensive place to live. But they are beautiful apartments and houses in the area, if you have a lot of people living with you, then it becomes cheaper. It really depends on what you can and can't afford."
College Junior,2,"This school is long story short, famous for its reputation in engineering, not necessarily for the parties and social events of Greek life. that's not to say that there aren't a few awesome parties cause there are. its just not a dominant thing to hear about."
Niche User,2,"Parking is very difficult. You must have a decal, which is expensive, or find a spot in the area, which is never easy."
Niche User,2,"It is a noticeable part of campus life – There are a couple groups that involve themselves in drug dealing and substance abuse.  Drugs range from marijuana, cocaine, to LSD.  I feel it is a noticeable part of campus life.  We had a drug bust by cops less than a year ago inside the fifth floor of Jasper."
Niche User,2,"The majority of the student body is Irish Catholic – The campus in terms of ethnicity is not that diverse.  The majority of the student body is Irish-Catholic.  I myself am from a Hispanic background, and even that group is fairly small.  Most of the student body are very liberal as well as the professors.  A select group practice religion openly and attend Mass every Sunday."
Niche User,2,"Eat off campus – As a commuter, usually eat off campus.  Broadway Joes for pizza."
Freshman,1,"During my time at Manhattan I was bullied severely. The majority of students who come to manhattan have been taught no accountability, goodwill, or responsibility for their actions.. In middle/high school, I experienced self harm and bullying however, my school was still populated with caring and considerate people. At manhattan there is no one to turn to. The counseling center is awful, and its like everyone here has no concern for a devastating event. Girls here make fun of peoples races, economic backgrounds,  and deformities that people cannot help. You can clearly tell that the majority of students here did not have a lot of friends in high school. You can assume that theres a bunch of other schools like this but thats not true. It is only 4,000 kids, and everyone is exactly the same. . As a person who has seen people around me struggle growing up, it is clear that a lot of these kids don't hold sympathy.. Please do not come here, it destroyed me."
Freshman,1,"They love to steal your money and not do anything about problems on campus. Dorms are absolutely disgusting and maintenance takes months to be completed if they even get around to it. The food isn’t even stomach-able. The classes are terrible, I’m a freshman taking classes meant for juniors and seniors and they are almost TOO easy. Don’t waste your time and money here and just go somewhere else."
Senior,1,"This school is a miserable place to be.  The dorms are disgusting and run down, with mice, mold, and roaches. The food makes people sick. Nothing ever gets fixed, much less it a timely manner.  Unless you want to pay a ridiculous amount of money to be treated like dirt, don't come here."
Senior,1,"Manhattan College is not friendly to commuting engineering students. Commuting Engineering students are expected to park in the worst lot in the Bronx. It floods when it rains, giant icicles fall during the winter, and there are potholes so deep you will end up bottoming out our car on the weekly. If you can't find parking and decide to park in a different lot you will get a ticket for being there. If you are going to commute to Manhattan College and plan on being a Engineer you should go to another school."
College Freshman,1,this school does not have house parties and it sucks. its more of a bar life and u need a lot of money to go out. this is not a party school and people who never partied in high school think everything is fun here. but is not
College Sophomore,1,"Its horrible. We have the worst greek life. I've been around greek life for a while, the college back home, and it is nothing like it is here. It's bad."
College Sophomore,1,"The greek life at MC is a joke. No frat houses, no good parties, and everyone thinks the people in frats are weird."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is literally terrible. All dormers are forced to purchase an unlimited meal plan, so you feel guilty buying other food. The meal plan is changing somewhat but it will still be unlimited. Tip - eat food from the vegetarian section, it's made in smaller amounts and therefore tastes better. There is one dining hall that you can eat at with your meal plan, the others need cash/ Jasper Dollars."
College Sophomore,1,"Academics have gone downhill. Im guessing since we have such a ""great reputation"" that the faculty decides to stop teaching and not caring about the courses. Academics here feel like I'm in high school. The only challenging aspect is that ""professors"" decide to pour massive amounts of homework that are all due the next day, and it's a challenge to bs essays just to get them done... Professors do not teach time management and how to do assignments correctly."
College Sophomore,1,It is cold from October through April. If you hate the cold weather it is not the right school to attend.
College Sophomore,1,The Greek life is embarrassing and an embarrassment to the school.
College Freshman,1,The 1 train and bad weather don't mix well. I'm a commuter. You do the math.
College Sophomore,1,The food is bad here if you have a meal plan.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life really doesn't exist. They only do bake sales for charities.
College Junior,1,"Out of the 2 frats and 1 sorority that exist, one has a house and none of them really contribute to much of anything that I've seen.  Definitely not worth being part of at MC."
College Junior,1,"food sucks, hard to eat healthy on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"im currently a student who isnt dirt poor but isnt rich either, they did nothing to help me and i get no money. i have a great GPA and its really frustrating."
College Freshman,1,"The reason i gave the diversity rating such a low grade is because the school tends to have a lot of the same students. Economically as well and ethnically. A large majority of the school is caucasian, i would say a good 75% of the school followed by 10% asians and the last 15% are hispanics and african americans. Not to mention the fact that it is a catholic school. forced to take three religion courses and see a crucifix in every class room. But other than that, the schools not so prejudice."
College Sophomore,1,"The on campus food is horrific; however, being in NYC it is very easy to get great food nearby."
College Sophomore,1,There is not a lot of diversity at Manhattan college.

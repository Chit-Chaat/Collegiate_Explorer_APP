Freshman,5,It’s a good place to start out if you’re a first-time college student looking to go to college. I graduated in 2012 and was nervous about starting college classes but once I started at Oglala Lakota College its staff and professors made me feel good about starting my new journey in life. The size of the classes are not big and overwhelming there just the right size where you have one on one time with the professor and your able to get more work done.

A lot of native American culture and pride. best place to be when looking for your belonging. great place to study and focus a lot on your education.

This school has always been there for me to give me a second chance when I needed one.  I believe I would not be in school if Oglala Lakota College had not been there.

Recent Alumnus,5,I have attended a state college for two years prior to enrolling at OLC. I feel that I wouldn't have finished or enjoyed college as much if I haven't transferred. They are flexible with my busy life schedule as I have 3 children and also work full-time.

College Sophomore,5,"Special study options? I finally got enough nerve to go to the tutor for Math and he is so helpful.  The class registering can be done by yourself and/or go to the counselor not at the last minute, but timing means everything.  The workload is also what kind of workload there is at home or work combined with the homework.  if it is desired, good grades, good return homework has to have at least 3 hrs out of school for each subject, so that = at least 9 hrs of homework time.  Don't procrastinate, keep ahead of deadlines."
College Sophomore,5,The tuition here is very reasonable and manageable to afford.
College Sophomore,5,The system that is ran here is a very good one. This is a small college but they do make the best of it and I have no problems with how things are ran here.
College Sophomore,5,I know each one of the counselors by name and they are qualified to help with all the students.

I've bonded with my college instructors who are more than willing to help you if you're struggling or looking for extra credit."
Freshman,4,"I like my classes Im enrolled in, most of the instructors are very flexible which is good for me because i am a mother of 2, sometimes i have sick kids and sometimes i have baby sitting issues. What i would change is the housing available, dorms are available but there are only 10 in one building and they are never available to apply for."
Senior,4,"I would like the parking lot to be expanded, I also would like if OLC college students here in Rapid City could have an area where we as students can apply for an apartment. I also think that Oglala College should be able to share money with other college centers. I also think that people in office can't make rash decisions."
Freshman,4,The experience at this college is great because I'm around all Native people and the culture is unique. I would like to see more courses offered and bigger dorms.

The teachers are very passionate about their students and making sure that they succeed. Oglala Lakota College is not only about teaching the students but is also about instilling values and strong morals in their students."
College Junior,4,I believe that the school is very good at dealing with credit transfers.  I don't believe I have had a problem with the school.
College Junior,4,"I have a full load of classes, the first class I have is Human Anatomy which is a pictel class of 4 students, who are very helpful in making sure everyone has their assignments.  The teacher is in another city and teachers through online video, I see no problem only that I can't really talk to him face to face unless I call or email.  In my second class Lakota History II, I feel very involved.  Our Tribal Councilman came to our class and spoke to us about the issues on the reservation and took questions.  I enjoyed listen and participating.  It even sparked my interest in the community more.  General Psychology is a very informative class, and the teacher is very friendly and easy to talk to, I enjoy this class.  The last class is Intro to literature, it is also very informative and interesting because I like to write on my own.  I believe it will be very helpful in developing my writing skills.

I knew it was in the book but didn't understand how to do it in the computer"

College Junior,4,"I liked it, applying for scholarships out of school, they weren't much help with finding you any."
College Freshman,4,The teachers and students are all nice.
College Sophomore,2,In my experience it is very hard to get credits to transfer to the college. There is no flexibility of the classes as some are only offered once a year and the demand for them makes them very hard to get into.
College Junior,2,i only had one online class and i thought that it wasn't very good. i had very little help from my teacher and no interaction with my other classmates who were taking the same online class.
College Junior,2,We only have two computer labs where you can print your stuff from. this is a problem because most students don't have access to a home computer and printer so they come to the school to do their work and print there assignments. most of the time it is hard to use them because they have a class in them and are not able to do their work. The college needs to have more printers in the other rooms.
College Sophomore,2,Well we have to wait until the next semester to get into a course that is not provided that semester. So in other words I like my school and how my professors teach us.
College Sophomore,2,We really don't have a workout area or a place to rest until the next class wish we did. Then maybe other students can get more involved with other students.
College Junior,2,"I have had no experience with internship/job opportunities. The workload, curriculum and facilities are tipical."
College Junior,2,"All the college is telling me to do is apply for FASFA. I learned on my own that there is deadlines for Scholarships that are offered. I learned on my own of the In house scholarships, not to mention the American Indian College Fund. I had no idea on what to include on a general essay for scholarships. The help was not what I expected it to be."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Resouces – I understand how the Oglala Lakota College centers are spread out for those who are unable to make it to the main college center for classes but I don't like how only some classes are offered at some centers, therefore I have to drive 40 miles to take a class that isn't offered at my center."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Hassles and Frustrations – First of all, I do not know which of my classes are going to be available to the next semester, and most of my credits did not transfer, so I have to start from scratch basically."

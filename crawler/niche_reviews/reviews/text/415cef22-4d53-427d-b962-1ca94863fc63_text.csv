Sophomore,5,"I honestly could not imagine myself at any other college other than Western Oregon University. The amount of diversity, compassion, acceptance, and warmth that goes on within this campus is nothing like you've ever seen before. Us students and faculty greet each other with nothing other than a smile. I've only just accomplished my first year as a college student here at Western, but I cannot put it into words on how excited I am to see what the next three years are going be like. There are so many opportunities on campus to meet  new friends and educate yourself about mental and physical health. Western genuinely cares about how you're doing and and is constantly introducing new ways to keep sane in college such as movie nights in the dorms, yoga at the student health and wellness center, and many other fun activities! I would recommend going to Western to any student considering going to college."
Sophomore,5,"Western has switched to moving 95% of classes to online and at first I thought it was going to very difficult to adjust but the faculty on campus has been so accommodating and understanding with every students situation whether that be staying on campus or taking the term/year to stay home. Personally, I've decided to stay home but still continue to take classes online and the advisors have been so supportive. I can book an online zoom meeting with an advisor of my whenever I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, anxious, or just have a few questions to ask and they always help by brainstorming plans and ideas I can do that will the term go by a bit smoother."
Sophomore,5,love it here super awesome and lowkey could invite to more parties doe or just have more in general that would be super cool actually
Junior,5,I will start with WOU this fall 2020 for bachelor's degree in ASL interpreting program.  I am very excited about it.  It will be done online!
Junior,5,"Its an awesome school and online options. Teachers, support staff and other resources have been awesome for me."
Niche User,5,"The campus at Western is beautiful! One thing that I really like about the campus is all the safety things added in, like security to walk you back to your dorms if you feel unsafe or a lighted pathway back to your place. I always feel safe"
Niche User,5,"I really enjoy the size of the college, this gives the opportunity for the student to engage in a small community and make lots of friends. Because the campus is of a smaller size, it makes getting to class easy. Food is also close by, along with a wide variety of it. It is also known for it's amazing curly fries! Western Oregon is perfect if you're looking for small and close knit."
Freshman,5,I love how diverse the campus is and the variety of students that attend this school. The professors truly care about their students and their aspirations.
Alum,5,"Western was by far one of the most welcoming places that I had ever encountered. The faculty alone are well rounded individuals from all sorts of walks of life that brought real life to the classroom. In addition, if the faculty was not enough, the campus itself is a place of higher and enlightened education and fun. Campus life and activities soar to the unimaginable and are constantly adapting to suit the students. Life here was amazing and missed immensely, and will always be something that I cherish as my first stepping stones to my career."
Junior,5,I really like the teachers. Every teacher I've had so far has been great! The students I've met have also been very helpful. I'm a transfer student and new to the school but everyone has been great in helping me find my way around.
Alum,5,WOU is a small populated University campus for good reason. The small classroom sizes allow professors and students to build long lasting professional relationships. More focus and attention is given to student life and faculty seem happier without all the work load of a larger university campus.
Freshman,5,I am a first time college student and in the fall of 2020 I will be attending Western Oregon University and I recently went there to tour it and I loved it. It is a beautiful campus and I love how easily you can walk to classes and to the dining halls. I would recommend going there if you want to be in a nice community.
Senior,5,"I was apprehensive about coming to Western due to the location and small town but it has been one of the best decisions of my life to come here. The community is amazing, the academics and staff challenge me to do my best and support my passions, the diversity on campus is well versed and I am so proud to be involved with multiple organizations and clubs on campus. It has become my new home and I have met people that make me feel like I belong which is very rare. Finally, they've opened me up to opportunities for Deaf Education which is only limited to this university and such a unique experience. Coming to Western honestly saved me and my life, I am forever grateful to be coming here."
Senior,5,It was a small campus where it kept you very focused on your academics and for me football as well. It was very relaxing and not hectic 24/7. Being from Los Angeles and going to a small school like this was refreshing and honestly I am glad I went to this school for two years after transferring from a junior college.
Freshman,5,This is a wonderful campus with many wonderful people from all different cultures.  This is a very inclusive school and I am so excited to be attending in fall 2019
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at Western Oregon University has been excellent. I am very excited to continue here and to be able to say I went here.
Junior,5,"Great instructors. Beautiful campus. I would like more opportunities to volunteer.
Western has an amazing atmosphere. Even as a student well into my 30's, I have always felt welcome and my input appreciated. The rugby teams are awesome!"
Freshman,5,They’re very inclusive and accepting of everybody as they are. They see your differences as strengths and treat you as individuals instead of just one more college student
Freshman,5,"In my experience so far, Western Oregon University has been a wonderful college experience for me. The campus is small enough that the professors get to know you on a personal level and they are really dedicated to your learning. They care about you and are very understanding. This school was my first choice for college because I've only heard great things regarding the school."
Freshman,5,"Western is a smaller school compared to big scale colleges, this allows for a more comfortable environment, easier adjustment from high school and being able to meet many other college students! Western Oregon University has so many resources available for all students regardless of what need it may be!"
Senior,5,"Western Oregon University is a great university to attend. It is lower in cost compared to other four year universities. I came as a transfer student and I felt immediately included. The class sizes are small and enjoyable as the professors do an excellent job of presenting material. The education building where I have taken most of my classes is beautifully designed and hopefully the rest of the buildings on campus will follow suit. The only issue with the university is the unnecessary fees charged, but that is to be expected."
Sophomore,5,Western Oregon University is a great place to attend because it offers small classes and knowledgeable professors who love to see their students succeed. It is a very safe and accommodating environment for students who like to focus on school without any distractions.

Niche User,5,"I have only visited, but the campus was beautiful and everyone was extremely nice and helpful. The campus is small and homey, making it feel like you belong. My mom and aunts all went to Western and are very thankful for the education they were given there."
Freshman,5,"Since I come from a background of diversity I really enjoyed that Western has many opportunities for diverse Scholarship. Also, being the first person in your family to go to college is very difficult especially if you don't really put yourself out there and seek for that help. In Western, they make sure that first-generation students are well aware of the help that's out there for them. They offer many scholarships as well for the students that are the first generation. Not only is it about the scholarships, but they also make everyone feel included by the different activities they host and also many clubs. Out of one thing, I can think about that might need a little bit of improvement is having more things to do in the city of Monmouth. The closest town with things to do in Corvallis and if you don't have a way of transportation that might be a little difficult for you."
Junior,5,"WOU has a small, but very nice campus. The faculty is very helpful with furthering your education and career."
Alum,5,"Western Oregon is on a beautiful campus, full of trees and lovely architecture. The campus is older, but has many newer building. All the teacher (i had) were wonderful and really wanted us to learn and grow. The class sizes are small, and the teachers are able to answer many questions. I loved this school."
Senior,5,I loved the location of Western. It is the perfect size college for me. The class sizes average 30 students and a lot of the staff learn your name. You will not be just a number.
Niche User,5,"I would recommend Western Oregon University to all student who are looking for a save and welcoming student environment. Western Oregon University is a smaller campus with lots of green space and lots of opportunities for students to get involved. It has spaces droms and options for a domestic or foreign student roommates. WOU has a olympic sized pool, a gym, and a rock climbing wall available to  all students. There is free wi-fi, cable T.V. , and recreational activities available. Something I enjoy is the small class sizes there is never more than 22 people in my class. During final season I alway make sure to take advantage of the free counselling on site over all western oregon university is my home away from home"
Junior,5,"Professors who are there for help. Support staff most helpful and informative. Campus dinning is small, but make up with good food. With it being a medium sized college, there is still a feeling of a small campus as people know each other and get to interact."
Sophomore,5,"It is a small teaching-based university where your professors and advisors care about your success as much as you do. Small class sizes, inclusive campus, warm and welcoming campus culture."
Sophomore,5,A very very welcoming community that is willing to help out with any and all questions you might have before starting your first semester of college!
Niche User,5,I have visited their campus multiple times and I just feel that it is a very nice place to continue your study it has great professors.
Junior,5,"My experience at  Western Oregon so far has been great. my only objective here while going here is to save up enough money just so I an continue going to school here. Right now, I dont see a need for Western Oregon to change in any aspect"
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere of the school is extraordinarily unique. The campus has a big-time city size but a small town vibe. The class sizes are perfect. Just big enough to make a friend (or two) but small enough to actually matter to the professor. Everybody is so willing to help and do it with a smile. The location is beautiful as well. Nestled in a quaint little town with the ocean to the west and larger cities not a few hours away. It's truley the perfect place for any type of adventure.
Freshman,5,"I like the people, the campus, and the opportunity to pursue my chosen career while hopefully participating in track and field!"
Freshman,5,I like the way this campus is diverse all throughout campus especially within the Monmouth community. I also feel safe and accepted for who I am which is very important to me because I've always felt afraid of everything and everyone.
Junior,5,I liked how diverse it is here. There are plenty of multi-cultural clubs and organizations here on campus. The campus faculty and staff support the students whole heartedly. I'd like to see more student engagement in volunteering serviceds. There are many things a person can learn from volunteering around the community.
Freshman,5,"I really like the diverse student body. There are a lot of students with different backgrounds. I like that I never feel alone, and like an outcast. No matter what type of background you come from there will always be people that accept you at Western Oregon University."
Niche User,5,very safe and welcoming i get my credits with them through oregon promise. I vised their campus and it is very beautiful
Niche User,5,when i was in third grade i went to Western Oregon university to see what the school was about. I instently fell in love with western. My mom is a first genaration student in her family and is now a teacher at santiam elementray school in mill city oregon. The teachers at Western let me and my brothers come to the classes with my mom when we did not have anywhere else to go when she was in class. Everyone was always so ready to help with my family and my mom and i can not wait to go to western when that time has come.
Freshman,5,"My proffesors know me. Here at Western I am not just a number. I receive a good quality education, make personal realtionships, while having fun at the same time.

Senior,5,"I have been at Western Oregon University for over a year now and it has been my favorite school that I have attended! I think what makes going here the most rewarding is the connections you make with your professors, there are always people to help!"
Freshman,5,I like the small town feel. A lot of art related courses. The student to teacher ratio is perfect. Looking forward to a great year!!
Junior,5,I think this school is amazing. It has a beautiful lush campus with old buildings looking like something out of gossip girl. I am in love with this campus.
Sophomore,5,"Small, beautiful, school where you can really get to know other people and teachers know your name and really help you because they are invested in your education as well."
Junior,5,"Although I have only attended Western Oregon University (WOU) for a short amount of time, I love this campus. The professors are very knowledgeable and hold a sincere passion for their fields. I enjoy the fact that students and professors are able to connect personally, so you can really get to know each other. This makes getting references much easier! The opportunities are an additional reason why I enjoy attending WOU. As a psychology major, I have an opportunity to be a research assistant, a teacher's assistant, or both! This provides an opportunity to experience those positions, and determine if they are areas that I want to pursue. WOU also has many activities and clubs, this is great because you can get to meet so many new people. One complaint I have is the advising available at WOU. I would enjoy more being able to sit with my advisor and create an academic plan instead of using an online system that tracks courses and credits."
Freshman,5,This is a great place to go to university if you are looking for a college experience in a smaller town. It is a very low-key place where a lot of people enjoy the scenery and the relaxing feel that comes along with attending school here.
Freshman,5,"Campus is small, neat, and gorgeous. The class sizes are small and professors know you by name. Student leaders are always there to help and you get to know classmates well."
Niche User,5,I went on a tour and the campus is safe and there is many opportunities to thrive here. The dorms are clean and well organized. They offer many courses and great campus life.
Sophomore,5,Western Oregon University is a great school. It's a medium size school and a small class size so you'll get to know the professors and other peers well. Only down side is it's in a small town and will have to drive 20mins to get to some places.
College Sophomore,5,"I haven't had a problem with safety on campus. Our Public Safety Officers are also patrolling and making campus feel safe. Plus there is always staff walking around, other students, and citizens of the town walking through campus that I do feel safe enough to walk by myself even at night."
College Junior,5,"As a baseball player, I could not ask for more from WOU and the coaching staff, as well as everybody in the athletic department."
College Senior,5,I'm in Alpha Chi Omega at WOU and its the best decision I ever made. There are about 80 girls in AXO and they actively try to be involved on campus. The other greek organizations are Kappa Delta Chi and Omega Delta Phi
College Senior,5,Western Oregon University is the most friendly and comfortable school around. It has helped me earn my first 4.0. The professors and students make the school feel like home
College Student,5,I feel like a part of a family and like I never want to leave
College Sophomore,5,I cannot wait to begin attending classes on the WOU campus.
College Sophomore,5,The degree that I am pursuing is shown to be top ranked at this school. I found the ASL/English interpretation program on a list of top 3 in the country. I am thrilled to start and think that I will be looked upon highly by future employers with a degree from WOU.
Sophomore,4,WOU is a pretty good school. You’ve got small class sizes which allow you to have a closer bond with your professor and lots of staff are here to help as well.
Sophomore,4,"it sucks but it would suck anywhere so might as well get it cheaper i guess, other than that, it’s pretty cool"
Junior,4,Most of the teachers are great. They are educated and committed to our learning and future. The grounds are beautiful and we have many clubs and activities on campus. Many of our organizations do great things for the school. We are slightly underfunded but tuition pays for our needs.
Freshman,4,"I like the campus it's very nice, there are places near Western that are good to eat at if you don't want to eat from campus dining. I haven't had any bad experiences so far at Western, although sometimes it can be hard to find things to do around here. It does feel like a really safe campus even at night, and you have the option to call Wolf ride if you are alone to help you get back to your dorm."
Sophomore,4,"Friendly, small university and campus. Most professors helpful and invested in their students' success. Easy to navigate campus and town. School wifi sometimes unreliable but only for short periods of time. Sports are still emphasized, but they (and the pressure and crowds that come with them) are easy to avoid if you're not a sports person."
Junior,4,I enjoy being a student at WOU. The professors are very helpful and campus life is good. Its easy to navigate and get around. everyone is very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"WOU is a great small school. Most of the professors want to help their students succeed. Class sizes are small, usually under 15 students."
Freshman,4,"When I Chose Western Oregon University, I was astounded by all the resources provided to me through the college. From resources in getting a job, to adviser information, to free counseling, to schoolwork resources, there are innumerable ways to get help and stay connected on campus. The class sizes are small, and every professor is engaged with their students. This college is here to support your success and be there for you as you make your way to your career."
Niche User,4,"After multiple college visits to western i have found that it is a great school
with a better community."
Niche User,4,What I liked most about Western Oregon University College was how kind and welcoming they were. When I visited there campus it was so beautiful and so full of color. All there buildings are close by which helps a lot to get easy to classes. You do have to stay on campus your first year as a freshman student. The one thing they should change about there school is the food. They only have on main cafeteria with not so much variety's as to what to eat. But the campus is gorgeous and all near by.
Junior,4,"The most difficult part about applying to WOU was when I was trying to transfer over my credits from another college. It took WOU three weeks to get my credits transfer, meanwhile, I missed classes that I wanted to sign up for. When I was finding a college to transfer to my biggest concern was finding a college that works with students that have learning disabilities the teachers and staff were very helpful and caring when I needed help."
Freshman,4,Western has provided me with many great opportunities in life. Weather it is making new friends or if it's with the friendly facility.
Junior,4,"Love my professors and what they have taught me. Not the flashiest of schools, but Western has a nice campus where students can hang out and take part in student run activities. A good school. I'm glad I'm a student here."
Freshman,4,"The faculty and staff are very considerate and the advisors on campus are always willing to meet with you. The campus also has an onsite health building where you can receive free counseling and doctor appointments.  Western Oregon, really puts the students first and supports diversity."
Graduate Student,4,I love WOU. The campus is small and charming. The grounds are well kept and the staff/students are very friendly. It is a place where people feel welcome and that they can be themselves. Since it is a smaller school there are more opportunities for students to work on campus and with their professors.
Sophomore,4,"Western Oregon is good for those that enjoy a small campus. The diversity here is strong, and there is always something going on around campus. School is expensive no matter what, but Western's tuition is a lot lower than the surrounding schools."
Sophomore,4,"The academics and campus are wonderful, however their financial aid and business office could use a few changes, holds are difficult to release and communication is poor."
Sophomore,4,Western Oregon University is smaller school compared to most schools. Everything you need on campus is close by since it is a college town. The students there are really nice and easy to talk to. The professors are really good on teaching criteria and always make time for you not matter what. There schedule is really flexible design on how your schedule is. Around campus there is many things to do. On main street there are plenty of different varieties of food places to eat at. There is small historical town right next to where our college is. If you ever get bored you can take a trip down to corvallis where there is much to do and is the host city of Oregon State University. You can also take a 25 minute trip to the capital of Oregon which is Salem. There is much to do and it is a very fun school.
Junior,4,"Western is in a small town community where you can ride your bike anywhere . The classes are smal and profs are great. Some people shy away from the small town but you are close to Portland, Salem, and Corvallis so there is good options for getting out of town on occasion"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my time at WOU. There are a lot of fun and interesting artistic classes-theater arts, dance, video, gaming/computers. Most teachers are very outgoing and they are always willing to give additional help. The classrooms are very discussion/group thinking based which I really liked."
Freshman,4,"Western Oregon is such a diverse school, that everyone excepts each other no matter what race or ethnicity you are. The school is spirited when it comes to game time for any sport."
Niche User,4,"The school is placed in a very small town just west of Salem, Oregon. The school is predominantly white, christian, with a few other races. The school itself prides itself on their academics especially in education. Many great professors, whom want you to succeed. The only challenges I came across this school, was being a transfer student and fitting in. I am in the older crowd, who attended the school from out of state. I did not know many people, and found it easier to make friends with those who were the same age as I. Also, I struggled with the fees. I feel in love with the school based on its looks and small classroom sizes. However, the price has left me in some debt that I will be paying off for some time now. 

In the end, I still would recommend the school to those who are interested. I would say do your research on possible scholarships, and loans."
Junior,4,"Western Oregon is a great school to get your education.The campus is small but it is nice and easy to get around. I like how everything is close to each other. The campus is really nice and modernized. They have a lot of resources you can get a hold of and different events that you can attend. The people and the staff around is really nice and helpful. They have a lot of little stores near the school. Depending on where you live, it is walking distance. The one thing that I would like to see change is more selections of classes and at more convenient times. Other than that, I have enjoyed being here and continuing my education at Western Oregon."
Freshman,4,Western is a great small town school for the focused and motivated. Something that needs improvement is diversity of class sizes
Sophomore,4,It's a great little college in a great little town. It's good if you like having personal relationships with your teachers and advisors. It's an easy transition from high school to college because the class sizes are usually no larger than 30 students. I feel at home here at Western
Freshman,4,Western Oregon University is the perfect place to transition from high school to college life. It is small enough to find places easier and has a beautiful campus. The dining hall should be in a more accessible location rather than towards the back of the campus.
Sophomore,4,"Very warm, welcoming environement. Small class sizes are perfect for any one-on-one questions/concerns. The majority of the faculty shows an obvious and genuine interest in your academic success."
Freshman,4,"I really like the welcoming people here at WOU. Everyone here tries their hardest to get you to feel comfortable here and strives to get you to be successful at this school. I would like to see more people come since it is such a small school and I don't really like that, also more food options and more cafes and such on campus would be good."
Junior,4,"I really like that it is a small, hometown campus, but is close to many adventures like the mountain, the beach, Portland."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Western Oregon University so far has been very pleasant. the campus is beautiful and easy to maneuver around, and the staff are always willing to give you a helping hand when needed. The student lead activities are fun and well meaning, they're making the most with what they have. I've made many good friends while I've been there and enjoy the people in my dorm very much. Overall I love Western Oregon University."
Junior,4,"The people are nice, some professors aren’t the best. However, some are great! Classes are normally not to big so knowing the professors comes easy."
Senior,4,I really enjoyed my professors at Western Oregon University.  I feel like they helped me to work outside my box.
Freshman,4,"Great school! The university grounds are gorgeous.  Lots of ASL students here.  I decided to minor it it.  The student population is very diverse.  There are a lot of students from Oregon here but I've also met students from California, Hawaii, Washington, and Alaska. It's been a great experience so far."
Niche User,4,"Not only was the campus beautiful, but the facilities were modern. The people walking around were friendly and welcoming. When I went for a visit we were able to walk through buildings and see some classes in action, it was very impressive. The gym by itself is a reason to apply there."
Niche User,4,I took place in the Western Oregon University Project taking place in the summer of 2017. I took 10 days out of my summer to go to WOU everyday from 7-3pm excluding the last day which was the over night stay. The experience was fantastic and all around amazing. They offer exactly what I want in a college. I find this college perfectly fit for me.
Junior,4,"I really like the campus! Its a small school which is helpful for me. The town its in is small and isn't always eventful but overall its a cute town. I love some of the programs the school has and the student-lead activities and clubs and organizations. Obviously the only thing I would change is the cost of tuition, room & board, and textbooks. But what college student wouldn't want to change that stuff?"
Niche User,4,The small classes were a big part of why I went to WOU. The teachers actually have time to learn your name and can take the time and help you one on one because their classes aren't overflowing with students. It was a good place to get my education.
Sophomore,4,"WOU gives students private school sized classes while paying for a public university price. Most of my classes have 16-20 students, so it is easy to get to know one another and the professor on a more personal base."
Sophomore,4,"Love the small campus and look of everything. The community is personable and so far, have enjoyed all my professors. The biggest downside to this school is if you don't have a car, you're kind of stuck since it's in a small town and the nearest ""city"" is about 30 mins away."
Junior,4,"Western Oregon is a great school if you want a top-notch education for minimal price. Its price/education is great. Many classes are filled with 30 people or less, so you feel like you're getting a good amount for the cost you pay. The one on one time with professors is also great and the opportunity for doing so is abundant. All the professors are highly knowledgeable in their fields and they all make you feel they want you to succeed. The campus is small so getting lost really is not an issue. There is also quite a lot of activities to get involved in, from the Online gaming club to the copious amount of intramural activities. There are not a ton of partying opportunities here, so don't be disappointed. The town of Monmouth is small, but only 30 minutes away is Corvallis and Salem, an hour away is Portland. You really get that small town college vibe, but you are really never that far away from big cities. Overall, Western Oregon University is a great school with great resources."
Sophomore,4,"I like that most of the professors make an effort to know who you are, and what degree you are trying to complete."
Freshman,4,"Western Oregon University is the perfect small college for those who want to be a part of a tight knit community.  It is in a very small college town which means that everything that a college student could need is within walking distance.  Although there is not much to do in such a small town, the school itself hosts a lot of events and activities that the students can enjoy on and off campus.  And with the WolfRide it is easy to get to the places that you need to go without having to pay.  The classes are relatively small which make it easy to have more one on one interactions with your professor, so that you can get the attention and help that you need.  There is such a great cultural diversity at the school, so whether you're in class, or getting food, or just in your dorm, you will meet some pretty amazing people that come from all types of backgrounds."
Junior,4,"This school is great, people really try to make it easier for you,  they help so much, they have tutoring  for you when you need help,professor have office  hours to explain the material even more for you  and it they care about you that they send   email messages to see if you're okay when you don't come to class. This is a great caring school, they are very diverse and they make it feel like you can learn other people's culture."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the class size and that the college experience is brought to light with these small classes.  I wish there were more student planned activities t hat brought together freshman and sophomores so more relationships can be fostered.  Its hard being so far away from home and not so much to do for the under 21 scene overall, a great school academically, and I am glad to be able to attend"
Senior,4,"WOU is a great place for students who prefer smaller schools. The campus has quite a few opportunities to get involved with clubs, activities, sports events. Outside of campus and in the summers its pretty dead. Overall I LOVE WOU! "
Freshman,4,"Although my time here has been limited, I can already tell that Western Oregon University is something special. Being one of the top colleges for aspiring teachers and boasting an absolutely gorgeous campus, as well as being filled with supportive people and wonderful organizations, I can't possibly think of any negatives. In addition to the aforementioned, Western features great diversity, being one of but a handful of colleges that offers scholarship opportunities to Hawaiian students. It is also very supportive of the LGBT community, featuring positive acknowledgements, accommodations, and clubs. All in all, my experiences here are already impacting me for the better, and I take reassurance in knowing that this college  is special to a lot of people for various reasons."
College Freshman,4,For division 2 the league is extremely competitive.
College Junior,4,The University makes you feel secure at all times. They provide a specific place to walk into if you feel that you been harassed of any sort.
College Junior,4,Advisors guide you to take the right classes so that your major fits with your minor perfectly. Once graduating you have an a better chance to get a decent job and well payed while going to graduate school.
College Junior,4,"At Western Oregon University, they are very supportive over the school sports. The Students put around campus flyers to announce the next game or the next home coming football game."
College Junior,4,"Being part of Western Oregon University has been a good experience. I came across professors that care about your success in school, are passionate on teaching, come well prepared to every class session and are very well welcoming to any questions or concerns you might have on any subject."
College Sophomore,4,I love the health and wellness center at WOU!
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy this college because of the small class sizes therefore you are able to have a little more one on one time with your professor.
College Sophomore,4,"I liked my first year on campus so much that I am living on campus again. But during my first year, my residents assistant should have enforced the rules more."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a huge Health and Wellness Center that includes workout equipment, weights, an indoor track, a rock climbing wall, clean and quite large locker rooms, two basketball courts, and a swimming pool. And that is just in the new facility. They still use the old facility which has additional basketball courts and classrooms. I love to play intramural sports here, or run on the treadmill after class."
College Sophomore,4,I would choose my school again because the environment is friendly and small town! All my professors have expressed their desire to help their students succeed and the staff working in administrative positions has expressed this as well.
College Junior,4,"While there are some things that could be better, Western Oregon University is a safe, affordable university with a beautiful campus and awesome student body that creates a great environment for any student who attends."
College Junior,4,"WOU is a very safe place for the most part, and students are active in maintaining that safety for not only themselves, but for the entire student body."
College Junior,4,"By all the accounts that I have heard, housing at WOU is awesome."
College Junior,4,"What I enjoy about WOU is it's intimate campus, beautiful scenery, and avid student life."
Alum,2,"The worst school...They require more credits for a simple degree that they put no work in. You dish thousands of dollars, or waste precious Veterans benefits, as in my case. As a combat veteran on disability, this school is still trying to charge me years after the fact and after I used the TPD loan discharge for veterans on disability.  This school prepares you for nothing and I truly feel sorry for all the students who have poured far too much money into this school because WOU is a scam. After graduating with a Bachelor's degree, and I got an Associate's degree at Chemeketa Community College, I was there for 3 years and had a whopping 230 credits. 

Veterans, please get the most of your benefits and time by going to a school with your best interest at heart, WOU is NOT the place."
Sophomore,2,"The environment is demanding, unintriguing, and inactive UNLESS you're a gym goer. Even then, you will notice the inadequate/outdated machines that DO NOT match the expertise of most students, alongside veteran bodybuilders, have to offer."
College Sophomore,2,"It's not the best in my opinion. Housing is so expensive and not worth it at all. A stall in my hall was broken all year, and the laundry room was always full."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have traditional fraternities or sororities, they're basically just clubs. And to me the Greeks are very clique-y and not welcoming."
College Freshman,2,There are maybe one or two clubs called Sororities or Fraternities
College Freshman,2,"At WOU the Greek life is very minimal. To be honest, we hardly hear anything about Greek life on campus. Of what I know, we have a Greek system, but it's student leadership type groups. They aren't very well known or popular. I know we don't have specific greek housing."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life on campus is not traditional. The sorority is very unfair in the rushing, and initiation processing."
College Junior,2,"There's not a lot to do, but they love the students."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is basically non-existent here, and the two chapters there are are looked down upon by Non-Greeks."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Monmouth has a few house parties, but if you really want to party in college than you would be better off attending OSU."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty expensive to live off campus when you consider the town location, apartments are incredibly over-priced and often the locations are not the best. A lot of people pay roughly 400 plus a month to live in a shitty apartment in a shitty town that's a good thirty minutes from anything."
College Junior,2,"There are few apartment close to campus, and few of them are affordable. We live 5 blocks from campus and have 4 people in a 2 bedroom in order to afford it. Due to medical reasons I usually end up paying for a parking pass and driving anyway."
College Junior,2,There are few business open after like 8pm. So the 'nightlife' is basically non existent. There is like one bar close to campus that stays open late that almost everyone hangs out at.
College Junior,2,Most of the food available is either fast food type burger and fries or is a salad. They rarely change anything about the menu and even the 'specials' are usually just rotated every month or so. Very few healthy options are available and there is little variety.
College Freshman,2,"My family makes too much money for me to get any scholarships or grants or financial aid, but I have such a big family that my parents aren't able to afford to pay for my college so I am swimming in loans right now."
College Freshman,2,One one fraternity on campus go put on probation for partying so there really isn't much Greek life on campus
College Sophomore,2,"The main attraction of Monmouth, Oregon is the college. It is a very small town which I don't really mind but others might. The nearest place for shopping, nightlife, and attractions would be the state capitol, Salem, which is about a fifteen minute drive away. Even though there isn't much to do in the area surrounding the college, the people here are very friendly."
College Junior,2,"I only received $300 in the form of a Federal Pell Grant. This only covers books. It is based off only my income, so apparently I make too much to receive any help."
College Freshman,2,"I would never live here after I graduate.  Its a small, cozy town, but has not much other than the University."
College Sophomore,2,Carts only runs on weekdays and not weekends Carts is bus transportation most people go shopping on weekends and other bus services like Cherriots run on weekends but not Carts. its hard for students who cant afford cars so they need to ride bus and riding a bike takes forever to get there.
College Sophomore,2,It is a small town atmosphere and there is not much to do. 
College Sophomore,2,The wifi at my school is awful! It is slow and unreliable. 
College Sophomore,2,"If you are not a college kid, you are an old farmer. Not much to do anywhere around town. Have to go to Salem to do anything"
College Sophomore,2,There is only one frat and one sorority. Do not do much. Trying to get housing.
College Student,2,"My parents don't make a lot of money but they make enough, meaning I couldn't receive financial aid or other things such as work study."
College Sophomore,2,rain rain rain. cold cold cold. spring time allergies allergies. thats all i can say
College Sophomore,2,"the variety of foods here are not that good its just the same. Its not really healthy either just pizza, hotdog Mexican food. nothing special. There very convenient to get to but just suck at different kinds of foods"
College Freshman,2,"i haven't looked into it but its awesome from what i've heard
"
College Sophomore,2,Pretty much it depends on where you are located on campus to get wireless. I hate having print credits...... but there are a bunch of computer labs everywhere in campus buildings. 
College Sophomore,2,"So the process of financial aid was such a hassle, i don't want to do it again but i have to if i want to renew my FAFSA. I did get my scholarship but i never got any other aid like grants and stuff. I am not sure what went wrong but i will have to talk to my financial aid counselor. "
College Sophomore,2,Cost of dorms is extremely high.  Not a big social atmosphere in some dorms.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the guys are not really outgoing or talkative.
College Sophomore,2,There good availability and cost of housing around campus.  The rental service's customer service is poor and makes working with them difficult.
College Junior,2,"Greek Life was recently instituted at WOU. So far, there is only one fraternity (Kappa Sigma Fraternity) and one sorority (Kappa Delta Chi Sorority Inc.). I chose to go to WOU to avoid Greek Life and was disappointed when the university caved and allowed students to pursue them. I did not go to college to waste my time dealing with social drama and cliquey politics, but that is just my opinion. Most people on campus are not affiliated with any Greek Life and a many of them have the same opinion that I do."
College Junior,2,"Dorm life at WOU can be sweltering and claustrophobic. Some look like chambers and have little to no phone signal. Cost is outrageous, its cheaper to live off campus. Socially its decent. Ackerman is the best dorms as many will say."
College Junior,2,The only reason i  give it a c is because to live in the on campus apartments is way to expensive
College Sophomore,2,I do not feel at WOU that anyone (including counselors) are on your case about your grades or academic success. Sometimes I feel like they just want your money. Though when you enter the classroom most professors are straight forward and encourage your success.
College Junior,2,"Monmouth is quite a small town. The school is pretty much its biggest thing. But it deffinately had the swee small town charm. People are friendly and I feel very safe. Although there is not a lot to do in town, Salemis only abour 20mins away and there are always things to do there. There are a couple parks and the river to visit when weather is nice. And there is a movie theater in Independence."
College Junior,2,All parking on campus requires a parking pass that is like $60 per term. There are a few pay per hour but they fill up quick. Then there is limited street parking. If you arrived after around 10am all the free street parking is full and you have to park quite a few blocks from campus.
College Junior,2,"I am a commuter so bad weather, like snow, is frustrating. They rarely every cancel classes so if you commute you have to make the journey in potentially dangerous weather."
College Freshman,2,"I am not one for the wetness and cold, so the frigid climate that we see a lot of the time here on campus makes walking to class a pain. But other than the occasional chill and liquid sunshine, the weather here on campus is not as bad as it could be."
College Sophomore,2,Its strict on drinking in the dorms but people sneak it in all the time.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few restaurants in Monmouth.  Their only saving grace is a taco shack just across the street.
College Freshman,2,The strictness at our school is fair. They don't want to see and drug or beer and they will find you. In the dorms or even around campus. But it is always good to be safe than sorry
College Freshman,2,Drug use is pretty strict. underage alcohol use isnt too strict. quet hours are pretty strict unless its a weekend.
College Sophomore,2,"Monmouth is a very small town. There is a very limited number of places to go. There really is no night life, you have to travel for it. There are no shopping centers and what little business there is has very little variety. Overall it is in a quiet and beautiful area that is clean and updated but lacking in things to do. The town is a college town and so the locals are generally friendly to students."
College Junior,2,Mostly white students.  Very cliquey students hard to meet new people
College Freshman,2,My school offers a free shuttle that operates only in the evening hours. I find it inconvenient only because they run only on non class hours. Other than their hours they seem to do an excellent job getting the students where they need to go.
College Freshman,2,"As currently being a freshman right now, I do not have my own car for transportation. But as I have spoke with upper class men, they seem to not have trouble finding parking. I believe a parking pass is about 70-80$ which i think is extremely high just because as a student we already have so much expenses to pay for."
College Junior,2,"I went through the process of completing financial aid it was a very difficult process. However, I did not recieve any financial aid for the past two years."
College Junior,2,I had applied for the General Scholarship for Western Oregon University and did not get it. I would say the scholarships at Western are very competitive and you got to keep your eyes open for early acceptance for scholarships.
College Junior,2,Most of the shops close to campus close at 5. The university does not provide activities to do at night except for collegiate games.
College Sophomore,2,"There are many bars for the small population of the school and town, there are no nearby clubs of any sorts. There is a 'college night' at a bar."
College Sophomore,2,"Struggling to Be Accepting – There are a well-rounded diverse group of students at WOU, yet it seems to be difficult for students to understand that people come from different backgrounds. There is no violent acts or any thing of the sorts, but there is hesitation at cultural events for attendance."
College Freshman,2,"RA's Let It Slide – The ""dry-campus"" rule is enforced, however it is very lenient. If the RA's catch you drinking they don't necessarily write you up. It lets people know that it's ok to let the rules slide, as long as you become friends with your RA."
College Sophomore,2,"Poor Rental Companies – I had a hard time finding a quality apartment for a reasonable price. There are two main rental agencies in town and I have heard horror story after horror story about how bad they are to work with. Just when my room mate and I went in to view soe apartments, they had such a bad attitude with us that we wanted nothing to do with them. We rented a place from near-by Corvallis and I a very happy we did."
College Freshman,2,"There is lots of parking, but it usually fills up fast, best times are early morning or late afternoon and during lunch are the best times to get a parking spot."
College Student,2,"Not Much to Do – It's very small, not much to do in this town. However, Salem is 25-30 minutes away, Corvalis is 35-40 minutes, and Portland an hour to an hour and a half. Because of the raising gas prices these cities are not easily accessible. There is a small movie theatres, retaurants, and most of the actvities are in or held by the Unviersity."
College Freshman,2,"Fan Support – The fan support is very small. The gym never gets full unless it's new student week, when the freshman get a taste of college."
College Junior,2,"Great If You Are Diverse, Not So Much If You're Not – Financial aid would be fine if you have a diverse background and are not part of the middle class. Stay on top of things and count on financial aid from outside resources if you need some. Scholarship sites are great, don't lean heavily on the possibility that you might get aid from WOU. The people at the desk are very helpful and have a great knowledge of the financial processes, so make use of that."
Sophomore,1,"I am writing this review as a parent, with a child attending WOU during COVID.  I think as a whole WOU has been very unprepared for online learning.  Much worse than Oregon State (I have a child who is attending there also).  Cost, well WOU has an added $795 online fee (which makes the tuition more expensive than OSU now).  Teacher online involvement with students-Spring2020-lucky to have 1-2 online classes per week if at all.  Support outside of class, not consistent, mostly not existent/supportive, no response to emails, etc.  Fall 2020, a little more online classes (more profs know how to use zoom now), but response outside of class very poor for students.  Students are mostly on their own during COVID.  WOU is a good in-person school especially if you know what degree you want going in.  They have good undergraduate programs for education, pre-nursing, and ASL.  When WOU will have in-person classes, it may become a good school again, but who knows when that will be, 2022?"
Alum,1,"Do not go to this university unless you just want the paper that says you have a degree. You won't receive any help from anyone. Billing is horrible...takes them months to get your bills to you then when you do get them your already hit with a late notice. Academic advising is horrible here, be sure to know what your going there and don't expect to get any help from advisors. For a small campus that's supposed to be about community, it was the worst experience of my life. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere for your college experience."
College Freshman,1,Not much of a party scene exists outside of tight cliques
College Freshman,1,The campus is fairly quiet and slow; not much if a nightlife scene.
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid office is a pain. We have to keep going, and reminding them to get our paper work reviewed. It is too much work. My friend even had to go to the head person for the business office to get her paperwork reviewed."
College Junior,1,"The one frat is ridiculous, it's almost a joke."
College Junior,1,"The reason I am giving WOU Housing this rating is because of the unique experience I had with the roommate selection process... I'm sure there are other students might have had better experiences than I did (at least I hope), but they never even gave me the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire to determine who would be a good fit for me, and as a result, I lived with someone who not only did I have nothing in common with, but we did not get along and she had a medical issue that interfered with one of MY medical issues and I was rushed to the hospital on life-support due to not being informed of her prior medical issue..."
College Sophomore,1,They gave me a bit of money last year but this  year I received nothing. I have no idea how I'm going to pay for next term and it's like they don't care.
College Sophomore,1,"There's a pub a few minutes off of campus but other than that, there isn't nightlife in the area surrounding the campus. You have to go to Salem or Eugene if you want to go to a club or bar."
College Sophomore,1,There are no greeks at our school and if there is I don't know anything about greeks. and I am not sure how it would change the atmosphere since ive never talked or seen a greek student before.
College Sophomore,1,Not a lot of option or variety for off campus dining.  A lot of the same types of restaurants.  Yang's is the best off campus restaurant.  
College Sophomore,1,The dining hall is very outdated.  There should be fresher and healthier options available.  Prices are reasonable.
College Sophomore,1,The town atmosphere is very quiet and there aren't many attractions or activities for students.  In order to go shopping students have to drive at least half an hour.
College Sophomore,1,Not a lot of nightlife at my school. Small town with not many options of things to do.
College Junior,1,"The dining hall can be very spendy, especially if you live in the on-campus apartments. The staff can be very rude to students. Clean area, but they only serve very basic meal ideas. There are not many fruit/vegetable options. I quit my meal plan after the first term because it was very expensive. There are other small eateries around the campus that have better food and are much cheaper!"
College Sophomore,1,"It is a little more difficult to find apartments because it is not super organized and the town is pretty small. If not ahead of the game, finding one may be too difficult to be successful so a lot of people end up in apartments with strangers. A lot of negative words about landlords, I haven't had a personal experience with a terrible one, mine is average. Parking is usually pretty good because you are at least entitled to one space, if there are multiple roommates, there may be some issues."
Recent Alumnus,1,"
I wouldn't let my worst enemy attend this school.  While they are nice to you at first and treat new students great, their care for you POST graduation is another matter.  Once they have wrung money out of you the school tries to forget about you.  In 2011 the school made a mistake on my graduation and prevented me from getting into graduate school.  This started a chain of events that has ended with my further education and goals being permanently halted.  They ruined me so badly that I went from a 3.89 honor student to nearly homeless.  Their response is that they don't care what they did to me.  That's it- no one wants to figure out what happened or try and resolve the problem.  It's my problem now despite it not being my fault.  Avoid this school at all costs.  If you know someone who is managing to have a life after this it just means there was no mistakes made by the staff.  Lucky Them.  For more details please see- http://www.gofundme.com/2i9evw"
Recent Alumnus,1,There is next to no support for students after graduation or helping them find work for their degrees.  Once Western gets their money they are done with you.
Recent Alumnus,1,Very little variety to offer.  Even worse when you go to graduate level.  The irony is so many of the undergrad degrees being offered require moving on to some kind of graduate program that the school can't offer.  Making Western a dead end.
Recent Alumnus,1,There were scholarships?  Even with my 3.89 I never saw one.

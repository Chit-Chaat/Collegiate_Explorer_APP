Alum,5,"My years at Albion were some of the happiest of my life. I made so many friends and had such wonderful experiences of growth and maturation. I recently found some of my old papers from college at my parents' house, and I kept thinking, wow - what wonderful classes I took. I wish I could go back and retake them as an adult, because I didn't even realize how rich the learning environment was - and I'm now a college teacher myself! Wonderful experience."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online at Albion College! When I was a student there was no online options for courses! Previously, this has changed at Albion and I've heard great things."
Alum,5,"Albion College is an incredible school with incredible opportunities. The staff, faculty and all the students are so friendly and helpful. Campus truly feels like a home! Best decision of my life."
Alum,5,"I heavily enjoyed my time at Albion. The faculty were personable and really cared about me. Before I heard of Albion, I was choosing between Grand Valley and NMU, but neither of them fully clicked with me. Though, when I visited Albion's campus, I knew I was at home. Hopefully you can find your new home at Albion too!"
Alum,5,"I didn't take any courses online, but I know some of my friends did this past semester. While it was a weird transition for everyone, the professors and staff were really committed to the students and their learning."
Works Here,5,"Albion is a place that makes you feel at home. Faculty and staff care about students and their success. They work individually with students to provide career counseling, mentor, and advising to insure students have what they need to reach their goals."
Alum,5,"Did not have online classes during my years (91-95) at the college.   

Therefore, I am unable to rate the online experience at this time."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Albion - best choice I ever made! The students, staff, and faculty at Albion set it apart from all other schools."
Alum,5,I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Albion College.  The professors were top notch and really cared about the growth and education of their students.  I met lifelong friends that I'm still close with.  It provided me a well-rounded experience and wonderful entry into the world on my own. I highly recommend it.
Alum,5,online courses weren't an option when I attended.  I'm unable to submit without 100 characters so I keep typing.
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online.  Not many were offered and they were specific to certain departments.
Alum,5,"My experience was personal and catered to my interests. Professors were very interested in helping me create an individually designed major and the process was easy.  The school is small, but I never felt like I missed out on any opportunities that my friends had a larger schools.  Albion really had everything the big schools had, just in a smaller package. Highly recommend!"
Alum,5,I did not take online classes.          I did not take online classes.     I did not take online classes.    I did not take online classes.    I did not take online classes.
Alum,5,Prepared me for life. Beautiful campus. Small classes. Talented faculty. Plenty of social opportunities. Launched my career in medicine.
Alum,5,Mild need when I went. Pretty standard experience. Only took part of one class online and it worked fine.
Alum,5,"Historical and tradition of being the best liberal arts in Michigan. Had a rough period during the economic downturn a while ago, but has come back strong.  Recent investments are addressing old issues and housing improvements have made a big difference.

The college has been working with the Town to fix up and provide new business opportunities which has in 10 years taken the town from negative stars to at least 3 with more coming."
Alum,5,Not applicable.  Albion College did not offer online courses in the mid- to late-1990s. This should not be a required field.
Alum,5,"I will never regret choosing Albion College. I met friends with whom I still remain in close contact with 25 years post-graduation. I met native speakers from Costa Rica, France, and Germany, and became friends with international students from Japan and Egypt and elsewhere. I got a top notch education in English and Psychology.  Perhaps most importantly, I was exposed to many different subjects and narratives and ways of viewing the world as part of my liberal arts education. Albion taught me how to think, and not only how to think, but how to do so in an encompassing way. When solving problems or writing, I draw from many disciplines and many perspectives. While there is a place for STEM programs, many of societyâ€™s most pressing problems (racial and social injustice; pandemic response; fighting government corruption) require elevated thinking that sees the world as a cohesive whole and incorporates multiple strategies to resolve these issues. Albion taught me how to think like that."
Alum,5,"No on-line courses taken as they didn't exist in my years on campus (1978-1982).  The small, face-to-face classes at Albion, taught by outstanding faculty members, are the way higher learning is best done.  On-line tools can certainly supplement courses, but only doing on-line work is not an adequate substitute for classroom learning."
Alum,5,"I received a superior, interdisciplinary education with professional internships.  I was trained in analysis, persuasion, adaptable thinking and strong communications skills."
Alum,5,I loved my Albion College experience! From the classes to campus to professors - they are all memorable. Biggest take away looking back 15 years later are the life experiences I gained and the life long connections and friendships are cherished.
Alum,5,"While I attended Albion, they did not offer online courses. However, based on my experience and continued relationship with some Albion College Professors, I believe any education they offer is top notch whether online or in person."
Alum,5,"A great academic experience where you had the ability to connect with highly thoughtful and engaged faculty! The smaller upper level class sizes meant that you gained much more support and built strong relationships with your peers.  Although Albion does not offer some of the same opportunities that are available at giant institutions, its size also makes it far easier to become engaged in the wide range of opportunities that exist."
Alum,5,Faculty recognized the challenges of online learning and really embraced it using a variety of techniques
Alum,5,"I never had any online classes so I really can't say what it is like now. They had them available in some capacity when I was there, but that has changed now, especially with the 2020 Pandemic."
Alum,5,My time at Albion College is something I look back on with fondness. It helped me become who I am today and I met friends that I will have for a lifetime. Every time I go back I remember the good times and the pride I feel to have graduated from an institution like Albion. I have been out for quite some time at this point and I am fortunate enough to still see professors that I had and they still remember me as well. You won't get that at a big school! I was able to do independent research over the summer and was even able to get an article published in a journal. Overall I have no complaints!
Alum,5,"College is a pyramid scheme. Go be an electrician. Or an arborist. If that doesn't work out, this is a good place to go. I had a lot of fun, made life-long friends, learned things, and I'm happy with what I got out of it."
Alum,5,"I didn't do anything online at Albion. Why why why why, oh, why does this review have to be 100 chars?"
Alum,5,"Albion is the quintessential small liberal arts college experience.  Excellent faculty, classic yet innovative curricula, intimate learning environment, kind and engaged student body, lively sporting and social scenes, enduring alumni network."
Alum,5,"Top-notch remote and flexible learning options online, approaching parity with live resident course offerings."
Alum,5,Focused instruction from PhDs.  Applicable coursework.  Well-positioned for post graduate employment.
Alum,5,"Albion College was great. It was a wonderful experience both in class and out.  The professors were excellent and caring. Many of the things I learned translated to success throughout the years; analyzing, communicating and thinking about the big picture.  Albion also fostered a lifelong passion for learning"
Alum,5,Did not take online classes so cannot speak to this. I was a full-time student who lived on campus all 4 years.
Alum,5,"Fantastic education and a great campus life. I received an excellent education at Albion that prepared me well for graduate school, while also having a great time living on campus. Professors are very invested in their students. Greek life made for a good social scene."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes, but if I did I know they would have been of exceptional and unimpeachable quality."
Alum,5,An amazing college that values individuals. A truly exceptional education that provides life long friends and mentors.
Alum,5,"The four years I spent at Albion were the best I can remember.  I made lifelong friends and has personal attention from all professors in all of my classes.  Albion prepared me well to be accepted at several of the top 10 law schools in the U.S., and has continued to serve me well throughout my career.  Albion teaches students how to think, be resourceful, be innovative and solve problems.  These skills are far more important for success in life as the world evolves -- as opposed to the particular course materials.  I would highly recommend Albion College in terms of quality of education, quality of campus life, quality of life attained after graduation, and overall value.  Albion College offers a unique value proposition -- and is well worth it."
Alum,5,"Excellent education in an academically progressive setting. Caring full professors know the students. Robust sports, service, internship, and social opportunities in a beautiful Michigan campus environment. Affordable and highly recommended."
Alum,5,"Phenomenal professors, true commitment to Liberal Arts education, wonderful study abroad and internship opportunities. Prepared students for careers and life post-graduation. Albion's culture allows students to be well-rounded. You can be on a sports team and take part in clubs or Greek life. 5 minute walk from one end of campus to the other means your precious time is spent studying and socializing rather than commuting!"
Alum,5,I did not take classes online. So I have nothing to contribute to the online capabilities. But the survey requires 100 characters here.
Alum,5,Albion College was the launching point for the many opportunities I had for my career.  The Gerstacker Institute for Business and Management provided the academic and work experiences leading to my first job and jobs thereafter in the executive space.  The liberal arts education creates a well rounded and experienced individual able to handle the challenges encountered after college.
Alum,5,"My Albion education gave me the tools and the opportunity to see the world through multiple perspectives at once, not just through the focus of one discipline or major.  In a world where the rate of change in the job market is faster than ever, that ability is more important than ever."
Alum,5,"I had no online courses as an Albion student, therefore this section doesn't apply to me at this point in time."
Alum,5,-I did not take courses online during my time as a student. That being said I found my professors to be very responsive to e-mail. They also utilized different online platforms to share course materials. One semester I became very ill during finals week. My professors were very accommodating and found a way for me to take my exams after I recovered out of state.
Alum,5,"-Albionâ€™s Vibrant Greek Life community was a major attraction. Involvement in my sorority helped me form strong bonds and gain leadership experience. Joining a Greek organization helps expand networking opportunities following graduation.

-Albionâ€™s professor to student ratio was a key part of my academic growth. Small classes lead to more opportunities and accountability. Having feedback from professors, and not TAâ€™s is incredibly valuable."
Alum,5,"Albion college taught me to learn well beyond the parameters of passing a test with A's.  The desire to delve deeper into subjects and learn on a multidimensional level was a key learning fomented at Albion. Interpersonal engagement with my professors made all the difference and gave me the inspiration to think bigger and dream bigger.  I truly learned to love learning.  I also loved my junior year abroad experience that gave me a perspective on the world that we live in that I've always believed helped me navigate the world in a more informed way in my adult life.  After my junior year abroad program, I was able to live in the International House my senior year.  This experience further defined and strengthened my understanding of the world and gave me insight I could not have learned otherwise.  Upon reflection, the social aspects on campus made all the difference for my integration and learning experienced."
Alum,5,"I never took an online course, but I have deep faith in the incredible faculty and staff at Albion College. Both faculty AND staff are warm, flexible, easy to connect with, and deeply supportive of academic success as well as personal wellness. (Make your way to Sociology and English Departments--you'll be happy you did!)"
Alum,5,"My years at Albion College were life-changing! I learned how to think about the world with a empathetic, well-rounded perspective, and my experiences with peers, faculty, staff, and community members played a huge role in shaping my identity, laying an incredible foundation for success. 
-- Campus is beautiful, super safe, and the perfect size to make connecting with peers simple and accessible. 
-- The people I met in my dorms are still some of my closest friends. 
-- Faculty AND staff are warm, flexible, easy to connect with, and deeply supportive of academic success as well as personal wellness. (Make your way to Sociology and English Departments--you'll be happy you did!)
-- The surrounding community is easy to navigate and ripe with opportunities for learning and development. 
-- Student Life has unlimited ways to connect to peers.
-- The First-Year Experience program is unmatched. Peer Mentors are the perfect access point for leadership on campus in your first semester."
Alum,5,"N/A - there were no online courses available when I attended.  In general, I am not a fan of online learning, but it is nice to have the option for those who need it."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Albion in 2002, so my review may not be accurate for today's student, but I had a fantastic time while I was there.  I was involved in fraternity life, president of the IFC (Interfraternity Council), played sports, and served as a Resident Assistant for half my time there.  Albion gave me the opportunity to take a semester abroad in London, England where I got engaged.  I met so many great people there!

While there was not a huge ethnic diversity, the students and staff all came from different backgrounds and homelands, so it was excellent to learn from everyone's life experiences.

The staff were always willing to go above and beyond to help.  I graduated in the biology/psychology fields and went on to get a doctorate, for which I felt well-prepared.  I would send my children there and recommend it to anyone.

College is what you make of it, so those who say they are/were bored should look into ways to get more involved.  Overall, I had a great experience!"
Alum,5,Loved my 4 years at Albion! Love the smaller campus size and class sizes! Easy to get around and meet people. Felt very safe at the campus.
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online at Albion. I have no doubt they put forth thought and effort in designing online classes for students.
Alum,5,"Terrific all-around college experience.  I am grateful for the years I spent at Albion, the education, the professors, staff, facilities and campus life.  Top notch academics, nice mix of historic and new facilities, beautiful campus, and lots of opportunities for financial assistance and part-time work."
Alum,5,Not applicable and no way to opt out of answering this question so just filling in something to complete the survey.
Alum,5,"I did not take any remote classes, but I have heard that Albion professors have really stepped up to the challenge of teaching during COVID."
Alum,5,"My Albion professors were the best.  They were helpful, compassionate, and seriously committed to my success. I could not have had a better undergraduate experience."
Alum,5,Albion prepared next well for graduate school and becoming a leader at an international human rights organization.
Alum,5,We did not have online learning during my time at Albion.  I understand the small class sizes support better online course interaction with professors.
Alum,5,"Albion offers a small, liberal arts experience with outstanding pre-professional programs.  My friends and I collectively attended grad school at Uof M, Harvard, Case Western, and many other top programs.  We are now all professionals -  doctors, dentists, lawyers, consultants, policy makers, bankers, etc. because of the foundation Albion provided us.  The greek life for woman where they have lodges but still live in dorms presents a great blend with service opportunities and sisterhood without having to live in sorority houses."
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online... So there should be a NA category and not a mandatory 100 charactersthat have to be typed here...
Freshman,4,Really good havenâ€™t had any problems and hope this was the right decision to attend here and also run track.
Freshman,4,"Very easy, teachers were always there to help me when needed. Easy to navigate through the black board."
Works Here,4,"Albion is primarily a residential four year liberal arts institution with very few online courses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, courses did switch to online, I did not take any online courses."
Alum,4,"Albion College has provided me consistent, positive momentum in my career and personal growth.   I am grateful to be part of the Albion College community.   Thanks, Albion College."
Alum,4,"While I did not take any online classes myself, I understand the Gerstacker Institute classes that are online during the summer are well done. (I have participated as an alum in mock interviews with the students from Gerstacker)."
Alum,4,"I graduated from Albion more than 10 years ago. At the time online courses were in their infancy. The online component of classes was adequate, but is likely very different now."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the ability to make friends quickly and easily. The campus life was fine and plenty of socializing on campus. Fraternity life was good for me. Band and music programs were excellent and kept me very busy (not my major). Business program was good and I have a good job with a strong salary. Campus was nice, quiet, safe and beautiful."
Alum,4,"Great liberal arts learning, centered on being civic-minded and on understanding  how multiple disciplines work together for an even richer overall education."
Alum,4,Online classes were not available during my four years.  However it appears that Albion is doing an excellent job of incorporating more of those options in the fall of 2020.
Alum,4,"I did not have the opportunity to participate in online learning at Albion College, but I have witnessed my daughter's class move online during this pandemic.  The professors have been very dedicated to learning the technology and the life situations of each student to make online learning manageable and as excellent as possible."
Alum,4,Did not have opportunity to take online classes. Would expect good experience based upon quality of professors.
Alum,4,"I loved the small classes for valuable discussions. These relationships with my professors and classmates deepened my academic engagement. I enjoyed being able to bike for miles, kayak the river, and spend time in nature. The ride to State or Michigan was quick, so I often visited friends at those campuses."
Alum,4,"The internet was in its infancy when I was a student, so Iâ€™m marking this non-applicable. Iâ€™m sure that the faculty did I fine job of leading virtual learning this past semester."
Alum,4,Apparently one hundred letters required to let me finish. Online didnâ€™t exist way back then. Dinosaurs wandered about campus.
Alum,4,"I had a great experience at Albion College, personally, professionally, and academically.  The network of opportunities afforded to its students is second to none.  While many institutions can offer internships and study abroad programs, none of them can connect a young person with the caliber of professionals and organizations that Albion can.  While a student, I was able to work with some of the state's most qualified and able instructors.  My education is more than just what I learned and remember - it is a wide swath of problem solving tools and strategies, a network of colleagues, and a broad perspective with which I can tackle complex professional challenges. The campus is beautiful, and the surrounding town is having a major resurgence. Student housing needs improvement, which the college has addressed and is making efforts to ameliorate.  Albion College is a unique place, with a myriad of people that leave indelible impressions."
Freshman,4,"I like how small the campus and the class size is. You get to have a lot of one on one time with your professor and there is a lot of resources you can use to better yourself academically which is really helpful. There are a lot of events you can go to to have a little fun here and there as well.Also, I was able to make a lot of amazing friends before I got on campus, so I didn't feel lost or alone when I moved in.  I am very thankful for that."
Sophomore,4,"I am finishing up my sophomore year at Albion and I have loved every moment here. The small class sizes foster a close relationship with classmates and professors who make themselves easily available to help students with their work. The athletic programs at Albion are also on the rise as multiple teams have made great strides this year. Professors are also supportive of athletes and will make accommodations when necessary. As an athlete, I like to do it all and be very involved on campus and Albion allows me to do that. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I wish students had the option to live off campus and not be on a meal plan."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a current sophomore at Albion and so far, I have loved my experience. I have a lot of opportunities for research and internships and my professors are always there to help me, no matter what. I know that the people at Albion genuinely cares about me and in my opinion, you won't find a community like it anywhere else. There are tons of activities to do on campus, programs for all kinds of interests, and the professors here take an active role in our education. Plus, there are many scholarship opportunities which made it possible for me to attend. I also like the fact that there are so many organizations to get involved with, like Greek life, music, sports, and other clubs!"
Freshman,4,"Albion is a great school that will prepare you well for the workforce. A large percentage of students get jobs right out of college, so you can begin to pay off student loans right away. Albion also gives great financial aid packages."
Freshman,4,Great professors! Need to work on updating the gradebook/posting grades. There schedule is also very early compared to other colleges.
Junior,4,"Albion is a cozy campus where everyone feels like family. You have easy access to all of your professors, and you are able to connect with them in a way that you can't on larger campuses."
Freshman,4,"So far, I've gotten the chance to learn about the community and integrate into the small college town setting. The teachers are eager to help and the administration is willing to listen."
Sophomore,4,"I love Albion college despite the town that it is in. The professors are awesome they provide good insight and often form a personal relation with the students. This college will not let you struggle, it has resources to help you in every which way and the students are down to earth. The food may be lackluster but there are substitutes outside in the town."
Alum,4,"The math professors are absolutely outstanding and really made my time at Albion a treasure. The atmosphere on campus is extremely liberal and dating a cop made me very uncomfortable on Albion's campus. There is not ""religious"" orientation on campus either, and you really need to work on your faith life if it is something that means a lot to you. 
The education is priceless, but you need to be willing to sacrifice. My first two years there were not many problems. My junior and senior year were when politics made the campus crazy."
Sophomore,4,Albion is a great college! There is a strong sense of community and lots of support from everyone. Strong alumni connection and really helps you with your future.
Junior,4,"My experience at Albion college so far is somewhat excellent. I love how the school has different activities for the students to do. I also love how the professors are engage to helping each individual student. What I would change is they should have more ways for students without cars to get around the city like to Walmart, etc."
Sophomore,4,"Pretty good school, Good Education, Good Opportunities, Expensive but they will work with you. Everyone is here to help you at Albion"
Senior,4,It's a very small liberal arts college in Michigan. I like it because it is only 3 hours away from Chicago and about an hour away from Detroit. The community is pretty welcoming and seems to want to get the students involved.
Niche User,4,"Good school but expensive, however the student body is very close among all grades and the campus is nice, they also have some nice reservations going on at the moment to the atheltic buildings and science centers."
Freshman,4,I like the small college feel. You get to know people in your classes and your professors. They want to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,The college has a homey feel to it. It is a small college but the students and professors are mostly all warm and welcoming.
Freshman,4,"Albion does a great job with combining all parts of a typical college experience and making them fun and accessible for everyone. I am enjoying my time here but the housing and facilities could use some updating and the tuition is ridiculous. Especially when you don't qualify for finical aid, this school adds up and doesn't offer to help with students in my situation."
Sophomore,4,Albion College is a wonderful institution with many great resources. Would be perfect if there were be more acceptance of minority students on campus.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love it. The campus is beautiful and gives off a historical/comfort vibe. It is really small, with around 20:1 student professor ratio which makes it rather easy to build a relationship with both professors and peers bettering the overall experience. There are clubs on campus for just about everything, and you can even create your own. It's easy to get a job on campus and with the size it is easy to stay involved. The faculty for the most part is amazing, they are the reason I'm there. However, the college does lack in diversity. In just my first year there has been multiple racial/cultural conflicts between both students and staff; however, it seems that administration is working to better educate people on the cultural differences and how to better handle situations."
Junior,4,I believe my experience at Albion College will stick with me forever. I've never been more involved in the community and more excited about my life until I came to this college.
Freshman,4,"The professors at Albion truly care about their students which makes the education here extraordinary. The school is small so it is easy to make friends. You see somebody you know everywhere you go. 
Albion is a great school, but there is not anything to do in downtown Albion. If i could change anything about this school, it would be the location it is in."
Freshman,4,"I truly love Albion College, but there are some things that could change. I love the atmosphere, as well as the people. Everyone is very kind in their own way. The professors are nice, as well as caring. Professors want to get to know their students. I love how small the school is. This way, students can know others, not being just a number. I'm not a fan, however, of the roommate choices. The school's process doesn't work very well. I am not a fan of how long the school takes to fix a problem, a lot of the times one has to do something to get things moving."
College Freshman,4,"I have not been a major advocate for sports during my time at Albion College, but I have noticed that football is a main part of campus life. Britton spirit fly's through the air during the fall when the season starts. Students are often seen hanging up supporting banners all over campus encouraging student attendance for the Albion College football team. The whole landscape of Albion is impacted by sports."
College Freshman,4,"Meeting all the staff and faculty at Albion College and getting to know them was hands down the best experience I have had here. From on the phone, to email, to in-person, Albion College staff for there admissions process have been nothing but helpful and want to see you succeed in every way they can. They helped me with scheduling classes in a way that set me up for my major and had awesome health programs that guarantees a future of higher education. I have nothing but nice things to say about Albion College and I look forward to spending my next three years at this outstanding college."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe and the health services are nice.  Sometimes campo can be slow when you call them to get a ride, but they are normally really nice"
College Sophomore,4,Greek life does good things around campus and hosts the parties on the weekends.  I just have no desire to go Greek
College Sophomore,4,"My school, Albion College, caters to my multi-cultural interests. Every week a new cultural event is set up by the school's language department. It's a great opportunity for learning more about food, clothes, and manners in other cultures. These events are presented in a fun and immersive way so that anybody can enjoy and learn from them. For myself, a student aiming to learn a second language and to one day experience a second culture, these events allow for me to get an idea of what  I will go through and see when I achieve my goal. I am confident that Albion will prepare me for the experience. I am grateful that my final pick for a college was the right one for me."
College Sophomore,4,I have had a lot of fun here and I would recommend it to anyone! It's a lot of fun!
College Sophomore,4,"I have never felt unsafe while on campus. Some areas off campus are not nearly as safe, but as long as you are on campus you'll be fine."
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on the sport one intends on participating in, but for the most part everyone gets involved and is supportive."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great place full of wonderful, welcoming individuals. You'll receive an amazing education, and I would recommend it to all!"
College Junior,4,"If you put in the time, then they will help you accomplish your goals."
College Sophomore,4,Coaches are great and very helpful and informed. All of the teams at Albion do very well in their respective sports. The school plays a big part in the spirit of our games and all students and faculty are very supportive of all teams.
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors are extremely helpful and approachable. Everyone on campus is friendly and generally happy.
College Sophomore,4,"You will get to know your professors well. Find a few that you can relate to and seem easy to talk to. Visiting professors is very common and encouraged. Professors love talking about their research, their field, and themselves; along with learning more about who you are and how you might be struggling in their courses. The professors will also give you opportunities and research positions to work with them."
College Sophomore,4,Albion College is definitely a safe school. Campus safety offers rides to students at night to and from parties or from classes to dorms. The number of incidents at Albion is amazingly low and the college stresses safety greatly.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is huge at Albion College. Most students are either in a social or non-social fraternity or sorority. Greek life puts on many events through the year that are very successful. Greek housing is currently only available for fraternities but sororities have houses, they just aren't lived in. Everyone is very welcoming of Greek life at Albion and even if you decide not to join Greek life, you will have a more positive college experience thanks to the atmosphere and events created by Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,"Although it is a small school, Albion College is a great transition for students. You experience living away from your family and gain a lot of the independence that young adults need in order to succeed in the real world. The campus is also very safe; especially when compared to larger universities. There are many different types of people at Albion despite its small size; so, making friends is very easy. The college is also very good at providing students with entertainment on weekends and events during the weeks - all free of charge. The city of Albion is also small and quiet, but with a lot of history and character. I am not sure what initially drew me to choosing Albion College, it was pretty much a random choice, but I do not regret my decision. When I leave the campus for vacation or to visit friends at other universities I often miss Albion and feel homesick."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors truly do care about their students. Course work can be a lot sometimes but it is college, its supposed to be. There are a lot of different courses available and they encourage you to take a variety of courses to see what you like. Class sizes are a 14:1 ratio, my biggest class I have had so far was about 30. That is why I love this school though, small class sizes!"
College Sophomore,4,"I think Greek life on this campus is great. If you are looking to get involved in the community, school, and meet new people it is a great option. However, you do not have to join a sorority/fraternity if you do not want to. It is not cliquey at all, and you can still go to Greek events even if you are not Greek!"
College Freshman,4,"The professors are really nice, and every class is small and inviting."
College Freshman,4,My only wish is that we could live off campus and not have gender separation.
College Freshman,4,"Academic is great, professors are nice and they care."
College Freshman,4,Albion is so beautiful and I personally love the size of it. It can get boring in the small town but the school puts on tons of activities and trips to keep you occupied. The people are really great and what drew me toward the school to begin with.
College Freshman,4,Those who work for campus safety take their jobs very seriously and work hard to provide students with the utmost secure campus. There are very accesible places to go if you do feel unsafe and people to talk to if anything ever did happen. Albion College takes the safety and security of their students very seriously.
Junior,2,"I'm a junior here at Albion, and I honestly don't recommend for anyone to go here. With the new protocols placed during the pandemic (e. tracking our location thru a contact tracing app, not being allowed to leave campus and not getting approved to leave, placing more blame and pressure on students to control the spread of COVID while faculty members are being affected, and so on), I seriously do not recommend for anyone to attend/or even transfer here during the pandemic. On top of being forced to stay here for 3 months, the majority of student life here is frustrated with faculty leadership and the fact that there's barely any resources within the campus and the town itself. Majority of us that decided to come back this semester are seriously considering not returning due to how everything has been handled this semester (nothing here makes any logical sense).

Even as a student of color, the retention rate for POC is extremely low since there's not much support offered towards us."
Alum,2,"The college is in the middle of nowhere with very little to do, although the college and other individuals are revitalizing the area so people will stay in town post-business days."
Senior,2,"Albion College is a great place to go if you are very studious, or like house parties, because that is the only thing to do around campus. There are no restaurants or bars, or even any kind of other nightlife or entertainment within 20 miles of the college. I've had a lot of great professors, but the science department is absolutely terrible. The professors don't care about teaching at all. The campus is entirely too liberal. If you're pre-med, want to go into a STEM field, are even the slightest conservative, or like to have an average social life, do not go to Albion College."
College Junior,2,"It's a major part of campus life, but race, ancestory, and looks play a big part in admissions. The Greek GPA is frequently misconstrued as being higher than the non-Greek GPA, but the Greek-GPA includes first-semester freshmen who cannot rush Greek life as well as people who are interested in joining."
College Freshman,2,I could do way better.
College Freshman,2,"I am just finishing up my Freshman year at Albion and so far I am not that happy here. The professors of great and the small size of the classes makes the learning experience better. Albion College's social environment does not have many options. There are a lot of the same type of people. Plus, due to the college's small size there are not many people in general, giving even fewer options. I know that people either like it at Albion or they don't. I am considering transferring and a few of my friends are too. What is keeping me here is the great scholarship money. They have great financial aid. But, in the end, I don't know if it is worth staying here for 4 years."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no air conditioning, yet classes start in the end of August and many people move in early for sports, training, or organizations. Also, during summer research they don't let students stay in the one air conditioned dorm. Students cannot control the temperature so once it is winter, the heat is so overwhelming students keep their windows open. Most of the dorms are old and not up to code. Yet, they are the most expensive room and board prices in Michigan."
College Sophomore,2,"The teams are great, but very few students show up to show support at games or meets. The athletic facilities are shared between non-athletes and athletes, which makes it so the already tiny weight room is not available often for students to workout. It has a great pool, but during the work week it is only open to everyone three hours a day, sometimes less due to meets."
College Sophomore,2,there are very few apartment options. You basically have to buy a house in order to live off
College Sophomore,2,I've been to Albion several times and there really isn't much there.
College Sophomore,2,The town around the college is kinda run down so must people just live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There's really nothing to eat besides a Pizza Hut, KFC, Subway and two mexican places"
College Sophomore,2,"I want to live off campus to save money, but the school does not allow you to live in off campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is extremely difficult to get because of the residency requirement. If you apply and are allowed to move off campus the options aren't bad,"
College Freshman,2,Albion is run-down town that has little going for it except for a couple restaurants and the college.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much variety; there's a McDonalds, KFC, and Pizza Hut in town. There's Cascarelli's, which is a big favorite because they have the best pizza and breadsticks. "
College Sophomore,2,Albion is really expensive so almost everyone gets some form of financial aid.  I'm having trouble paying my bill so I've been trying to get help from the FA office and they haven't been that much help. 
College Sophomore,2,"Frat parties are the main thing. There's usually something every weekend. There aren't any nearby clubs, and there's only a few bars. "
College Sophomore,2,"Albion is tiny town with a few restaurants. The locals aren't huge fans of college kids, but be nice to them and you'll have no problems. You can always go into Jackson, about 20 minutes away, for tons of food options and shopping. "
College Senior,2,"There are a lot of international students, but most people are white."
Alum,1,"no online classes.  I graduated before online classes were available or used, however, online learning is far inferior to in person education"
Alum,1,"I never took any online classes. But if I had, I'm sure they would have been great. Apparently I need 100 characters in this space..."
Alum,1,I did not take any classes online during my time on campus. There needs to be a N/A option for this rating.
Junior,1,"Professors pick favorites a lot, some of the professors lost assignments and some didn't even answer emails."
Junior,1,"awful experience, transfer credits nowhere, car was robbed on campus along  with a camera stolen from my room, was expelled for failing an acting class due to a concussion, refuse to send transcripts, its a joke."
Niche User,1,They are not worth all the money they charge. They continue to raise prices by thousands every year without any return on investment.
Niche User,1,"I would give it zero stars. The adminstration likes to get away with a lot of crap. Including taking external scholarship money away from students, putting students into moldy rooms with furniture stuck to the floor, and not giving those with disabilities with the accommodations with were approved of through the college. Professors are great, the work it's challenging and worth the money. Living situations suck, food sucks."
College Junior,1,"For us paying the highest dorm costs in the state, the value is inadequate."
College Sophomore,1,"You are not allowed to live off campus, even though there are a number of empty houses that could be used as special interest student housing. You aren't allowed to buy your own house to live in, even though the community outside of campus is dying and needs help from the students to stay alive."
College Freshman,1,Housing is something you need to apply for if you want something better than Whitehouse.
College Freshman,1,"There are very few places to eat, both on and off campus."
College Freshman,1,You're not even allowed to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Very strict, you have no chance of getting away with anything or being about to state your case. They'll think your guilty no matter what, and fine you an obscene amount of money."
College Sophomore,1,"Old, out of date. Either too hot or too cold. Small living, with out of date appliances. Very poor. "
College Sophomore,1,You aren't allowed to live off campus. Albion's way of making sure you keep paying room and board.
College Sophomore,1,The internet at Albion is close to awful. Some of the worst connection you'll find at a school. Near impossible to get anything done because everyone is on. 
College Sophomore,1,"Not the best experience I've had, rather poor. I wish I chose a different school. Quite a large amount of cons compared to most schools. "
Recent Alumnus,1,The college really discourages students to go off campus so to try and get off campus you have to get approval from the school for special reasons.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The was a macdonalds, a taco bell 30 minutes away and then a gas station..."
College Sophomore,1,There are no people of color on campus with the exception of a few african americans including my self.

Sophomore,5,Great education. Easy enrollment process. Very good and capable professors. Student life its awesome and good sports tournaments.
Freshman,5,I really like the university. The campus is so natural and peaceful that makes it beautiful. Professors have been nice and clear at the time of giving classes. You can take tutories for free of a lot of diversity of classes.
Niche User,5,"This University has it all in on place,Each building is separated by category,its very easy to get around there.
The School of Optometry is like 2 minutes from the actual campus which is really nice.
The only major that is separated is the School of Aeronautics"
Freshman,5,The Inter American University of Puerto Rico - Bayamon is a  unique school and all expectations were exceeded.
Senior,5,"The opportunities that gives you the freedom it gives you, all that has to offer, from installations, material, learning ... But the best thing that leaves you desempeñarte in a workplace and academic as you want, and you get yours to exploit capabilities and qualities that can take you to be a high achiever. Its also great student atmosphere that makes everyone feel at home, surrounded by great people with different characteristics. The changes are to continue improving."
College Sophomore,5,My university every year wins the sport games vs PR universities..
College Senior,5,"I feel more safe at campus that at home. The security is very strict, they are always in patrol and checking who get inside the campus. There's not drinking at all at college because you'll get caught easily..So don't Try IT!!"
College Sophomore,5,"there's a wide variety of people on campus. they are all accepted no matter their economic situation, religion, major, sexual orientation, etc. everybody is super friendly."
College Senior,5,It rains a lot but that doesn't affect the classes.  The classrooms and the parking are all close. It's a tropical island so it's and ever changing weather but it's really good.
College Sophomore,5,"it is a good and wide parking that fits lots of cars, though some days you will not find a parking lot easy but in general it is good and wide"
College Junior,5,"well through the two years that i had in the interamerican university, i didn't see any drug scene or any other scene in the campus because there are guards that always check the places all over the campus to make sure that everything is okay and no one is doing something bad."
College Senior,5,The Best Social Atmosphere – I love this campus. All professors help us to be professional and full of knowledge. Students are respectuful and the campus atmosfere is calmed and relaxing.
College Sophomore,5,"Biology Major Importance – I'm in the Inter American University of Puerto Rico - Bayamon and my major is Biology and throughout my college years, I've noticed that it's laborious but interesting major. However, most students can not handle the load and decide to change their major. They do not see beyond the present and to set their sights set on the big achievements that all those who stand fast in defense of our biology will acquire. The biology curriculum is well diverse and covers many branches of both science and the humanities that will be like a window to the world of work. The facilities are great and in very good condition especially the laboratories, who with their tools will lead us to discover another way of seeing the world and how we can make a difference in it. This major gives us many opportunities to get a job in the future as we prepare to stand out and make any profession related to science, environment and technology."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Pay the $20-$30 Per Semester! Parking Cost it $20 or $30 per semester, but considere this, I rather prefer pay those $30 bucks, that park outside the campus and find my car without tires!! (true story!)"
College Freshman,5,"Academic Life in  Inter Americana University of Puerto Rico - Bayamon – The registration process is fast and not deficult to do, can access from internet and apply. I can access from internet to see my grades and trasncription credit and accept my finacial aid. As anyplace there very good professors and some not that good, but the curriculum and the system make the professors go by the book. Then if the professor if not that good the book help you pass the class, no problem. Many academic activities in the year and rewards for the progres of the student I been experienced."
Junior,4,"ITS A GREAT UNIVERSITY, WERE THEY DONT TREAT YOU AS ANOTHER NUMBER. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN FAMILY."
Senior,4,"I like this college because its a very quiet campus and the students are very nice, same as the professors. But I've noticed the problem of individualism in the student body and its that not many student try to really socialize with each other and the administration has done nothing about it. Also, there isn't much of support for the campus choir. Other than that, its very peaceful and any place is quiet enough to study."
Junior,4,Very good experience with the professionals that work in this university such as employees and professors. Excellent service and classes in order to be prepare for the future.
Sophomore,4,"The university's hallways and bathrooms are always clean. It has a good location and there are plenty of fastfood restaurants in case you don't want to eat at the cafeteria (which has good food and prices). Also, of you forget to buy something there is a store 5 minutes away by foot and every classroom has air-conditioning. There are also two computer rooms where you can print what you need for cheap and there are always available computers for people to do their homework. The library staff is really polite so they help you with anything you need.

The university has very few seating areas and even less tables. When it's raining everyone is guaranteed to get wet either for the gigantic puddles or because you have to go to another building and there is no way to get to it with ceiling. Most importantly the student's wifi is horrible so for people to do their work they have to use their own internet or hotspot or go to one of the computer rooms."
Senior,4,I liked the environment of the campus and the way that the professors approached the subjects of study and hopefully I would like to see the colleague growing and taking into consideration new techniques in the forensic area.
Sophomore,4,Good university i would like some changes in some courses that we need and if you dont choose quickly it will be full.
College Freshman,4,Its okay they are nice.
College Freshman,4,The school is not too difficult to get into.  It offers a multicultural experience with the opportunity to visit some gorgeous beaches.  Most of the teachers are excellent.  The faculty and administration care about their students and work very hard to make sure that we are working happy and are content.  
College Freshman,4,"My school is very unique in the sense that it is an English-speaking school in the Caribbean that produces bilingual Optometrists.  The weather is always wonderful here.  There are students from many parts of the world.  There are more than 15 different languages spoken by less than 200 students.  While the school produces good doctors, it is dedicated to helping students who are struggling."
College Freshman,4,"The school is brand new and is very well kept.  The library is small, but adequate for the program.  The school is lacking in a few amenities, but technology is adequate.  There are many campus events and activities.  There is a gym available to the students that is slightly small and run-down, but is very useful and easily accessible."
College Freshman,4,"There were many exchange programs in our school available for foreign students to come to the U.S.  I felt that the majority of foreign students were Hispanic, Asian and Middle Eastern.  The campus was also very diverse in religion, sexual orientation, political beliefs and economic background.  I feel that, for the most part, students were accepting of others.  I never witnessed any discrimination or racism, personally."
College Freshman,4,"There were not many options of places to eat near campus, because the campus was relatively small.  However, there were many options at each of those few restaurants.  There were a few pizza places that provided decent pizza and were very inexpensive.  Still, there were very nice restaurants that provided adequate dining experiences and extensive menu options."
College Freshman,4,"I admit, occasionally I would hear of a murder or sexual assault on or near campus.  I also heard of date-rape situations many times.  However, I feel that security presence was adequate.  It seemed that insecure incidents were isolated and almost always involved non students.  The school would always send out a text and email to each student when there was a threat in the area and always investigated every situation."
College Senior,4,The statistics about crime is extremely low.
College Sophomore,4,"the parking at college is quite wide, there are more than one parking lot and its cost is $30 per semester"
College Junior,4,"We consider our system one of the best competing with other universities of Puerto Rico. In the past annual overall competition we reached first place, demonstrating that superiority in the majority of the competitions and sports."
College Junior,4,"Well, campus police is very strict. Nobody enters the campus in a car without identifying themselves. The school has a lot of programs involving social activities; concerts, movies, conferences. Also academically we have a our societies which help us developing our professional life."
College Junior,4,There is not a lot of walking distance Off-Campus near Inter American University of Puerto Rico but there are a few. But non walking distance there is a lot of options. The Campus even has a bus that pick you up at the train station drop you at the campus and then takes you back to the train station.  It is also worth mentioning that there is an on-campus housing for optometry students
College Senior,4,Financial Aid has help a lot in my academic studies and the process of obtaining this financial aid has been relatively easy.
College Junior,4,"If you're going to study in Puerto Rico, and want a great college, this is the one for you. It's the newest campus in the island and the most advanced, technologically speaking."
College Freshman,2,"Basically, if you don't own a car, you will go nowhere for six months.  There is a grocery store and a few fast-food places within walking distance.  The school will often provide a bus that will drop students off at a shopping center on Saturdays, but it can be inconvenient.  There is no public transportation available and bicycles are very difficult to maneuver on the busy roads.  There's not very much space available, so the locals never use bicycles."
Recent Alumnus,2,Average Food – The white rice always taste bad! But meat is good.  The student combo deal is good.
College Senior,1,The off-campus housing is too expensive

Junior,5,"It has been positive. It did take some time for the professors to get set up online, but when they got it up and running, it ran smoothly."
Freshman,5,It has smaller class sizes which allows you to get to know your professor. The staff and professors are really adamant at trying to have you succeed especially in your first year. There are so many opportunities of inclusion that allows you to fell part of something greater than yourself.
Freshman,5,"I love the programs they offer, sometimes I struggle with the lack of communication from higher ups like the dean of students etc, but proffessors are amazing and I really am interested in my major which is great since it is a niche major."
Alum,5,I really liked the small class  sizes and how you were able to really  interact with the professors. As member of the biology department you were able to grow and really find your place with the aid of faculty. Clubs were a great resource for networking and getting to know others within the sciences. Biology Seminar enabled you to see what  events were happening  and to showcase the research done in the summer by other students.  Summer Research was a great experience that provided skills utilized after college. Overall I was really able to flourish and participate not only in the science  community at Hamline but the community at Hamline as a whole.
Freshman,5,Welcoming community. Feels like a suburban neighborhood in the middle of a city. Professors are great! A lot of fun activities and clubs!
Sophomore,5,"Hamline University is a very small and connected college. Hamline is surrounded by the Saint Paul and Roseville community with various attractions near by. Hamline is great for a community with emphasis on giving back to the community. A great place to be, learn and interact, Hamline."
Freshman,5,"Hamline University is a great university you can attend. Its core values of inclusion, leadership, and development lead students to achieve their dreams of pursuing a degree they would like to become. The campus is big, and the classes are small, around 10 to 14 students per teacher."
Junior,5,"I like the close relationships you can build with teachers. The campus is nice, however the surrounding area is a different atmosphere than the campus itself. I feel safe on campus though and I've taken classes that end at night. I also like that you have the opportunity to buy Starbucks and subway on campus."
Alum,5,"I attended Hamline University as a transfer student from a community college. Hamline made the transition seamless and I felt welcome from day one. My professors were always helpful and available for one on one meetings. I always felt the professors wanted each and every student to succeed. A benefit of being a smaller private universities is you have a chance to spend more time with your peers and create strong and lasting friendships. Overall, I believe Hamline University is a great place to study that provides excellent opportunity after graduation."
Alum,5,"I loved how supportive their professors are. As a student with a disability, their disability resources department worked creatively and tirelessly with me and my team of professors to ensure I was able to succeed and thrive here."
Sophomore,5,Great school. Good teachers and good students who are very nice. Could improve in diversity and tuition is very high.
Alum,5,"Hamline is a very tight niche university with a small classroom size as it should be with a private university. The education level achieved is top notched in the state and well worth the cost....although it is very expensive compared to most private universities in Mn. However, you get what you pay for!!"
Freshman,5,I really like how the professors get to know you and care about you. Where you're not just a number. The track coaches are amazing and so incredibly helpful for incoming freshman.
Freshman,5,Coming to HU has been one of the best decisions I have ever made! The professors are great and very knowledgeable.
Junior,5,"As of now I am a Junior at Hamline University. The university offers a lot of great resources such as tutoring if you are having a hard time getting through your classes. A career research center that provide helpful tips and advices for current students who are not sure what they want to do or be. Hamline University is a small private school in Saint Paul and is by the main light rail. This is an accessible way to get around the Twin Cities, which makes Hamline University an outstanding college."
Niche User,5,"My father attended Hamline University, and my sister is currently a first-year student. They both are in love with the campus, community, and overall feel of the school. The school made the transition from High School to college much easier. I am proud to say I belong to a family of Pipers!"
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my education experience at Hamline University.  All of my professors were attentive to my needs.  I graduated with a double major in elementary education and psychology in less than 4 years.  With no transfers going into Hamline University.  The only thing that was hard was a lot of students hometowns were nearby, so a lot of students went home on the weekends."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. It's way underrated. Check out the professor's backgrounds, they will surprise you. Many of my professors had their Bachelor's from Ivy Leagues, and others at least held their PhD from top universities. It's basically Top university education within a small campus. Every faculty member is definitely trying to help, if not going an extra mile to help. The only con is the tuition. Even after scholarships  it's still going to cost you a chunk."
Sophomore,5,"I have highly enjoyed my first two years at Hamline. Moving half way across the country was a hard descision to make but I am so happy I decided to make it. There are great people here, it's in an awesome location, and wonderful staff. Professors are nice and helpful no matter what. You're located in St. Paul but far enough from downtown that you dont experience much traffic and you still get the small town feeling while on/around campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love Hamline! Everyone here is so nice and helpful, I always feel safe on the campus, I have access to practically everything I need on campus, teachers are practically always available when I need help, and they have all the majors and minors I could want!"
Senior,5,"Hamline has a great campus and welcoming atmosphere.  All of the professors I met were passionate about what they do.  The campus was nice and compact, giving it distinction from the surrounding city."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Hamline is the school and communities diversity and student involvement. I also really admire the student to teacher ratio, classroom sizes, and the major/ class variety in options. Those are the important things that I took into consideration and those are what made Hamline my first choice school. I really appreciate how involved the staff are with the students and that's what makes the school really enjoyable."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Hamline in 2016. I can confidently say that my decision to attend Hamline was the best decision I could have made. The professors are excellent, and I met some of my best friends here. You definitely get out what you put into your program."
Freshman,5,"During my first year at Hamline, I have grown already with so many people. The campus is beautiful and everything about it just feels like home."
Junior,5,I love the sense of community that Hamline has.  The diversity is great.  The professors are awesome.  I wish it wasnâ€™t so expensive and there were more scholarships that Hamline offered.
Freshman,5,Hamline University is a very welcoming school. They put so much emphasis on acceptance on campus ground. A diverse school with lots of open opportunities.
Freshman,5,"The campus at Hamline is just gorgeous with its gardens and lawns. The students are so nice and diverse, many different personas and opinions."
Junior,5,"Since transferring to Hamline, I have found that students and staff are both very friendly.  I enjoy the area and have met great people.  I also am ejoying school, as I have finally found what I enjoy-finance."
Freshman,5,"Hamline is a very small campus. But it also great, because you get to know your professors and they get to know you as well. The classes are small and classmates are really respectful and polite. I wouldn't want anything to change, because it is great as it is."
Sophomore,5,"Hamline is a small campus, which I love.  I am able to talk to my professors and get answers to my questions quickly.  I know many of the students on the campus and that's what I wanted.  I love my classes and there is enough activities for anyone."
College Sophomore,5,"This school fits me.  It is small, easy to get around, professors are available for help.  I love it."
College Senior,5,Hamline is extraordinarily terrific about diversity.
College Senior,5,I love Hamline.  They care about me as a person.
College Senior,5,Hamline does everything to prevent sexual assault.
College Senior,5,My registration was handled flawlessly.
College Senior,5,Hamline is an excellent liberal arts college.
College Junior,5,I have never has so much help as I have at Hamline
College Sophomore,5,"I love Hamline! My favorite parts about it are the size and location. Being in the Twin Cities means that there is always something going on, and having a community of only 2,000ish people means that their are familiar faces everywhere I go!"
College Freshman,5,Security will escort you up to a mile off campus
College Freshman,5,"Great variety, helpful & understanding professors"
College Freshman,5,"Great variety, helpful & understanding professors"
College Freshman,5,Wonderful community service work & social events
College Freshman,5,Connects everyone at the school great spirit
College Freshman,5,Professors know your name. That's one of the most important things about the classes here. It was really important for me to go to a small school where the professors care. The professors and courses here are truly some of the best in Minnesota.
College Freshman,5,The staff has been very helpful and having visiting hours are very important to create better relationships.
College Freshman,5,"I might be biased because I am Greek. We do the most philanthropy events on campus and if there is a party it's a fundraising possibility. All the people in Greek are very nice and the Fraternity is a dry house. I'm making most of my friends in Greek or through Greek events. There's not a line between Greeks and Non-Greeks. If you're Greek that's cool, if you're not that's cool too. But almost everyone is involved in a group or club. Greek holds a lot of events so a lot of people appreciate us for what we do."
College Junior,5,I love my classes in the Criminal Justice program and the different classes offered to fulfill my major requirements. The advisors for my program are really good at working with transfer students to get as many classes transferred in for credit as possible.
College Junior,5,I transferred in so I mostly take courses in my major and I love my professors. I'm in the criminal justice program and my professors are knowledgeable and passionate about the issues facing our criminal justice system and the people that work in it. They make going to class something I look forward to every day. I had one freshman level class that was required for transfer students and was taught by an adjunct professor and I hated it. The teacher had the maturity of a sixteen year old boy with ADHD.
College Freshman,5,"The process of registering for class is quick but can be difficult because the classes fill up within minutes. 

Students are able to study just about anything they want as well as build their own major if needed. 

Hamline is known for Psychology and Education but many other departments are growing quickly such as Criminal Justice and Digital Media Arts."
College Freshman,5,"A new fear has come to light, decision making. The process of choosing a school to attend for the next four years was difficult. Nevertheless, the Hamline experience resinated with me the most. The people, campus, and overall environment surrounding this university created a wonderful atmosphere. There is excitement in the air, smiles engulf the school. The is uncertainty regarding what I will choose to study. However, Hamline has showed the support that I will possibly need. I am excited to learn everything about this school, and create the rest of my future with the strong education base this school offers."
College Sophomore,5,I love the St. Paul area.
College Freshman,5,I live off-campus and it is great. It is way cheaper than the dorms. Plenty of houses surrounding the campus in which is walking distance. It is fairly cheap if having roommates and splitting rent.
College Freshman,5,As an athlete here the facilities and staff are amazing here.  Some of the other athletes can be very annoying though.  Academics are also stressed by the coaches.
College Freshman,5,It's awesome.  There's a chipotle and bdubs less than ten minutes away from campus and a tbell within walking distance.
College Freshman,5,For me I think it's a great school to get a degree from.  It's a very respectable University.
College Freshman,5,I've loved it here so far.  Coming to Hamline was one of my best decisions.
College Sophomore,5,"Financial aid is a huge support in my ability to afford college, and getting a large amount of financial aid from the school was easy and convenient for me."
College Sophomore,5,I have not been exposed to drugs at all during my stay so far.
College Freshman,5,they searched for and found extra money to entice me to come . . and it worked!
College Freshman,5,It is a very diverse community and most of the time the people on campus are accepting. 
Junior,4,Great school. I just started my junior school and have loved every second of it. The professors work hard to pass on their knowledge and give all the resources that they can to the students.
Freshman,4,"The classes are fairly easy to learn from, the professors tell you that the reading and assignments are the most important concepts of the class. Our finals are all online. Most classes are either hybrid or completely online."
Junior,4,When COVID-19 came into affect Hamline's professors worked hard on making sure that their students could understand the units and were able to provide links to other sites for students to look at for a better understanding on a topic if need be.
Junior,4,My experience with Hamline is very good. Professors are for the most part supportive and are willing to help you with anything that you may need.
Senior,4,"Hamline was an overall great school for me, I would go again if I had the chance. It gave me once in a life opportunities to study abroad and learn about so many different things, even though the student life had its disadvantages as a commuter student."
Sophomore,4,I have overall really enjoyed my college experience at Hamline University. Being in a very diverse area introduces me to many people with fun personalities!
Freshman,4,"I really like the welcoming and opening atmosphere at Hamline. The classes are also a good challenge and fun to participate in. Overall, faculty and students are really kind and fun to be around. Now if only some of the money earned by the University would be used to fix up it's campus...."
Alum,4,It was good. I went for womenâ€™s studies and creative writing. It was really expensive though and a lot of work. I had wonderful professors and a really supportive advisor. They always made me feel welcome.
Junior,4,I've really enjoyed having small class seizes and getting to know the professors. I am not a big fan of the administration that is currently running Hamline because it seems like they do not care about their faculty/staff or students. But I have met great people who are in admin positions there and many other amazing people.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy being a student at hamline. The professors are very personable with all students. Hamline is kind of pricey but it's a good school, especially if you're looking for a small/private university."
Sophomore,4,It is a little pricey for some of the facilities. The staff members are good and their jobs and are willing to help anyone. Academics are structured very well and you defiantly feel that you are being challenged.
Freshman,4,I really like the size of the classes and the campus as a whole. The only thing is this a commuter school and if you are like me and don't plan on going home every weekend a word of warning that campus really clears out on the weekend.
Freshman,4,The professors are all pretty great compared to other professors especially from bigger schools such as the University of Minnesota as most of the professors there are not good teachers. The professors here are very open and they put a lot more effort in classes and their lesson plans and this is helped by their ability to actually learn their students names. That one on one type of relationship with a professor is great for trying to gain a spot on research team that is a little more than taking down data and just using a shaker for flasks of chemicals. The students are all very warm and mostly welcoming but there are always a few who are not. The athletics and parties are not  strong suit here as they either suck or is at best okay.
Freshman,4,What I like about Hamline is that it is quite a small university so your paid attention to by your professors.
Junior,4,I've enjoyed studying at Hamline. Every professor I've had has been amazing and really knows what they're teaching. The small classroom sizes are something that I think really help a lot of people out and I like having classes of only 20 people.
Sophomore,4,"Campus, professors, and housing are all great! However, adjunct professors are not treated great by the institution, and the curriculum seems to be shifting away from their liberal-arts image toward a more business and STEM focus, which is frustrating."
Freshman,4,"Overall this school is pretty great, there is a big emphasis on actually getting what you came. not many people go out partying. The places the school could stand to improve on are the food and diversity, the food is pretty bland but it's edible and there are options for almost everyone. The diversity is better than some places but its pretty standard, for being in a metropolitan area I would expect to see more students of color."
Freshman,4,"This University is worth it, but is quite expensive. Food is edible, but I miss having any flavor in my food. They stopped serving chicken nuggs. The area has good transportation to a lot of the Twin Cities with the A Line buses and the Green Line down the road."
Freshman,4,"I like Hamline, but when I first came, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It took some time to adjust but I ended up liking it when I found my friends. I would definitely want to graduate from here if the tuition wasn't so high."
Sophomore,4,"My time at Hamline has encouraged me to grow in so many ways. The professors and staff are all very friendly, and the programs are decent. Hamline helps their students to succeed, and it is very easy to meet with professors or counselors to help you get internships. The professors are also very understanding of mental illnesses, and the Disabilities Resource people are my heroes."
Freshman,4,"Great university overall! It can lack in an area here or there, but in general it's a solid college with solid academics, great surrounding area, lively student life, and many resources to help students achieve their best selves."
Junior,4,Hamline offers various types of areas of study to choose from and participate in. It also offers a wide range of clubs to join. Tuition does keep increasing each year which is something to look out for.
Freshman,4,I like that I can meet with people because they hold events to meet and chat with sother college students.
Sophomore,4,The classes are great at Hamline University. The professors really care about their students and their students future. The food is not that good and also most of the sports team at Hamline are pretty bad compared to the other competition. The campus is very safe in my opinion and security will drive you in a one mile radius to wherever in that radius.
Niche User,4,I enjoyed my experience with Hamline. The were very through and answered any questions I may have had. They pointed me in the direction I wanted to go
Junior,4,"Hamline University is home to a very progressive and inclusive community. Hamline offers endless opportunity - if there is something that you want to do, something that you dream of, the amazing faculty and staff do their best to make it a reality."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Hamline this year. I am from a small town, so I wanted to move to the city for a change of scenery. Hamline is a small school, so I figured that it would be much more in my comfort zone. I really enjoyed my first year here. The food was decent, my dorm room was nice and big, and the campus is very well kept and pretty. I did not experience much student life despite living on campus. Many students go home on the weekends, so it was a bit difficult to meet people. Overall, going to school here has been a good experience. I do think some of the buildings could use some renovations, though."
Sophomore,4,"Something that I really like about Hamline is their flex-curriculum. It's possible to quadruple major here if you come in with a good amount of credits and are a motivated student. You can also write a proposal stating the name of a major you wish to create for yourself. Professors and staff will guide you in the pursuit after a council approves your created major. However, if there were one thing I'd change, it'd be the structure of the buildings. Being an old university, some of the buildings could use renewal. While that's been happening slowly, the room for improvement is certainly visible."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, encouraging professors and faculty. Everyone on campus is always happy and wants to connect. Classes are small and allow a lot more personalized and discussion based instruction."
Freshman,4,"Campus is smaller than other universities, professors and other faculty members are really nice and helpful. There are a fair amount of programs offered here and with the Hamline Plan, it allows you to be more flexible with your courses in order to graduate. In terms of other students, people are more introverted here but fairly nice. Overall a nice compact school."
Freshman,4,"I like it here, it's small and the school offers help to anyone in need almost the time. Professors can teach and offer great ways to interact with the classroom and are dedicated to their field. So overall its cool."
Sophomore,4,Decent but unless you're involved in something it's hard to make friends.  The professors are amazing.
Graduate Student,4,"I have enjoyed the classes taken so far.  In my specific field of study there are many changes taking place, which is causing miscommunication between faculty and students.  This has created much confusion and stress for me."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience with Hamline University is great. The class size is perfect for someone who likes small class sizes and a personal connection with their professors. This university is also really into social justice and the LGBTQ community, so for those who are passionate about those things, Hamline is perfect for them. However, the negative things about Hamline is that since it is a liberal arts school, each student is required to take a certain amount of diversity, humanity, fine arts, etc. classes. Another thing is that the food on campus does not have a good variety and the only other option to the cafeteria is subway, which is on the other end of campus."
Sophomore,4,"Hamline University is a great college for people that like small class sizes and a convenient campus.  They have many different teams, clubs, organizations, and leadership opportunities on campus.  You get the chance to know your classmates as well as the professor and have that one-to-one interaction that many people are looking for.  Overall, Hamline University makes everyone feel welcome and provides the students with knowledge that will last a lifetime."
Freshman,4,"I am about to start my second semester as a freshman at Hamline University, and I have had very little to complain about. My professors first semester were all so helpful and invested in truly helping their students succeed. Their office hours were always super open to students, and they were some of the friendliest people I have met. Although the school is originally very expensive, they offer many scholarships and loans through financial aid that make attending the university infinitely more affordable. Classes were neither too  easy nor too difficult. They were just enough work to challenge me, but not overwhelm me. If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation. The toilets and showers are always broken, and the elevator does not always work. The size of my room is perfect, though. Unfortunately I will not be living on campus next year due to the old living facilities, though."
Freshman,4,It's a great campus with lots of opportunity! I loved my time at Hamline and I felt comfortable and I got along with with everyone I met on campus.
Freshman,4,This school is very liberal and itâ€™s very open about the complicated issues in todayâ€™s society. I feel very welcomed and itâ€™s a safe environment. The professors are very kind and you actually get to know them and they know you. The only thing I would change is make it slightly bigger since itâ€™s quite a small campus. Also we have to pay for printing which I rather have included in the tuition.
Sophomore,4,"They're bad at sorting out money and where to put it, but the professors are cool. If you want an ellcellent education I don't recommend this place"
Junior,4,"I have greatly enjoyed my time at Hamline. All of the professors are extremely helpful in guiding you towards the next step in your life. The variety of coursework and requirements lets you explore options you normally wouldn't think about. Like all liberal arts schools, it's a little biased. Nevertheless, I've had a fun time at Hamline and have learned a lot."
Senior,4,There are some issue but the school is overall a good university to go to and have dedicated professors to connect to. Their Education Program is also very good and is one of the reason I decided to attend.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very good and willing to work with students. Campus is beautiful and safe. The dorms are pretty nice, and dining hall options are very good. Don't hear much about the party scene, though it is there."
Sophomore,4,"Hamline is one of the best Liberal Arts school because it provides resources to help support students and has a small class setting. Many colleges teach students to be successful. However, Hamline teaches students to be different. Hamline students are not afraid to speak out against situations that need to be justified and has sparked more diversity on campus."
Freshman,4,Hamline University creates a place for many different communities. Being a small enough school that personal connections can be created and maintained is really important and yet there are always people you have yet to meet. The campus is kept up very well and theres a good sense of community. Different changes are an open conversation and fosters a sense of trust and respect.
Junior,4,"Great place for academic success and feeling like you are a part of social change/community development. Worth the investment, and they provide generous financial aid. The faculty are invested in the students and also have tremendous experience in their respective fields."
Freshman,4,"Great community, wonderful teachers, expensive tuition. They have events for stress relief, a well-kept gym, and cafeteria. Just a bit north there are stores and malls that contain all the necessities for living and entertainment."
Sophomore,4,I have loved my experience so far at Hamline University. It is a small school with a lot to offer. The theatre program here is a great program. It gives students ample opportunity to not only work in the theatre but also learn how to budget and manage a theatre. I have gotten so many great opportunities. The faculty here has a lot of experience and can help with so many things from personal to academic.
Freshman,4,It has a small community atmosphere within a big city network which makes it easy to obtain the best of both worlds.
Junior,4,"The campus is small,  but not too small. People are generally friendly. Food is decent, but could be improved. The financial aid process was difficult for me to figure out at first and I wasn't sure who I needed to talk to for help. The activities that I would want to participate in, the school doesn't have (Cheerleading, Marching Band). The class times usually don't change from semester to semester and they can be very difficult to fit into my schedule."
Senior,4,"Hamline is a great university. The small class sizes create a great opportunity for you to get more connected with the professors and other students, thus enhancing your learning experience. There are a variety of clubs and teams that you can join. Campus is not too big which makes it easier to get from place to place. The professors liy care about their students and want them to do their best."
Sophomore,4,Love the small size and the beautiful campus. The professors in the chemistry department are so helpful and passionate about their subjects.
Freshman,4,"Hamline is a very diverse school. It is extremely good at making people feel like a community. As I attend school here, I am very happy because it feels as though we are all part of one community. Though it is diverse in culture and religions, I think there could be more social gatherings that could be offered to bring people together. 
Hamline is a very proactive school. It provides many opportunities from studying abroad to internships with you desired major."
Freshman,4,"My university so far is great ! The campus is great and the environment is extremely Special. The people here are very welcoming, and our historic but progressive, the architecture and the faculty are both true to history. Your education is very challenged and valued at Hamline University."
College Senior,4,"The campus is right between the Twin Cities, has many different programs, a beautiful student center, and awesome students."
College Senior,4,It feels as if Hamline is a widely respected small liberal arts university. A degree opens door to many post-grad opportunities.
College Senior,4,Being a student athlete has been rewarding. At times it can be cliquey but it's only because your teammates become your closest friends.
College Senior,4,Endless opportunities to get involved on and off campus. If you choose to take advantage of them you will be set up for success in your career field of choice.
College Sophomore,4,The class size is important to me.  I need to be able to ask questions and become part of a discussion in a class and not just rely on the textbook.
College Sophomore,4,This school is well known.  I believe that opportunities will exist for great career services when the time comes to needing them.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy living on campus.  It's a great way to meet new people especially if you are not from the area and didn't know anyone before you came to school.
Niche User,2,"Met some friendly people here but at the same time I have met a lot of rude people both faculty and students. Very stuck up including black kids that makes fun of you if you are not like them. Also, I feel white students were nicer to Muslim and Asian kids but not always to black students. They taught you as if they expected you to be smart as a student that got their PhD and Master Degree."
Freshman,2,"The students and the campus is fairly nice, but as far as the school aiding its student its fairly bad. There have been countless times, where I've gone to the student administrative office for help, and not gotten it. Personally I think that its the schools job to ensure this doesn't happen."
Junior,2,"It is far too expensive for what it is. Residential Life office does NOT care about the students, same with Student Accounts office. So many qualms with Hamline."
Freshman,2,"The people and faculty are very nice and friendly. The requirements for the curriculum seem a bit much, and it's very expensive. The campus isn't the safest; I am on the track team and during a practice, several teammates had their stuff stolen by non-Hamline people, and Hamline didn't do anything about it. The campus is very involved in the public, but the public in this area isn't the best; there are constant sirens, and there was even a shooting/murder that happened right in front my dorm. Asides from the lack of safety and how expensive it is, its a good school."
Junior,2,"Serious within department conflicts amongst professors and administration, low-yield research opportunities that are preferentially distributed to non-transfer students, little-to-no within department student employment opportunities, and very high variance in educational competency. I would seriously not recommend this institution for psychology majors."
Sophomore,2,"Look Hamline is not a great school. Academically it holds its' own because of the small classroom sizes and passionate professors it is easy to learn. That being said there is a lot more bad than good. Those professors are not paid nearly what they should be because the school has so much debt, this results in a lot of professor turnover. Socially this school is also pretty dead, the frat here is a joke and only about 1 in 3 parties are worth going to. I've heard people say ""you aren't a true Hamline student until you hate Hamline"" and I think that that's pretty true."
Niche User,2,"Simply put Hamline is an okay school, there are much better ones in the area. There is much frustration within the student body about the new President and her decision to overhaul the current curriculum and to get rid of free J-term. Many professors seem to be leaving or are just adjuncts who don't really care, that being said there are also many dedicated and caring professors in the university too. The dorms are also awful here, live off campus. Overall you could find a much better school than this one to attend."
College Senior,2,Not a large part of our campus
College Freshman,2,I actually really worry about my safety on this campus. There is so much evidence of sexual assault. I'm afraid to walk alone at night but I appreciate the safety and security option.
College Freshman,2,"There is safety and security cars that will come pick you up anywhere on campus which is gteat. If someone reports sexual assault though the school does very little. A girl was raped and the school allows the boy to be in sports and go to this school. It's wrong. They just try and talk it out, but don't do any serious work to help the victim. I'm very disappointed in how the school handles the sexual assault crimes."
College Student,2,"The good: It's really close to anywhere you'll need to be since the campus is so small. The social life is fantastic, but the dorms are generally quiet enough during the week that it's possible to get necessary work time/sleep. The buildings are reasonably secure and the dorm rooms themselves, while somewhat lacking in square footage, have a decent number of outlets and such. Laundry machines are plentiful and easy to access.

The bad: No air conditioning and prohibitions on any sort of personal appliance, including but not limited to personal air conditioners. Unbunking beds in certain dorms is against the rules. No control over the heat in an individual room either - temperature regulation must be accomplished solely with windows and fans. Communal bathrooms get filthy and run-down very quickly, and the cleaning staff consists of only one or two people per floor. Water pressure is inconsistent along with water heat. Some buildings only have a single (small) kitchen serving everyone in it."
College Student,2,"Difficult to rate the Greek life due to its utter lack of prevalence. There is one sorority and one fraternity on campus, and membership is not particularly large in either. If one is searching for an active Greek life, this writer recommends finding a different campus."
College Sophomore,2,Hemline sucked away my soul.Transferred out after one year.
College Sophomore,2,Not any good options that are close.
College Sophomore,2,The food quality and options have been going down almost daily. Meat is often under cooked and there is no flavor to anything.
College Junior,2,"Honestly I think it has gone downhill. I used to be a member because it was pretty chill and something we did for both ourselves and those around us since we were a philanthropic org. However, this year I left because it has become much cliquer, the leadership was demanding it be your number one priority, and while it they got it under control the drinking was at least a small problem for awhile."
College Sophomore,2,"There is one sorority and one fraternity. They are occasionally noticed during sporting events, but otherwise are quite outside of hosting events and parties."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors are hit and miss for me. I've experienced very caring professors, but they just don't know how to relay the information to the student so they could understand. They care about your success, but they don't know how to help. Some professors are so energetic and happy to share their experiences and their knowledge, which is the best way I learn. If the professors are energetic and easy going, I learn better. Registration process is easy, but you have to know what you want to do before you register and you have to register fast, because classes will go by faster than you think. If you don't get a certain class at a certain time, you have to talk to professors and hope they would let you into their class."
College Sophomore,2,"We have Apartments, but they're more expensive than living on campus. They also have different houses for organizations (black pride house, sorority, fraternity, hmong house). You have to be very committed to those organizations to be able to live in one of those houses. It is only safe if you live near school, but by living near school, it is very expensive. The farther you go, the cheaper it gets, but the more inconvenience and less safe it is."
College Sophomore,2,Just about anyone with good grades can get in. They don't have a lot of events associated with greek life.
College Freshman,2,Winter is brutal and it goes from November to April. -20 degree weather is common and the dorms were in lock-down (students not allowed out of the dorms for safety reasons because it was too cold) several times this last year.
College Freshman,2,"The football team is well supported by the students and university even though the team doesn't fair well. Some of the other sports, like soccer, have to fend for themselves. Coaching is an issue as well."
College Freshman,2,It's always cold or raining so walking outside is miserable.
College Senior,2,"its minnesota, what do you expect? its always unpredictable"
College Senior,2,"the greek life is more so for alternative people, not the typical greeks you see at big schools"
College Senior,2,"they are not very willing to escort, even though it is part of their job"
College Freshman,2,The parking permits are really expensive and finding spaces to park that aren't permit only is really hard. 
College Freshman,2,"Minnesota winters can be harsh! Class may be cancelled up to a few days a month in the winter, but only if the weather is really terrible."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is just gross, everybody knows that. Since it's the only option, people deal with it. Hamline tries to accommodate to what people want, but it just isn't enough. Hamline uses Aramark, which just provides gross food. (if you want to look into it more you'll find out some interesting things about Aramark haha)"
College Sophomore,2,"I've heard this go on both sides. Some of my friends have had no problems with Financial Aid and everything has gone smoothly with no questions or problems. For myself, financial aid has always been a problem. Hamline is really expensive, and although they try to give as much as possible sometimes it isn't enough (but for some people it is plenty!). It really depends on your parents income, which is unfortunate. "
College Sophomore,2,"It's in MinneSNOWta, need I say more? Well to get anywhere on campus you have to walk outside, so just make sure you bundle up in the winter"
College Freshman,2,Hamline parties are pretty bad people are angry drunks and it is hard to find a fun party unless you go to the somewhere else
College Freshman,2,The cost to park here is outrageous expecially considering most people never even drive and the lots are half empty
College Freshman,2,"Pros it is close to all your classes, its a pretty typical dorm situation. 
cons people like to hole up in there dorms and there is no social interactions. 
p.s. go drew"
College Freshman,2,"I don't have an internship, although I would like to. It's been hard for me to find a job on campus."
College Junior,2,"There is quite a healthy amount of off-campus housing, all within three blocks of the campus, but the quality of that housing varies a great deal. Some of the houses available for students are over, or quickly approaching, 100 years in age; as such, they carry with them a ""run down"" sort of charm that I, personally, do not find attractive."
College Junior,2,"The midway area is a small community with little to offer. The best of the midway are the very few small shops and restaurantes such as Gingko's, Black Sea, Fasika. Other than that midway is pretty boring and there are no attractions or activities on a walking distance from Hamline. The area is also somewhat dangerous, on my first year at Hamline we received a safety email every other week about a person getting robbed."
College Freshman,2,"I hate to say it, but my roommate used weed regularly. I didn't partake because I just don't have a desire, but there are quite a bit of people that smoke marijuana. I'm not sure about other hard core drugs. You can stay away from them, though. There are a lot of other people to hang out with."
College Freshman,2,"I feel as though all they really do is ticket cars, but that may be because I've never utilized them. Also, Hamline is in the middle of the city so crime does happen pretty nearby campus."
College Freshman,2,"I'm a commute so I don't have the full experience or knowledge, but I feel like its the same as every college campus would. Since my school is a private institute I feel that the ones who live on campus know everything about everybody. The dorms are small and I feel that its not spacious enough for two and in some cases for three to live in. Then again, I feel that way about most campus's that I have seen and that's why I chose to stay at home."
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a car at school with me, but I know the few times I came down in the summer, I had a horrible time parking. The streets are very restricted as far as parking goes, and it gets worse in the winter when the plows are out. I have a lot of friends who've been towed because of a lack of communication about snow emergencies and also because there really isn't anywhere else to park. In addition, the lots all require permits, which can be quite pricey and are not typically available for first years."
College Freshman,2,The street parking fills up very quickly during the morning and afternoon hours. This seems to be true for the parking lots as well. I am not sure of the parking permit costs as I do not have a car on campus and my roommate did not purchase a pass. Ticketing prices are sometimes just worth getting if you need a parking spot and cant find street parking.
College Freshman,2,"This is Minnesota. Therefore in winter it gets very cold. As such you will move between buildings wearing coats, boots, gloves, etc. It's not as bad since campus is relatively small and everything is close. After time you get used to it especially if you already live in Minnesota or similar states."
College Freshman,2,As a commuter i struggle a lot with parking and cost.
College Freshman,2,"I personally have no troubles parking, since I have no car. Hearing from other people though, they cannot afford parking tickets and getting a parking pass is not available to everyone if they cannot afford one as well. It is also limited and not spacious."
College Junior,2,"Although I live off campus now, when I had to eat at the dining hall while living on campus it was awful.  They have very little variety, things aren't cooked correctly, and it all tastes very cheap and greasy.  Things only got worse when they moved into the new University Center."
College Senior,2,"Not a Lot to Choose from â€“ I'm not much of a club or bar guy. The places are expensive and unless you go to place on Thursday night, there is always a cover charge. I enjoy the house parties more because it's always a place to hangout with people you know and enjoy being around."
College Senior,2,"Getting Better â€“ The university center just opened, but other buildings are older and need to be upgraded."
College Sophomore,2,Could Be Better â€“ It takes a while to find a spot and most of the time it is just luck. Parking on the street is horrible because it is patrolled by not only the school but the law as well so it is a double whammy.
College Sophomore,2,There are clubs out there but need to have good time management skills to keep up with the clubs and school works.
College Sophomore,2,When the food is better than average is when there are special guests coming to campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Need a Car â€“ I may not be able to drive yet but if I could I would there should be a lot of exceptions to first  year students having cars on campus. I had moved to a new city before my first year of college started and it was impossible for me to go home on the weekends due to no bus schedules and family work schedule to arrange for a ride.
Many students cars were towed during a snow emergency plow but the announcement on the news was never made and the street had not been plowed the next day as expected."
College Freshman,2,Its Cold â€“ It snows a lot in Minnesota. When the wind picks up its terrible to be outside. Never leave without proper clothing or you will freeze.
College Junior,2,"The faculty is fantastic at Hamline you could not ask for better. Unfourtunently they do not posses the same skill for hiring administartion. The registrar, admissions and student advising are among the worst I have expierenced. They give students a lot of misinformation and very little to no guidence at all. Students have to turn to faculty to get any assistance on campus, however these departments will inendate your email with invites to different events, perhaps if they spent less time on events and more time actually helping students--students wouldn't have such terrible reviews of Hamline. Hamlines class offering and schedule is also terrible. There are 2 prime times they schedule 3/4 of thier classes and that is often the only session of that class, so you have to make a lot of compromises on your classes and if you are a junior or senior you may miss a vital class because of this. They also advertise classes they don't offer. If I didn't have such great faculty I would be transfering, because overall Hamline is terrible."
College Junior,2,"Old computers, only available in library, during busy times don't count on getting one."
College Junior,2,It is on bus line. But Saint Paul bus lines are terrible compared to MInneapolis bus lines if you communte from a suburb.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Either They're in AA or Just N/A â€“ There is very little drug usage despite the urban location.  Alcohol is definately less common here than most universities. The policy enforcement is tight and maybe even overboard, especially in the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"I am not impressed with the social scene at Hamline. It labels itself as a ""diverse"" campus that prides itself on exactly that. However, it really is a rich, white, lesbian school. The greek system is abysmal, as is the party scene, it's non-existent. If you want to go to college to have fun and cause mayhem, go somewhere else, like I do! Travel to a nearby school or the University of Minnesota. The one great thing about Hamline is how small it is when needing to get from class to class, and the professors. In my mind, this is what college is for, getting an education. But if it's one thing that I learned in the last two semesters, it's not about the education you get, but the connections you make."
College Sophomore,2,"We live in Minnesota. There are great weather fluctuations, but overall, little affects Hamline's community. The crew has everything together, but there are also inconveniences that plague the campus, usually occurring in winter. The plows that scrape the streets rack up many cars being towed, and when it rains on campus, large, deep pools of water cover the campus. In addition, while crews are quick to shovel the sidewalks, campus construction makes it difficult to navigate in the dead of winter or in a thunderstorm."
College Freshman,2,Hamline is unique but it is on its way to becoming like any other school with the new student center. The atmosphere is very relaxed which is nice but a lot of the departments have professors that everyone can agree need more training. It's way too expensive for that to happen as often as it does.
Freshman,1,"Nearly everything about Hamline is a scam. The school advertises itself by emphasizing diversity when, in reality, it's largely white students, and most of the minority students are exchange students. The school treats minorities as tokens they can use to make themselves look better, but do not take action to make the campus a safe place for them to be (example: white students who filmed and posted themselves using racial slurs got little to no consequences). The campus safety is absolutely appalling- emergency phones in my dorm disconnected, the campus shuttle refusing to pick me up even though I was less than a mile away (they promise free rides within a mile), several instances of strangers entering dorm buildings, a male student breaking into female students' rooms and not being punished. The neighborhood can also be very dangerous (especially for girls and at night!). The teachers and classes are great, but the overall experience was so bad that it wasn't enough for me to stay."
Graduate Student,1,"As an MBA student, I have yet to be challenged or learn something that I can apply in my daily work. I'm disappointed is the little level of female faculty, I've had one adjunct and the rest have been male and there has been zero emphasis in promoting women in business, a HUGE miss in the program. I am happy to be graduating soon but it has been a waste of time and money, but it's what you get for a course not requiring the GMAT. I'll have a piece of paper but little to show for it."
Freshman,1,"At first I thought I would do okay at Hamline, financially at least. But I was wrong and they didn't tell me how to work with financial aid until it was too late this meant I had to pay 2,000 a month because I didn't know how to really use financial aid etc. They will also not allow me to apply for classes next semester if my bill is over 1000 and they didn't tell me this until later so now my bill is about 6,000 and now I have to work two jobs as a freshman plus take out lots of loans even though Hamline gave me some scholarships."
Niche User,1,"It wasn't a good choice for me, I wasn't really ready for college right after high school let alone a private school where I was trying to play a sport as well as pay for cost of living."
College Freshman,1,"There is one fraternity and one sorority. Not many people are involved in Greek life, and those who are are not that well liked."
College Sophomore,1,Res life sucks. The director should be in administration. But the Deans office is very helpful!
College Sophomore,1,"Same stuff different day.

No fruit or vegetables ever."
College Sophomore,1,"Our greek life is super small and really designed for a certain group of people. If that's your group, awesome, but for most people it's just looked at as not really a thing."
College Freshman,1,They don't have much of a variety. Some days I go to the buffet line and find nothing to eat. They would use more simple foods like burgers or buttered noodles. Everyone loves when these foods are available.
College Junior,1,"There is one accredited fraternity at Hamline and one non-accredited sorority.  That is it.  The frat is ""dry"" so every party they have there feels like a weird high school gathering.  It's a small percentage of people that are in these houses, but they are very recognizable.  (hint:  they're not like your average frat house)"
College Freshman,1,"Permits are very expensive, you have to park far away many times, and when people park in the lot with many available spaces, safety and security give away a lot of tickets, I highly dislike the parking system."
College Freshman,1,The lack of knowledge many of the students have when talking about diversity .
College Freshman,1,"The diversity ofHamline University is low, for the majority is mostly White people. The minorities doesn't have much of a voice, but still strives to be heard and not be left behind. It is hard for them to reach a higher level of diversity when there's not much here already. There are, however, some organizations that are trying to raise awareness and create more diversity on campus."
College Senior,1,Majors Being Eliminated â€“ I'm a physical education major and the entire physical education department is being phased out of the school. The number of classes being offered are slowly being phased out as well so I am having to go to different campuses around the Twin Cities area to take my required classes that were once offered here at Hamline.
College Senior,1,"Less Than Helpful â€“ Each and every year it is a giant headache dealing with the financial aid office here at Hamline. My family isn't made of money and I've had to take out every loan offered to me in order to finance my education here and the few private scholarships that I received, we always have to annoy the people at the financial aid office at Hamline to file the necessary paperwork. This is my 5th (and hopefully final) year at Hamline and Hamline is 0 for 5 in being helpful."
College Sophomore,1,Get off ASAP. The department is horrible and treat you like you are a child.
College Junior,1,"Don't Count on It! I was promised a scholorship when I began my transfer to Hamline. It was an honors transfer scholorship worth $18,000. I was told it was merit based, then came to find out I had to do many other things and submit other information, when I found that out I had missed the deadline. You will find that you are given a lot of misinformation from different administartion depts. at Hamline, then when you take it up with higher authorities they don't respond to you. They do much to get you on campus...not much to keep you there. Thier retention is terrible."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel that they are strict in their policies. Kids will be kids, and with it being their first time away from college, they will make mistakes. However, I don't think that the consequences of these mistakes should be so high. There are very large monetary penalties given to students if they break the drugs/alcohol rule(s) on campus. This upsets me, because not only are college students going to continue to do it, but they will be forced to do it in secret and if a problem should happen, be reluctant to seek out help for fear of additional punishment. Also, I dislike seeing my school nickel and dime the students and then on top of that slap them with a large fee for violating policies. I work on campus, and I know where my tuition money is going, some of it is being pissed down the drain. It sucks."
College Sophomore,1,There Is None â€“ There are hardly any school sponsered events. Partie susally get busted quickly and bars around are so/so...you will want to bus to Minneapolis
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not an Athletic School â€“ Athletics is not exactly a strong suit at Hamline. Hamline is a D3 school, and not very competitive. Most games are lost, and the crowds are thin. Sometime people get groups of friends together, but really the only time the stands are full is homecoming. Tickets are free for students, which is a plus, but the games themselves leave something to be desired."

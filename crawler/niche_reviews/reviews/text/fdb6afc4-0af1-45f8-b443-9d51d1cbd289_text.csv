Sophomore,5,"I love Carson-Newman University for millions of reasons they taught me to be a better person, reach for my dreams, succeed in ways I thought I could never and receive education from the bests professors in the world!"
Sophomore,5,I had to take online classes for when cover-19 happened and I had a easy and great experience I passed all of my classes and would do online over again if I had to.
Senior,5,"Outstanding school, great support system! The advisors genuinely care about their students and will do whatever they need to help them succeed."
Senior,5,"Excellent school, excellent advisors and support system, all employees assist students to the best of their abilities."
Sophomore,5,"I came to Carson Newman university in the summer of last year for football, As a freshman in college. My experience here kind of felt like back home, From high school. I went to a boarding military school eight minutes from my house. I was a day student though.  I’ve had friends from all over the world. Kind of like at Carson Newman university. Both small schools. I chose Carson Newman because I didn’t want to be just a number. I wanted to be known. I am from Florida so the weather is a lot different my first year as a freshman in college I got to see snow! It is a little colder here but it wasn’t too bad. I missed my family, I was also busy with football, friends, class work and homework. The time when by fast.  My overall experience Was great! I will be back in July for football and my sophomore year!"
Sophomore,5,"During COVID-19, I took the remainder of my classes online. Me personally I was able to get all of my work done, On my own time, Which was great. Being in the classroom I will say is better overall, Having that hands-on experience. To having to do my work online wasn’t much of a change for me, in my grades..I was able to keep them up. The professors helped me if needed. Being at home is a plus.. Because I miss my family, being a-freshman, I keep busy with sports, Classwork and homework, also with team sports as well, there is always something to do here. The experience at Carson Newman University, Felt like home. The staff, coaches, Professors, Everyone that is on campus makes it such a great experience to be here. When I First came to Carson Newman it was in the summer, for football. I flew up there from Florida. I will be back in July for football, I’m coming back for my sophomore year.."
Niche User,5,I love the welcoming Christian environment at Carson-Newman.  I have not yet attended Carson-Newman therefore I do not think they need to change anything from the outside looking in.
Sophomore,5,"One of things I like most about Carson-Newman is the atmosphere. Every person there is encouraging and supportive of your academic and overall success. I also like the classes, They have exceptional professors instructing material that is most helpful in pursuing  your career or degree."
Freshman,5,"Carson-Newman is a very well rounded college that focuses on the student, the professors focus on the students as well work with them to improve there academic journey. The facility's are up to date and clean, the students all have a close relation ship to one another all in a very safe environment."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Carson-Newman University primarily because of how friendly the professors and staff are. At Carson-Newman you're treated as an individuals as opposed to a bigger college which fills hundreds of students in one class.

There is also a good number of side activities or clubs to participate in."
Sophomore,5,The nursing staff is outstanding.  I can't say enough about it.  They have encouraged me through difficult times and they truly care about their students.
Sophomore,5,"Carson-Newman offers a wide range of opportunities to explore. The university is rapidly growing and changing. It may be a small campus, but everything within it is moving at a fast pace. If you enjoy interacting with people I highly recommend giving this university a chance. It is incredibly easy to network with people. You are given plenty of leadership opportunities. The environment is suitable for learning. Just remember to try to get involved! The best time to get out of your comfort zone is in college."
Sophomore,5,The school itself it a great school. I absolutely love it. It is a small community and our are not just a number. All of the teachers are willing to talk to you. Everything about this school is great.
Freshman,5,It is an amazing University. Everyone is is so friendly and helpful. The cookies that they serve in the Cafeteria are amazing.
Senior,5,"Since it is a smaller university, the professors have more one on one time and can give every student ample attention. The baptist aspect of the college keeps everyone sturdy in their faith and helps others follow the correct path. Great college with awesome faculty!"
Freshman,5,It was a great choice for me to attend CN.  It is a small campus with caring faculty and great student life.  My one major concern/area that needs improving would be the dorms and living area for students.
Niche User,5,"Carson-Newman University is a small, private Christian school. One of the main things that I like about it is how people will grow in their faith at Carson-Newman. The entire atmosphere of the school is positive. I am going to be swimming on the swim team next year. Even though  I am not on the team right know, all of the athletes already treat me like family. I love that it is only a thirty minute drive to Knoxville and Gatlingburg. One thing that could change about the school is the cafeteria. The cafeteria could be update to meet the standards of other college cafeterias. Also, the school could be sponsored more throughout high schools."
Alum,5,Carson Newman University is an amazing school. My professors here were always willing to work one on one with me and accommodate my children when I didn't have a babysitter. They put their students first. The teachers genuinely care about what happens to their students after they graduate. Carson Newman is a great university to build life long connections. They provide lots of activities for students living on or off campus. They provide for their students. This school helped me get through a lot!
Niche User,5,"I like the fact that it is a Christian based college. When I went to tour the college, they were so welcoming and they made it feel like home. Everyone is very nice there and it seems to be easy to make new friends. The dorms are very nice and the church they have there seems very big but beautiful. They mentioned to me that you get to talk to whoever you get paired with to room with ahead of time and I think that's very wonderful. It seems like a great college to attend and I'm very excited I get the chance to attend there."
Senior,5,"Carson-Newman is such a special place; you could not choose a better institution! I have grown so much as a person during my time  at CN. Carson-Newman professors and faculty are incredible and they prioritize your overall growth, your academic achievement, and your future success!"
Sophomore,5,"Carson Newman University is the best college I could ever imagine attending. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about you and your school work. With it being a christian college, it makes me feel at home"
Senior,5,"Carson-Newman is a wonderful Christian school that is like being surrounded by family. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. There is no other place I would rather be! The only thing I wish that could change is that they would offer the upper-level undergraduate classes more frequently so that the times would be more convenient. Other than that, it's great!"
Junior,5,I love Carson-Newman the hometown feel and the family I've created there is something that will stay will me forever.
Graduate Student,5,This college allowed me to push myself and reach the goals that I have set forth. I am currently in the Masters program here and when I graduate I will be able to give back to the community and support my family fully. I love the faculty and how they really allow you to be yourself yet make sure that you know God loves you.
Freshman,5,I liked the professors and how they truly cared for their students. I feel as though every professor would take the time out of their day to help us succeed. The food could use some work tho.
Niche User,5,"I am not yet an official student of Carson-Newman University but I am committed. When visiting the campus I got to eat with students and tour every building.  The university felt like home. I knew right then, that Carson-Newman was the place for me. The students and professor were willing to go out of their way to show me around and telling me everything I needed to know about the campus. Many of the student even prayed for God to show me the way he wants me to go. That particular moment meant so much to me because as a high school senior I was having a difficult time trying to figure out where God wants me. After being there for a few hours, doors began to open and God was showing me everything that i needed to see."
Freshman,5,Carson-Newman is a warm and inviting school with professors who genuinely care about your success. I know I can count on being pushed to my full potential with support all the way to the end. You will never go unnoticed or uncared for. I am crazy about this campus and the beauty it possesses especially in the fall when the colors fill campus. I am crazy about the people I met and have been surprised to see just how different people are once you enter college. I am compassionate about Carson-Newman and would recommend it to anyone.
Freshman,5,I truly love this school and everything about it! Carson-Newman makes me feel like I am at home. This school has become one of my favorite places to be. The campus is beautiful with lots of wonderful people. The professors are engaging and kind. They genuinely care and want you to succeed in the process called college. The campus life is great especially for a small school. There is always an event or something to go to. Also it is super easy to get involved and be apart of groups and/or organizations.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. I have grown so much mentally since starting my career here in August 2016. My two favorite things are it is a small campus, and the professors care."
Freshman,5,"Carson-Newman University has a lot to offer. Whether concerning classes or extracurriculars, there is something for everyone. Every day is new and fresh which is hard to find in rural areas. The people you spend your time with will easily become the most interesting and best people you know. As you learn from extremely talented professors, you will make memories to last a lifetime."
Works Here,5,"C-N is a great place to be! It's a University that has highly ranked academic programs, integrates faith and learning and has so many unique opportunities for students. A Carson-Newman education is an amazing and eternal investment."
Alum,5,"Carson-Newman University is a wonderful institution with incredible teachers and academics. It's a great size and there's a 'feeling of family' across the campus. Nestled in a rural community with access to restaurants and local businesses and only a short drive from larger cities, you have the best of both worlds. 
The athletics, extra-curricular activities (intramurals, organizations, SGA, etc.), food service and overall student moral on campus is outstanding.
It's quite the school!"
Freshman,5,"I love Carson Newman!The academic program is amazing. It is rigorous yet fun and interactive. The advisors will definitely do their best to lead you in the right direction. The sports program s awesome and you are sure to get a scholarship if you are good enough. The dorms are nice, and the student life is definitely something to look forward t. They are constantly having events to connect you with other students and have fun. The cafeteria is actually really good for café food. They also have a Chickfila on campus and a Maples Café. As far as scholarships, they offer a large variety, and are known for being one of the cheapest yet  one of the most influential schools in the Southeast. You never have to worry too much for your safety, for there are always security driving around campus in mini cars to make sure all is going smoothly. I would highly recommend Carson Newman University!"
College Freshman,5,Carson Newman Admininstration is out recruiting and teachers/advisors are there to help with job opportunities.
College Freshman,5,"So far, I seen nothing but the best from the admininstrative offices and teaching staff.  Everyone has been very eager in helping me with my first year at Carson Newman University."

College Student,5,CN is the perfect place for me! Small class sizes and professors that care about their students as individuals make all the difference!
College Student,5,I feel very safe on this campus. There are always security personnel around to help.
College Student,5,I love the homey feel of Carson-Newman. I know that my professors want to see me succeed beyond the classroom!
College Junior,5,"The professors are amazing!  The classes are hard, but worthwhile."
College Junior,5,I have known several people who were offered jobs before the graduated simply because they attended school here.
College Junior,5,"There are always things, but I have always felt safe around campus."
College Junior,5,"They look at each person who is applying - and if you don't have a great GPA, just talk to them and explain why, and they will work with you."
College Senior,5,The professors are all very responsive to the needs of students. They're all passionate about their fields of study and eager to help students learn.
College Senior,5,"Everyone loves their dorms, but not always their dorm mate. I still think it's a valid and important part of growing up and experiencing college life."
College Senior,5,I was able to register and tour the day before classes began since I was an almost too late transfer student my junior year. Everyone was knowledgable!
College Senior,5,"I am not personally involved in sports teams on campus, but everyone knows who is playing and who won after the fact. We all feel a sense of pride when one of our Eagles goes on to win big!"
College Freshman,5,Everyone talks about how prestigious a degree from here is and will be in the work force. I can't wait to graduate and see for myself how great it really is. Carson-Newman is a nationally ranked school in academics.
College Freshman,5,Carson-Newman has a strong security system and a secure source of protection.
College Freshman,5,"My school is the best possible academic, spiritual and  social environment possible for me. Carson-Newman exerts the most positive and uplifting atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,I almost always see a security guard on campus while I am out. Studnets are required to complete a sexual assault online course which educates the students in the dangers of sexual assault and measures that can be taken to prevent sexual assault.
College Freshman,5,Professors genuinely care about the students and our success. The professors teaching styles vary so there is a professor for everyone. Class sizes are small and allow for a lot of interaction between professors and students.
College Freshman,5,"I love how genuine, welcoming, and kind the students and professors are. Fellowship of Christian Athletes has allowed me to grow in my relationship with God and my peers. Making God our (the students') main priority has definitely helped me grow intellectually and spiritually."
College Junior,5,I have already been offered jobs as a Junior in hospitals when I graduate. Carson Newman has a very good reputation.
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes and professors are the best part of this school. I am also taking a judo class next semester, so the variety of classes is amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"The community is so amazing.  You're not just a number!  Professors and staff, including the President, work to make sure that Carson-Newman is your home that that you are living a fulfilled life.  They all have posted office hours, and will do all that they can to help you.  The students are all awesome people, too.  It's great meeting someone as a total stranger and then walking away as friends.  I can't imagine transferring to a school where I wasn't an individual."
College Sophomore,5,They staff there are very personable and dedicated to learning you are not just a number since me having adhd i have to always be ahead i contacted my instructors and they all told me what chapters we will be starting on.I tried this at other college and they denied me this .The registration and enrollment process they are there every step of the way.The faith is another very amazing feature.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone really likes sports, but if you aren't into athletics, you will still fit in."
College Freshman,5,The courses definitely challenge you- but in a good way- and the professor know their students so well and so much more than other schools I hear about.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone, of both genders, are very friendly and helpful. Carson Newman is a big family."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy how if you ever get lonely at the creek, there is always someone who is willing to be your friend. The scenery is gorgeous everytime I step foot on campus."
Senior,4,As far as education goes Carson-Newman University is a great school. There is great campus activities and something for everyone to do. But it is in the middle of nowhere and it's very small campus.
Sophomore,4,Carson Newman is a great places to really focus on your work. There aren't as many distractions on this campus rather than being on other campuses. Even though it seems to be in the middle of nowhere there is plenty to do. I have found my life long best friend here and I wouldn't change any of it for the world.
Freshman,4,"I have only just started my first year here, but they strive to help new students adapt to college life. The Orientation activities and leaders, as well as the Welcome Week activities help immensely in the transition. The teachers are amazing with students and seem to always be open to help."
Sophomore,4,I have only completed one year at Carson-Newman University and I really like it. Campus Community is a big thing there and it really shows. I knew the moment I stepped on campus that it was the place I was going to go. It is an older school and because of that I would like to see the dorms in a little better condition but they could be worse. Overall I really enjoy being at Carson-Newman.
Sophomore,4,I love Carson-Newman I thought college was going to be very difficult for me but with the smaller classes the professors are able to connect and help more
Alum,4,"Carson-Newman is a fine school for liberal arts, but their STEM majors are lacking. That said, the STEM professors are very good in their field and do a fantastic job conveying the information."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student, who came to Carson Newman in the fall of 2018. My experience so far has been very good. All of the faculty and staff are very invested in seeing every student succeed. When I first started here, I was worried that I would have a problem finding a community or group of friends but that was no issue, given the size of the college. It has been great so far and I'm sure it will continue to be."
Sophomore,4,"The school is not too big which in turn makes going to school less overwhelming. The teachers there really care about you and your performance in their classes! DO try and get involved around the school: athletics, clubs, programs anything is fun."
Senior,4,"I like that the teachers & staff are very supportive & flexible with their students; however, I would like to see more options for clubs & organizations for students to be involved."
Junior,4,"Carson-Newman University is a college that appreciates the voices of the students, faculty, and staff. Every since I started at Carson-Newman I immediately felt accepted into the community. I was a second year transfer and was very nervous because I did not start here, however, I immediately made friends and got involved in campus clubs and activities. I am very happy with my decision to attend Carson-Newman University."
Freshman,4,I love Carson-Newman! I have made great connections with staff and with students here! Everyone there is kind and helpful. I enjoy being a student there.
Junior,4,It a place where if your looking for fun you can find it but it also has a silmple quietness to it to help you focus on school work
Sophomore,4,I have been at Carson Newman for two years now and it has been nothing short of amazing. The professors are so helpful and strive for your success
Sophomore,4,Carson-Newman is home to some of the best professors out there. They legitimately care about your education and are there to help.
College Junior,4,Carson-Newman is an amazing university! One of its best features is definitely it's professors. They genuinely care for each student and will go out of their way to ensure their success. Just be ready for not the best dorm situation.
College Freshman,4,Still learning as I am on campus
College Student,4,I love being so close to my friends!
College Junior,4,"The campus is wonderful, it is just a little bit expensive."
College Junior,4,"This is a great school for athletes, and more than just football.  Soccer, baseball, swimming, and volleyball all are large parts of the campus."
College Freshman,4,"Safety here is not a concern to anyone. Although, some nearby residents are sketchy, campus security is always on the patrol ensuring our protection as a school."
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, Carson Newman is my home now. Its a great school with some incredible people and professors. Although, there are some things i would change, nothing is perfect. I love it here."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics is huge in the atmosphere here. Between football, basketball, softball, and baseball, students are always in attendance to events all throughout campus."
College Freshman,4,Its a beautiful school with friendly people. Professors are helpful and creative with their lectures. The school is very good towards making Carson-Newman feel like home. Its a big community here.
College Sophomore,4,"What makes CNU unique is professors actually care. The largest class I was in had 52 people, but 2 professors. Professors remember names for the most part and I have only had a handful of professors that were either rude or unorganized. Once students are taking upper level classes in their field they tend to have close bonds with professors. Carson Newman is amazing and professors are very willing to help if they are asked for help in a timely manner. My only complaints are about the limited hours the cafeteria is open and the limit on food options in campus but this is to be expected at a small university."
College Freshman,4,I have felt very welcome and at home here.  Faculty and staff have been helpful and kind.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Carson-Newman are taken very seriously, not only to the athletes but the student body as a whole. The population of students are constantly exerting school spirit."
College Sophomore,4,The security personnel are always around.
College Sophomore,4,Our degrees from this school are said to be very desirable.
College Sophomore,4,I could not hope for anything better.
College Freshman,4,Carson-Newman has great fan and family support for the athletes. The teams keep a Christ-like and positive attitude throughout their games. The athletic facilities are beautiful and accomadate to the athletes needs.
College Junior,4,"Even though the caf is disgusting and the dorms are moldy, I love this school and am glad that I found a college with such a great sense of community."
College Junior,4,"Athletes are viewed in high esteem, whether school or intramural teams. Most students come to view games and support their favorite team."
College Junior,4,The school is very friendly and the community is wonderful. The teachers truly care about the students and want each to succeed.
College Freshman,4,"Football had an okay year this year, soccer made it to the Sweet Sixteen and volleyball made it to the Elite Eight"
College Sophomore,4,Getting scholarships was slightly difficult but they ended up giving me most but not all of what I needed.
College Freshman,4,All games are enjoyable to watch!
College Freshman,4,"Security officers are always driving around campus at all times of the day and night. Overall, I have never felt unsafe walking around campus alone. The security office also does a great job of alerting students to abnormal or potentially dangerous things happening on campus; the security office's weather statements are helpful too."
College Freshman,4,I love living on-campus with all of my friends. It can be annoying if you are trying to sleep/study/etc. and people are lous but you will experience that anywhere. All of the girl dorms are pretty equal I believe. Since the campus is small you aren't too far from your classes most of the time.
College Freshman,4,I think our centers are great and helpful. The library is busy most of the time and it can be difficult getting a computer. Campus events are fun but scare during the winter.
College Freshman,4,"We don't have housing and we don't have any fraternities, but we have one local social sorority and one national service sorority that do great service projects around campus."
College Freshman,4,It was super easy. On my student account it showed all of the expected amount for me to receive and I received it all.
College Freshman,4,Dorms old but people here are great!
College Freshman,4,The financial aid office communicated very well
College Freshman,4,Everyone held to a high standard
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus can be called for anything. They will give you a ride to your dorm when it's storming, they will let you into a building at night if it is permitted, they are also willing to give you a ride across campus if you are scared to walk alone in the dark. We receive emails from them with weather warnings and they really have our best interest at heart."
College Senior,4,"They are very strict when it comes to academics and visitation in dorms.  I have never seen a protest on campus, so I do not know how they would react to that.  Overall, I think that the school is pretty strict."
College Senior,4,"There are lots of athletics to choose from if you want to attend an event.  We offer, to my knowledge, tennis, football, basketball, volleyball, softball, baseball, and soccer.  We also have disc golf, with the goals spread around campus.  Soccer is probably out biggest sport that is attended and played."
College Junior,4,I am aiming for great safety being that this is a Christian College.
College Junior,4,I am taking part in athletics so I am hoping that they are great!
College Junior,4,I like attending a University because it's more diverse
College Junior,4,"there's a wide variety of food on campus, and you can eat all you want in the caf.  What could be better?  I have the unlimited meal plan so I could go in at 12pm for lunch, eat a big lunch, and go back in at 1:30pm and eat another big lunch all over again."
College Junior,4,"My professor was telling me all about the job opportunities his graduates have landed since leaving Carson Newman and I'm talking about editing for the Ellen Degeneres Show, touring with Beyonce as her videographer, editing for a reality tv show, etc.  If you put in the work, it seems like you have a really good shot at getting the job you dream of."
College Junior,4,The professors I've met so far seem very nice and willing to help you with anything they can.
College Junior,4,"If you're going into a competitive field such as nursing, film, physical therapy, etc; I would suggest you attend the earliest registration so you can get in the classes you need before they fill up.  I waited until the last one and had trouble getting in some of the film classes I needed, but luckily, my advisor squeezed me in even though the classes were already full.  Not all advisors will do that, and not all classes are able to add extras though."
College Junior,4,"I've only attended early registration, and I've already learned about all the exciting film events coming up like film competitions/festivals, internships, off campus study in LA, etc.  I'm very excited"
College Junior,4,I'm very excited for football season :)
College Junior,4,There's a mcdonalds and sonic within minutes away which makes for a great late night shake for me:)
College Junior,4,I wish some things were a little closer but I can get used to it.
College Junior,4,"I was able to view some of the film studio areas, and production labs and I'm impressed and very excited to be able to use the facilities :)"
Niche User,2,I didn’t take online classes but they online system wasn’t that great. I think they changed it after I left but I’m not 100% sure.
Niche User,2,"If you want to go to a school where everyone knows everyone, C-N is for you. I went to a small high school & thought I wanted that in a college but I was wrong. Stayed for my freshman year then transferred to a much larger university. At most you’ll have five people who are in your year &share your major, so you feel alone w your studies/ experiences. The required events (CLWs) are terrible. College is supposed to be a time where you’re free to do as you want/ make your own decisions &CLWs are just one way they take that from you. Some CLWs can be fun but it’s really just a way to make you sit through a church service once a week at 9am. If you’re Christian and don’t want college to challenge your beliefs/ make you grow, this is also the school for you. Finally, the dorms and their restrictions are atrocious. All of the buildings are outdated & falling apart. You’re treated like a child & have to check any guests in/ have them leave by a certain time & leave your door open."
Freshman,2,I chose the school to continue my athletic career and did not actually look at the school itself. It is not the right fit for me.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing has probably been the worst experience for me. My freshman year in the women's dorm Burnett was only uncomfortable because the furniture was not moveable. But storage space was great. The closets in Burnett are huge and plenty of shelving and cabinet space. Community bathrooms are fair in Burnett and was a better experience than I originally thought before moving to Burnett. The women's dorm Alumni on the other hand is possibly the worst dorm experience I have ever had. When I first moved in the air conditioning was broken. After a couple of days maintenance fixed the problem. However, a month later a black mold infestation broke out that covered the entire room. As it turned out mold had grown in the air conditioner over the summer and once it was fixed, mold spores blew over the entire room. Of a glass was not dried completely after washing, mold would grow on it over night. Ventilation on the bottom floor of Alumni Hall is terrible and the hall typically smells musty and feels damp. Also, the dorm used to be a men's dorm. The bathrooms have not been updated since 2004 and they were only updated then to convert it from a men's bathroom with urinals to a women's bathroom with no urinals. There are still hook ups for urinals and dividers where urinals used to be. If I could make one change to Alumni it would be to the bathrooms. I would much rather live in Burnett again rather than Alumni where the only up side is the furniture can be moved. The closet is very small and is shared with a roommate. There is no shelving in rooms of Alumni. I prefer Burnett for women's dorm halls."
College Freshman,2,"My school only has two sororities on campus, and no fraternities, whatsoever. Greek life is virtually non-existent. If you are chosen to be in one of the sororities, it's not really a big deal. In my opinion, you can't really differentiate the non-greeks from the greeks on campus. Everyone is more or less the same. There is also no Greek housing that I am aware of."
College Freshman,2,The buildings are out of date and the community showers can be a little hard to deal with sometimes
College Senior,2,"I talked to multiple people and got a few different answers so it made my process longer. Just when I thought I was done, there was always something more that needed to be completed."
College Freshman,2,"The meal plan for freshman is outrageous and the food is terrible for the price you pay. The best place to eat on campus is Maples or Chik-fil-a, but you have to pay with Eagle Bucks."
College Freshman,2,The caf is gross but Chick fil a and Maples cafe are good
College Sophomore,2,Dorms are extremely old and gross. especially burnett hall
College Freshman,2,We don't really have much of a party scene that I am aware of. Me and my friends usually just do game nights or something like that.
College Freshman,2,There are no public transportation services that I know of. You're on you own when it comes to getting a ride.
College Freshman,2,"The library and labs consist of Dells with Microsoft operating systems. However, one lab, which is on fourth floor of the library, has Mackintosh computers."
College Freshman,2,"There is one computer lab and it is in the library, and it only contains about 30 computers.  The wifi is awful, rarely works.  The internet itself on the computers set up is 50/50 on whether it works or not."
College Freshman,2,The off-campus dining options near school are awful! Mostly just fast food places that are not healthy and do not even stay open late for midnight study runs. The students get tired of the same old food over and over again.
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere in our town is lacking greatly! There are limited restaurants to choose from, and limited shopping areas. Nightlife and museums/cultural experiences and basically not available unless you travel 30-40 minutes to the city. The attitude towards students could definitely be better!"
College Freshman,2,"Carson-Newman has a very strict honors code. Visitation is tightly tracked. While drinking and drugs do happen, if you get caught you're gone. There's no second chances."
College Freshman,2,The police are strict at random times with parking. You can't park in places that would be easy for you. We need more Parking near Henderson!
College Junior,2,"A Place to Get Your Mrs. Degree of Go Elsewhere – Student relationships are interesting. Being a small school, it is cliquey at times, but once you find your group, it is better. When it comes to romantic relationships, most girls are here to get there Mrs. degrees. If not, they are probably dating elsewhere, and you probably should."
College Student,2,"Not Much – Carson-Newman is located in a small town, so the nightlife here pretty much consists of evening classes, on-campus evening activities, and a small handful of off-campus restaurants.  But I live off-campus and don't attend activities regularly, so it's largely irrelevant for me personally."
Sophomore,1,"Online was awful, but not due to the school. The professors seemed to assign more work now that we wasn’t on campus. They asked for students to act as if they was still there even though we was not. Some students had to come back home and work farms, jobs, and babysit family."
Freshman,1,"Awful school. Terrible dependence. People will not support if you are an international in trouble, professor are racist with people without noticing. It was a terrible experience spend a semester in here. Think it twice if you want to come over and waste your time. If you ask for something they will take months on answer whatever you ask! Food is bad. Athletics are decent. Academics, to many useless classes with no meaning. School is to expensive for what it offers. In my personal experience, i can just feel regret about spending a semester in here"
Niche User,1,"The Butler residence hall should be condemned....  Water damage and mold present, peeling paint, not properly maintained or updated to current standards-  beds for full grown young men are twin size.  Even the windows in the back are rotted and most all of them dirty and covered in spider webs."
Junior,1,It’s honestly not that good. It’s easy to say it’s a good school if your not a diverse student. The lifestyle at this school is depressing and feels like it’s holding me back from learning as much as other students are. The education curriculum is the same every year and the equipment is outdated. Please do not waste your time here it is expensive
Freshman,1,"Worst college experience one can ask for. Dorms are awful, imagine using a sketchy gas stations bathroom. People are very hard to talk to and get to know unless you're on an athletic team. I am overly out going and have tons of friends back home. The college may have a ""Christian"" title, but the amount of profanity that you will hear around campus is shocking to say the least. Also rap music will be heard all hours of the night in your dorms. Don't get me wrong i love rap music, just not at 4 am. Teachers are good, they will give you an A if you just show up for class. I would give my overall experience at Carson-Newman a 0 out of 10. I will not recommend ANYONE attending this school unless you are commuting from home. I went here for one semester and I got out as soon as possible. If you want to pay $30,000 a year for crappy food, awful housing, weird people and a below average education, than this is the place for you!"
College Freshman,1,Carson-Newman does not have  a Greek life. These questions are not relatable.
College Junior,1,Our Greek like is basically non existent. No one ever really hears anything about it.
College Senior,1,There are very few days where the cafeteria has decent food. I usually have to fill up on cookies and ice cream.
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, I don't understand what the authority figures are getting paid to do at Carson-Newman."
College Sophomore,1,so many rules and if you break one you get fined 100-200$
College Sophomore,1,town is horrible. nothing to do.
College Sophomore,1,no greek life at all
College Sophomore,1,Food was awful. Chic fila was always good but students were never given enough eagle bucks
College Sophomore,1,"Carson Newman doesn't have much of a party scene at all. If you want a big time party, you will have to go to knoxville which is 45 minutes away."
College Freshman,1,There is literally nothing to do but we are super close to Knoxville and Morristown where you can do a lot of stuff so that helps.
College Senior,1,"I hate trying to get financial aid for school.  It is such a long and complicated process.  The first year was okay, but then it all went downhill."
College Freshman,1,At least you can watch movies and play board games in your dorm.
College Freshman,1,"It's Jefferson City, Tennessee. There is literally nothing to do excepty eat Taco Bell late at night."
College Freshman,1,"I don't even know of ever seeing a single officer other than one writing a ticket on my car and the ones that hang out in the cafe, recreational center, and dorms."
College Freshman,1,We don't have any greek life.  We have 2 sororities and zero fraternities.  The sororities are the biggest joke ever.

Alum,5,"A warm, welcoming community where you won't be a number on a roster, but rather part of a family. People truly are the hallmark of the K-State experience. Beyond kinship, the amount of pride and loyalty current students, faculty, and alums take in K-State & the surrounding Manhattan area is unparalleled. It is the quintessential college town/experience to submerge in for four (or more) years and reminisce on beyond that."
Graduate Student,5,I only took a couple of classes online but it was very easy and simple. They utilize canvas which is user friendly for users.
Graduate Student,5,"Kstate gives a great education and has a great campus enviornment. Students are friendly, there is plenty to do on campus and around town."
Niche User,5,"The same instructors who teach in the classroom also teach online. You are still very much a part of the K-State culture, even while learning remotely. I am now able to take pretty much any class online or on-campus, depending on my preference. The options are endless and the degree is the same whether achieved online or on campus."
Niche User,5,"K-State offers everything you could want in a college experience. Small class sizes means you get to know your instructors and your classmates. Everyone is friendly and the instructors truly care about your success. And you don't just sit in a classroom all day. The internships, research opportunities and field experiences give you a real-world perspective of what to expect when in your career. There are endless majors, a ton of different student groups, and events and activities galore. Also, the city of Manhattan loves K-State! There are restaurants, bars, shopping, entertainment and a lot of outdoor activities. Also, don't believe the stereotype, there is nothing flat about Manhattan. You can hike in the flint hills and the sunsets are unlike any you've ever seen before. K-State is truly a fantastic shool!"
Junior,5,Professors are willing to work with you over computer just as if you were in a classroom setting. I learn just as much as I would in an actual class.
Junior,5,"I was nervous to start online classes. However, all of my professors have been so kind and working with us to problem solve."
Junior,5,Kansas State has the best atmosphere. The community feel of campus is so real. I've never met so many kind people who are willing to help those around them. I love attending school here and I'm so glad I made this choice.
Senior,5,"After reviewing many possible options of schools I would be able to attend, Kansas State seems like one of the few that would be the best fit for me. My hometown is located in North Texas and one of my priorities is to remain somewhat close to home where I am able to continue to visit my family. Speaking of family it's one of the most important things to me, so having a school that even my picky parents approve of magnifies the support system I have in making such a big decision. One of my main priorities is my faith and being able to have a community surrounded by students and teachers with similar beliefs is such an amazing thing.Another thing that I love about KSU is it's individualistic learning approach to education. Many colleges don't have interpersonal relationships with the attending students, and I think that being in a smaller community that has personal relationships with their students, is an environment that I would be able to work best in."
Freshman,5,I love Manhattan and the campus. I have already met so many friendly people.  Can’t wait til we can safely do more.
Senior,5,I had the best transfer experience here as opposed to other colleges I have attended. My advisor encourages me rather than tell me it may be difficult or I may not finish- like I've been told at prior universities because I have 4 kids. There's always tons of resources for help and I've been able to work my class schedule at comfortable times for my family and I. I would and have recommended Kstate to a lot of non-traditional students.

Sophomore,5,"I personally really enjoy attending Kansas State University. As an out of state student I was really nervous about attending Kansas State my freshman year (Fall of 2019). The atmosphere, the town, the staff, and the students though are all reasons why I love being at Kansas State. Recent issues I think have been handled very well at Kansas State by the president. I am also impressed with their current plan dealing with Covid-19. Kansas State is a fantastic school and I am so lucky to call it my home away from home."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved Kansas State! Being an athlete also gave me a great platform to get involved on campus and in the community. Overall, the atmosphere is supportive and encouraging of both personal and academic endeavors. Although Manhattan is a small town, there is still much to do in your free time."
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoyed my online experience at Kansas State. There were few technological issues, and there were many people willing to help in the instances that I required assistance."
Niche User,5,I took classes through K-State global campus and had a great experience. My academic and financial aid advisors were accessible and I received a top-notch education from home. The online platform gave me the ability to work around my family's busy schedule and still take a full-time course load.
Senior,5,K-State is a very connected community and offers a wide diversity of courses and organizations to be involved in and learn from.
Graduate Student,5,K-State is an awesome place to go to school. They have wonderful teachers that really care about the students and go out of their way to make sure that students are succeeding. Their campus is very pretty and is relatively easy to maneuver.
Niche User,5,I am an incoming freshman to Kansas State University the fall of 2020. My older brother attends currently and I can happily say that I have never had a negative experience working with the school or any of it's departments. Looking forward to continuing my education there!
Niche User,5,This is an unprecedented time and that means things are bound to be fluidly changing as we figure out what works for distanced learning and what doesn't. I have found that the staff at Kansas State University has been very devoted to creating the most positive and effective learning environment that does not compromise the quality of it's student's educations.
Freshman,5,"I am not typically one for online learning, but the teachers did what they could to transition. It wasn't much different from the in-person lectures, and in some ways I felt it was easier learning things at my own pace instead of in a set class time. Due dates were flexible and professors were very open to changing schedules and assignment requirements to satisfy everyone's needs."
Junior,5,"My experience at KState has been by far the best. From the campus tour to the classes themselves, I can say the experience has been one to remember. The teachers have been friendly and accommodating to student needs and the advising has been extremely helpful. KState in general has been a great source for me to find my purpose in what it is that I want to do with my life and what I want to achieve throughout my time here."
Junior,5,"Online school has definitely been an experience. I would say online school suits some better than others, but overall it’s a great source of education especially during hard times like the ones we’re facing now. KState online education has been easy to transition to and not as stressful as I imagined previously. One of the best ways to learn, in my opinion."
Alum,5,"KSU is an amazing place to study. It is in a town that probably wouldn’t be there if not for the school. It is a mix of old and new with beautiful buildings like Hale library. School pride is huge, everybody wears purple most days."
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere of the campus and how friendly everyone is to each other. The athletic events also add to its element of family.
Junior,5,"The culture that Kansas State has is like none other, it is a safe environment to grow as a person and find your future career.  I have gained mentors through my classes and they have led me to a bright future, I cannot thank Kansas State enough for the positive impact on my life.  The family atmosphere draws you in to the university and it does not disappoint when you arrive on campus."
Freshman,5,I have extremely enjoyed my experience at K State. I am from a smaller town in central Kansas. Upon arriving on campus I never felt overwhelmed or out of place. The class sizes are not to large and there is always avenues to get the help you need. There is a lot of school pride and school spirit at K State. Everywhere you go people are wearing purple to represent the Wildcats. I would  wholeheartedly recommend Kansas State University to anyone looking to further their education. Go Cats!
Junior,5,"They really advocate family, and it definitely shows in the overall atmosphere of the campus and the student body. The campus is very beautiful with all of the limestone buildings. The campus is nice and compact and its not too much of a stretch to get from one side of the campus to the other in between classes. Kramer dining center is way better than Derby. Manhattan is a nice town with everything that you could want that is a nice change of pace from the KC metro area."
Niche User,5,"I liked the overall architecture and stature of the campus itself. The campus itself has a very welcome feeling to the University. There is more diversity in the campus, which is always nice. It has amazing staff and is always willing to help with questions. There are many clubs to offer you the full college experience and find your own group in the campus. The possibilties on campus are endless; which makes it more enjoyable. They also offer great majors with excellent internships to make your learning experience, a job itself. Having it also be a small town, the student life has a very good scene."
Graduate Student,5,"Really easy opportunities to get involved on Campus. Campus feels more like a ""family"" if you are involved!"
Graduate Student,5,The college is very welcoming and willing to get you involved in clubs and organizations that are great networking paths!
Sophomore,5,I love K-State. The atmosphere is amazing and the university is full of amazing students and faculty.
Freshman,5,"So far at Kansas State University, it has been an amazing experience! The faculty, staff, and students have all been so kind and I know I can ask any stranger or friend for help. Everyone on campus has said that K-State is one family and I truly believe."
Alum,5,I loved KState.  The professors are wonderful.  The History department is fantastic and so underrated.  I wish I could go back.  I miss it every single day.  Being a student at KState was a wonderful experience for me.  The History professors are so passionate about their field and project that to students each and every day.
Sophomore,5,"Kansas State University is located on a beautiful campus and truly lives up to its name of having a family culture. Students on campus enjoy one another, many friendships are born here. The The University's love for its student body is evident through continuous improvements to dorm buildings and educational facilities. Faculty truly wants the best for the students, whether that is by challenging them in the classroom or helping prepare them for their entry into the workforce. Many high school students may overlook Kansas State solely based on its location, but they overlook what the university has to offer them."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE Kansas State!!! I love the community aspect the campus has and just the overall home feeling Manhattan has. The professors have been so so helpful and kind. they are all super cool to talk to after class too!! It is such an overall good campus, and its beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"I love K-State!  There are SO many things to get involved in and everyone can find their own pocket of campus to be successful in.  Our greek life is starting to decline as well as overall enrollment, which is sad.  I think some partnership with the university could be used to improve this."
Freshman,5,I love the family atmosphere of Kansas State. Most people are willing to help you and do anything they can to help. There is equality for all diversity on Kansas State's campus. Everyone is welcomed in which makes Manhattan a home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"I love K-State, it's an awesome environment that fits me very well. There is a lot of tools available and most professors will be willing to work with you to find a time to meet with them if none of their office hours work. The overall community feel is awesome as well. The hype for games is also really big as sports are a fun way to bond with others. Some of the dorms need some renovation but overall facilities are pretty good."
Freshman,5,Overall being at K-State was a good experience. Kansas State offers so much free tutoring and other education successors. The first semester was stressful trying to figure out the new work load and time management. The one thing I don't like about K-State is how much money they try and squeeze out of young adults.
Freshman,5,It's a great place to be. It feels like home and all the people in this town are amazing. The staff here work very easily with you and are here only to help you succeed in today's world.
Freshman,5,"In the Architecture Program and can't say enough great things about the faculty, staff and facility."
Niche User,5,"Kansas State University has a very welcoming environment. Everyone always seems very happy, and it feels like home the minute you step on campus. Their food is also amazing, way better than what you'd expect from a university."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour of Kansas State recently and was very surprised with how well I liked it. First off, the campus is gorgeous and unlike any I have seen previously. I was also very impressed with my academic program , Speech Pathology, and all that it had to offer. I was pleased with the overwhelming hospitality that was given by all of the different staff and volunteers as well. Overall, I had a great experience at Kansas State University and would be very happy if I attended there one day."
Junior,5,I love the care they give for their students and professors always manage to give you their time if you need or want it.
Niche User,5,"Kansas State University has a comforting, welcoming, high quality campus and environment! The people were so kind and helpful, when needed. They really want you to join the cat family, no matter your situation. Not only will you get a excellent education, but friends that last a lifetime. You create exciting memorable moments partying, hanging,  and tailgating on gamedays. I recommend KSU to any students who just loves to have a good time, but also can handle their studies. I really wouldn't change much but maybe the cost of overall yearly tuition. I wish college in general was more affordable."
Junior,5,"Kansas State University stands more than just a University.  Being at K-State provides a sense of community, opportunities, and connections that allow a diverse learning environment."
Niche User,5,"When I first visited Kansas State University, I knew it was the school for me. From the friendliness to the opportunity, The overall environment was wonderful. They say you will feel like a family and they couldn't be more right. I am so excited to attend this school next year in a program ranked so highly across the nation."
Niche User,5,Kansas State has an excellent music department.  I love the marching and pep band!! It is fun and the students and instructors are awesome!
Sophomore,5,"My journey from High School to Kansas State University was very smooth sailing, the application was very easy and i heard back from them about my acceptance in a very short period of time! After i got accepted i took one last college visit to make sure that K-state was exactly where i wanted to go and i absolutely loved my visit and stayed in town for the weekend to go to a game which just sold me even more on K-State, the atmosphere is like no other. I thought it was cheesy when people told me, but now I cant stop talking about how great my first year at K-State was!"
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed the student involvement atmosphere. My visit to Kansas State was very professional and well planned out. The campus was beautiful and easy to navigate between buildings.  My tour guide answered all my questions fully and helped me to feel comfortable in this new environment. Overall, my experience was great!"
Sophomore,5,"Kansas State University has made me feel very welcome and it has the ""small"" school feel.  They make you feel at home and help in every way to make your transition to college life more simple.  I love Kansas State!!  Go Wildcats!!"
Senior,5,Overall great school. Everyone here is so kind and the staff really want you to succeed. The nightlife is also never boring.
Senior,5,"No wonder Kansas State University is ranked one of the best universities and places to live. Manhattan, Kansas is truly a special place to live. From sports to academics, Kansas State University is truly special.

I know a spot that I love full well"
Alum,5,"Just this past month I graduated from Kansas State University, with my dual bachelor's in Psychology and Sociology, three minors in Anthropology, American Ethnic Studies, and Conflict Analysis & Trauma studies, and an additional Certificate in Conflict Resolution. It sounds like an insane workload, and at a lot of points, it was. But with the resources at Kansas State, I was able to graduate in 5 years. There are professors here that truly inspired me to learn more and be better, work harder. I am very grateful for the experiences I had at this school, and the education I was able to obtain here."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus with amazing people! I am so lucky to have been accepted, and cannot wait to continue my education there!"
Junior,5,"I love this college so much because its not just an university but its a family. The staff are always willing to help students no matter if its personal or not. My counselor have been there for me since I first started school here, they really do care about you and will push you to graduate."
Sophomore,5,"Kansas State made me feel at home the minute I stepped on the campus. So many students would greet me as I walked the campus as a new freshman. Not only are the students polite, but the professors show there compassion and love for their students. They make sure we have access to get help within our classes as well as resources for mental health. I have met so many more people through KSU and have loved every minute of it."
Sophomore,5,I love how the professors and tutors are very helpful with our questions. Everyone on campus are some of the nicest people I have ever met. The courses are interesting and beneficial for our degrees.
Niche User,5,"Kansas State University has that glowing aspect of feeling like home. Once you step onto campus you are welcomed by understanding students and helpful professors. Staff will do everything in their power to help you succeed. On top of the great academics, the culture and student life of K-State is not seen anywhere else. The feeling of being a wildcat and being apart of the legacy is truly one that surpasses college expectations"
Alum,4,"I only took one class online -- it was well-structured & on an easy-to-use platform. Not sure about others, but the one course was very solid for being online-only learning."
Freshman,4,I like the teachers and how willing they are to offer their help and assist us with our work.  They are also concerned about our mental health as well as our physical health.  I would like to see more diversity but I am not sure if that is possible.
Freshman,4,I took most of my classes online because of the CoVid-19 situation.  I liked my online learning experience because our teachers set time apart for us to ask questions and interact. It did not feel like our teachers were just showing us resources and we do what we may with it.  They made an effort so we could understand the information.
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and all the teachers I’ve had really know what they’re teaching and want to help you.
Freshman,4,This is my first semester and although you can’t do much because of COVID that nice friendly environment is still present on campus. I can say I’ve enjoyed my time here so far.
Freshman,4,"I had to take most of my classes besides one online for this semester. Most went to zoom lectures, it was alright although it felt like there were a lot more busy work assignments for some classes. Overall tho it was ok."
Freshman,4,Just started but it has been good so far. Teachers have already communicated with students and I am looking forward to delving further into my classes.
Junior,4,"Kansas State University is a great school, I have had a great time on campus and the town is great. They don't have a lot of safety portions put in place and some of their professors arent the greatest."
Junior,4,"The teachers are more able to help you in person than online, a lot of my professors won't offer help online"
Graduate Student,4,"Kstate has a diverse of students who have different backgrounds with a combination of personality and confidence. we are usually known for our agriculture and engineering with high expectations. the community is lively and high with spirit, you can find any friend on campus either though they are known for technology, math and science. but we also have variation of social studies/ science, literature and art, music and theater and numerous sports, the most honorable activity is our students who are also joining the army. the school might not be as big as KU but Kstates buildings do expand especially their sports stadium. its fun to explore and look around , some of the residents are so different from normal dorms, its like a hotel resort. the foods are great depending on what day and time you get many different types of themes to choose from. and its fun to go in the city of manhattan hanging out or buying stuff from many stores there. i think theres a plaza there as well."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Kansas State University is that I am continuously meeting new people. I can connect and talk to these people because they are students, just like me. This gives me the chance to ask for help or even help other students if I can."
Sophomore,4,"Originally I was not supposed to have any classes online. Obviously Covid-19 changed that. My professors were very understanding and really tried their best to make sure that we had at least a similar experience to in person classes. Even though I'm not thrilled about taking some of my classes online again this fall, I know that the professors have been preparing for months and I know they'll try to make sure that we have the best experience possible this fall."
Junior,4,Did a good job working with us to help things go as smoothly as they could make it. Personally not a big fan of online learning but I think they did a great job making the adjustment.
Junior,4,"I’ve lived in the dorms for going on three years. The incredible community there feels like home, like a family, sounds cliche but it’s true."
Alum,4,"Kansas State University offers a diverse learning community being in a community shared between military, Manhattan citizens, and all the KSU students who come from all areas of the world. They strive to offer the most learning opportunities and are constantly making changes to improve student experience."
Alum,4,"I did not take online courses through K-State. I only took courses on campus. However, K-State as implemented many new online learning tools that are connected to regular campus classes."
Junior,4,"Most professors were very understanding when classes moved to online platforms. Aside from Zoom lectures, there were still many resources for students that had questions or needed extra assistance."
Junior,4,Kansas State University has lots to offer at an affordable price. There are many clubs and activities students can be involved in while completing their degree at the same time. There are opportunities to gain research experience and hands on work for those who look for it.
Junior,4,"I really don’t like online learning but I feel like K-State makes it about as good as it could be. My professors have  always been super available and helpful. Canvas, which is the program we use for our classes, is also super easy to navigate."
Junior,4,Kansas State is a great school. They have the resources of a major university but also a very cozy campus that you won’t be overwhelmed by. All the people are super nice and there is a lot to do in the Manhattan area. The buildings are pretty but some are needing some updates and I think that their degree programs could use expanding.
Junior,4,"My experience has been very good. The faculty cares about its students and want them to succeed. In light of recent events happening in the world today they are going beyond and above making sure everyone is staying healthy, giving them wisdom, and encouraging each other to do well socially and in school."
Niche User,4,I took all of my courses online. The course formatting allowed me to work around my family's busy schedules and nap times. I was able to carry a full-time course load while being a stay-at-home mom to my three boys and working part-time as a substitute teacher for my local school district. I was able to receive a top-notch education from the comfort of my own home.
Senior,4,I haven't yet taken any online courses but my friends who did this past semester said their professors were understanding and made the process flow smoothly.
Graduate Student,4,It isn't a small school nor a big school but you'll always recognize someone on campus. The student's happiness was recorded one of the best in the nation and that is widely seen on campus. School pride is strong and the student involvement in sporting events is always strong.
Senior,4,The online courses I was apart of went very well. The professors kept the classes organized and easy to follow along. I felt that I was able to communicate with the professors about assignments I may have need clarification.
Senior,4,I really enjoyed my time at K-state. My professors helped expand my way of thinking and interpreting the world. My academic advisors helped me explore different fields of study. There is always something todo on campus.
Freshman,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed my classes at this school. Professors are more than eager to help students with questions and assignments. Everyone is very friendly and approachable, and I am proud to say that I attended this university."
Freshman,4,"Overall, K-State is a pleasant place to attend school. It’s safe, most classes are very close to each other on campus, the teachers are dedicated, and there is a large number of clubs and other groups to get involved with. Some downsides are that the student body isn’t as diverse as at some other schools, it’s hard to get involved in the party scene unless you know the right people, and Manhattan is in a somewhat secluded region that’s away from any other large cities."
Freshman,4,"I had originally planned to take two courses online in my spring semester; given the COVID situation and response, the remainder of my courses went online. I still kept my two online courses, so having all 16 credit hours being online was very challenging. The grades you want in online courses are easily obtainable, but be prepared to do an awful amount of work to earn what you want. 8 week courses can be very challenging in the workload aspect, so be wary of what courses you take as an 8 week session. Higher level courses can prove more challenging than lower level ones. I would recommend doing courses in person, then taking one or two online courses the next semester to see if you would wish to pursue other courses online."
Freshman,4,"K-State is a great campus for those who wish to adjust their lifestyle. It's large enough to do many things and have many social circles, but also secluded enough to where you can opt to have less things to do, maybe perhaps to work or focus entirely on classes. There is especially a lot of pride taken in the Engineering, Psychology, Sociology, Business, and Veterinary Medicine programs/majors, to name a few. The dining halls could use more variety and flexibility, and some of the classrooms could really benefit from air conditioning and remodeling in general, but given K-State's efforts to always adapt, and especially trying to renovate the library and Derby dining center, it can be understandable if these minor things aren't attended to yet. The advisors, faculty, and counseling staff are amazing, perhaps some of the best in the Midwest. One of the best things is the supporting community, being the town of Manhattan, the county of Riley, and the nearby military Fort (Riley)."
Alum,4,"Online classes for me were either over the summer or as a buffer class during a heavy semester. They are usually easier and for that reason I would advise you to space them out. Similarly, do not take electives that do nothing for you. You can double major and balance the electives out with each other instead of taking a class of the history of rock and roll."
Alum,4,"Very helpful with incoming freshman. Personal follow up calls and info provided. Extremely informative meeting with academic advisor. Provided for requirements and schedules for intended major for entire four years. Campus tour was comprehensive and allowed a view into campus. Campus offers a wide variety of activities, jobs, tutoring, safety features, study environments.  My daughter likes how the campus is contained in a smaller radius than other large colleges. She said even though it is a larger college, it doesn’t feel so big. The majority of housing has been updated with suites and some new housing construction. The eating facilities are new with a never ending variety of dining selections. The rev center is free to students with full gym, offers intramural sports. The town of Manhattan itself has everything to offer that cities have, shopping mall, restaurants and fast food eateries, movie theaters, bars etc. Parent  KState 30 years ago. Enjoyed wildcat experience."
Sophomore,4,"The Architecture program at K-State is nationally ranked, and I know I am getting a good education. The campus is very nice, and everyone is very friendly and welcoming."
Freshman,4,"Kansas State University is a relatively good university to go to. It may be located in a smaller town, but it is surrounded by many places to go in nature such as Pillsbury Creek and Konza Valley. Since K-State is located in a smaller area, the people are more engrossed in the campus, and on game days you can really feel the school spirit. Almost everything is within walking or biking distance on campus, so you can save money on gas if that is a worry. The night life is not very interesting though, most businesses close around 6 pm, and the mall isn't that great either. The school itself is better kept up than the surrounding areas. However, Aggieville is a rather great place to go on the weekends for food and drinks."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere at KState is great. However, there are some professors that do not fully comprehend the subject that they are teaching. Additionally, there have been some racism issues that I have noticed in my first year here."
Junior,4,Kansas State University has a quite and pretty campus. The school spirit on the game day is amazing with all the students and residents around campus.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Kansas State University, also referred to as KSU or K-State. I am also not from Kansas, more known as a transfer student, so coming to this school away from home was a little scary at first but this school has a beautiful campus and everyone in Manhattan are such sweet hearts. Upon me arriving to MHK, everyone truly made me feel apart of the purple family. The academics and professors are also amazing at K-State, of course like any university you have some classes with professors that aren't particularly your favorite. Overall, I would 100% recommend Kansas State to anyone considering going to a 4 year university. Academics are very good and you will meet some of your long life friends the minute you start taking classes. GO CATS!!!!!!!"
Senior,4,"The family aspect and the dedication to student success made the university feel like a home away from home. Some decisions made during my time felt like it was the convenient thing to do, but understand that working for a university isn't the easiest thing to do and can make decisions very hard to make!"
Sophomore,4,I love k-state because it makes me feel like I'm at home. Everyone is so nice and always willing to lend you a helping hand. The only downside to K-state is how expensive it is.
Sophomore,4,"It is a place like no other, you feel right at home as soon as you step on campus. Something that is unique about Kansas State is that is based in family. This place is home away from home from the school spirit to teachers and academic advisors. Another great thing about this University is that there is always events or activities happening so the atmosphere is always full of excitement and joy."
Senior,4,Most all of the teachers are effective in getting their point across. faculty and staff are all very friendly and so are the people on campus.
Junior,4,"I like Kansas State University because it feels like home. They have always called K-state a family, and once becoming a student, I felt like family."
Senior,4,"Big enough to have plenty of resources, small enough you don't feel lost. Faculty and staff are very helpful. Party scene is lacking if you're not greek or 21. Manhattan has almost everything you could possibly need and is fairly safe."
Senior,4,"Great school with so many opportunities to engage in and outside of the classroom. Students are presented with many research or travel opportunities. Even more so, students are highly engaged in campus involvements."
Freshman,4,"I have loved about Kansas State University that when I need help, the advisers are more than happy to help me with whatever I may need. So often I have found myself needing a quick change with something and my adviser goes out of her way to help me get it done. I also really like how the school gives so many opportunities to be social in life and participate in campus activities. However, I do wish the school website were a little bit more easy to navigate."
Freshman,4,"My first semester was a bit rough; however, I think the academics a good, and the people there, both students and staff, are willing to help students succeed. There’s free tutoring, which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet, and the quality of life is good here, both on campus and in the town."
Junior,4,The transfer from UMKC was great. Faculty is really good explaining details so it is understandable. The town is really nice & provides good entertainment and gathering places for all of the students.
Sophomore,4,"I like Kstate, but there are a few changes I'd like to see. Because the campus is highly populated, many of the classes are full and thus the teacher has TA's do the teacher's job. This takes away from when something happens and the teacher is understanding because they never get to know you."
Junior,4,"My experience at K-State thus far has been extraordinary. I had some trouble adjusting to college life my freshman year, but have since been able to push myself out of my comfort zone. Kansas State University has so many opportunities. There are organizations, clubs, and tons of ways to get involved. I have joined a club here on campus which has been a great experience for me and allowed me to meet new people. I have also enjoyed most of the courses I have taken here. I am lucky to have had the privilege of being taught by some of the most amazing professors who truly care for their students."
Junior,4,"I love the community that is at K-State. In addition, they have a lot of opportunities to be involved outside of the classroom. There is always something going on for students to do. However, I have not had the best professors."
Niche User,4,Great atmosphere for any other students who want to apply. Great academics and a great campus. Great student greek life and clubs/organizations. Staff and students are respectful every single time you ask for help or directions. Great for new students who want an average size college.
Freshman,4,Kansas State University is such a fun and safe university for all of it's students and staff! Manhattan is a great college town full of fun places and things to do!
Niche User,4,"I like the campus, it has a homely feel to it. The only downside is how far away the rec center is. When looking at a college you want to look for what feels like home, somewhere you feel like is going to be a good home for you. K-State has that feeling for me. I love the dorm halls and the selection available for those. They integrate people very well and people always seem like they have a community they can belong in. The people I have met that either work there or take classes there are kind and including and try to be as helpful as possible. The application process is fairly easy and straightforward as well."
Graduate Student,4,The program that I am is still fairly new. It’s an online Master of Arts in Teaching program that takes just a year to obtain. The coursework is easy. You work with a TA the entire program. The professors all seem very nice and the director of the program is awesome! I would recommend.
Freshman,4,The Polytechnic Campus is small. Teachers and administrators know all the students by name. The college offers a lot of extracurricular activities. Students get personalized help when needed.
Senior,4,K-State offers a lot of different programs.  I love that they offer flexible classes as well to include online!  The staff at the university is always helpful with any questions that I have as well.
Junior,4,"I love being a part of the K-State family and being able to study with knowledgeable and talented faculty and other students. I am always being pushed to give my very best even if we don’t have the best situation. K-State needs to have a serious discussion regarding the most important needs for students in the department of music, theatre, and dance and provide more space and better conditions for the place in which we all work so hard to earn our degrees. Being an out of state student is difficult because my tuition is so high and I struggle to pay for each semester, but the progress I have made in my first two years has made me so excited to make a difference when I become a teacher."
Senior,4,"My advisor in the College of Education was amazing! Actually knew her advisees and cares about her college. The Campus Atmosphere is healthy, as is the surrounding town."
Freshman,4,"I attend the Polytechnic campus in Salina, KS. I enjoy the hands-on classes and feel like I'm really able to learn what's being taught. The things we learn actually apply to the career that I want to be in, as opposed to filling my mind with useless information."
Niche User,4,Kansas State had a very wholesome environment and family-like feel. I enjoyed visiting it because I felt a sense of community throughout the campus. My whole family has attended and enjoys the gamedays and classes.
College Freshman,2,I live in Ford and I hate it with a passion
College Student,2,"It feels as if it is a pretty normal dorm experience. Due to our 95% acceptance rate, they run out of space extremely quickly."
College Student,2,"The importance of athletics at K-State is best illustrated by the front cover of the orientation handbook. The handbook's cover shows our mascot in the student section at a football game while drunk shirtless students cheer and shout. This is another key part in selling the phrase ""back in college""."
College Freshman,2,Everyone does drugs or drinks.
College Senior,2,it bad because the college i am studying under keep raising price nonsensically.
College Freshman,2,"It is a public university, so there are many rules that dictate people's actions. I do not live on campus, so I am unable to speak on what it is like on campus."
College Freshman,2,The location might be great but the living situations arent always. I am stuck in the basement of a 50 year old building
College Sophomore,2,"I hate Greek Life. Really. If you're not Greek, well, Greeks won't give you the time of day usually. There's always the few who don't follow the stereotypes, but I've been at this school for two years and all the sorority girls I've met are snobby and rude, and frat boys are, well, frat boys. Don't trust them. They've got their houses and house parties and if you're not Greek, you're not in. To find your niche without being Greek is extraordinarily difficult, even though  Greeks are only 20-30% of students. However, I believe that percentage includes online students and grad students."
College Sophomore,2,"Prices are way too high. Especially for a single mother. They charge ad if we have an option to have roommates, when I do not consider that an option.  I do not want strangers living around my children.  The rent is the same as certain places in California & I know this because some of my family lives there. That is just crazy to me!"
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of the non-Greek students do not associate with the Greek students.
College Junior,2,Mostly fast food places and expensive restaurants for when the parents visit
College Senior,2,"I did dual-degree with Manhattan Christian College and Kansas State University, I didn't start at KState until 3 years in and I was not full time when I first started so I have not received financial aid from K-state itself at all. I am currently struggling with this issue now.

The out-of-state tuition is also ghastly, it is ridiculous what it costs but I pay it to go there."
College Senior,2,I didn't qualify for much.
College Sophomore,2,I consider myself in a lot of financial need because I have an older sister that attends the University of Alabama and my younger sister is about to attend my school. My family cannot afford that and the financial aid is barely any help.
College Junior,2,it was long and confusing
Recent Alumnus,2,We are in the bible belt.
College Freshman,2,"There is access to wireless internet almost everywhere on campus, but the network is less than reliable."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never noticed the use of any drugs, but it is very noticeable to see all the alcohol consumption. Dorms have a no alcohol policy, but it is never really enforced."
College Sophomore,2,Kansas weather usually ruins the experience of walking to class. One second its hot and the next it's freezing.
College Junior,2,"They're trying to improve the shuttle bus system on campus. Not many people use it unless they live in Jardine, the on-campus apartments. It's easier just to walk places and if it's to far away, just drive or find a friend with a car."
College Freshman,2,Kansas weather is very stressful. One day it could be snowing the next it could be 65 degrees outside.
College Junior,2,Our financial aid adviser is not willing to help look up personal scholarships for students. (K-State Salina)
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from New York, I am a student who is used to and loves diversity. Although I love my school here, it is not a great cultural mix. A high percentage of the student body is white, middle-class, and Christian."
College Freshman,2,A lot of underage and drinking and drug use.
College Freshman,2,"I need more money, it is so stressful. I want to continue attending Kansas State but I do not want to bury myself in debt."
College Freshman,2,it's Kansas so you can expect freezing winters and blazing hot summers.
College Freshman,2,"My FASFA had issues and was sent to the botto of the stack, I received the least amount of aid possible... The are very few scholarships."
College Freshman,2,The building and furnishings are very old. The community bathrooms have many issues including clogged drains and only one hand dryer.
College Junior,2,The worst thing are the prices. There are not a whole lot of landlords to choose from so they know they can raise prices on apartments etc. Also its a college town so that also makes it easy for them to raise prices because they know we students will pay to live off campus because we love our freedom.
College Junior,2,A lot of places are closed during school breaks so we dont have many options to eat a different variety of foods. They are never open late. 
College Freshman,2,"Permits are expensive, on campus or off. The parking lots are large, but none of them are close to central campus. Tickets are expensive so don't park where you shouldn't. You really don't need a car if you live on campus, but the apartments close to campus expensive. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few shuttles or mass transit on campus, however the few we have are free."
College Freshman,2,"Kansas State University (KSU) does not provide very many options for student transportation.  They recommend students own a car or at the very least a bicycle.  Although KSU does not provide a transportation system, Riley County provides an bus that will take students on fixed routes to specific stores, like Target and Dillon's.  The bus also provides transportation to apartment complexes, like University Crossing.  The average cost of taking the bus is one dollar per trip.  It seems necessary to own a type of vehicle yourself."
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is close to most classes, but not a very good value. The facilities have not been updated in years. Student life in the dorms is thriving, however. I have met some of my best friends on my dorm floor, especially my roommate. "
College Freshman,2,"Lots of partying and alcohol present. The school provides safe transportation, but does little to prevent students from accessing drugs and alcohol. "
College Freshman,2,"The busses on campus don't run frequently enough to be worthwhile, but if it something that you have to do to get around, it will work, as long as you don't mind waiting. But you should definitely have a car for shopping trips as the on campus convenience stores are outrageously priced and don't have a great selection. "
College Freshman,2,"The school has a majority of white, higher-income students, with I believe 11% african-americans. Our international student population is higher than all other minorities combined. Most students are white, and it is weird because I came from a very diverse high school. "
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman, you are required to buy the crappiest parking permit, which leaves you with two different parking lots as your options. For $170, it is crazy that we have to walk so far. These freshman ""R"" and ""Z"" lots are so far from anything that it's ridiculous to try to drive when on campus. And if you park outside of these lots, it's very likely that you will receive a citation within 3 hours of parking there. "
College Junior,2,Most of the greeks I have met have been snobby and act better than everyone else. 
College Freshman,2,Unless you're a junior or senior in college finding a good parking spot near the dorms is nearly impossible. Upperclassmen are given first choice so underclassmen don't get nearly as good of a parking spot as the older guys.
College Sophomore,2,Big town easy to get anything you might want
College Senior,2,It's been really tough for me to get any financial aid or scholarships through this University.
College Senior,2,"Off campus is rather expensive though it beats out on campus which is absolutely ridiculous, somewhere around $10,000 a semester. You should expect to pay at least $550 a month minimum for off campus in a one person apartment and its nothing fancy by any means. "
College Senior,2,In all reality there is really not that much cultural/racial diversity when compared to other schools.
College Junior,2,we could use an increase in involvement by diverse groups on campus
College Sophomore,2,The local weather is so unpredictable and very extreme.
College Sophomore,2,Needs more parking closer to classrooms. Free parking far from campus is far and few between if you don't feel like driving in circles.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Restaurants and dining at home are average, for a town with two colleges."
Recent Alumnus,2,When I go to college I usually don't live on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Off campus living is not very over priced, but if you live at home and go to school where I live is probably just the same as living in the dorms."
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus life and culture here is very diverse.  The Midwest is the more diverse than ever.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Local atmosphere for my town is cool, especially with College Prowler."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nightlife is always good in my town, especially if you are a hometown hottie."
Recent Alumnus,2,In my town transit is very busy.  There are a good amount of public buses and adequate campus bus systems.
Recent Alumnus,2,Fraternities and sororities and always an option but I live at home.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am new to my school, I prefer to eat at home for my dining experience.
"
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus security is prevalent and quite aware.  In the community that I live in crime is regular but not too overbearing.  I feel safe in the college life experience that I have planned for me.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I do not use drugs and alcohol, especially at school.  College life is constantly affected by drugs and addiction, which is one reason that I am on to my fourth college degree."
Recent Alumnus,2,"At the current school that I am enrolled at there aren't any sports programs offered.  Technical schools here in Kansas are very good with internships and job placement, but don't offer too much sports programs."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have never had a paid internship before.  Internships should involve a lot of careful planning.  If you get grades through a traditional college atmosphere, then an internship is probably a good choice.  Getting my second minor degree, an internship wouldn't really be necessary.  
In the socioeconomic ladder an internship to me is defined as a
 ' job shadowing experience that may be advanced monetarily.'
My career is based on technical school expertise and hard work.
                                                                                                  James M."
Niche User,1,"No Foreign Language Programs (Turkish, Islamic, Russian, etc.) this is what drives me insane. Stupid people and stupid things"
Senior,1,I’m a super excited to attending this school. I’d like to know all about it. Because i heard about this school but is very very Nice. So i want to join in.
Graduate Student,1,"I am a veteran who works for the Federal Government. I have asked for information regarding an MBA program three times. Each time, this university's enrollment department has blown me off. I am not impressed."
College Freshman,1,Very clicky and awful people
College Student,1,"Sexual assault is pretty rampant. Administration turns a blind eye. Rapist pay 10,000 a semester too, so it wouldn't be economically positive for the university to take any action."
College Student,1,"On the ""leadership and service"" page of K-State's website, there is a phrase near the bottom that reads ""K-State Greeks represent about 20 percent of K-State undergrads, but they hold about 65 percent of the leadership positions on campus"". This advertisement of disproportional representation is a perfect example of the place that the greek community holds at the university."
College Senior,1,I was in a sorority for two years and it was the worst decision of my life. People in sororities and frats here think they are so much better than everyone else. They are rude to others that aren't in Greek life and are just rude to other houses to make themselves feel better. The girls in my house made girls in the same house feel low or less than them. It also was super expensive and not worth the money.
College Sophomore,1,"Without a social security number, you cannot apply for it"
College Senior,1,With so many campus police and the Manhattan police I would say it is tough for students to use drugs. I myself am not affiliated with the drug scene and do not know others who are.
College Sophomore,1,"I hate Kansas weather.  One day snow, the next day, sun.  It changes all the time and unfortunately it encourages students to miss class, especially when its snowy, rainy, and cold."
College Senior,1,"If you live far from campus, have fun getting up extra early to attempt to find a parking spot. They fill up extremely quickly and lots are not especially close to buildings. If you park without a permit or in the wrong area, you WILL get a ticket. "
College Freshman,1,"K-State has the worst wifi known to man. There are some who don't bring their own computers, but it is a hassle to have to go to the library or find a lab to get assignments done. "
College Freshman,1,Don't like the weather in Kansas? Wait five minutes. 
College Freshman,1,"The scholarship requirements for ALL undergrad scholarship recipients to keep their academic scholarships state that you must maintain a 3.5 GPA or higher. This is extremely unreasonable, especially for freshman, who are undergoing a process of change as well as more difficult classes. "
College Junior,1,"Parking sucks. There aren't enough spots for the people that possess a permit, and if you get a permit they are in the hundreds for cost. Ridiculous. "
College Senior,1,It's either really hot or really cold and the wind blows strong almost all of the time. This makes for a miserable walk across campus.
College Junior,1,"parking needs to be improved greatly before it could be considered a ""pro"" of our university"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Typical campus life is pretty normal where I'm from.  
Main campus life is all about sports.  Usually students get along and coerse normally among my school and surrounding areas."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The campus at Kansas State University is strict in the idea that the campus is thought of as an environment of deference, so any variables that does not reflect those constructs are absent. Information in a variety of forms are dispersed throughout the college to offer options to avoidance as well as being aware of the negative consequences of under age drinking, drugs and also alcoholism."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The drug scene epithet does not apply to the campus at Kansas State University, it has a very low visibility even if it exist in pockets of students."
College Senior,1,"An absolute nightmare. I wish I had not paid for a parking pass, the only way I ever get a spot is by getting on campus by 7 am or earlier."
College Sophomore,1,"It's Kansas! There is sun, snow, rain, hail....everything and at any time of the year! Bring your rain boots and jackets! Also they never give out snow days!"
College Sophomore,1,"Although KSU speaks a lot about how 'diverse' the college seems to be, I have now attended KSU for a year and it is not diverse by any means. 80% are white and the other 20% is African-American, Asian, etc. Sometimes it is difficult for African Americans to fit in with the majority because there is a feeling that we do not belong, or we are not part of the KSU family. KSU does a wonderful job of talking about diversity, but I feel as if not of action has taken place."
College Junior,1,"Permits are expensive. They give out way more permits than parking spots so there is no guarantee that you will get one close to your class. The good thing about being in agriculture, is that there is typically lots of open spaces to park because most of the people go to class on the other side of campus."
College Sophomore,1,One day it can be snowing and the next day it will be sunny at 80 degrees. Kansas weather is not good.
College Sophomore,1,You can apply but the most scholarships are out there for freshman
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no visitor parking ANYWHERE on campus and you also have to wait until 6 pm to get free parking. If you're a freshman/in the dorms you have to park about 10 minutes away and fight to the death for a spot.
College Junior,1,It's usually terrible and there are usually little to nowhere to park.
College Junior,1,"Frats here are viewed as people who need to 'buy' friends.  There is no reason to be in one and no one expects you to be.  At enrollment there are several frats/sorority's set up to try and catch transfer students.  They are succesful at geting some to pay and join - but anyone who's been on campus knows that ""Greek Life"" is a huge waste.  There are some exceptions where living in the dorms is more expensive then the frat and can make it worth joining.  But most students just rent an apartment off campus and that way dont have to mess with the outragious living costs of a frat or dorms.  Much much cheaper to live on your own.(speaking from experience)"
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is absolutely horrible.  It is very limited and not close to any of the buildings.
College Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate living in the dorms. All of the people living on my floor of the dorm are weird and unsociable. I have tried my best to make friends, but no matter what I do, they do not respond. I want to move out of the dorms as soon as possible, because I do not want to risk getting a rude, obnoxious and loud roommate like the one I have now."
College Junior,1,It doesn't go anywhere worth while. No one knows the schedule. Not advertised.
College Senior,1,"Small Town – I come from a big city, and Manhattan, ks is small."
College Sophomore,1,All the lots close to campus fill up really quick.
College Junior,1,It Could Be Better – I received hardly any financial aid from Kansas State. I wish there were more options for aid.
College Senior,1,"It seems like every day no matter the time, you can't ever find parking. Even if you have paid for the parking pass or garage pass, you still can't find parking. You are either racing with people to get into a parking spot or you are waiting an hour before class just to have a secure parking spot."
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process should be smoother, i had to fill out several forms! also, they just don't have enough for the students who really need it!"
College Senior,1,Parking is honestly inconvenient. A parking garage was recently built but it's on the opposite side of campus from the dorms and the parking situation near the dorms is inconvenient. It's a long walk and almost impossible to find a parking space. Not a fan.
College Freshman,1,"Not Haveing Been in School for Awhile,Got in on a GED – The Hardest thing for me was haveing to take Gen Ed courses,like English,Math,Psychology,"
College Freshman,1,"There Are Not Enough Places to Park,Due to the Amount of Students Takeing Classes – Some Days there are alot of students in class so parking spots are all taken.along with non students parking in them also"

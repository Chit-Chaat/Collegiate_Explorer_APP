Alum,5,I felt that all teachers made appropriate transitions to the online learning environment during the Covid-19 pandemic. We primarily used Zoom and the Moodle technologies that were available pre-pandemic to finish the rest of our classes. All my teachers did as best they could.
Junior,5,My professors were extremely supportive and helpful with the transition to remote learning. I was impressed with how quickly they were able to move all resources online and we adapted to zoom lectures together. I feel that this brought us all together more and provided an environment of support through a very difficult time for all of us across the country.
Alum,5,"This college will challenge you and support you as an individual in a variety of ways.  Professors will find ways to advance your education inside and outside of the classroom and care about you as a person. Custom fellowships, service placements, and funding for personal research are abundant. The Foundations curriculum will expose you to studies you didn't even know exist. You can carve out your own path at Rhodes and will have a team cheering you on--professors, advisors, and the incredible staff that keeps the place running. Rhodes is a very tight-knit community. Students work hard--and often play hard too. All of this surrounded by fairytale buildings. I cannot describe the opportunities Rhodes gave me and the holistic growth that I gained in those 4 years."
Niche User,5,This is a college where a prospective student should invest their education into. It is known for having one of the best academic programs in all of Tennessee. The campus is also beautiful making student life wonderful.
Sophomore,5,"Rhodes college is an incredible college, it offers students many opportunities and a very close interaction between students and professors for having a smaller number of students. One thing to be changed is how many buildings are not accessible for people with disabilities."
Sophomore,5,Small but that's the way I wanted it. Close community. Great organizations and clubs. Always feel wanted.
Alum,5,The campus and career networks available to students are unbelievable and provide a great turn in investment.
Niche User,5,"Rhodes exceeded my expectations in every imaginable way. The students are beyond friendly, while also being incredibly intelligent and passionate about their studies. Greek life is present, but not entirely pervasive in the community; greek life doesn't create a divide between the student body. Most students are friends with both greek and non-greek students, which truly creates a strong sense of community on campus. The professors, as well, are some of the most passionate and engaged I've ever seen; you can really tell that they love what they teach, but they also genuinely take an interest in their students, and making sure they understand the topics. The dorms are very spacious and nice, with most first year dorms being suite style. The campus is very much deserving of its high rankings as one of the nation's most beautiful campuses; photos alone cannot truly do it justice."
Sophomore,5,"I love Rhodes! Classes are small, professors are very accessible and easy to reach and the campus is great. The only things I would improve are the food and some of the dorms."
Junior,5,"Really love my professors. Rhodes dominates the SAA in most sports and has several national caliber teams. The alumni database is superb and continues to grow. The only downside is how administration is trying to phase out greek life (most students don't agree with) and the ultra liberal agenda they have; for example, they make you do privilege walks during the ""First year experience"" (FYE is a waste of time that no first year likes) and try to make white men seem bad. Hopefully, that will scale back with time."
Alum,5,I totally got the return on my investment.  I was quickly able to get involved and take on leadership roles which led to mentors from various departments and administrative offices.  These mentors connected me to a great job and launched my career.
Alum,5,"I had a thoroughly wonderful time here - wouldn't change it for anything. The students are a fascinating, multi-talented hodgepodge of kids from all over the country and world. Academics can be demanding but teachers are always willing to go the extra mile to ensure a student's success. Memphis itself is teeming with opportunities, with volunteer work, internships, and employment to be had across disciplines. Alongside the never-ending live music, cheap and delicious food, Overton park, the river, and too much else to name, Rhodes really can be the perfect place for the right person."
Sophomore,5,Great school with a beautiful campus and professors and administrators that genuinly care about the success of its students.
Alum,5,Great community of students who are cooperative with one another. Surrounded by a city full of character and opportunities to serve.
Senior,5,"Rhodes college has been an unbelievable place to attend school for the past four years. As you can see from the statistics, it is obviously a very good academic school; the rigor, diversity, and interactions with the professors in the classroom has prepared me tremendously for the real world. The experiences and opportunities that the students have here in the city of Memphis is truly incredible. From internships to volunteering to simply experiencing the culture of a diverse city has shaped me as a very well rounded person in addition to the broad liberal arts education. But most importantly, the best part about Rhodes is the people here. Coming from all of the country with all different backgrounds, goals, and interests does not stop the students of Rhodes from forming an incredibly tight-knit community. I would highly suggest looking into becoming a part of this community as it has been a life changing experience for the better."
College Sophomore,5,I love being at school
College Freshman,5,"The academics at Rhodes is about as good as one could ask for. The professors are engaging, very approachable and willing to help if you go to office hours. The only downside is that the workload can be quite overwhelming at times (especially if you are taking a lab) but visiting professors in office hours usually helps with the more difficult material."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,I love Rhodes! It is the perfect college for me!
College Freshman,5,The opportunities I have at Rhodes are preparing me for graduate school and a successful career.
College Freshman,5,"I am a member of the Men's Swim Team. Our coach is amazing. Our team is growing and setting new school records every day, every meet, and every season!"
College Freshman,5,Rhodes College is the perfect fit for me!
College Freshman,5,The courses are really hard and they make you think but the professors are there every step of the way
College Freshman,5,The career center is very helpful. The alumni are also very loving of the school
College Freshman,5,Most students live on campus so the sense of community is really there
College Freshman,5,"It's a great environment if you feel like you need it. It's definitely very helpful during freshman year as you get to meet a lot of people. However, the most awesome thing about our Greek system is that people don't actually live in the houses so non-Greeks and Greeks mix together a lot."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very helpful and friendly. The professors are very engaging and genuinely want to be there to teach you. 99% of the classes don't have TAs so you really do get to know the professor on a personal level.
College Sophomore,5,"The sense of community is great, the classes are challenging but not overwhelming, and there are amazing opportunities to get to know Memphis. Plus, I'm a Bonner Scholar, so I have amazing intern opportunities and I get money to put towards my tuition."
College Freshman,5,"everyone is so nice and helpful. Rhodes has so many programs to help any type of student from multicultural programs to first generation students. staff is so nice and so are the students, great school overall."
College Freshman,5,The food in Memphis is amazing
College Freshman,5,Rhodes College is very prestigious and very well known.
College Freshman,5,I have made a lot of really good friends this year.
College Freshman,5,There has been a big push on campus to make the college a safer place.
College Freshman,5,I am really lucky to be living in the dorm that I live in currently.
Recent Alumnus,5,Memphis has so many delicious off-campus dining options!
Recent Alumnus,5,Rhodes is very generous with their aid. I come from an upper middle class family and still received funding.
College Freshman,5,I am involved in greek life and I love it. It was a great way for me to meet new people.
College Freshman,5,"I came to Rhodes from Los Angeles. It's a bit of a culture shock, coming to the south, but I really love it here. The people are really cool, it's a beautiful campus, and it's a lot of fun."
College Junior,5,I love the fact that it's not a huge deal but you still get all of the friendships and experiences
Recent Alumnus,5,"Most classes are from 10-20 people. I've loved almost all of my profs--very knowledgeable and passionate and willing to help/talk. Since we're so small, there is less variety in available courses, but I loved most of mine (pretty passionate about my psych degree). Most classes are about half lecture, half discussion, but the broader courses are often more lecture-focused."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We are, overall, a very lenient school. Underage alcohol use is discouraged, but it's practiced as ""don't see, don't tell."" If you're 21, alcohol is fine as long as you aren't wildly disruptive. Drug enforcement is stricter, but is still more like a ""3 strikes and you're out"" thing than immediate punishment. Our only rule about visitation is that they can't stay more than a few consecutive days, I believe. We take our Honor Code seriously, allowing us to let our guard down, but violations are taken seriously and go to Honor Court. Attendance rules depend on the prof."
College Junior,5,"Our physics department is a very tight knit group of students and faculty.  We all work together on assignments, participate in social and outreach events through the Society of Physics Students, and just hang out in the SimLab together.  On top of all that, the faculty are extremely interested in you and helping you achieve your goals."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm going to be honest. When I first came to Rhodes, I loved it. Then somewhere during that first semester, I developed an intense hatred for this school. I felt like I was alone; everyone around me was rich, white, and conservative. I applied to transfer; thankfully, that school didn't give me enough money. So I was stuck at Rhodes. Turns out it was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.   

It takes a while to get used to something new, something different. Rhodes is different. Rhodes students are different. And what I didn't realize before is that every single Rhodes student is different from one another. Once I began to embrace the uniqueness that is Rhodes College, I saw the school in a different light. (I'm sorry for being so corny.) It's a place where you can go to the Middle Ground for coffee and leave with a new friend. It's a place where you will see familiar faces on a daily basis. It's a place where there are very few unrequited smiles, and help is never far. It's like a utopia. People are nice, things don't get stolen, and there is a sense of family. 

Rhodes started out as a nightmare for me, but it's become my haven. With people as beautiful on the inside as our buildings are on the outside, I can't help but enjoy my time here. I've already grown so much both academically and personally, and I cannot even imagine being anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"It's most definitely cheaper than on-campus housing. A lot of times, Rhodes students tend to forget that we're in the great city of Memphis. We get stuck in the Rhodes Bubble. Living off campus helps break that cycle and serves as a reminder of the opportunities we have outside of our 100 acre haven."
College Freshman,5,"Campus safety is greatly available on campus, at any time of the day and night."
College Freshman,5,Rhodes is a school that is very accepting of all diversities. It is a school that one can learn from a plethora of different view points. It is truly a priceless experience.
College Senior,5,Classes are challenging and rigorous but its an academic environment like no other. Like an Ivy league school of the South.
College Senior,5,"The Honor Code is taken very seriously and has created a wonderful environment academically. Students also feel comfortable leaving their backpacks, books, etc. places because they know they'll still be there when they return. Socially Rhodes is a little more lenient. There are alcohol violations and drug violations but consequences aren't typically severe and sometimes those in authority will look the other way."
College Freshman,5,I never have any problems getting into the classes I need/want. Professors are great about making wait lists and will usually let you in a full class if you ask.
College Freshman,5,The classes are very demanding but the professors are really great about meeting you in office hours if you need extra help or just want to clarify a few things.
College Freshman,5,"Probably the strength of Rhodes College, its academics. I absolutely love going to classes and have no fear in meeting my professors in office hours. The academics at Rhodes are nationally renown and open many doors for graduate studies!"
College Freshman,5,Religious Studies is at the core of the Foundations curriculum at Rhodes College. This makes pursuing a major in the field a very exciting and contemporary one. The professors in this field are eager to have students involved and are interested to see what students desire to do with such a degree. Being a freshmen I am limited to the ins and outs of the major but am very excited to embark on that journey!
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Rhodes! Sure there are things that I wish were different however the good things greatly outweigh the bad. My professors are invested in us, the students. Rhodes kids, as a general rule, want to be there and want to the make the most of their education. Going to Rhodes has already and I know will continue to open amazing doors for me. I am very fortunate to be there, it is the school of my dreams."
College Freshman,5,Rhodes Campus has been rated one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. My housing experience has been wonderful. My dorm is spacious and the bathroom and showering facilities are clean.
College Freshman,5,"Student life is bountiful, but is majorly contingent upon being greek. 50%+ of the student body is greek. Library is beautiful and very helpful, new build ('04). Campus events and traditions are also bountiful such as convocation and Rites of Spring. Students hang out in the Middle Ground often, which is a 24 hour lounge with Starbucks and printers (the coffee isn't 24 hrs)."
College Freshman,5,There's a lot of variety and you can even create your own major. Art and theatre departments are not fully developed and need work.
College Junior,5,"I love everything about Rhodes. The professors are the best, and the overall campus experience is great."
College Junior,5,There are always on campus or off campus house parties.
College Junior,5,Classes take a lot of work but they are worth it.
College Freshman,5,"Being in Memphis, there are a lot of fun barbecue places. I've only ever used my student discount at Yolo (frozen yogurt place), but I think there are a few other places that accept Rhodes cards. Cafe Eclectic really is great. It's nice to be able to walk to a place with really good, high quality food. My favorite restaurant so far is Flight, but it's definitely not a place I would go to unless my parents were in town. "
Graduate Student,4,Once the pandemic started and we transitioned to online class we had a week to move and the teacher had a week to transition online. Most of my teachers still had regular schedules but were very lenient on attendance. They all used zoom and just did live videos of them walking through their power points and submitting assignments through moodle.
Graduate Student,4,I liked going to a small school in a big city. It was very cozy. Teachers were very personal and attentive.
Alum,4,"Rhodes College provides a truly unique experience for you to grow as an individual and a scholar. There are numerous opportunities to get involved in leadership activities in student government and organizations. Required courses in the Search/Life categories during the first 1.5 years ensure that all graduates have good critical reasoning abilities. The liberal arts course requirements offered me so much knowledge on topics that I had no idea I would be interested in at the time I started at Rhodes (Buddhism, Archaeology, Film,etc). One of the most effective ways to get involved in leadership positions and enjoy the social life on campus is through Greek Life. The only reason I don't give a 5-star rating is President Hass's decidedly anti-Greek bias on campus, limiting all organization's abilities to throw parties, engage in philanthropy, and recruit on campus. I think a majority of students look forward to her departure. Overall, absolutely consider Rhodes in your college search."
Junior,4,"I love the community at Rhodes College, this is what made me choose it in the first place--you could feel the connectedness from even a campus tour. After two years of being at Rhodes I have made so many valuable connections with professors, fellow students, and mentors in and around the Rhodes community. I look forward to my next year at Rhodes! Go lynx!"
Sophomore,4,"A small community where everyone knows each other. There’s so much things that Rhodes College offers that engages you more deeply because of that small community environment. Volunteering and services are emphasized, and the college encourages you to be involved"
Freshman,4,"The teachers at Rhodes College are wonderful! It is so nice to have Professors who are invested in the environment that students are in and actively engage the class in what is being taught. The campus is very pretty and easy to get around. Everyone is dedicated in their studies,  but are still engaged with the community within Rhodes as well as out side of it. Though I have only been here a short time, my overall experience has been positive and has motivated me to work harder and enjoy my life while doing so."
Freshman,4,I am only a freshman here at Rhodes but my experience has been pretty great so far. I have met some really great friends and I know that my academia is really being challenged in the best possible way so that I will be successful.
Freshman,4,The absolute best part about Rhodes is the people you will meet here. There are so many fantastic and friendly people.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my academic experience at Rhodes. Classes have been challenging but reasonable, and my professors have made significant efforts to enhance my learning experiences. I feel as though I am learning valuable and interesting content, not simply passing classes."
Niche User,4,The campus is simply to beautiful for words. The nature around the buildings gleam in the sunlight. And the library.... it is a masterpiece!!! There are many resources that student can use and they are easily accessible.
Sophomore,4,"Rhodes is a great place. The community of both students and teachers is enriching and welcoming, and the college is full of opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate the willingness of the faculty and administration to form close bonds with the students and help us succeed as much as possible. Despite this, there is a distinct separation between on-campus students and commuter students.. oftentimes, commuter students are very ostracized from the community and their differing schedules are ignored."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I love Rhodes College. Even more so, I love the city in which it resides. Rhodes does a great job of encouraging its students to go beyond campus and experience what Memphis has to offer those who live there. Further, the school is very service oriented, and generally does a great job with connecting students to service opportunities. Unlike at most schools, greek life is a positive addition to the campus, and offers various leadership and philanthropic opportunities for those involved. Additionally, the coursework is manageable, yet still vigorous. Faculty are easily accessible, and class sized are small enough for professors to notice absences. Lastly, and most importantly, the school recognized its past shortcomings on its lack of diversity, and has worked tirelessly in recent years to improve this problem. Overall, the student-faculty relations and the opportunities the school offers makes it a great institution for anyone interested."
Freshman,4,"Rhodes will give you opportunities that a larger school never would, but it is truly dependent on how much you are willing to invest in Rhodes. Though their is a culture of silence when it comes to forward thinking , there is a large portion of the student body that does care about the school. It is one of those schools that can completely change you for the better, or become a living hell if you let it. There also is a lot of happenings in midtown and Memphis, and there are enough academic opportunities to keep even the most ambitious students busy. I do agree with earlier comments however—this is not a forward thinking campus. I do hope, however, that it will grow to become that way in the future."
Sophomore,4,It's fun and all but I feel as though I am wasting my money here. I really hope the new Dean makes some necessary changes. Some teachers here are honestly unacceptably bad for how much we pay.
Sophomore,4,Would not have had it any other way! I'm glad I chose to attend Rhodes. I enjoy the small campus and friendly environment. The classes are small and the professors are super accessible. I have always been able to just come in during office and ask any questions I have about the course. The Student Activities Board and the other organizations are always planning something...it's hard to be bored here!
Niche User,4,The atmosphere is friendly and the campus is beautiful. I wish that there was more diversity but there are many extracurricular activites on campus and the music program is exceptional.
Niche User,4,"The campus is a dream, so beautiful! And the library is beautiful! The people are sweet and the weather is awesome."
Freshman,4,"I love this school so much. I think the teachers and students are inspiring and the quality of life here is really great for me. Living in Memphis can sometimes be frustrating mostly due to the setup of the city. However, I personally enjoy the city and all it has to offer. I've never felt unsafe around campus. I quickly integrated into the schools community and it really feels like home. "
College Sophomore,4,I am on the volleyball team
College Freshman,4,Athletics are just as important to faculty and students as academics are.
College Senior,4,The professors will push you.
College Senior,4,"One of my favorite memories was when my friends and I ""borrowed"" food trays from the Rat for makeshift sleds. . . good times!"
College Freshman,4,"The Alumni network and the career services department help students get their application all over the country, therefore giving them access to more job opportunities. That alone is worth its weight in gold."
College Freshman,4,"Course variety is vast, and in every department you find professors who are willing not only to work with you, but who will go out of their way to engage with you on a personal level."
College Freshman,4,"Campus crime hardly ever occurs. I have never witnessed it, only heard about it second or third-hand. Security guards are always driving around campus to keep a watchful eye on the students they protect. Guards at the gate stop everyone who comes in unless they have a Rhodes parking sticker on their car. I personally feel very safe at all times, but for those who do not, Campus Safety offers to drive to your location on campus and take you to your desired location as long as it is around campus or on campus itself."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms, at least for my freshman year, were just classic college dorms. Sophomore year, I am booked for a nicer double room. After freshman year, the housing improves dramatically."
College Freshman,4,"As a member of Greek life, it significantly improved my college experience almost immediately. The guys in every fraternity are welcoming, and sororities are universally inclusive as well. The only clash between Greeks and non-Greeks has been caused by a change in admittance into events. Guest lists are strictly enforced at Greek events, both on and off campus, in an effort to minimize, and hopefully eliminate the chance of sexual assault at such events. Each fraternity member is allowed one guest to bring to the event, so while parties are not open to everyone, they are rather inclusive if you find a fraternity member not taking a guest (which is not hard to do)."
College Freshman,4,"Students come out and support their friends at sporting events. Because the school is so small, almost everyone is friends with an athlete or an athlete themselves. The facilities are better than average, plus the addition of a new Varsity Weight Room allows athletes to train separately from the non-athlete population. For a Division III school, our athletics rank as some of the best in the nation in many different sports."
College Junior,4,Career Services isn't really that helpful but you'll make many connections for potential jobs simply by being a Rhodes student.
College Freshman,4,"Rhodes has a lot of issues on its plate, mostly in terms of diversity, but they are normal college problems and unlike some other public institutions, we are embracing them and making sure they are being worked on. The academics have been very challenging, but I may not be the best source on that coming from a local public high school which consistently struggled to meet state standards. Perhaps what is most pleasing to me is the financial aid (which, on the current path, will let me graduate debt-free) and the willingness of my professors and advisers to go a step above the rest and make sure I'm doing well."
College Freshman,4,I've been very happy with my dorm experience.
College Freshman,4,"While there's definitely measures now in place to address safety, the school can do more in terms of preventative care."
College Sophomore,4,The nightlife is very fun. I have a lot of really great friends at Rhodes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great school, dedicated professors and campus safety."
College Freshman,4,"The two times I have been at Rhodes College were amazing. I went for the first time to tour the school to help make my final decision and everyone we met was so kind. The school took my breath away. Then I came for the second time for orientation and although I endured a lot from flight issues, everyone was welcoming with open arms. The school took my breath away again and was even prettier than I remember it. I was a little confused as to where some buildings are because there are not obvious signs pointing you the way. Other than that aspect and a couple others, I have enjoyed my experiences at Rhodes so far."
College Sophomore,4,"A few of the rules don't make much sense to me, but they do a good job reinforcing those that they have, and consequences seem fair."
College Sophomore,4,"Many places have awesome food! Memphis has some great options for eating out, especially when it comes to barbecue. You just have to know where to look."
College Freshman,4,There was not a real process of choosing my major. Since Rhodes is a liberal arts school students are encouraged to try out a little of everything.
College Freshman,4,I am really looking forward to the classes I am taking for my major and minor.
College Freshman,4,I am really looking forward to the classes I am taking for my major and minor.
College Freshman,4,Neuroscience is a great major. Since it is really popular there is a lot of help with faculty and a lot of opportunities to do work outside the classroom.
College Freshman,4,The academics are very rigorous.
College Freshman,4,The students on campus are great. I wish there was more of a student center than just the Middle Ground.
College Freshman,4,The people at Rhodes are really great and inviting.
College Freshman,4,"Freshman year parties are great, but the novelty quickly wears off."
College Freshman,4,"The ice cream is always great, and Alphonsus is the bomb diggity."
College Freshman,4,Some trouble with sexual assault policies from what I hear
College Freshman,4,"The professors are really great. The material is really difficult, but that is expected. The professors are all really willing to help."
College Sophomore,4,Midtown has a great variety of restaurants. I love that we are so close to many different types of dining options.
College Sophomore,4,"There's almost always a party going on - whether it's in the frat houses, in a dorm, or off campus housing. It's even better if you're Greek. Formals can be a lot of fun. Two reasons why I say it isn't ""the best"": Alcohol runs out quickly at parties (to the point where it wouldn't be unusual to spend a year attending Rhodes where the only time you drink is while pre gaming) and everything ends before 2 AM, sometimes as early as 1 AM, which is really lame."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing process can be difficult. The dorms are generally clean. The staff members that clean the dorms are very nice and come often. The dorms are mostly older and tend to come with bug infestations or really strange shapes (from things such as adding AC) and you could end up playing a game of tetris when trying to fit furniture and other room appliances. I have lived in 3 different dorms on campus and each of them have been about a 1-5 minute walk to all my classes, which is a huge plus. There are only a couple dorms that take more time than that. The windows crank open and don't have screens, which is frustrating because there are tons of bugs here. I love that there is a large variety of different types of housing. A few of the dorms reserved for upperclassmen are amazing! Overall, I think the housing is pretty nice compared to most schools."
College Freshman,4,I received exactly what I needed. That is not the story for all students but the process is quick and easy.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't been off campus very many times, but I cannot complain about the places I have gone."
College Freshman,4,I don't think the campus is really strict. The point is to make sure students are safe.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus Safety is great-for white kids. Drinking underage is okay, drugs will get you in trouble."
College Freshman,4,"First of all, I would like to give you the business for looking at this ""Guys & Girls"" section of a school when deciding where to apply.  It is misogynistic and encouraging the patriarchy!  How dare you.  Just kidding.  This is probably what I looked at the most when applying to schools.  

Rhodes College has some of the most fantastic people I have ever met.  Even though most of them are white and come from upper-middle class families, somehow there still manages to be a diversity of opinions and upbringings.  

A lot of the girls here are in sororities; however, Greek life is not as prevalent as you would believe.  The sororities still intermingle and no one really cares which one you're in.  

Ten percent of the male population at Rhodes is football players.  Seriously, this is not a joke.  There are a lot of athletes here, but since this is a D3 school, they aren't the typical meatheads you're imagining.  They have activities outside of football and interact with non-football players.  That being said, Rhodes has a lot of male athletes, but sports is not prevalent on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Fraternities hold parties on Thursday through Saturday with DDs for all off-campus parties. There is even a phone number that you can text, and a brother will come pick you up (even if you are at a different fraternity's party).  If partying isn't your thing, Greek life still hosts events that aren't parties.  For example, every year AOII hosts a Minute-to-Win-It team fundraiser, and the TriDelts have a Pancake fundraiser.  If Greek life in general sounds atrocious, there are still plenty of non-Greek events hosted on campus.  For instance, the Rhodes Activity Board (RAB) hosts open mic nights and often gets local artists to play in the Lair."
College Freshman,4,"Strict enough to ensure a good classroom environment, but lenient enough that people can still have a good time. The Honor Code is taken very seriously for the most part and is mainly supported by the initiative of your peers, which is awesome. The 3 big no's are lying, cheating, and stealing which are pretty simple rules to follow and really pay off (like there is nothing like the freedom to be able to leave all of my things in the library while I leave for a half hour study break at Middle Ground without any worries). This being said, rules are kind of loose in terms of alcohol, so if drinking is your thing, then just drink responsibly and bring a sober friend with you and you'll be fine!"
College Freshman,4,"Assuming you have a car (or a friend with a car), dining options are great. There are a lot of various barbecue places to check out with a wide assortment of prices. There's also late night donuts, rad places that do soul food, and old reliable fast food. Now, if you are without a vehicle at all, there is a cafe within walking distance of campus that students seem to really enjoy."
College Senior,2,There seems to be two extremes.
College Freshman,2,"very inclusive 

hard for some to join due to financial issues"
College Junior,2,Our administration is awful to survivors of sexual assault and nearly always take the perpetrator's side.
College Freshman,2,I'm stuck in a sticky situation and Rhodes is being very elusive about helping me out to keep attending.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are really only two options-the Rat and the Lair. 

The Rat is unlimited, cafeteria style, but the food is not great. 

The Lair includes the campus pub, and offers salads, quesadillas, sandwiches, pizzas and grill items (chicken nuggets, burgers, fries, etc)"
Recent Alumnus,2,"While the dining halls are nice, the food sucks. Little variety both on a daily and weekly basis. Few vegetarian/vegan/etc options, and that's the same stuff every day, like the salad bar. The only late-night option is the Lair, open til 11. Most meals cost right around $6.50, which seems like a high price for the value. The quesadillas and cheese dip are great, though!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"We're not very diverse: vastly non-ethnic white, middle-upper class, Christian, straight. Mostly liberal but with a good mix of conservatives. Our international students largely keep to themselves (barring the UK/Aus kids). LGBT students are largely accepted and not treated differently, but it varies individually. I'd say the vast majority are accepting of everyone regardless of race, etc., but the minority groups don't always feel too welcomed. Thankfully, that seems to be on the upswing."
College Sophomore,2,should give out more to transfers
College Freshman,2,Memphis weather is pretty random. Winter was pretty cold and now the summer is going to be very hot.
College Junior,2,The workload at my school is very intense. The curriculum is very very tough. Being in a city there are many opportunities for internships and then future jobs.
College Freshman,2,"Dorms suck. Because the school is so old, most of the dorms haven't been renovated. The best housing is West and East Village, but it's pretty hard to get into one because of the housing selection system. Classrooms are not very high tech, and a lot of the bathrooms are really old."
College Freshman,2,"My roommate is Indian, so I see a lot of her friends a lot, but otherwise theres not an extreme amount of diversity. I have a lot of super rich friends and some friends that aren't poor by any means, but not near the same level as my rich friends. Most people are Christian and I haven't run into too many gay people. "
College Junior,2,"Most people have their own cars, but campus safety patrols the school 24/7. So if you ever need a ride to some place on campus, you can call campus safety and they will pick you up. Sometimes it takes them awhile to arrive, so you may want to call ahead of time so that you won't be late to wherever you're going."
College Junior,2,"There are different forms of diversity on this campus. As far as racial diversity, Rhodes has quite a bit of a way to go."
College Senior,2,The Rat is a nice space but does not offer a lot of options that appeal to me. I tend to cook my own food.
College Junior,2,"Parking has become a nightmare as the school accepts a larger number of freshmen. Students try to get away with parking in the faculty/staff lots to be closer to their dorms and classes. I'm a commuter, and I have to leave home early just to ensure that I get a decent parking spot."
College Sophomore,2,"In recent years admissions has been putting more effort in attracting other races to Rhodes, but I have yet to see a major difference."
College Freshman,2,"Small school, so no bus. There are zip cars, but there's only 2 and the price is pretty high."
College Sophomore,2,"There is little parking available during the week, basically you will be stuck in parking far away from classes if you don't come to school early or you leave and come back during the day."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone drinks at Rhodes, and people often go out Thursday, Friday, and Saturday every weekend. There are a decent number of students who smoke weed, and there are definitely some who use harder drugs like cocaine. Campus Safety really does not care what students do as long as they aren't completely out of control."
Alum,1,"Rhodes is a school that used to be a great place to get a job and an education. However, they have used this reputation to keep expanding their reach without actually improving the school. 
The administration is lackluster and truly only cares about those diverse students who fit the brochure mold.
The career services department needs to be completely gutted and fired because in my time at school, the only recruiters that they managed to bring in were US military and teach for america groups. I am currently looking for a job and in contacting career services usually only receive one response with little help. On replying to them, I almost always receive nothing back. 
The campus buildings need great improvement. While they just completed the new science building, probably 20 years after it was needed, they next must begin updating the dorms other academic buildings. 
The food options are very limited due to a non compete clause with aramark."
College Junior,1,Greek life on campus is a hot-topic. Non-Greeks tend to hate Greeks and Greeks do not realize their privilege and arrogance.
College Sophomore,1,"I went to two different boarding schools and my sister went to another one where I often visited her. I used to get sick of the food that was offered at boarding school but it always tasted good, they had more options, and everything was healthier. Those three schools all had food that was far superior than the food at Rhodes College. Here are almost no healthy options. The ""healthy"" options they have are bad, such as lettuce being wilted and salad toppings from a can. The food served at the rat does not change very often either. Even though they have vegetarian options, it is extremely difficult to be a vegetarian here. Many times, there have not been labels on the soup and I have had to ask the Rat employees if the soup is vegetarian. They usually have to check and then respond with a 'yes'. However, when I taste it, I find out it that it had chicken broth in it or something that is not vegetarian (this is a problem within Memphis as a whole - they do not seem to understand what vegetarian means and some restaurants do not have any or only have one vegetarian option). The vegetarian options do not give enough nutrition and I stopped my vegetarian diet. There are only two places on campus to get a full meal, which is annoying. The Lair runs out of food items quickly, such as wheat rolls or a certain type of meat, which limits options even further. If you eat dinner late, it is very frustrating. The Lair stops accepting meal plans at 8:30 PM and you have to pay with Lynx Bucks (if you are out, you have to pay with your credit card or cash). That wouldn't be so bad except they close all the other stations and leave open the station with the most unhealthy options available - the Grill."
College Freshman,1,"THE WIFI REALLY SUCKS. Crashes every 5-15 minutes, especially dependent upon which dorm you're in."
College Freshman,1,"Very stingy and unnecessarily so. A lot of the students on campus have a lot of money and don't need as much financial aid, yet the office isn't very willing to accommodate changing circumstances."
College Freshman,1,"Absolutely blows. The cafeteria is known for multiple health code violations. I've stumbled upon completely raw chicken one too many times....look off campus. The lair isn't any better either, the food isn't kept clean or away from contamination. Nasty nasty nasty"
College Freshman,1,"I came from a huge city with awesome nightlife and Memphis had nothing to offer whatsoever. Students mostly go to a dive bar near by called Zinnie's, and it's grungy......to say the least. "
College Senior,1,There is a very visible use of alcohol on campus but I would't say that you would be pressured to drink. You would be offered drinks but no one would treat you badly or differently if you said no. There have been a few nights when I've gone out on campus and chose not to drink and no one treated me badly at all. The drug usage isn't as high as the alcohol usage but different groups treat it differently. Some may be fine if you decline to participate while others would treat you badly if you said no.
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't many safe clubs, or any clubs, to go to in Memphis, and you would need your own car to get there anyway.  Parties are typically just drinking, beer pong, talking (kinda), and dancing if you're drunk enough."
College Freshman,1,The diversity here is negligible and sad.  Almost everyone is from the same background racially and socioeconomically.  We are on a list for the least diverse schools in the nation as well.
College Freshman,1,"About 70-75% of the student population is White.  Currently, Rhodes is accepting more and more international students."
College Sophomore,1,"Just built new facilities in the ""rat."" Still horrible despite million dollar renovations. I am about to post a picture if possible of my dinner tonight: ""pesto"" pasta with shrimp and a slice of pizza topped with corn, black beans, onions, and cheese. I legitimately almost vomited, but didn't because I'm just about used to this trash. The ""Lair"" is good for the first two weeks, until you realize they only have the same options every night (of which only 3 or 4 are edible/healthy). Living off campus helps (when you get the chance your junior year). When I toured, they didn't show me the rat (pre-new construction) because they were embarrassed by it. Awk."
College Freshman,1,"Rhodes College, though located in Midtown in Memphis has poor transportation options. You can take a bus into the city but I DO NOT recommend you take it! It is extremely sketchy. There are no trains locally except a trolly that only runs downtown. If you want to get around, even to go to Target, the best way is to have a car or to ride with a friend."
College Sophomore,1,"Alcohol Is Very Popular – As a visitor to Rhodes, one would not know that alcohol is a problem at Rhodes, but once a person becomes a student, he or she will see first hand that a majority of Rhodes students take part in drinking alcohol. Weekend parties begin every Thursday and don't end until Saturday. Therefore, drinking begins every Thursday. So many alcohol violations are given that it becomes second nature to some students. As a Freshman, I was very surprised to see so many drunk people every weekend."
College Freshman,1,"Food on Campus – Options at Rhodes are pretty limited when it comes to food on campus. Students may choose to eat in the ""Rat"" or the ""Lynx Lair"". The food in the Lair is pretty good, but it doesn't always apply to the meal plan and is usually pretty unhealthy. The ""Rat"" usually has something you can eat, but the chances of it being healthy, good, and warm are next to nothing. There is a lot of variation in what you can get everyday, so eating on campus can be hit or miss. The only things guaranteed to students are a salad bar, ice cream, drinks, apples, oranges, and cereal. Students tend to eat off campus/in their rooms more than they expected to."
College Freshman,1,"Eat Off-Campus – Although there are several restaurants and fast food establishments minutes from campus, the food on campus is less than desired. Put it this way, the University of Memphis' level of food is level five. The state prison is level one...and Rhodes is level two. I don't exactly know what the levels mean, but college students at a prestigious liberal arts school are one better than the state prison? Yeah...not good."
College Freshman,1,"Rhodes is extremely expensive, doesn't offer a lot of academic scholarships (mostly loans, not scholarships), and is constantly asking for donations. They increase tuition by thousands each year and do not compensate for the students that were already going there. Then, at the same time they decrease the quality of other things to save money like smaller Lair cups and limited amount of cheese on personal pizzas. Not to mention they freeze you in the winter and cook you in the summer to save money on heat and air conditioning. The dorms are also terrible. Rhodes students pay four times the amount of tuition that an in-state university, but receive less benefits than university students."
College Junior,1,"Professors are okay and the students aren't that bright – I haven't had many classes at Rhodes where I felt particularly challenged or felt that the professor was really invested in my learning something.  They are constantly running around worrying about tenure, no doubt due to the absurd Rhodes College Administration (a motley bunch, take my word for it).  Rhodes students, for the most part, are there for an A grade, and once they learn how to get that, they pretty much zone everything else out.  I learned way more in high school than I have at this school.  I would recommend you use your $50,000 to buy a boat or something."
College Junior,1,There is virtually no spirit on campus for athletics whatsoever.  I am not even aware when there is a sporting event going on.  I hear the football team is pretty terrible and the field hockey team is okay.  Do we have a basketball team?  I couldn't say.
College Sophomore,1,"All grades are allowed to park on campus, and parking is free.  While that seems great, that means there are not enough spots for everyone on campus.  It is difficult to go off campus during the school day, because you might not get a spot later on.  Most dorms aren't near parking lots, so it can be a hassle when shopping."

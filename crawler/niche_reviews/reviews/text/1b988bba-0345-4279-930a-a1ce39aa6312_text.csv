Sophomore,5,I had a great experience at Oakwood University although short lived it helped me get to where I am now. I Wish the tuition was a bit cheaper but the education received was worth it.
Sophomore,5,"I truly believe Oakwood University was the right choice for me. Coming from Canada, I had never thought of going to an HBCU; however, it was extremely beneficial as a black student because I have had the opportunity to relate, share, and learn about my history and current experiences. Additionally, the Christian environment is beneficial because I have been able to get advice from great mentors, and relate with other young people who also share the same values. Finally, I love to be in a school where I can meet and network with people from all over the world, not only the States."
Sophomore,5,"We were evacuated from campus in mid-March and completed the spring semester online. I personally completed four classes online. It was difficult. Luckily, I had a personal space to work in but my conputer shut down midway because it could not handle the extra activity. Plus, my home environment is not ideal and I had a challenging time emotionally being able to complete the year. However, the professors were very helpful and understanding. And the school changed the entire scale system so none of is failed which was a blessing."

Senior,5,"I've been at Oakwood University for four years going on because this is my senior year, and I've had nothing but fun and educating opportunities. Yes, every school has its issues but what makes this school unique is the care the faculty has for the students and the great networking opportunities that they help students to connect with.

Freshman,5,I like that the students are diverse and so kind. The professors are here for you spiritually and educationally. The food is good at the market and if you’re into lifting weights or getting in shape this school will do that for you. I came to oakwood with no guidance on my spiritual side. The ignite program helped me get my spiritual life together. If I could tell people to come here I would.
Niche User,5,"Oakwood is an HBCU with a great Christian background. Having to deal with no meat on campus and vegetarian food 24/7 may be difficult, but its worth the experience of the friendly people and atmosphere."

Freshman,5,"I love the Christian environment. The people are very kind. The food isn't that great, but the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Oakwood University is that it's a Christian school where we not only learn about new subjects every day, but we also learn about religious teachings. It is also a Seventh-day Adventist orientation campus and has a church that students attend for divine worship. There are multiple jobs that students can get at the campus while they take their classes. So far, there are no changes I want to see to the campus. It's fine just as it is."
Freshman,5,I came to oakwood as a freshman. Not really knowing what to expect. I was nervous about leaving home for the first time and being somewhere new with new people. But as soon as I got there I felt such a warm and inviting presence. We are all one big family and we look after each other most important we keep God first and that makes oakwood stand out from any other school I applied to.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the academic atmosphere of Oakwood University. The professors and other students are welcome to support and guide any student who may have difficulties. We strive for success as a family and because it's a small school we can even more guide each other. There's not much I would change about oakwood in the academic sense but if we could have better accomadations for food provided on campus that would be great.
Sophomore,5,"Oakwood University is a Historically Black College/University. Ever since I began attending I immediately felt at home. Oakwood University is a safe and loving environment and I've learned a lot since I've furthered my education.

Senior,4,"Oakwood University is a blessed college. It's quite far from perfect, but those who enter to learn truly depart to serve. It was my last choice when it came to the universities I was already accepted into. But, thankfully and God willing, I am here. I don't regret the time I've spent at Oakwood simply because of the connections I've made. Several things I would change, however, would definitely be the food, room and board, and education when it comes to Graphic Design. It's a new program there, so there are a lot of holes and imperfections. The rooms are quite old and need to be updated, and the food has more days than none where it tastes absolutely horrid and terrible. But, no university is completely perfect - though there are some better than most."
Senior,4,"Well, I ended up taking online classes with Oakwood in the spring of 2020 due to the Corona Virus. For my major, it wasn't hard as I'm an art major/marketing minor, so transitioning online wasn't an issue I had to face. The only downside was that a lot of the teachers at Oakwood are very, very, very old-school. So the transition from paper-back to online was harder for most than some. As time went on, the teachers and faculty became used to it, and the process was very smooth."
Sophomore,4,"The professors work well with the students, however they take a while to respond to emails and phone calls. Work and instructions are outlined clearly and lectures are not too long."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed Oakwood, as a freshman they built the stepping stone for me to become great and productive."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my online experience, after the pandemic occurred in the U.S many colleges were forced to become classes online. Last year i was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA for spring semester. The way the online classes were set up, it ensured success."
Sophomore,4,"I did take online classes and I actually only had an issue with one professor who did not put much effort in communication. Otherwise, I was able to complete my classes and stay connected to the teachers."
Sophomore,4,Overall I think Oakwood is a pretty great school. The people are friendly and willing to help. Really my only problem with the school is that the food is absolutely terrible.
Sophomore,4,"As a young, African American female, Oakwood has been a safe place to grow and thrive. Emotionally, it has afforded me the place to feel safe. Mentally, it has challenged me to become a better version of myself. Academically, it has motivated me to pursue my passion as a musician. Overall, my experience at Oakwood has been pleasant. My fellow students and most of my professors have been nothing but positive and encouraging. While the atmosphere is beautiful, there are some downsides. I have seen a very evident lack of organization and communicaiton on the part of administration. Also, sports does not play a larger part in the University's campus life. Lastly, the school promotes a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, but the food is not the best."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience has been awesome. I dont regret choosing this university.  Though I take all my courses online, I spent some time on campus. The campus is wonderful. The dorm and food are great. Lastly, the security systems are very good!"
Graduate Student,4,"My experience has been awesome. I dont regret choosing this university.  Though I take all my courses online, I spent some time on campus. The campus is wonderful. The dorm and food are great. Lastly, the security systems are very good!"
Sophomore,4,"Oakwood is a very good school, especially if your trying to keep your faith strong with God. The connections you make while are amazing, I promise you'll never meet such amazing friends and teacher. Plus the teachers actually care about their students and they don't just see them as numbers on a screen."
Freshman,4,"Oakwood University is a really good school, Academically and spiritually. It averagely diverse. The professors and staff members are really nice and caring. We have worship programs like AY, Power Half Hour, Ignite, Prayer meeting, and more. They have a lot of Job opportunities that you can apply for. They also have a lot of sport programs, and clubs for your major.They have fun activities on campus, some being skating, basketball and soccer games. One of the most exciting things is that time to time we might have a famous special speaker or singer that comes to perform either for Chapel or at the Oakwood University church. Two things I would like to change about this university is the food they serve in the cafe and curfew hours."
Freshman,4,"Oakwood University is a very family oriented University. It teaches it students not only about academics, but how to build life long friendships. The professors become like parents away from your parents. Oakwood University has also brought me closer to God . The school does have mandatory worships, but those worships are very helpful when trying to get through the week. The only thing I can say Oakwood needs to improve on is the food."
Freshman,4,"Oakwood University is a college with a rich history, and excellent programs for their students. Improvement would be in the area of more staff with qualifications in varied areas of education such as art, graphic design, athletic pursuit."
Senior,4,Oakwood University is a pretty much overall amazing school. The only thing I’d change would be the cafeteria food and menu. It is horrible and it really takes away from that experience very much so.
Junior,4,"Oakwood University is a Christian HBCU. Here you can find exactly what you're looking for; from great friends to an improved relationship with God. I believe like any other university, there will be highs and lows but for the most part, you'll get what you put out. Oakwood is also known for its musical prestige and academics (specifically pre-med). Many of the students here, graduates or not, go off to do great things in the world. Aesthetically, it is a relatively small campus but so much work is being done to make it better each year. In spite of it being a 4-year university, it doesn't have a huge variety of majors to choose from. Don't get me wrong, it has a good selection, but not as wide variety as anyone would expect. People are friendly, faculty is graceful, the food is not the best, it's in Alabama so everything closes early, and there aren't co-ed dorms. Just a few observations of mine."
Senior,4,"The oakwood experience makes you feel like you're really part of something. With this college, there's a strong feeling of individuality that permeates through the campus. Plus the level of leniency an understanding with the staff is phenomenal."
Freshman,4,Oakwood University has been in the family for years and i only have good memories. It is a good experience as you will not get this kind of experience anywhere else.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere of Oakwood University, the people there are a real family. The worships are amazing and the teachers are super supportive in the classroom."
Senior,4,"There is no other University like Oakwood! The atmosphere is very open and loving. The extracurricular activities range from sports to poetry clubs. My favorite thing at Oakwood is the music. We are home of the Aeolians, Choir of the World 2018. There is also student led choirs that give the campus an opportunity to experience different styles of music. I also enjoy basketball season. Oakwood has very competitive fans, which makes attending basketball games a highlight of the semester. Although my school has a lot to offer, there are  some things that need to be  changed. I would like to see our expansion as far as the facilities on my campus. Many of our department buildings could use renovation because everyone enrolled in certain programs cannot fit comfortably within the space. Overall, Oakwood is a place to grow and develop mentally, spiritually, and academically. I am glad that I chose Oakwood for mt undergraduate experience, it was the best decision I’ve ever made."
Freshman,4,"I love the class sizes and the small school population. I would change the way food is delivered because some types of food aren't allowed in and certain times at night, delivery is not allowed."
Junior,4,"The musical experience at Oakwood University is unmatched. Oakwood's choir, the Aeolians, won the award for best choir in the world, and even if students don't want to join the Aeolians, there are several other great choirs on campus. Also, there is a really good sports presence on campus because the students love to support their sports teams, win or lose and in the past 5 years the men's basketball team has played in the state championship game twice. Even though Oakwood is an HBCU, there are various culture groups that make the school a melting pot."
Niche User,4,Oakwood has an atomosphere like no other. The worship experience is amazing and lifts  you up. The pastoral staff was good. I loved the AY team and productions and services. The campus is small but still a nice little walk if your on foot. The professors seem to care about you and actually want to see you doing will and employed and also a thriving relationship with God.
Junior,4,"My experience at Oakwood has been pretty good so far. I am currently starting my 2nd semester here at Oakwood University and I’m really enjoying it. The environment around Oakwood feels so at home to me. We are all just like one big happy family on campus. The teachers and other staff members do everything in their power to help if needed. Also there are many activities going on throughout each and every week. As far as things I would change, I would just add more students because I think more People out in the world need that “ Oakwood experience.” Besides that I wouldn’t change anything at Oakwood University because it is just that wonderful."
Freshman,4,"Oakwood University does an excellent job with making their students feel at home. As one walks the campus people greet one another with a handshake and a smile. One improvement that could be made, is a variety in teachers, specifically in the math department. For example, at Oakwood, there is only one teacher that teaches Calculus 2 and Calculus 3."
Sophomore,4,"Oakwood University is homey and extremely inviting. If you make the effort to be a friend, you will most likely receive friendship in return wherever you go, whether you're dealing with other students, professors, or staff. Even though the school is costly, it is a great place for people looking to study at a Christian HBCU.

One of the aspects of the school that could potentially be seen as a downside is the fact that a specific set of moderate rules are in place, such as a curfew, required the attendance of worships and weekly chapel, and a dress code, which states ""no jewelry"". Also, something else to consider is that the food sold at the cafeteria and the Oakwood University Market is vegetarian and/or vegan.

Overall, Oakwood University is a warm, friendly, stable place of education that is highly rewarding and enjoyable in the long run."
Sophomore,4,"Oakwood is a unique place. It is place where the teachers and faculty care very much about what they put into the students, and work towards making their stay as enjoyable as possible. However, as with everything it is not all great. For instance the cafeteria, which is undergoing improvements, could be better as well as giving the students a much needed student center and improving the process for student residential leaves and so forth. Still with all these things Oakwood is place where you will find some of the best people you will ever meet and many lifelong friends are sure to be made."
Junior,4,"I like Oakwood for the people I've connected to there. I found great friends. Oakwood also offers a wide variety of jobs on campus and ways to pay off your school bill like LETC. (Literature Evangelist Training Center) where you are matched 100% for what you earn. That's way more than WAU. 
   At Oakwood, just like at any other school, you will find what you are looking for as far as good associations or bad associations. 
   I'd say ask previous students about professors before you select their class, if you can help it.
   Another important thing, submit your forms way ahead of time, but email or call the faculty directly to get updates because processing can be really slow or get lost in the shuffle."
Freshman,4,"Oakwood University is a family oriented, God-centered institution. If you are looking for a university with caring faculty Oakwood is the place to be. In my first year at Oakwood, I have learned to love others and love myself. This institution will prepare you to ""depart to serve"" with love."
Senior,4,overall oakwood has been a challenging experience for me. when i first got there it was different beeing away from home. then i made friends and got a little more comfortable in my environment. the worship experience is great i would advise anyone who likes to worship to attend this university it will change your life. I've had a great three years there ad look forward to graduating with my fellow class mates. I thank god for the experience and the opportunity to attend oakwood university.
Junior,4,"Oakwood has its pros and cons like any other school would have. It can be annoying at times, but overall, it's what you make of it. I overall enjoy it. It fits my lifestyle and my friends have been great so far. It's a good school and the professors I have had so far for the most part have been wonderful."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere here is amazing. The music and spiritual aspect is the best here then any other school.
Junior,4,"It is a very peaceful and calm environment , as well as a  good place to go if you want to be reminded of your relationship with God"
Alum,4,I enjoyed attending this university and I would recommend it for others. I believe it was a good investment into my future.
Freshman,4,What i liked about oakwood university was the diversity and how everyone came from all different walks of life. The kindness of the faculty and professors were amazing and the professors were very patient and kind with the students. Some things that I wish were different at oakwood would probably be the different buildings that aren't used that should be remade into things such as a student center.
Junior,4,My experience at Oakwood University is something i'll take with me for the rest of my life. It's a very small school so it has this family atmosphere where it feels like your connected with everybody. I think Oakwood needs to work on getting their name out there more because they have a lot to offer.
Senior,4,I enjoyed my academic experience at Oakwood and made some great friends in the process. I had the privilege of meeting Professors that helped shape my career. I am so thankful for the blessing of these people in my life.
Freshman,4,"Oakwood has a strong biological science program. It offers a lot of opportunities to get into summer programs, research programs and medical schools after graduation. I also like the diversity at Oakwood. We have students from all over the world who come here and we get along with each other. We also have a strong Christian bond."
Sophomore,4,I like Oakwood University because It helps me to explore opportunities with my college career. It allows me to discover internships and help me reveal my true love for Social Work. They also have a vast majority of clubs that help you and others make a difference within the community. I was previously on the volleyball team and it was a cool experience traveling from different states and playing competitively. I also am involved in the Social Work Club and am developing friendships and opportunities to help out within the community.
Senior,4,I enjoy the overall atmosphere of the campus. The professors also take time out to help and go the extra mile to see you succeed.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I enjoy Oakwood and all it had to offer. Although the food isn't the best, the community, hospitality, family like setting, extra circular activities and the friendships are the best part. The worship, and God filled air is just amazing. Overall it's a great school academically and athletically. Everyone is so talented in their own way and it makes us all uniquely different to where we all mesh together perfectly and get along so well."
Sophomore,4,"At oakwood i liked the social, spiritual life, the family atmosphere and the music. what i would change is variety of courses they offered. The university offers very limited selections. Overall it is a faith based university so if your faith is important to you, it is perfect.
,"
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience with Oakwood University has been great thus far. You are indeed bless at any church service or concert the school has to offer by The Aeolians, The University Choir (VOICES), Voices of Triumph (VOT), and Dynamic Praise (DP). One of the things I love about Oakwood is the homey feeling of the campus, as well as its nature during fall. You are sure in for an experience when you step on campus. Whether it be in your classes, in the cafeteria, at church, at worships, or even dorm activites. Either way you will be blessed and be fulfilled with an experience you have never seen before."
Junior,4,It's an experience like no other. Your teachers actually know you and cares about you as an individual. The spiritual atmosphere is amazing.
Junior,4,"Oakwood University is a great environment to find God and receive an education. The dorms are nice, the food is decent and the atmosphere is a delight. The teachers are respectful and God-fearing and they really have you best interest at heart. If I could change anything, I would help some of the departments organize their lives because some majors can be a hassle if not advised correctly."
Freshman,4,"As an HBCU, Oakwood University provides a unique opportunity for African American students to get both a great education and faster job placement once one graduates. The professors here have good connections within the business and medical fields, so as long as you keep your nose in the books and conference with the professors to discuss grades and other class-related criteria, you're pretty much set. "
College Freshman,4,The track is a place where you can go if you feel like you need to run to clear your head. The gym is place hwere both guys and girls can benefit.
College Freshman,4,I feel like I can accomplish anything here! I love this school. They push you to be better in every aspect of your life.
College Freshman,4,"The Freshman dormitories, Carter Hall and Holland Hall are the 2 best residence halls on campus! One reason, they are newer and have more perks than the upperclassmen dorms do. Carter hall (freshman girls) has a kitchen where students can cook, air conditioning in every room, the option of a suite or a regular double room, and an updated security system."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are very fun. Any sport that you want to play they offer at some point during the school year. I really enjoy the sports and the facilities.
College Sophomore,4,Oakwood University produces many great young people. I really enjoy the atmosphere of the school and the professors and students are very unique. I appreciate the friendships that I have made and the help that I have received from the professors and advisors. I wouldn't choose another school because Oakwood is where I need to be. The Adventist atmosphere is good for me and will not only help me thrive academically but also spiritually.
College Sophomore,4,Oakwood is a really good school. Not only are you getting a good education but you also get to grow a closer relationship with God if you choose to. It has its ups and downs but what university doesn't? If you choose to go to oakwood it's either you will love it or want to go to another school there is no in between.
College Junior,4,My experience has been great so far. I just wish my school had better facilities.
College Senior,4,"The class sizes are great, not too big and not too small. The Biology department is the best department filled with teachers who have the knowledge and desire to give the students the knowledge as well. The quality is great, however, it would be great to take out teachers who are near 70 and hire teachers who are young, vibrant and have a new view on the subject matter."
College Senior,4,I personally feel very safe on campus and in the surrounding areas.
College Senior,4,I love my institution and the students that it produces. I love the Christian atmosphere and the way that the faculty and staff encourage and help their students. I would definitely choose my school again because I have met amazing individuals and have created long-lasting friendships.
College Freshman,4,"This school has provided me with nothing but the best. Tuition is a bit on the expensive side only because the school is located in Alabama and I live in New Jersey. Everyone there likes to have fun and loves God. It is a Christ-Centered school, with a positive, welcoming, and homey atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are great not too crowded not too scarce, professors are very understanding and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe whenever I'm on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus was a very great experience for me, I think everyone should experience dorm life."
Sophomore,2,A few of the Professors are on the older range of the spectrum and had a hard time figuring out the online learning thing
Sophomore,2,I do not like going to school online. It was very stressful and sometimes the teachers don't give us enough information in the email to complete our assignments. There is something special about one on one help with a teacher and I enjoy that. I am a visual learner so I work best with I am physically there with a teacher.
College Freshman,2,"We don't have typical fraternities, they're veggie fraternities. They aren't recognized outside of the school."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really like the dorms aside from the freshman Girl's dorm, the other dorms are lacking and since im a male i do not benefit from that the freshman male dorms feel cramped and are far away from everything on campus and the dorm is old , the upperclassman dorm looks really bad and empty almost the reflection of emptiness and is also need to be updated the female upperclassmen dorm i also hear is worse for wear , they need to seriously renovate the other dorms"
College Sophomore,2,My school doesn't support Greek Life due to our Christian values
College Senior,2,"Greek life is extremely limited, and the school does not endorse it. Anything pertaining to Greek life cannot be worn or displayed on campus. Only thing students hear about Greek life is about the parties they throw."
College Freshman,2,Greek life isn't present that much at Oakland. We only have two or three houses I think.
College Junior,2,Fraternities are pretty irrelevant on this campus.
College Junior,2,Athletics are horrible at this school. Basketball is the only program that people actually go and watch.
College Senior,2,Gym is super small compared to other larger colleges
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not prevalent in  my school. There is probably just a hand full of greeks on campus and the rest are usually Theologyy majors. You would mostly find the theolog majors bringing greek into their social lives as a tactic to better their skills. Honestly if it werent for them there would be no knowledge of greek on campus.The greek life could be much better it would add culture and interest to campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Sports at my school is nothing to brag about. The sports that takes place is usually against classifications rather than ""intersec"". I believe that there are alot of students who are passionate about sports and has the talent to go far in life with the right motivation but the school lacks the coaching abilities to push them forward. The number of competitions played in a semester against other schools are very limited. I can honestly say that my school is lacking in the sports departmeent."
College Sophomore,2,"If you are used to the SDA schools, people, church life then this school is all for you, but if you are not then I suggest you don't apply. You will just be miserable your entire time. The school is very expensive to be so small. Most people don't graduate until their 5th year. I met one friend while i was here. The rest are very stuck up. The one thing I did love was the religion aspect. The school really did help me in that department a lot. Also the classes are very easy and the professors will work with you."
College Freshman,2,"There needs to be more seasoning, and variety of food options."
College Sophomore,2,The workout gym we are provided with is smaller than the average classroom.
College Sophomore,2,They working very slow and always have some difficulties to help.
College Sophomore,2,"It's really bad,not variety and not students discounts. Always the same places."
Recent Alumnus,2,"No one of the opposite sex can enter the dorm room of another. They have curfew for all students living on campus and if you live on campus you have to go to a certain amount of worships every week or you will be fined. The dress code is enforced mainly by the professors, some more than others. If you are not in dress code, some places will not service you."
College Freshman,2,I don't know about the parties here at the school all I know is that they respect the campus and have is off campus
College Freshman,2,They aren't a big part of the school.
College Sophomore,2,"Our teams are bad, and my high school had a bigger gym."
College Freshman,2,they dont have public transportation and everything is in the middle of nowhere
College Freshman,2,"there's a lot of boring fast food, and they all close way too early"
College Freshman,2,the weather is always something different and it can be very inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,The strictness on campus is ridiculous. I almost feel like a prisoner in my own dorm
College Freshman,2,My health is fine but a couple of my friends have had things stolen out of their rooms and they haven't gotten any of it back even after reporting it to those in charge. There are cameras and yet nothing has ever been recovered.
College Freshman,2,Too much work but I took too many credits last semester. I should manage the load better this semester with less classes.
College Freshman,2,It is boring. Basketball is the only option.
College Sophomore,2,The drugs are available on campus for those who wants to find it.  More should be done to reduce the availability of drugs on campus
College Sophomore,2,The food options are very limited.  more dinning facilities are needed on campus to offer variety.
College Sophomore,2,The shuttle services need to be increase to support the number of students on campus.  It is not convenient based on the schedule.  this should be address immediately.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the time the weather in Huntsville is very bipolar. Majority of the year the weather is cold and terrible. The only time the sun usually comes out is in the beginning of the year and the ending. Its not always time efficient when you have to walk to class in bad weather.
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do in Huntsville. 
College Junior,2,"As much rules the school has, students still break them. Because you can not monitor them In their rooms 24/7. "
College Junior,2,"Guys are not attractive at all. 

Girls are sometimes too wild"
College Freshman,2,"I have a new dorm that looks very nice but is actually very cheaply built.  All of the other dorm buildings are old and dirty though, except for the one that they are currently remodeling."
College Freshman,2,Thre is no place to hang out with a person of the opposite sex in doors at all.
College Freshman,2,Student life isn't too great.  The opposite sex isn't allowed in dorms and there isn't a place to mingle or hangout in doors other than the cafeteria or the library.
College Freshman,2,"We are in Huntsville, Alabama...at a christian college."
College Freshman,2,The food in the cafeteria is not good. 
College Freshman,2,"We have a tiny gym, a boring mascot, and a bad team."
College Freshman,2,The intramuaral program at oakwood is completely terrible
College Freshman,2,I don't go to parties
College Freshman,2,"It's boring on campus and when it's too cold out, even less people are outside"
College Freshman,2,The quality of the conmputers and wi-fi could be alot better
College Junior,2,"The gym needs to be improved, not many machines to work out on. The facility should be bigger as well, for a school that emphasis physical wellness they sure don't show it."
College Sophomore,2,Because they fine you and tow your car.
College Senior,2,"Campus dining continues to be an issue for my school. The cafeteria quality of food is not the greatest in terms of taste and desirability. The selection, however, is pretty large. That is probably the best feature of the cafeteria. The major problem comes late a night, as campus dining options close pretty early."
College Freshman,2,"I received my grant, but then also had to take out a loan and with the two combined I will no be able to move up to a sophmore in a year."
College Sophomore,2,There are a variety and fast food restaurants.  I haven't been everywhere because I still am fair new to the place.
College Sophomore,2,I usually say the weather is bipolar. One semester there were times it would start out as a beautiful day and out of no were it is raining. But overall it has all four seasons.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't a variety in the choices of food. Some days the cafés food is horrible and others it could be really good. The market use to be a really good place to eat but now with the change it is average.
College Sophomore,2,"The school has been recently renovating most of there facilities, so it makes the campus look more modern and comfortable to be in. But there aren't really any hang out spots officially. Many people would hangout in the lobby of the dorms, outside, or off campus. "
College Senior,2,"A computer shutdown on me and a few other people. But other than this experience, everything else is peachy."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty easy to find a spot in Oakwood University's computer labs, unless its midterm or finals week of course. Most people have their own computers and printers, which isn't completely necessary unless you're a chronic procrastinator and need to write & print a paper at 3am. The university does provide WiFi, but the reliability & speed is pretty bad at times, especially when a lot of students are on at once. For example, the internet crashed during finals week of Spring '13, though somehow, certain social networking sights still worked."
College Senior,2,"The campus is diverse but there a lot judgmental people, you will find that type of attitude any where."
College Senior,2,"CURFEW AT 1 – The school does not condone party life styles. the campus shuts down around 12 and anything after that is technically against the rules. On Sat nights Kids 18 and up chill at house parties frat parties other campuses, clubs and just outside where ever it's alabama so it's hot."
College Junior,2,"They could be very unorganized! Please keep a copy of everything you send to them. Do everything ahead of time, not at the last minute!"
College Sophomore,2,"The finical aid department was a hasel to deal with. Papers are always lost and no one picks up the phone. More importantly students are often being slighted for what they have earned as far as aid and scholarships go. So keep track of what going on your bill, and whats  NOT"
College Sophomore,2,They could do better with the amount of scholarships they offer
Junior,1,"I honestly would not recommend this school. Yes, if you’re seventh day Adventist this is the place for you. This school doesn’t focus on black issues. It has strict regulations like no jewelry, sleeveless shirts (women), no visible tattoos, room checks, curfews, cleanliness check. Etc. if anything it’s ran like a cult more than actual college/university that’s enjoyable. The student body has decreased significantly because of the strict rules & regulations. College should be a place where teens turn and grow into adults and this place treats its students like middle schoolers. It also lacks in opposing opinions meaning they are very stern and dismiss other’s thoughts. I spent one semester here and that was enough to leave off campus. Most students make the decision to live off campus for reasons I just stated. As far as the school itself most of the professors are nice. It’s just staying on campus that makes it miserable & depressing."
College Senior,1,"Athletics are seemingly unimportant at the school, except for basketball. All other sports get little attention. The facilities and equipment need to be seriously updated. Because it is a private institution, there isn't much funding for athletics, and most of it goes towards basketball."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Greek life.
College Freshman,1,I am not involved with the greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,They were not encouraging when it came to aiding students who needed scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,Wade Hall (where I live) is rat and roach infested!
College Sophomore,1,Alabama is not the best place to attend school at all.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life. It is a religious university.
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't know too much about the Greek life on campus. I know they have a few but it's not like the typical ones like the AKA's or Alpha's.
Recent Alumnus,1,The school does not allow parties to go on on the campus but many students do go to off campus parties.
College Student,1,This school is highly unorganized when it comes to student services. The process for many things pertaining to finance is a headache.
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly speaking, I dislike the weather in Huntsville, Alabama. It's sad to say a student can experience all four seasons in one day but it's true."
College Freshman,1,My favorite experience at school has been when I was off campus with my sister and we went to a hockey game in Nashville. I don't like the campus the dorm rules are ridiculous. I feel like I'm in High School all over again. While I may be black and attend an HBCU I feel out of place because I don't fulfill the stereotype. Everybody is generally friendly I guess but if you're not doing what everybody else does then you are irrelevant and I don't feel like being here any longer than I have to.
College Freshman,1,"Student center is rarely helpful, campus events never happen, students are in their own group of friends, and the athletic centers are poor."
College Freshman,1,Facilities are outdated outside of my new dorm and the campus is small and spread out away from the dorms. Social scene is average. Campus life is boring and food at night is never available
College Sophomore,1,"Oakwood University is an Seventh-day Adventist school, so there is no greek life supported on or off campus. The greeks who are on campus are hidden and are considered to be fake, because they are not the real deal."
College Junior,1,Huntsville really has no attraction. 
College Junior,1,The school has a curfew for the students. The Café food is horrible!
College Freshman,1,Not that many options whatsoever
College Freshman,1,there are no greeks on campus
College Freshman,1,"I hate the food on campus, not acceptable what so ever"
College Sophomore,1,The weather is very haphazard.
College Senior,1,"This school is extremely strict with a lot of things. For partying and drinking and everything you just need to plan to be off campus or keep things to yourself. For dress code, curfew, worships, ect. the list goes on and on they fine you. So unless you want to loose hundreds of dollars stick to the code."
College Senior,1,Huntsville does not have a good public transportation system. There are shuttles that take students to the store daily at specified times.  Also for campus transportation there are several places included on the route the bus driver doesn't go to without you knowing in advance you'll need him. No consistency so you end up just walking or investing in a car.
College Sophomore,1,Night Life is non existent because we all have a curfew
College Junior,1,"They are extremely strict, the campus is drug and alcohol free. If found with such items you will get removed from school."
College Junior,1,"The school does not help find off campus housing at all, they try to make as many people live on campus as possible."
College Sophomore,1,The night life absolutely sucks. What night life? The school has a 12:00 curfew for freshmen and 1:00 curfew for all upperclassmen. Only on the weekend is there stuff to do and that's off campus.
College Freshman,1,"Dealing with financial aid can be a nightmare! Make copies of EVERYTHING! SAVE EMAILS! Make sure you have proof of every scholarship, loan, or discount."
College Student,1,"The school is a completely dry, tobacco free, and no loud music campus. Although many students take the festivities of campus on campus their is nothing to do."
College Junior,1,"The food is nasty, the wifi is slow,and  the cost to stay on campus is over priced."
College Freshman,1,There are barely any scholarships given! And they always lose papers so it's hard to keep on track with the ones you already have!
College Senior,1,"Oakwood is a christian school that prides it self in it's advent values, this includes no partying for students."
College Freshman,1,receiving financial aid was a challenge. considering the fact that my school is a private school and is requires more money than a community college or a public college/university. I ended up receiving the maximum amount i guess. but still wasn't nearly enough.I ended up getting enough by taking out loans and from the help of others.
College Sophomore,1,"Little Help – Upon arrival, it's nearly mandatory that you already know someone. While most people are friendly, a lot of people still seem to go out of their way to get a laugh. Staff does their job well, but can't cover everything. A lot of times, schedules conflict and have harsh consequences."
College Sophomore,1,Oakwood has a 1am Curfew for all students and a weekend leve must be put in before leaving on weekends
College Junior,1,"The teachers and the campus police are strict on the students if he/she is late to class which affect  the other students who made to class on time to get discipline. During those times there are some fighting on campus, offenders outside the campus ground, and drugs that take place on campus."
College Junior,1,"Not Many – Of all the issues that Oakwood has it would have to be obtaining scholarships. Oakwood offers  a few scholarships-more towards the upperclassmen-, but the chances of a student actually being rewarded them at all-or at the very least on time- is not likely. Just last year Oakwood started an online program where you could check and get updates on upcoming scholarships, but they never stayed up to par with it. Most of the time, when they would actually place upcoming scholarships on the site, the deadline would be the so close that it seemed useless to even apply."
College Junior,1,Punishments Are Very Harsh – Public safety is very strict when it comes to drinking on campus and drug use. You do either of these two and you will be definite danger of being kicked out of the school.
College Freshman,1,The Computer Lab – the computer labs in the CAS department needs work and also in student accounts
College Freshman,1,Admissions Process – Admissions process is below average. There is nothing to stress over at all.
College Junior,1,"Registration Proces – The registration process at Oakwood University is grueling to say the least. One can spend up to six hours in line and still get nowhere. The registration staff tends to run circles around each other. However, this year I have noticed some improvement over the summer. For instance, I asked for two changes on my bill, and it was accomplished within five days (wknd days included. I hope this will be a world of difference this year."
College Senior,1,Well the Financial Aid office is known for messing people up. They lose papers and sometimes have you going in circles.
College Senior,1,"Popular Study Areas – My school offers a variety of study areas; however, it mainly promotes the areas of Biology, Music, and Education. All other areas do not receive as much attention."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Worth It – I dont smoke, drink, party or club. However since this school is located in Huntsville Alabama I really dont believe that there are a lot of cool places to do that here."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid has been a constant struggle and still is one. It is so difficult to get get anyone from my school to assist me. Right now I am suppose to be in school finishing off my second semester but I can't because of financial aid. It's not possible for me to get a private loan because I don't work and my parents have bad credit, so we can't get approved. FAFSA is the only reason I was able to complete my first semester. It looks like I will have to take off a semester to find some type financial aid to finish school."
College Freshman,1,"The buses of Oakwood University have a schedule. The buses come only two times a week, which are Wednesday and Friday. They usually come in the afternoon when most students have class. If you miss the bus then your out of luck. So a lot of the non-driving student are stuck on campus. The bus only makes two stops, which is to the local Walmart or the Mall. On Friday you have to pay two dollars to take the bus. A lot of the students have complained about the bus schedule but no changes have been made."
College Sophomore,1,Stressful and an on-Going Process – The Financial Aid process was long lasting and is still going on for me as a student. My mother has been taking care of it and it's been stressful for her.
College Sophomore,1,"Oakwood University is Prodominantly African American in just about every way, shape or Form. However there are a few students who come in and break the racial trend. Even then they are comfortable and we accept them cause this is a Christian Campus. Along with the prodominance of African American students,we are also Seventh Day Adventists. There are many more religions on Campus however the practiced religion is Seventh Day Adventism."
Recent Alumnus,1,Freshamn Girls Dorm Needs Work! Living on campus as a freshman female is very difficult. There are bugs that crawl around. The bathrooms are disgusting. there ar numerous problems the dorm has face already during the first semester such as problems with AC and heat. The fire alarm constantly goes off especially when u are doing hair. The dorm needs to be updated.
College Sophomore,1,"Facilities are very rude in admissions, those foreigners need to learn some manors! STOP HANGING UP ON PEOPLE YOU EFIN JERKS! "
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Strickness – They are just so weird with trying to control people. This school may be Christian, but they are actually the devil. They want your money! you can't stay off campus, which would be cheaper, but due to the upcoming ban on staying off campus, you are force to stay on campus until age 22 or 24...CRAZY"
College Junior,1,"Veggie-Frats on Campus? On a regular campus, a fraternity or sorority is the cool thing to do. They are known as family for life, togetherness, etc. Coming from Oakwood University, a Seventh Day Adventist Christian college, they are very frowned upon. People try to do it and sneak it in anyway, but they have been threatened with expulsion and fines. The majority of the other students on campus ridicule them, and claim they want no parts with it, because they aren't real sororities/frats to them."
College Sophomore,1,Slow Network – The wireless network at Oakwood is unreliable.  The connection can just go out at the blink of an eye and can get really unbearably slow.  Most of the time its a hassle trying to submit assignments over the internet because of the slow connection.
College Student,1,"Caf=BLEH, Market= Good but Expensive – Oakwood University  has a bunch of good facilities but it doesn't include the cafeteria. I have heard of schools with cafeterias that are on point, but never put Oakwood on that list. The cafe isn't diverse. Everything is either leftovers or something that was served the day before last. They barely give takeout. The food just plainly tastes horrible. The market is the only place that serves good food, but everything in there is expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"Registration Process – I came to Oakwood University and the registration process was horrific. There would be long, endless lines with rude adminstrators having worldly attitudes. Now that registration is done online, there are no longer long lines. The registration process is still terrible. For example, if a student can't financially clear for school, the financial aid staff really doesn't care about those students."
College Junior,1,Not a Real Factor – The Oakwood University handbook states that Greek organizations are not permitted without approval of the school. There are few organizations on this campus. They are pretty much seen as those who are trying hard to fit in and be wanted.
College Freshman,1,Since my time here i really haven't noticed any real popularity of the sports at all.
College Freshman,1,"The facilities at Oakwood University are okay but not the best. We have teachers that are outside of the U.S. I have nothing against them, it's just that I can't understand what they say to the class. But I believe that im not the only one."
College Freshman,1,"The Food Is Horrific. The food service needs to be much better. The employees are very rude and they act as if we owe them something. The food is always over cooked, and there is no real variety in meal selection."

Alum,5,I took one class online and it was well organized and informational. This class tested in person and was self led.
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere at Butler is inspiring and students are encouraged to step outside of their current boundaries.
Senior,5,"Butler is the perfect size, where there are always new people to meet but the community isn't overwhelmingly large. There are activities and clubs for all different interests and most of the professors actually care for their students' learning."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful! The professors are very engaging and are very interested in the subjects they teach. The dorms are amazing!
Freshman,5,"Butler University offers many services, clubs, and activities for students. The staff are always open to academic help and also personal advice if approached with it."
Freshman,5,"Butler is a great overall place to get an education. It has a small campus feel, but it is located just 15 minutes from downtown Indianapolis. Professors there are top-notch and truly care about their students' education. It also provides the opportunity to get to know just about every student on campus. Not to mention that the basketball team is competitive annually in the NCAA."
Senior,5,Small school with a big school feeling. Everyone is extremely nice. It gives the advanatages of a school in a big city. It's a tightly knitted community. The professors care for you and will make sure you are suceeding.
Alum,5,"Great school. Campus is beautiful. Academics are strong, especially in the college of business.  New buildings are regularly being put up around campus (very impressive facilities)"
Sophomore,5,Butler University has fantastic resources for students to get involved in and outside of their communities. Butler University attempts to bring awareness of the oppressive struggles of people all around the world and encourages students to get involved and spread the word. The faculty encourages students to participate in extracurricular activities in and outside of campus.
Graduate Student,5,Butler is a great school with amazing faculty who care about their student's success. The Indianapolis and surrounding area is a lot of fun and there are a lot of things to do and the cost of living is ver affordable!
Freshman,5,Butler has a very beautiful campus that is welcoming and inviting. Its curriculum and professors allows the students to excel in each and every subject. All of the faculty and staff but the students first so that we may excel.
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience has been absolutely amazing. The community of students is amazing. Everyone I very welcoming and campus feels just like home. I actually never want to go home and visit family because I love my life here."
Freshman,5,"First year and I give it a 9.5 so far.  The campus is beautiful -  not too big, not too small.  The new residence halls and the new Lacy School of Business are top notch.  The food service is new and doing an amazing job overall - they have taken the time to get feedback about gluten free choices from me as I have Celiac diseases.  Outstanding school that really cares about the individual students."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman to Butler University, I have been very pleased so far with the registration and orientation process, and I am really looking forward to starting classes at the end of this month. All of the professors and administrators that I have had the chance to meet have been so welcoming and helpful throughout the entire process. Butler has a beautiful campus and it is in a prime location, just north of downtown Indianapolis, making it great for job and internship opportunities. Every current student that I have talked to has made it clear that they feel very safe on campus and enjoy the abundance of extracurricular activities that are offered. I am so excited to be a Butler Bulldog."
Sophomore,5,"The professors' goals are to help students succeed and guide them to learn. Everyone on campus, from staff to students, makes anyone feel welcomed at Butler during their visit. Butler offers so many different clubs, organizations, and events for students to truly be involved and get to know their peers. Overall, Butler University is a great school to attend."
Freshman,5,I'm an incoming freshman and I'm really excited to start school in the fall! I've wanted to attend this school for as long as I can remember and the staff made me feel so welcome once I got accepted. I really like how close everything is on campus but it's located in a large city and you can get away from campus if you need to.
Junior,5,"The academics at Butler University are challenging, however the small classroom size and availability of resources allows for great learning. The business school pairs you with a career mentor and is one of the only schools in the nation that requires two internships prior to graduation. The location of the school near downtown Indianapolis is excellent and the programs at Butler are ranked one of the highest. Butler was ranked #1 Small Midwest colleges."
Freshman,5,Butler is a beautiful campus and I love the small school feeling even though I was nervous at first. They truly do have nice and helpful professors that care about you. Everyone is very friendly and helpful around.
Niche User,5,"Butler is an amazing school that gives all its students the best programs, opportunities to be involved on campus, and many study abroad chances. They are very friendly and helpful in figuring out financial aid, paying for college, programs to go into, and more. Indianapolis is also an amazing city! Lots of opportunities for work too!"
Freshman,5,"The first experience I had with Butler was absolutely amazing. I had gone to several other college visits before Butler but instantly fell in love with the community and campus life. I love the class size aspect of Butler because I have a personal relationship with my professors and whenever I am unable to make it to class or missed a test, I can immediately make it up the next day and go in during their office hours. 
The people I met on the first day of classes and throughout the school year have become some of my best friends. My favorite part of campus is when it starts to get warmer outside and everyone is hanging out in the central part of campus studying outside, having picnics, and laying out in their hammocks. At Butler, we have so many ways to get involved no matter what your interests are and I find that so unique. Our campus is very easy to get around and most individuals are very friendly and outgoing."
Freshman,5,I really liked the campus and the environment at Butler University. Everyone there was so nice and caring.
Niche User,5,Amazing school with incredible people and endless opportunities. You'll make priceless connections and the location cannot be beat. School spirit is amazing and the students and faculty all have a sense of pride in being a Bulldog.
Freshman,5,"I love Butler! They just built the new dorm Irvington which I live in as a freshman which is extremely nice and often compared to a high end hotel. Everyone I've met here has been so incredibly friendly, everyone holds doors open and smiles to you. My experience here has been nothing but positive, I love my professors and have already made close connections with the people in my classes through the small class size that allows for in-depth discussions. I love everything here and couldn't have asked for a better university!"
Niche User,5,Butler just opened a brand new freshman housing building that is truly amazing! My favorite thing about Butler is their amazing student life as well as the fact that there are no TA's. Students interact with their professors.
Freshman,5,"I'm a first-year here at Butler and so far it's been an amazing experience. I've thoroughly enjoyed all my classes so far and the people I've met have been fantastic. We are the largest class in university history with 1,300 new students and I only expect that number to increase in foreseeable future. I live in Irvington House, the newest dorm on campus that opened this year. Other freshman residence halls on campus (ResCo and Ross Hall) don't even compare to this place which could be a disappointment for some, so my advice for future freshman would be to apply for housing as early as possible.  Also your only real option for meal plan dining is Atherton Union dining hall and that can get boring sometimes, but I don't really mind it too much. Overall I would definitely recommend coming here if you can afford it and I look for forward to spending my next four years as a Butler Bulldog."
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere, the beautiful campus, and the great schooling opportunities the college offers."
Sophomore,5,"When I visited Butler only 3 years ago, I immediately knew this was where I was meant to be. I stepped on campus and felt like Butler was my home and every day since my first year that has proven to be true. All the professors I have come in contact with have been super helpful and does everything in their power to make sure each and everyone of their students is succeeding. There is plenty of campus organizations  for everyone and Student Government provides a lot of on campus activities free to us most of the time. If there was one thing I could change, it would be the quality of the food in the dinning halls. This is something the dinning hall staff is continuously working on but there is still flaws in it for those with allergies such as lactose intolerant and gluten free. Other than that, I have been very pleased with Butler and proud to be a bulldog."
Niche User,5,"It felt just like home! This campus gave me a great experience and I can't wait to go there next year! I love the friendly vibe I got touring the campus, and I can't wait to be a part of the Butler spirit!"
Junior,5,"Great school and a great education. Many opportunities will come from Butler. Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive. You will have plenty of loans unless you're parents have a lot of money or get help from FASFA. It is a great univeristy and you will have a great time. The question that you should be asking though is ""Is it worth it?"""
Alum,5,"While a little on the pricey side, Butler has been the perfect college for me. A small school of about 4,000 undergrads made it the perfect size so that it didn't feel like I was still in high school, but I would recognize people all over campus. Go here if you want a strong sense of school pride, want to be close to an urban environment, and just want an all around great college experience."
Niche User,5,"Butler University is great due to a wide array of reasons. The professors are personable and willing to help you in your respectable career field; they have great connections for internships. The campus is a great size, the university campus area is essentially its own little bubble. The location of Butler is also great because it's ten minutes away from downtown Indianapolis. I have no regrets and am extremely glad that I chose Butler to be my home for the next four years."
Senior,5,"Great school, academically challenging. Professors push you to be the best you can be and challenge you to think critically with a wide variety of unique coursework. Great campus as well. Professors always have time to help you during office hours and small classes make it easy to build a relationship with your professors."
Niche User,5,"When I toured Butler University, I was quick to notice the beautiful and extensive campus as well as the academic excellence that seemed to surround Butler. There are many major options and not to mention the numerous available activities."
Alum,5,"To be completely honest, I have never had the greatest experience with school until I attended Butler University. From quality of living and food, to safety and community, Butler satisfied everything There were so many opportunities academically, socially, and culturally. The faculty were kind and understanding, the teachers were phenomenal, the dormitories and the entire campus was kept clean every day. There are numerous resources to help students and the opportunities from being within Indianapolis made it all the better."
Graduate Student,5,I love Butler University. The courses cater toward current social/political issues and have challenged me in growing in awareness of personal biases. It has assured me that the path I am taking in serving others will be a vital part of improving my community and those who are effected by it.
Junior,5,I am a junior at Butler University and feel that the campus of care Butler promotes has made my three years here feel like home. Indianapolis is a great city to build connections and develop my professional career.
Senior,5,"This is my first year on campus and it has been excellent. Butler has been very accommodating and has went far out of their way to see me succeed. The teachers truly care about their students and want to see them excel in every course they take. It has been a truly enjoyable experience and has made me feel right at home. The campus is gorgeous and there are plenty of study places, including plenty of 24 hour study places as well. There are tons of food options as well. Overall, I do not have any complaints so far with this campus."
Freshman,5,I am currently a first year student at Butler and I am enjoying my time. The academics here are fantastic and I get so much help from faculty due to the 12: 1 student to faculty ratio. The campus is great and there are a lot of extra curricular activities offered. The private college really gives a lot of benefits and allows me to take more time and space.
Freshman,5,Butler University is a great place to be. There is so much support and opportunities here! The professors are amazing and the people are all so nice.
Freshman,5,I enjoy being on the Butler University campus and feel that it is a safe environment for its students. The students and professors are very welcoming and radiate love and joy for their campus.
Freshman,5,I think Butler is a great school to attend. The professors care deeply about their students and seeing them succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I started at Butler last year and I loved it right away! You get to know a lot of people on campus since it's smaller. You also get to know your professors very well, which is super helpful. The social scene is perfect at butler and I have made the best of friends here. I love all of my classes and professors so far. I'm about to start my sophomore year and I can't wait."
Sophomore,5,"I will be a sophomore in the fall of 2017 and I would say Butler has treated me well. Education wise, I believe Butler is preparing me for medical school. For one, the courses are quite rigorous. However, the professors are great at what they do. They teach the material well and are open to meet up if you aren't quite understanding something. The core curriculum shapes students into well rounded individuals. Requirements include the study of a foreign language, taking an analytical course, a speech course, and writing course. The people are welcoming and helpful. The Learning Resource Center has a variety of resources including Exploratory Studies advisers for those who aren't quite sure what they want to major in. They also provide information on tutors and study tables you can visit when in need of help in a class. Some things about the campus could be changed such as the little amount of parking and more lighting around campus especially around the Mall"
Alum,5,"Choosing to go to Butler was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (""The Butler Way""). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding. The BU degree is only becoming more valuable!"
Sophomore,5,I just finished up my first year at college and it has truly been a perfect fit. It has already allowed me to grow and challenge me in ways that I am grateful for. I have made lifelong friends and have had the opportunity to get involved in amazing events the schools puts on. The community of care is real at Butler University.
Alum,5,"My experience at Butler University was indescribable. Butler is a small university, with a big school connection. Having attended Butler for 4 years, the liberal arts education has provided me with a sense of preparedness if my field of interest. I took an interdisciplinary social science major that allowed me to explore different facets of the field. My workload consisted of public health classes, pharmacy elective, psychology and environmental classes. Butler provides a sense of togetherness. Because it is a small university, the one-to-one interaction with professors and administration made my experience more personal. I was more of a name, rather than a number. With a small university, networking  with faculty and staff was easy to do. Networking is crucial in order to become successful in one's future professional career. Professors worked around the student's schedule rather the other way around. This speaks volume as the care and effort  the university has in students."
Freshman,5,"Simply a fantastic place to go attend college. The community is friendly, and the faculty are there to help you succeed and grow as an individual. It's the Butler Way!"
Sophomore,5,"I was on the border about going to Butler, but now I am so happy I did. The professors are here to help students, campus life is great, and the people are awesome if you are willing to give them a chance. Butler's campus is beautiful and feels like home, and the health and recreation complex is really great to work out at. There is much to do on campus even if you are not involved in Greek life."
Senior,5,It is a great school with great academics and even better basketball. The campus is small yet still feels like you aren't crowded. Everyone is friendly and the greek life is amazing
Freshman,5,"My experience at Butler has been nothing less than phenomenal.  With going away for the first time, from a small town, my academic advisor saw my sadness. He emailed me and had me come to his office on several occasions during the first couple weeks. His words, ""Chelsea, you are not going home."" He was my second dad, mentor and an actual professor my first semester.  I am forever grateful to him!  I majoring in Sports Media and have already made huge strides in my field. The professors and athletic department are so welcoming and accommodating to their students! I now know what they mean when you hear, ""The Butler Way!"" Everything is absolutely top notch here at this incredible institution!"
Freshman,5,A college that offers the whole college experience. A gorgeous campus surrounded by a safe community. A visit to Butler is unlike the rest.
Freshman,5,"Butler has a wonderful over-all feel to it. You feel at home the second you walk on campus. The professors are great and actually care that you do well. Opportunity is everywhere if you're not lazy. Take advantage of your surroundings (Indy),  there's plenty to do! I love this school, Go Dawgs!"
Sophomore,5,"Butler is a small campus, with a large sense of community, and the big school sports and academics. The professors truly care about you and your education, and the opportunities are endless. "
Freshman,5,"I love Butler so much. I cannot imagine going to any other school. The one thing I do not like is the way the housing is headed. They are tearing down Ross and Schwitzer, so freshmen live in apartment or suite style dorms. There is no sense of community in ResCo or Fairview and Butler is making a huge mistake by eliminating Ross and Schwitzer."
Niche User,5,My experience was fun and very sensational met a lot of smart beautiful people on the quad didn't have a visit just was an open visit to myself I the campus was so amazing and I instantly fell in love with it. Reason why is because it was my first and only college I ever wanted to see grew up around Bulldogs so might as well try to become one
College Sophomore,5,I love Butler! I can't imagine myself anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,There are tons of career fairs and recruiters coming in from businesses in the Indy and Chicago areas. We have a very high placement rate.
College Sophomore,5,I love Butler! I'm so glad I chose  to go here.
College Sophomore,5,I believe I have a lot of different opportunities to have a job and an internship in my chosen field.
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy this school and all of the professors and administrators involved.
Alum,4,"Online learning is tough. I did a couple online classes Pre-Covid so communication was probably less active than it is now. I used the old website Moodle, worked great, the current one is outstanding and very easy to use."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19, many of my classes are online or hybrid this semester. Professors are great at accommodating students and I feel like I get a pretty great education through the online platform."
Freshman,4,Butler University is a very great school. The education you get here is amazing and the faculty is full of wonderful people.
Alum,4,Butler has a lot of great professors who take the time to get to know you. There are a lot of opportunities but you have to take advantage of them.
Sophomore,4,Due to the corona virus my classes were moved online and the experience went over well. Many of my professors took a couple weeks to adjust but quickly learned to run the class smoothly.
Sophomore,4,All of my professors were accommodating to the sudden shift to having online courses and provided an ample amount of opportunities to ask them questions via their emails or by zoom sessions.
Sophomore,4,"Butler has the best school spirit and campus environment. Everyone is willing to help each other out, no matter the circumstances. The professors are readily available and easy to connect to."
Senior,4,"Butler University cares about their students wellbeing- mentally and physically. Butler has a cute mascot, the best basketball team, and several enlightening courses available to its students. Butler’s campus has been changing over the past few years to accommodate its students needs."
Freshman,4,"There are so many great things about Butler University, including the academics and professors. The professors genuinely care about you, and go out of their way to make sure that you understand the material. In addition, the small class sizes make it easier to interact with your professors, and provide a great learning environment."
Niche User,4,"I love the facilities, study abroad opportunities, and the teachers I've gotten to interact with. I like the fact that it is smaller and seems incredibly dedicated to student activity and involvement."
Niche User,4,"Butler U is a small school with lots to offer. the campus is gorgeous and easy to navigate from dorms to classes to the libraries. Also, the students are very nice, easy-going and always willing to answer questions. The only downfall is the tuition price, but it was expected from a private institution."
Freshman,4,I have only been at Butler for a couple months but I have loved every second of it- even the hard times. Butler does an amazing job of surrounding their freshman with the resources to allow them to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I have only spent one year here and similarly to most college first-years, I had my fair share of ups and downs. The small, tight-knit community is very welcoming. However, the University heavily promotes diversity and I was disappointed to see how diverse it really is."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a great first year at Butler University. I was extremely impressed with the amenities provided to us, including free food all of the time and brand new dorms. Campus life made it rather difficult for me to find friends in the beginning of freshman year due to the lack of social events available to meet new people in my class. It is such a small school that you can recognize everyone's face, which is a rather comforting feeling. There has never been an issue with safety. My teachers have all been extremely helpful, even out of the classroom. Unfortunately, the cost of going to this school continues to rise, and it is very disappointing how few scholarships they offer to students. Besides that, Butler is an amazing school where you never feel alone, and I feel prepared for whatever I choose to do in my future."
Senior,4,"The best part of Butler is the LAS and LSB professors. I enjoy my classes and have learned so much, which is why I'm here! But socially, I wish there was more going on outside of greek life. Also not very diverse which is too bad."
Sophomore,4,"Butler is a great school. I love what I am majoring in, and I love the professors who are teaching me. I think the classes I am taking in the business school are very hands-on, and I wouldn't trade them for anything else. It's exciting to think that I will be in a new business building in a very short time. I also think that the students I have met and made relationships with will be friends that I would have for life. I don't love the fact that there has been a tuition increase, but I am hoping that Butler proves to be worth it. I also think that regarding living on campus and living situations, Butler needs to learn to listen to their students a little more."
Junior,4,Butler has plenty of professors that truly care about their students. The people here are extremely nice and everyone always has a smile on their face. Plenty of great majors to choose from as well.
Sophomore,4,"There was a lot to like about Butler.  I started as a Journalism major, but found my way into becoming an English major during the first semester.  This was an easy switch as I had lots of guidance and assistance from staff members to allow me to join the new major.  All professors are lovely and really do get to know their students, which only made me feel more comfortable when it came to asking questions about a class I was in."
Junior,4,"Butler is a very fun place to go. Greek life is fun, students are fun, and staff always goes the extra mile to help."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Butler University. The department that I was a part of was a tight-knit community of professors and students that supported each other through everything, from graduate school applications to writing papers and manuscripts. The professors are what make Butler a special place - the university would not be the same place without them."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience so far at Butler. The faculty and staff are very caring, considerate, and good at their jobs. It’s a good sized school in which it’s not too small or too big and there’s a lot they offer from majors to activities to internships."
Freshman,4,"I love it here at Butler. I am very far away from home, however, I feel at home with everyone and the environment here at Butler."
Freshman,4,"I love Butler University because it's a campus where others care about you. Strangers will hold the door for me and I'll often return the favor, not only is this a great way to foster a community that cares but it's also a hugely positive start to my day. While this is only one example, Butler truly does foster a community of support and has been doing so since my first day on campus. This mutual affection is really nice, though I also wish more diverse voices were given attention on campus. While Butler is encouraging diversity I'd love to see the University make more of push because a community that cares should care about all the voices on campus."
Freshman,4,Butler University is an outstanding institution!  Everyone is so friendly and I always feel like I'm in a welcoming and accepting environment.  The campus is beautiful and I love the city of Indianapolis.
Freshman,4,Classes and Professors are great. Food and many of the food staff are not. There are a lot of services available to you as a student that are not made very clear. Find and make use of these.
Sophomore,4,Butler is a good school. You get the most of what you put into it. I would like to see a strong diverse presence on campus and improve the safety of the campus life.
Freshman,4,There's a real community of C.A.R.E at Butler. People are very accepting and inclusive of everyone. Everyone wants to succeed but still knows how to have fun.
Junior,4,"I love Butler! The campus is beautiful and the classes are small, so you really get to know other students and professors.  The professors are also very helpful when it comes to course work.  We have our own police station that only works for the campus, not the city.  We have a high ropes course and other activities that different organizations put on such as cookies and canvas and philanthropy events put on by the social Greek houses.  Having access to the canal and downtown is also a very nice perk.  There is a lot of construction and updates being made as part of the ""2020 Vision"" so tuition has increased, which is the only downfall."
Sophomore,4,"Butler is located in the Rocky Ripple neighborhood of Indianapolis, meaning that it is surrounded by rich people who want to be served, and big houses that need to be cleaned, so there's always an abundance of internship possibilities."
Junior,4,"I'n proud of this college. It is a pretty high price tag, but there are several opportunities for aid or on campus employment. It has felt like home since the first day I walked across the campus, and I'm proud of my friends and the legacy I will leave behind."
Sophomore,4,"Butler is a great school academically! I've never had a professor that wasn't invested in their students success. Excellence is the standard here. I only wish there was more diversity. As a person of color, constantly being surrounded by people that don't look like you and haven't been through the same struggles as you can be mentally draining and lonely."
Freshman,4,"The things that I like about Butler University, is that there is something for everybody to get involved in no matter your interest. I also think that Butler University does a good job of challenging us academically. The thing that I wish Butler would do better at is making sure that the professors that they hire are passionate about teaching and are continuing to learn how to become a better professor. I feel that some of the professors at Butler University give off a vibe that they do not want to be here. Another thing is that the food in the dining halls at Butler is not up to standards. The students that are attending are paying a lot to go to Butler, but especially for the dining halls. The quality and variety of food should match the price that the students have to pay for it. Finally, Butler does do a nice job keeping the campus looking gorgeous. They are always making sure that the grass is cut, flowers and mulch look good, and our fountains are clean."
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience thus far at Butler University. I have always felt welcomed and supported on this campus even before I was an actual admitted student. The atmosphere of the campus is very homey and inviting. In addition, Butler is very close to downtown Indianapolis and a variety of other attractions that bring tourists to Indiana's capital. I would highly recommend applying to this fantastic school because it has taught me so much already, and I am undoubtedly confident that I continue to grow each and every day because of the love and support I have received from the students, faculty, and alumni."
Sophomore,4,"It is not too small, not too big school. The weather sometimes gets crazy, but other than that I enjoy going here. You can definitely create personal relationship with professors if wanted. They will know your name and face by the end of the week of class."
Junior,4,"I have absolutely loved my time here at Butler. The professors, for the most part, really do care about your education. Being in small classes really helped my learning."
Sophomore,4,I am a current student at Butler University. In the past two years they have built two new dorms along with a new parking garage and are currently building another academic building. The school works hard to accommodate to students and the athletics are very competitive and entertaining. The Butler family is very welcoming here!
Freshman,4,The school is very small which I didn't know I liked.  The teachers care a lot about your learning as well
Freshman,4,Butler University wants to make you feel welcomed on their campus and wants you to succeed. The staff members are always available for help. Butler's campus is growing with a new business school and freshman dormitory underway. I am excited about these additions.
Niche User,4,Butler University is a beautiful campus with lots of student life. They also offer great academics and sports programs.
Freshman,4,"The three B's of Butler are Business, Basketball and Ballet. Those put Butler on the map. As a dance major, I can vouch for the Ballet training."
Freshman,4,Butler is a small but active campus full of friendly people. Professors are willing to work with students to ensure students are successful and classes are challenging but not too difficult.The party scene is decent but new administration on the police force is causing it it to die quite quickly.
Freshman,4,I'm still attending here but the teachers are great and understanding. They love to talk and get to know you. They work with the class at a pace that works for everyone.
Sophomore,4,The small community is the best aspect of Butler. Your professors all know who you are and will be as committed to your success as you are.
Freshman,4,"I have only finished my first year at Butler, but it has been the best first year I could have ever experienced.   I was able to interact with countless people and built relationships along the way.  The classes were designed to have personal professor to student relationships.  The only thing that I would like is that it had more diversity and have more people of color on campus."
Freshman,4,Butler University is a great university to attend for academic purposes. I have attended Butler for a year and have enjoyed my academic and social experiences at this university.
Freshman,4,I love Butler. It is such a great place and I cannot say enough nice things about it. It is mostly rich white kids that come here but that is due to the lack of financial aid that they are able to give.
Junior,4,Butler seems to be focused more on prospective students and families rather than the ones that are currently attending. Tuition has increased and students here are paying for amenities for future classes that we will most likely never see. The professors are wonderful and dedicated. Having struggled with mental illness I have had great professors who have worked with me to help me be successful.
Junior,4,"Butler is a community. Bulldogs stick together and I don't feel like I am fully removed from anyone else. We support each other and treat each other with respect. I like this feeling. Campus is small yet open and gives a very comfortable atmosphere for learning and expression. 
The one thing I wish that Butler did better was seek student input on large decisions."
Sophomore,4,"There is an overall ""snooty"" atmosphere here at Butler sometimes, and most people come from those types of rich families. Although the teachers are great, sometimes the students are questionable. "
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my overall experience with Butler. The dorms were nice, the food was delicious, and everyone there was very friendly. I would highly recommend this school for anyone looking for a small Indiana school."
College Sophomore,4,It could be improved on. Sexual assault is a problem on many campuses and Butler is no exception.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people are greek. It's a big part of campus
College Sophomore,4,People drink because of all the stress. It is a good get away. Most know their limits. Drugs are used but not in my circle.
College Sophomore,4,I think a degree from Butler is a great choice and has a high reputation. Alumni look out for recent graduates and the career services are there to help. Butler prepares you for the future.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small so that is awesome. Courses are tough and require a lot of work but that is everywhere.
College Sophomore,4,BUPD is awesome. I have never felt unsafe while on campus.
College Sophomore,4,There is a certain level of the freshman experience that is attributed to dorm life. Ross Hall was a class case of yes it is a building and yes it has everything a freshman dorm would have. Personally I never thought it was gross or dirty but others thought so. It was clean. Old but clean. The Ross experience is something everyone should go through. #RossLove
College Sophomore,4,Basketball is a great part of campus life. People always go to the games and it is a great part of being a student. Other sports are fun to attend such a nice spring baseball game or homecoming football game. Sports are a great time and it is great to get away from straight academics.
College Sophomore,4,I love Butler. It is a really great school. It does have a lot benefits but I find it hard to believe that it should cost that much. I understand it was my choice to go there but it is quite pricey.
College Senior,4,Many internships available.  You must do them which is good.  Other campuses recruit from the Butler student body.
Freshman,2,"I do not like Butler. The only thing keeping me at the school is the study abroad program and the business school. This school is clique and exclusive. No diversity (primarily white rich kids). It reminds me a lot of high school. Granted I am a second semester freshman so I still have not had the full experience. However, I thought only the first semester would be challenging in making friends and meeting people."
Freshman,2,"The students were generally pretentious and conceited; the facilities were lackluster and subpar; the food was repeated every morning, afternoon, and evening. The silver lining is the teachers: Butler had some outstanding teachers."
Alum,2,"-STEM education is severely lacking in career prep
-Advising is extremely poor - all are professors that don't have good advice or guidance to help students who are unsure of direction 
-Administration is terrible. The Butler that I was admitted to and the Butler that exists now are in direct opposition. Their original value set was very student-oriented and now students are literally the university's last priority.
-Financial aid program: riddled with inconsistencies and lies. Tell different people different information on the ""maximum amount"" one can receive in combined academic and financial aid.
-Student culture and the Butler community: if you do not fit into the stereotypical white and upperclass community or are in any way ""alternative"", you will be miserable. Greek life completely dominates campus. That said, if that's something you're looking for, you will likely be very happy here. 

+ Professors are great and genuinely care about the students."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life affects almost every aspect of campus life.
College Student,2,I am certain that the education Im receiving is excellent. My professors know me by name. Most are approachable and caring. Visiting professors during office hours not only gave me a chance to know my professors but also shows me their willingness to help you succeed in the class if you give your best.
College Freshman,2,i would not go here if i had to do it again. put unnecessary strain on my family for a mediocre education
College Freshman,2,"should have went somewhere else, not worth the price"
College Freshman,2,"have a specific brand they try to upkeep and if you do not fit their mold, they will force you out of the school"
College Freshman,2,"rundown houses, distracts from studies"
College Freshman,2,"Not nutritious, poor quality, few options"
College Freshman,2,"Buildings flood, wallpaper peeling off, no AC"
College Freshman,2,We are required to live in Ross hall as freshmen and this place is old.  The community bathrooms always have a toilet or a sink that are broken.  The only microwave is in the lobby and we aren't allowed to have any appliances in our room.
College Sophomore,2,The school and Police have changed a lot the school used to feel like it was helping to create a safe envirement where students could learn to control themselves and have some fun but now it's overly strict. The officers all act kinda nice until you get the court date no matter how small of a violation
College Sophomore,2,Really not enough options near-by.
College Sophomore,2,"The people I know who lived in dorms complained A LOT. It's just too outdated. The only decent place to live on campus is the Dawg Pound, but it's all too expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is all I hear about on campus. I'm not a party animal either, so there isn't anything for me to do when it comes to socializing with people that live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the boys at Butler are not my type, and I don't find most of them attractive. They all dress like a typical male college student- in sweat pants. So far, I've seen two guys of interest at Butler, but one already graduated and the other graduates soon. The female to male ratio is way off, not enough guys!!! 

I don't know much about the social scene; I don't participate in it. I'm not a fan of frats and sororities, and I don't fit in really."
College Sophomore,2,"As far as I have seen, Butler isn't very diverse at all when it comes to ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, or economic background.  However, I think that there is a strong presence from different religions.  Although it's not very diverse, I think that people are pretty accepting about differences."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life dominates the campus and it is the only kind of place that big events happen. Being a girl, I am almost expected to be in a house and because I am not, I am perceived as though I am missing out on something. It bothers me that Greek life is so important and I wish there were better clubs to join."
College Student,2,Butler does not offer much financial aid to caucasian females from middle class families.
College Sophomore,2,"Butler is basically totally made up of midwestern white people. There is some diversity here and there, but most people are your generic, Christian, midwesterners."
College Freshman,2,This has been the worst winter that Indiana has had in years.
College Freshman,2,There isn't a shuttle that takes you across campus during the day…which sucks when there is a ton of snow or rain.
College Student,2,"Not much close off-campus dining. Must have a car for it, none within reasonable or safe walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,The weather in indiana is terrible. Pne day it could be snowing and then the next it is raining. 
College Sophomore,2,"The food on campus is only provided by one company. unlike larger public schools there is not a franchise fast food restaurant located on campus. if this were the case more people would be happy with staying on campus and eating the food. However, there is a small area near campus that a lot of students go to to get the food that they are looking for. The flex dollars always come in handy when getting coffee from Starbucks. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Because Butler's campus is so small, parking as far being close to your dorm room is never a problem. However, actually finding a parking spot on campus can be. With Butler's growth following its appearances in the NCAA tournament, the campus has expanded far past its original parking capacities. BUPD (Butler Police Department) is constantly on the prowl for errant parking from students as well. This really makes a lose-lose situation for students. Plans for a parking garage are in the works in the future, however. For the time being, its best only to use your car when absolutely necessary."
College Sophomore,2,Winter makes travelling rather difficult when one does not have a car.
College Freshman,2,"I hate the way Butler's latest food option is only open until 9 pm. That is ridiculous. The only place you can go after that is the Starbucks, but you can't use your meal plan, only your flex dollars."
College Freshman,2,"You literally can NEVER get away from ""the Butler bubble."" "
College Sophomore,2,The one thing I hate about Butler is the parking restrictions and regulations. I've paid a ridiculous amount of parking tickets this year alone.
College Student,2,Butler like most private schools is outrageously expensive. I got financial aid but still had to apply for loans 
College Sophomore,2,"Typical frat guys, nothing special. Most guys are short, so if you're a girl over 5'8'' it's hard to find a guy taller than you."
College Sophomore,2,There is no way to get groceries unless you have a car or a friend with a car.
College Sophomore,2,"I have never been pressured into doing drugs, and never really knew people used drugs until I went to certain fraternities and got to know more people. "
College Sophomore,2,"Not really diverse in terms of ethnicity, but becoming better."
College Freshman,2,"There are 2 options for freshman in parking permits. the I lot pass cost $80 bucks but you have to walk easily a mile to get to the lot from campus. the other option is the B pass which cost $150 but you can park at your residence hall, that is if there are spots. "
College Freshman,2,"I haven't used Dawg Ride yet, but I heard it's pretty nice.  But if you or your friends don't have a car around here, you're kind of screwed."
College Freshman,2,"If you have a car, there's a lot of great off-campus.  But literally nothing is within walking distance, forcing you to get stuff delivered.  I have hardly eaten out simply because my closer friends and I don't have cars."
College Freshman,2,"Some guys are pretty friendly, but most are kind of douchy and are only looking for booze and sex.  "
College Freshman,2,"The campus police aren't too strict as long as you're not obnoxious.  But, the excise police, who go undercover then cite underage people at parties, are very present.  That is a huge worry every weekend.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Not diverse at all from what I can see. Perhaps it's all in the upper classmen, but all I saw all day was caucasian individuals."
College Sophomore,2,"I can see why people would like the community, but for a gamer or not highly socioeconomically ranked person it's terrible."
College Sophomore,2,"For freshman, there are only two dining courts that are both open at odd times.  ResCo's dining court doesn't serve hot breakfast very late and isn't open on the weekends.  Atherton is open on weekends and weekdays but not for breakfast on weekdays.  I've heard it used to be much worse than what it is now, so I guess it's good that there have been improvements.  The hours are terrible for a college student's schedule, whatever kind of ""schedule"" that is.  No place is open past midnight for food on campus!  It was really nice to have 400 flex dollars to spend at Starbucks and C Club though."
College Sophomore,2,"Like all Greek Life the main focus is on drinking and hooking up, they play it off like they are focused on their philanthropy but not really, Greek Life at Butler overtakes the rest of the campus"
College Freshman,2,"With the large class sizes Butler has been admitting, parking has gotten pretty bad. There is not nearly enough parking at the dorms, so you are forced to park at Hinkle. BUPD is known for giving out tickets all of the time, so be very careful about where you park."
College Freshman,2,"If you have ever heard about Butler at all, you have heard about men's basketball. That is by far our biggest sport. Everyone gets super excited during basketball season and constantly goes to basketball games. Other sports are not given very much publicity. However, basketball fans get treated extremely well."
Recent Alumnus,2,Racial diversity is not someting you see that much at Butler. However ethnic diversity is present. Also economic background is diverse. There are many people with different political beliefs and religions as well. The acceptance at Butler is amazing.
College Freshman,2,"There's not a lot of parking, but they are working on fixing the problem."
College Student,2,"Butler is becoming way too crowded and they need to adjust better to find housing options for all students. Also, the parking situation is a major issue since there is never enough parking around campus and with the parking restrictions there are very few options."
College Freshman,2,"I would say that BUPD does a fairly decent job at keeping the students safe.  Except, the buzz around campus deals with the excise police who are cracking down on underage drinking and writing tickets to those unfortunate enough to get caught."
College Junior,2,"Make sure too look into dining and alcohol strictness before you choose Butler. Don't ask a tour guide or faculty member, ask a student. Dining is terrible, the new implementation of secret police has raised the strictness considerably. Don't fall for the line that the dining halls have ""just been renovated."" They mean the building, not the food. Dorms are pretty bad, but that's true anywhere. If you are not in pharmacy or preforming arts, it's hard to justify what Butler can offer for the price it is."
College Junior,2,Pretty much what to expect from a Midwestern college. Not a lot of diversity. Its there if you seek it out but never in your face.
College Freshman,2,"Definitely typical for a midwestern private school.

In terms of ethnic diversity, the campus is predominately white, with a noticeable black population. There are very few Hispanics/Latinos and international student. There also are few Asians.

In terms of regional diversity, a large majority of students hail from Indy or Illinois. I have friends from Kansas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Tennessee, Kentucky, Vermont, Washington, California, New York, Michigan and Connecticut, however, as Butler's strong programs bring students from across the nation. I have met one person from India, and I am only a freshman.

In terms of socioeconomic diversity, it's fairly typical of a private school. There are plenty of students donning Sperry's and polos, no doubt about it, and you will see several luxury cars. It may seem overwhelming at first depending on your background, but it's mostly just that those are the people you notice. There's plenty of middle-class kids to be had as well. But just be aware that a fair majority of kids come from money."
College Freshman,2,"It exists. It's not super close to campus, and a lot of it is just bars or food chains."
College Junior,2,"Some facilities such as the HRC and pharmacy building are great, other building (mostly academic) are severely outdated and need renovations."
College Junior,2,"Some building are new, such as the HRC and pharmacy building, but those such as Jordan Hall and Gallahue Hall are severely outdated and need major renovations."
College Junior,2,There are fewer spots available each year for students though everyone is allowed to have a car on campus.
College Junior,2,Just Average – Food is just average at Butler. Resco's food tastes a little better than Atherton's food.
College Sophomore,2,"There is definitely not enough parking on campus! There are small lots behind each of the residence halls but no lots for fraternities or sororities. Also, commuters have a difficult time finding a place to park while avoiding parking tickets."
Junior,1,"Overall going to Butler was a huge mistake. Don't get me wrong, the academics are excellent, basketball games are fun, and for the most part students are friendly and cool people. But the administration is ran by extremely old fashioned, strict, no-fun allowed type pricks. The police force is full of racist cops who don't care about anything but arresting kids for drinking and giving out parking tickets. And greek life is a huge divider on campus. Post rush week, nothing is the same."
Sophomore,1,"Butler commits itself to being a ""community that cares"" however this is far from the truth. Being a current student on campus I have come to realize that if you aren't in Greek life or athletics then no one on the campus cares. You are ostracized from social events and even clubs. Construction is always a factor and parking is far from most of the residential buildings. The food options besides scottys are all terrible. One of the few good things about the school is the basketball but the student sections aren't that energetic. I knew coming in that most colleges are liberal but this school takes it to an extreme and if your viewpoints are different from everyone else's then you get targeted by almost everyone in class when having class discussions. Almost every college has drinking and I understand wanting to keep kids safe but the BUPD on campus are getting kids in trouble for minor drinking violations that on almost any other campus would not be a factor."
College Freshman,1,turn a blind eye to almost everything negative
College Freshman,1,"little to no aid, have to beg"
College Sophomore,1,"Butler used to have an incredible party scene but in the past few years it has radically changed. The school is changing a lot, excise cops are constantly on campus and Butler Police are far from on your side"
College Sophomore,1,I know nothing about off-campus housing thanks to my university. Butler only allows for students to live off-campus their senior year and even then many students decide to live in the houses behind campus. This is very close but the availability for these houses are slim to none because the Greek members who live in them usually pass these houses to fellow Greek members.
College Freshman,1,You need a car on campus or you need a reliable friend to go anywhere. 
College Freshman,1,"The freshman dorms are a joke.  They aren't air-conditioned and are old, run-down buildings.  Whatever you do, DO NOT live in Ross.  It is dirty, noisy, cold, and people like to damage the property all the time.  We've already had thousands of dollars in damage (that we'll have to pay for at the end of the year) and it's only been a few months.  "
College Freshman,1,"This place mostly consists of white, upper-middle-class to middle-class people.  It was actually quite a culture shock from my high school, which I didn't think was all that diverse, but it definitely was compared to Butler.  I hear quite a few homophobic comments almost every day, so you could say this isn't the most open-minded school."
College Freshman,1,"For a vegetarian, the food is hit or miss.  I often eat cheese pizza for days in a row because either there are no veg options, or they've run out of the food.  Luckily, there is C-Club, but even it has few vegetarian options."
College Senior,1,Parking permits prices have gone up. They have provided more parking for commuters and less for people who live on campus. It is often difficult to find parking. It seems like they are more worried about making money from people coming to sporting events. In the past though I haven't had any problem with parking until this year.
College Sophomore,1,"Being a male freshman, I was stuck in Ross while women were the only ones allowed in the objectively superior Schwitzer Hall. My room in Ross was constantly cold and filthy when I moved in. In addition to this, the facilities were less than average and the residents were rowdy and loved to break things."
College Freshman,1,It's not a diverse school AT ALL. Mostly Caucasian with sprinkles of other races.
College Freshman,1,"It's Indianapolis, IN...The weather sucks here most of the time, and the summers are hot and too humid. We get A LOT of overcast days, and the pollution in this city only makes it worse."
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking on campus kind of sucks. There is limited parking all over campus. And frankly there is no parking anywhere in Indy.
College Freshman,1,"I received a good merit scholarship, but nowhere near what I got from other schools in the area of similar caliber, which was and continues to be frustrating. As a student entering with a 4.4 GPA and a 34 ACT, it seems that Butler would be doing everything in their power to get me to stay, but this is not the case. Financial aid seems to be very inconsistent. I was told that because I have the maximum merit scholarship ($18,000) I was ineligible for any financial aid, which is ridiculous because they are completely unrelated departments at most institutions. I love Butler but this honestly is my least favorite thing about it. 

Definitely apply, it's worth a shot. I feel personally that I was cheated, but I have friends that have gotten more in the way of need-based aid than I. It is just frustrating because there seems to be very random distributions of aid."
College Student,1,"Parking permits are very cheap compared to other schools. Mine for this year was $75. This means that a lot of students do bring their cars on campus. However, because Butler is within a city, there are not enough options for parking whatsoever. The residence halls have parking lots, but they are always full and students have to park along the streets. This is difficult because it requires parallel parking skills and often the streets are full as well. Butler needs to think of a way to provide more parking options for students. It is getting quite ridiculous, especially with larger amounts of freshmen each year."
College Freshman,1,"For starters, the amount for room and board is ridiculous. Butler requires students to live on campus for 3 years. This is more than any school I've heard of. There is not enough room for students, many get put into forced triples (two people rooms with three residents). Also, the dorms are run down, ugly, and often smelly. They aren't the cleanest either. Microwaves in Ross hall are in the lobby which, for third floor residents, is an extreme inconvenience. Also, custodians are notorious for half-assing their work and spending their time on their phones instead of cleaning."
College Freshman,1,"Butler charges very little for parking for the year. I believe it's $75. Because all students are allowed cars on campus, most do bring their own. All dorms have their own parking lots, but they are small and sometimes you need to park down the block. People don't drive to classes since it's literally a 3 minute walk."
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is horrible. Especially if you do not have a parking pass. Everything is permit parking and even the permit parking is limited. Also Parking Services is very adamant on permits.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus has been a long standing and serious problem. There simply aren't nearly as many spots as are needed, and the University knows and acknowledges it. They are planning on doing something about this around 2013/2014 so look into it again after then."
College Junior,1,"They have just stepped up security with almost double the police as last year and the new Excise police. Excise police are secret police, dressed as students, who will stop you and breathalyze you walking around on campus. The feeling used to be of safety from the police. They would escort you home at night if you didn't feel safe walking. And they were friendly and unobtrusive. Now it feels as if they are literally out to get you. Going undercover, waiting around in the residence halls on weekend nights, and breathalyzing freshman and sophomores coming back to their rooms outside the residence doors at night."
College Freshman,1,"This probably my largest qualm with this institution. Perhaps the students are at fault, but no one leaves campus. Which is shocking, considering there is nothing to do on campus. The shuttle to downtown only runs once a month. How can you expect us to gain a wider understanding of the world around us when we are cooped on a 290 acre patch of land which contains little to no diversity?"
College Freshman,1,"Bland on a Good Day. I really have never eaten at the dining halls and afterwards thought, ""That was delicious."" The food served here is bland on a good day. I am incredibly jealous of the food services at other colleges."
College Freshman,1,Atherton Dining – Aramark food prepares the food students eat in Atherton but it is petty nasty. I mean cheese pizza is served everyday and the food is quite bland. On occasion they have fruit pizza for desert which is not bad but I have gotten food poisoning twice this yar and my roomate has gotten sick once as well!
College Sophomore,1,We have Atherton for lunch and dinner and Resco for breakfast and lunch. We need more seating and the food quality needs to improve.  The only good thing is being able to spend some points on Starbucks :) C-Club is an option for a quick dinner but it'd be nice to have more options there all around.  The meal plan itself is outrageously expensive and there are no good options once yo live in AV because your options are so far away!
College Senior,1,"Not a Fan – Students involved in Greek life make up about a third of students at Butler. I would never join them in a house, ever. When I lived in the dorms, across the street from Greek row, I learned to seriously dislike Greek life. In the public eye, it seemed like all they ever did was stand out on the lawn and scream, sing, chant, and blast music when I was trying to study or sleep. I complained to the campus police who rarely did anything about it. Also, the concept of ""sisterhood/brotherhood"" is a joke. A girl was raped in the Phi Psi house and her ""sisters"" told her not to report it so the organization wouldn't get in trouble/suspended."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is mostly white. There are hardly any other people here, and they stay in groups."
College Junior,1,Any good looking girl on campus most likely has a boyfriend. There are a few hot girls here but its nothing special.
College Sophomore,1,"Where Is Our Money Going? There are VERY limited options and the school makes freshmen have a horrible dining plan, forcing them to ""socialize"". No one I know uses many of their meal swipes and students have to spend their own cash to get food that is edible. They have changes in mind that will hopefully help the dining become better. The hours are awkward especially on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"Need for Car on Campus – It is very hard to get around as you get older without a car. Many classes require you to leave campus which you cannot do without a car. Things are much easier if you have a car on campus, yet all of your friends will be bugging you for rides too."
College Senior,1,"Printers Are Unreliable – There are many printers on campus that students can use. Paper is alloted using a credit system and documents can be sent to the printers online. However frequently the printers are jammed, out of paper, or otherwise malfunctioning. Students are not allowed to fix problems with the printers and there are almost never people who are allowed to fix the printers around. Also when a document is sent to a malfunctioning printer it does not return the paper credit."
College Freshman,1,"All of the food on campus is really gross, but next semester they're changing all of the dining options, so it might be better."
College Freshman,1,"Ross Hall – Ross Hall is without a doubt the worst place to live on campus. I understand I only have to live in Ross for one year, but between the low quality utilities, rampant vandalism, and bug infestation, it is a place that I will be glad to leave. I killed my fourth cockroach the other day."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is horrible. You are lucky to find a spot and when you cannot, you are lucky if you do not find a ticket. BU Police are not lenient when it comes to fines and giving tickets. Parking is limited, even when you have an assigned lot and if you do not have a parking pass, expect to pay outrageous amounts to feed the meter. Since when does 25 cents buy you 10 minutes?"
College Freshman,1,"The closest off campus dinging to our school is at least 5-7 minutes way driving. Drunk driving becomes a big problem on the weekends because of the lack of open and available dining options close to campus. There are plenty of restaurants in the area to eat at if you want to drive there, but it would be nice to have something within walking distance for those who don't have a car or have been drinking."
College Junior,1,"Too Much – People always say that they're not dominant, but they are. The run things and they know it."
College Student,1,From Champions to Losers – The school still treats the basketball team like they are gods but they haven't been able to make more than 18% of their shots. The school needs to reevaluate their focus
College Freshman,1,"The most diversity you will find at Butler is in the Greek system, simply because there are 7 fraternities and 7 sororities. However, not even those are diverse. Everyone looks the same, comes from the same region, and has a similar reason for attending Butler: ""They gave me a lot of money...and uh, Go Dawgs!"" We do have a ""Diversity Center"", but what good is a center that creates a space where ""diversity"" can go and become segregated from the rest of the community, which is lacking in the first place. Students are apathetic about politics and make little effort to vote. Butler has a loud Christian presence. The lack of diversity bores me."
College Junior,1,Butler University may look good from the outside but it has multiple flaws. The dinning and residential facilities are terrible. Most of the time I am bored on campus. Nothing to do on the weekends. No football and performing arts and theater are big here. If you want a true college experience do not go to Butler University.

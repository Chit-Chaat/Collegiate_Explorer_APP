Alum,5,"If your wanting to get a great degree while focusing on Christ, Freed-Hardeman is perfect. Great and caring professors and a wonderful student body."
Alum,5,Most MBA classes were online and it was a great experience. It definitely prepared me for the future of work (working remotely with coworkers).
Senior,5,"FHU is a small close-knit college located in the small town of Henderson, TN. What really sets FHU apart from the other colleges I've attended is the genuine care and support for the students body that is shown by the faculty and administration."
Niche User,5,"One reason, I actually like FHU is because it is a school that is close to home. it makes it so much easier to go home instead of going out too far."
Freshman,5,My experience with Freed Hardeman has been great. Nothing I would change. We have great food with lots of variety and choices to choose from. This is a Christian school not a party school. The staff are all very friendly and always willing to help any way they can.
Alum,5,"FHU was a blessing. I graduated and became a BSN, RN and would not trade my training at FHU for anything! The campus was expanding during my four years at Freed, but overall I feel that every facility met expectations. I was ready for the workforce when I graduated, and always had a sense of belonging at Freed! I would recommend this university to everyone. I am not Church of Christ, but I am a Christian. I did not feel out of place or pressured during my time there."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my school. The professors are all friendly and knowledgeable. And the fellow students are always so supportive.
Sophomore,5,"FHU is home to me, and I truly would not want to be at any other place. I get to connect with people of a like-minded faith as me, and I feel like I am being more than adequately prepared to be a teacher one day."
Sophomore,5,Freed-Hardeman is a wonderful school. The Christian environment is absolutely amazing. The teachers will do absolutely anything possible to help you succeed.
Niche User,5,"I love how social everyone on campus was, and how helpful the administrators are. The students and faculty want each person to have a good experience and connect with God."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere at Freed is unmatched. The campus is very small so everyone knows each other and everyone is well connected with one another. Professors actually care for each and every one of their students. The opportunity for spiritual growth at this school incredible. I have nothing bad to say about Freed-Hardeman University.
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed the campus and the area it was in. The campus is well kept, and has a lot of charm. The town it is in is a smaller town that has a lot of character. The people there are very friendly including the professors, staff, and students. It was a great experience!"
Niche User,5,"I love FHU! From tours to camps, I love it all. The campus is so pretty, and I can’t wait to attend next year."
Junior,5,Freed Hardeman is an excellent university. Everything about the university is outstanding except for the food and the dorms could be better. Student life is fantastic if you involve yourself
Freshman,5,Freed Hardeman is a great school that really gives their students a sense of a home feeling. There are also lots if interactions with others from different places. This is definitely a small but great place to be that is considered a family from within.
Senior,5,"I loved Freed-Hardeman University. I must say that the diversity of the school is disappointing when considering religion and race, but I understand that is the reason many of the students come here. I think we should be challenging ourselves more and what we believe, however. The PEOPLE here are amazing. I have found amazing professors here who are willing to do anything to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,"Freed Hardman is a unique school based on Christian values. It is geared towards academics but offers a variety of ways to socialize and fun.  The faculty, staff, and the student body make this university feel like home away from home. "
College Freshman,5,Just say NO to drugs
College Freshman,5,They care about all of the students on campus
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus with a group of friends
College Freshman,5,FHU has the best dorms ever!!
College Freshman,5,Greek life is the best ever!!
College Freshman,5,FHU has the best basketball team ever!!
College Freshman,5,This is the best college to attend to and I would recommend my friends to come to Freed Hardeman University!!
College Freshman,5,"This campus is such a community, and it's love for one another and for God is absolutely beautiful. Our dorms are easy to decorate, and the food is really good. Everything here is so cool, and it's so southern. I am in love with it, and if you choose Freed Hardeman, I know that we can't wait to welcome you!"
College Freshman,5,The security here is so nice and friendly. It's hard to find a place on campus where you feel unsafe.
College Freshman,5,"I expected to get in another dorm, but because I chose to go here late, there was no room in my preferred dorm. I was moved into Hall Roland, and I love it. The bathrooms are a little small, but Hall Roland is definitely the homiest dorm on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Every club is open to the others and it's not clique-like at all. It's a big family. Everyone is really nice to each other, and if you don't feel love here, you're blocking it out. This place is a dream."
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities on campus are awesome. The only thing I would change is I would put a pool in.
College Freshman,5,"This place is actually the best. It's just like a dream come true. I've always wanted to go here, and I cried when I got accepted. Every day I walk past the bell tower, and it reminds me that it's still real, and it's like a dream, and that's why I love FHU."
College Junior,5,"I feel very safe here, and violence and sexual assault never really happens here thankfully."
College Junior,5,"I don't like that we have curfews and room inspections, but I love living here."
College Junior,5,"We have so many opportunities here to have fun and grow spiritually at the same time. For someone looking for a chance to constantly be able to attend encouraging devotionals and singings in the dark, or go to slip n' slides and cookouts.. We're trusted here too: We have free reign to classrooms for studying or for socializing- my friends and I like to play video games and watch movies on big screen projectors (after we use the rooms for homework discussion and test prep)."
College Junior,5,"Being a Christian college, many of the students strive to do right. It is also a small campus so there are not too many spots where one could be harmed without someone noticing relatively quickly."
College Freshman,5,My classes are challenging but manageable. My professors are very approachable and definitely care about me & my grades. I love the small classes.
College Freshman,5,The fact that I can get my MBA while I am getting my undergrad is awesome.
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. The environment here is awesome. It isn't perfect, but it is where I feel I fit in best."
College Freshman,5,I feel really safe at FHU and well cared for
College Freshman,5,The teachers say that FHU graduates are top picks for jobs
College Freshman,5,Professors are all around awesome people and teachers and care about their students
College Freshman,5,"Freed-Hardeman is an amazing school all around. Good academics and lots of choices for classes, very focused on spirituality and has a faculty and staff focused on Christianity with an overall Christian feel on campus, good professors, the professors' desire to help the students and they want the best for the students, etc."
College Sophomore,5,There are many employers that come specifically to this school to hire graduating students and talk to the juniors.
College Sophomore,5,Lots of employers love Freed-Hardeman Students. The quality education and Christian nature of the students is loved by many.
College Sophomore,5,As good as it gets.
College Sophomore,5,"One time, I had a friend who was walking, and some townie creep asked her to get in his car. She didn't (because she's not stupid). This situations occur extremely rarely. Sexual assault is almost a non-issue."
College Sophomore,5,"If you're a Bible major and you're have traditional church of Christ beliefs, it's stupid easy to get an internship or job. I can't say for other majors."
College Sophomore,5,The teachers truly care about their students! FHU is the place to be!
Recent Alumnus,5,I'm grateful for this school.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone at Freed is very helpful, and will go above and beyond their ability to get you what you need."
College Freshman,5,"""Parties"" at Freed are not what you would expect when thinking about college parties. Freed's parties social gatherings to get to know each other better, or hold devotionals. They DON'T include negative influences."
College Freshman,5,"This place is the best! It is so amazing here! I feel like it's another home for me! I've met so many amazing people and the education value is great! It is a private school, so it can be high is price, but it's completely worth it if you are able to go!"
College Freshman,5,Administration cares very deeply for the students on a spiritual level.
College Freshman,5,Best Christian education out there.
College Freshman,5,I attend a private Christian University. They are expected to be strict about certain issues because of our beliefs.
College Senior,5,I have never heard of any such thing as violence of negativity in such degree.
College Junior,5,"Freed Hardeman issues at the end of the year a crime report to all our students. There were no sexual assaults, no violence related crimes, and no substance abuse crimes. There were three counts of possession of alcohol and five thefts. Crime is almost non existent on campus. There is a sufficient number of security personnel and everyone on campus feels safe."
College Junior,5,"This school is awesome. It has the perfect amount of everything. I enjoy being apart of the University Choral. We love visiting churches and singing for them and we're sort of like a big family. Our director is great too, funny, caring, and skilled as a conductor. Freed- Hardeman is probably the best because of the people that go there. Just about all of us cares a great deal about God and serving our fellow man. It's just the greatest!"
College Junior,5,I am majoring in Bible and love it. Everyone around me always has a great attitude and are willing to work hard to learn. The Bible faculty are very receptive and personable. Each Bible major must complete a field internship. The school provides plenty of opportunities and will help you find a place with ease.
College Sophomore,5,"Other than a few hot boxers, drug use is nearly nonexistent."
College Sophomore,5,"Great professors, standard curriculum, easy registration process.

All professors are experts in their fields and have real-world experience in said field.

Classes are easily acquired and dropped."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my classes online were done well. There was one class that I had to be live for every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday which was difficult due to the pandemic and lack of WiFi."
Junior,4,"It is a great college, however, the financial aide services have always been kind of poor in terms of helping their students and the campus itself is in need of updating and better facilities but the teachers are fantastic and amount of studies that are at the school are great!"
Freshman,4,"The professors are caring and the campus is small, so you can get to know most people. Being a small campus the support from other students and staff is great. It is a safe campus and town that all people in town watch out for the safety of the students."
Freshman,4,"Freed hardeman is a great Christian college. The housing is great. Great food and a good variety to choose from. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help. Freed Hardeman is not a party school.
 The athletic department is great.
There are lots of Churches of Christ near by to attend worship at. 
The majority of the staff are members of Church of Christ.
There is mandatory chapel held each day on campus.
It is mandatory to take a bible course each semester which helps to strengthen my faith.
I feel that God has lead me to this Christian school to further my education an play baseball with Christian people and coaches."
Freshman,4,"Everyone here is so nice and friendly, plus the campus is really amazing! All of the teachers seem to care about what they are teaching and who they are teaching. I love going to chapel and being able to learn about God every day."
Freshman,4,"My semester at Freed-Hardeman University was very interesting. This is my first time staying on campus and going to school out of my own city.  The diversity there is good, the teachers are willing to work with you on your class work and grades. By its being a private christian school they don't believe in sororities, they have social clubs and they are fun. They all get together and plan trips and have good time on campus. Everyone is nice and kind, the staff are willing to check on you when you need and there is Chapel everyday that you must attend. The dorms are nice depending which ones you stay in I stayed in Dixion and the girls were nice I just didn't like the size of the room. If you ever decide to come to Freed please have some good scholarships and come in with playing sports. They only have basketball, base and soft ball, golf, track and field, soccer, and volleyball."
Senior,4,"Freed-Hardeman University while not very diverse, is a safe place. The culture surrounding the school is extremely Christian. Holding lectureships every February and chapel everyday, the school is deeply emerged in the Christian views. Therefore missing a chapel or a church service on Wednesday and Sunday, raise eyebrows from surrounding students and staff."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the environment at Freed-Hardeman University. That is in the top two or three reasons why I wanted to go there. I can build my schedule from classes to what I do after class. Whenever I come home for break, I am already looking forward to getting back to school. I can't get this kind of education/environment in any regular public school."
Sophomore,4,"The thing I liked most about Freed-Hardeman was the relationships the professors have with the students. I easily could joke with them; we got along great. As someone who commuted and lived 30 minutes away, if I forgot an assignment, the professors we're very lenient and saved me extra stress."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the Christian atmosphere.  Friendly students and caring staff.  With the smaller class sizes the Professors are able to focus on the students.  They all are open and welcome visits to their offices.  It is a pretty campus, up front.  One major drawback is NO football team.  The Basketball teams do VERY well.   The athletic players are well supported by staff and students, but NOT given easy grades.  The food could be better.  There is a nice movie theater for students.  Could use a little more stuff in the student center to keep students on campus and not off looking for inappropriate things to do.  This university is located in a small rural TN town with nothing to do off campus.  Luckily there is a nice size town about 30 mins away that has a lot of fun things to do.   Many alumni stay in the area. Great place to go!"
Sophomore,4,"Freed-Hardeman University provides a thorough education and an environment that provides compassion and understanding. The teachers are highly informative and willing to share their understanding of the subject with you, upon the unwritten agreement that you are willing to provide a, at minimum, decent effort. One major compliment I can give to Freed-Hardeman, is that you are not abandoned into classes that expects you to already have a master understanding. The teachers understand that college is a very difficult transition that requires someone experienced to guide you through the beginning processes."
Niche User,4,Freed Hardeman is a small college making it like a family almost. The teachers are personable and the walk to class is short!
Graduate Student,4,I love the professors. They are understanding and caring. They will help you any way you can. I am in a new program and it is challenging with working full time as well but the professors have been wonderful. They get you ready for the work force.
Junior,4,"I love that Freed-Hardeman provides the Christian environment for all students. The teachers work really well with students, and everyone is so caring."
Senior,4,"I was a non traditional transfer student when I started. There wasn't a lot of information given to me as I came in, most of what I found I either asked about it or found it on my own. I would like to see that transfer students get the same assistants as an up coming freshman. It would allow the transition to be more at ease "
College Freshman,4,"A degree here is awesome! With our MBA program, you can finish your degree faster and have more time to get a job. Our outstanding nursing program allows us to get a good job after school ends. This place is actually the very best."
College Junior,4,"The professors are wonderful here! There isn't a variety of cool classes to choose from, and scheduling is a nightmare in regards to upper-division classes when some are only offered once every other year."
College Junior,4,"My specific degrees will ensure that I can get a job nearly anywhere. I'm double majoring in Psychology and Education, and minoring in Mathematics. Once I'm certified to teach math, I can teach nearly anywhere in the state."
College Junior,4,"There are several sports offered and available to students, but we don't have a football field or team. Sports are big here, but they aren't appreciated by the majority of students."
College Junior,4,"I feel that when it comes time for me to find an internship, I will have several options. Many graduates of Freed-Hardeman come back to talk to us students about their careers. They seem pleased and encourage us to work ethically and hard to get to where we want to be."
College Junior,4,All the courses I have taken so far have taught me something that I will need to use later in my life. There is not only a variety of classes but different types of professors as well. Most of the classes are pretty small (2ish students) and this makes learning easier.
College Junior,4,"I love the Christian atmosphere of this school. All the teachers care about the students and truly want us to succeed and even excel in what we pursue academically, spiritually, and and personally."
College Junior,4,"Professors will generally work with you, and curriculum is generally quite decent. It's relatively easy to register, and students have final control of their classes."
College Junior,4,"While there is some drug and alcohol use on campus, it is against school policy, and is kept quiet."
College Freshman,4,Campus crime is extremely low due to the Christian environment. Our security is pretty hardworking.
College Junior,4,"Students who graduate from Freed-Hardeman seem to do very well following graduation. I have no experience with the career center, but I do know that the school occasionally hosts job fairs, especially for specific fields such as business or psychology."
College Junior,4,"The large majority of classes are excellent, including basic general education requirements. There is a wide variety of classes, though a lot of them build on entry-level classes, and thus have a string of prerequisites"
College Junior,4,"Several of the dorms are becoming outdated, and a good number of them are scheduled to be demolished and replaced in the next ten years. That being said, they are mostly well maintained, and living on-campus is quite a delight."
College Junior,4,"While it certainly has its flaws, Freed-Hardeman University is full of great teachers who genuinely want to see their students succeed. Granted, there are a few that couldn't care less, but if you work with them, even they will usually work with you."
College Freshman,4,"Really good dorm community, good RA's and Dorm Moms"
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, I don't know much about sports at Freed, but my review reflects what I can tell about sports."
College Sophomore,4,There aren't many crimes and the campus security is always roaming the streets.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are manageable and the professors really care about you.
College Sophomore,4,The best option would be Sewell Hall because it is newer and cleaner than Farrow and Benson.
College Sophomore,4,"Students support the teams but during homecoming and post season play, they show it the most."
College Sophomore,4,Pretty great environment for academics. Some professors need to be dealt with but other than that everything here is pretty satisfactory if not great.
College Sophomore,4,Safety for us is a nonconcern because campus security does their job well. My previous girlfriend was a victim of sexual assault but it wasn't on or near the campus but even still the administration does tend to care for her a bit more than others which is great in my opinion.
College Sophomore,4,"Most courses I have taken have been good or great. However, there are professors on campus you'd want to avoid if possible. One was in my previous major and honestly is the entire reason I'm changing my major now."
College Sophomore,4,Can't really give a rating due to not being in a greet association myself. As far as my experience goes people in Greek and Non-Greek usually like each other or we are just indifferent if we don't like. Dislike or Hate is usually between personal things.
College Sophomore,4,Team performance is pretty good from what I've seen and heard. Fan support isn't exactly the best however.
College Sophomore,4,Great school overall. Only a few problems. Definitely can spruce up some of the older dorms when possible. On-campus dining could have a few more choices and more seating space. Some teachers need to be dealt with. Has curfew which can deter some. Has chapel at 10:30 am on weekdays which is mainly mandatory to attend (You do have skips however).
College Sophomore,4,"FHU is great! If you come here, and you plan on majoring in something other than Bible, you're probably not coming here because of any phenomenal programs. Freed's strength is the emphasis of the students on social and spiritual life. If you're not a Christian, it can be difficult fitting in at first, but if you let someone know you're interested in becoming or renewing yourself as a Christian, you will find more than enough people who would be thrilled to help you."
College Junior,4,I really enjoy my school! The people here are all really nice and have similar interests and morals as me. I feel as if we all understand each other even if we just met each other a few years ago!
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience so far at Freed-Hardeman University has been amazing. I have made many life long friends and grown spiritually. Some of my favorite experiences have been my trips with the University Choral. We went on a winter tour to Texas and Louisiana in an old tour bus. I became close with many of the individuals in the group and I'll never forget our moments. Freed is unique in that we are a private Christian University affiliated with the Church of Christ. There are many churches in the area and you can find a number of teachers at each one. If I had the choice to do it all over I would definitely choose Freed- Hardeman University again.
College Sophomore,4,"Freed-Hardeman is a decent school. They have a lot to work on. I think that some of the staff does not need to be there. The school basically need an entire remodeling. It is trying to play catch up with the surrounding christian schools such as Harding, Lipscomb, and OCU."
College Senior,4,We have plenty of fans and everyone is always very nice
College Senior,4,Taco bell would be the best
College Senior,4,They are trying to keep everyone safe and know what they are doing
College Senior,4,You just get together and socialize with everyone
College Senior,4,i just wish you had to fill it out once
College Senior,4,I love staying on campus
College Sophomore,4,"Well since I am at a Christian College it is very strict in most aspects of our lives. Dress code, drugs, alcohol, and dorm life is very strict and most occacians not allowed. The security is great and very nice, very approachable."
College Sophomore,4,"The process went smoothly, I just didn't get necessarily all that I needed. Paying for school on my own is stressful and can be a big headache. I stress over money all the time. Scholarships are awesome and i recommend even if you do have money to try and get some."
College Sophomore,4,"My school Is very expensive, especially to liv in the dorm. Each dorm is very old and not up to date at all. I do recommend staying in the dorms though, it gives you a chance to make life long friends. The social atmosphere is great here, everyone knows pretty much everyone. As a small school christian school its easier to get involved."
College Freshman,4,I love the small town atmosphere. Plenty places to eat if you are willing to drive a little ways outside of town. Stores are close by in Jackson.
College Freshman,4,"Most everyone on campus has a Christian attitude. If you look though you will find those rebel guys and girls. Some guys are like guys from high school. Girls are okay, a lot are fake though."
College Freshman,4,"They where very helpful in helping me get aid to attended. It was somewhat of a hassle, but getting finical aid in general is stressful."
College Freshman,4,"We do not have fraternity's or sorority's, instead we have social clubs. I enjoy my social club very much, they are like family."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoyed a couple of my classes this past semester. My teachers made the class something worth attending.
College Senior,4,Over the years at Freed the athletics at our campus have been growing. The whole aspect on how things work are so weird from other colleges.
Freshman,2,"Co-ed frats are the name of the game and there is mass division among students. Most students are obnoxious, racist, and mean, some are good as gold. Obviously a mean-spirited conservative christian atmosphere but that's what you get at hardcore COC schools anyway. Academics are pretty good if you're in a bigger program. Every other semester ""makin' music"" takes over the entire school as well as academics so expect 2/4 of your time at freed spent on that. I'm not convinced that it's a real school."
College Freshman,2,"This was the worst decision of my life. Although this school expresses that they accept anyone, it is only partially true. Anyone can be accepted as a student of Freed-Hardeman but as far as being accepted into the school's student body, it is easier said than done. There has many times where those who weren't of Christian faith, Church of Christ or Baptist congregation they considered lower than the rest of the student body. The majority of the faculty members are amazing and will do anything for you, but a good percentage of the students are not so welcoming after the first two weeks of the school year. This is a perfect school for others, but it was far from perfect for me. It was a mistake to even consider accepting here."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no sororities or fraternities at the school, they have a lame substitute called social clubs."
College Sophomore,2,"Homosexuality is condemned with love (which seems like an oxymoron to most people). Some insensitive people will judge you inappropriately, but if you can find some good people to sit down and discuss morals with, and if you are open minded, you will understand what I mean."
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't any parties. Everyone goes home on the weekend.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have a lot of options. We have a Taco Bell, McDonalds, Jacks, Subway, Dominoes, Pizza Hut, and a Sonic that closes at 10:00. The entire town shuts down at 12:00 on the week nights."
College Sophomore,2,social club parties are always fun to be involved with.
College Junior,2,"You are not allowed to live off campus unless you live with your parents, are married, or in graduate school"
College Sophomore,2,"Either hot or cold, few days in between. Lots of rain, which is a personal turnoff."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is small, so most people walk from place to place. No local transportations are offered."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not really much to do in Henderson, most students drive to Jackson."
College Sophomore,2,"It has been pretty bad lately, but it is starting to get better."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not very much parking on campus. There is some, but they are sparse."
College Sophomore,2,"Freed-Hardeman is accepting of diversity for the most part. As far as sexual orientation, homosexuality is frowned upon at the institution. They believe it to be ungodly. The majority of the people on campus are Republican. There is a Republican club but not a Democrat club. The majority of the students are Christian and members of the church of Christ. Several are of other Christian faiths and there are a few that are not religious at all. People think that everyone that attends Freed is rich but I promise, that is not valid. Several nations represent our campus, however the majority of the student body is Caucasian."
College Sophomore,2,"When it is sunny out it is great! Everyone does their homework and eats out in the common area. Several groups go to the state park nearby and have a day of fun. It doesn't snow here often so when it does several students, mostly male students, go outside and have snow ball fights. When it rains it pours and it definitely rains a lot at Freed. During tornado season we get a few warnings. Then we must go to the basement of our dorms with the rest of our dorm mates. It is great bonding time."
College Sophomore,2,The faculty and staff do not communicate. it's too expensive for too little.
College Freshman,2,"I am still waiting on my financial aid as I type this. They don't tell you what you get with financial aid until it is almost too late. I wish I could have gotten more scholarships from them, but since this is a private school, a lot of scholarships are not offered here."
College Junior,2,There is none.  It's a small campus.  We don't need it.
College Senior,2,"Dining in Henderson, TN – There is not a big variety of places to eat in Henderson. There are about 3 places that I like to go that are not the typical fast food places; Bills BBQ, Bells Drive-In, and Los Portales. The cost is reasonable at most places and some places even offer student discounts. 

I feel that there are a lot of other places that could benefit from putting a facility in Henderson."
College Sophomore,2,Driving Is a Must – You have to drive to get to Freed but you don't have to necessarily have a car. It is just nice to have. If you live near anybody else I would recommend car pooling though. It saved me more money than I can imagine!
Freshman,1,During the pandemic teachers didn't know what to do so they increased the workload by about 60%. Many of my friends were physically sick after trying to complete the semester due to workload.
Graduate Student,1,This school is not what I thought it would be at all. It caters to the students' whims without actually guiding them and preparing them for life. It has become a stumbling block for so many of my friends especially when it comes to the art department and the long hair freak drama teacher.
College Freshman,1,This is not a party school.
College Senior,1,"I really wish we had greek life verses the ""social clubs"" we have on campus. I think the students would be way more involved with campus events if we did have greek life."
College Senior,1,We have three restaurants and the rest are fast food options. Nothing healthy or satisfying.
College Senior,1,Henderson does not have much to offer. College students have to drive thirty minutes out of school to Jackson to do anything exciting.
College Senior,1,I do not think that all the rules at this University are useful. Dress code and a curfew for college students is silly to me as well as not being able to drink when you turn the legal age.
College Freshman,1,The Wi-Fi barely ever connects and when it does it's only for a few minutes at most.  It's ridiculous.
College Senior,1,"We are talking about Henderson, TN one of the smallest and oldest town in TN there is no nightlife in Henderson, Tn only ice cream, coffee, and movie nights."
College Freshman,1,They have lame social clubs that THINK they are legit frats and sororities AKA Sigma Rho
College Freshman,1,I would advise all minorities NOT TO COME HERE!!! no diversity....constant racial slurs....
College Freshman,1,"THey suck they have never been upgraded , we pay 7000 for nothing."
College Freshman,1,"It's more like a boarding school here, we get no privileges for being here. They treat there students like little kids. You could get a summons for practically anything here, as trivial as not signing out which could lead to suspension."
College Senior,1,"This campus is so strict. No drugs, no alcohol, no tobacco, no sex, you can't even be at a place that's main intent is to serve alcohol (such as the bar at Applebee's). Campus Security is very nice once you get to know them, but they will not hesitate to give you a parking ticket. Pretty much the theory is guilty until proven innocent here. The RA's vary, most are very nice and tolerant, others think they're dictators."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The school is so small, there is no transportation."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Extremely Strict Dress Code. If you wear running shorts to sports practice, you're still considered out of dress code and will be reported to the dean of students. They might as well make us wear uniforms all day. I have never felt so self-conscious about what I wear until I came to this school. You WILL be judged for wearing clothes that do not fit the dress code and people WILL talk about you behind your back. They might even post a picture on Facebook of you out of dress code, saying that you should be sent to the dean."
College Junior,1,"College Daycare Lacking Diversity, Freedom of Expression, and Civil Liberties – When you graduate from high school and when you turn 18, you're viewed by the law as being a fairly competent and educated adult.  However, you are treated at this school as a child to be monitored and coddled as if you've committed a crime and are under probation.  You have a MANDATORY curfew, severe restrictions on co-ed visitation (note: visiting is not having sex, and there's a thing called privacy rights in America).  The campus is located in a very small town with little to offer in the way of cultural diversity or enlightenment, and the closest major city having any worthwhile extracurricular activities (that don't involve church) is Memphis.  The overall credentials of the faculty body are laughable, and the programs are limited, at best.  The overall atmosphere is one that is stifling, with many of the rights guaranteed by the constitution (freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom of speech) sharply limited by campus policies.  If you're a spiritually motivated student, there are much better options available.  There are countless universities centered around Christian values and education that do not treat their student body like children, with much better facilities, faculty, and surroundings to boot.  Avoid at all costs, unless you absolutely must attend a university run by the Church of Christ. "
College Senior,1,"Computer Labs – The computer labs on campus are dwindling because of a lack of classroom space!  They have provided printers in each dorm, but they are of no help to commuter students!"
College Junior,1,"Not Great – A couple of dorms have plenty of parking (Sewell, Woods-East, Farrow), but most share parking lots with all of the other dorms.  Some of the girls dorms especially have to walk quite a ways to get to their dorm once they find an open parking space.  Also, so much of the parking is reserved for faculty/staff and graduate or commuter students, that resident students (which makes up a majority of the studnet body) are very limited.
A parking permit costs around $20 if you live on campus.  Campus security can sometimes be borderline unreasonable about writing parking tickets, so you just have to be careful where you park.  Also, while I survived one year without a car on campus, it was definitely inconvenient at times."

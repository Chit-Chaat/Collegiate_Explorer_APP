Senior,5,"Mercyhurst has been a great choice for me both academically and socially. The opportunities that have presented themselves, and the relationships I have gained have been super rewarding. Highly recommend Mercyhurst to all incoming students who are considering Mercyhurst. 
#HurstisHome"
Graduate Student,5,"Each professor handles the online learning experience a tad differently, but I didn't take a course that I did not love and learn a ton from, either online on on-campus."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved Mercyhurst for the community and opportunities it's provided me both in my undergraduate and graduate studies. The faculty goes above and beyond to ensure each student is meeting their personal goals. Student life has events weekly and there are so many clubs and organizations on campus that students may choose to get involved with. No matter who you are, Mercyhurst has a way of making itself Home to everyone who visits!"
Alum,5,I loved my 4 years as a Mercyhurst undergrad student. I learned from excellent professional leaders who really know the industry and share their passion with the students. We got a well-rounded liberal arts education to help mold us for any career situation we might find ourselves in after graduation.
Alum,5,"I didn’t have online classes at the time, however, we used a system called Blackboard for course management that was very user friendly!"
Freshman,5,With the limitations on group activities on campus the dorm RA's conjure up plans to keep the students from each dorm occupied. By make plans for weekend activities to help new students make friends and memories. The campus is a very relaxing place to be with a great view and cleanliness.
Freshman,5,The classes are very convenient on line you can reach through to your professors through Zoom and by sending emails. Office hours are usually before the hour your class start and they are very reliable to reach on the weekends.
Sophomore,5,"When I was first going into college, I was formerly extremely pessimistic and thought the worst of how my experience would be. However, once the first semester started, my tune completely changed. My motivation to work and be involved with the Mercyhurst community rose. One of the most prominent reasons I enjoy Mercyhurst is the staff and faculty on campus. The faculty here are the most extraordinary people who want you to succeed and help you with anything troubling. They try to help you find where your interests lay and motivate you no matter what. However, this is not the only reason why I love Mercyhurst.
The next reason why Mercyhurst is excellent is because of the people on campus. They welcome you with open arms and are some of the most wonderful people I have ever met. You can quickly get involved in any extracurricular activity because these people here are all there for the same reason and will help you.
I would like to see change is police and safety taking more action."
Sophomore,5,I have (briefly) attended two other universities and Mercyhurst has been the best one I have been to. The professors and staff has been extremely kind and helpful. I am very happy at the school and feel like it is where I belong. So far I have not had any bad experiences or feel like the school needs to change. It’s perfect.
Sophomore,5,My online experience happened because of COVID-19 but with that my professors did an amazing job with teaching us and providing as much guidance as they could. Despite the circumstances we ended the semester strong.
Freshman,5,I had a very good time at Mercyhurst University. The campus is always alive with people and the campus is small enough where you will run into your friends or teammates on your way to class.
Alum,5,"Great experience. Dedicated professors, fun activities organized by the president and by the student government."
Alum,5,"Never received online classes while I studied at Mercyhurst. However, I did hear many people had positive experiences"
Sophomore,5,"I have had an excellent experience at Mercyhurst University. I believe that the education that is given prepares us as students for the real world and helps us become people of benefit in society. Also, because this university has a small campus, you are able to have a better communication with your professors. Something I would change is the amount of diversity. I would love to see more students with diverse races and cultural backgrounds. Overall, it is a great university!"
Freshman,5,It feels like a whole community. The teachers really care for the students. The athletic department are one of the best. Awesome campus.
Graduate Student,5,"The PA program is excellent, and they have done an amazing job keeping up with classes through the pandemic! We have continued all classes online, and through teams, we continue to have face to face classes."
Freshman,5,"Mercyhurst University is a beautiful institution with a caring, well educated staff that allows students to be challenged, but find enjoyment in their area of interest."
Niche User,5,When I first visited about a month or two ago they were very welcoming with my visit. I received a free shirt and was able to get hands on with music department and learn more about it.
Niche User,5,They are very good at communicating with their incoming students. The campus is gorgeous and when I visited everyone was extremely friendly.
Senior,5,Small school gives you a lot of one-on-one time with professors. Everyone including cafeteria staff is so nice and will almost always know your name.
Freshman,5,Everyone person I have come in contact with have always been very welcoming and willing to help in any way.
Freshman,5,This place a very awesome.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Sophomore,5,"I love Mercyhurst! Small class sizes, real connections with (amazing) professors, real world experience--often as a freshman--in every major, and a flexible core curriculum. Student life is pretty good, always something going on so there's no reason to be bored. Housing/res life is a mix, but generally better than most schools. People might complain about the dining hall food, but it's still better than 95% of other schools! Worst part is easily the price tag, but if you can make it work (through scholarships or grants or if you have the money) it's totally worth it. So so thankful I'm here, and wouldn't change my decision for the world."
Niche User,5,"Have applied to attend for the fall of 2020. Coming from a Sister of Mercy high school I really like the small town, close knit community feel of Mercyhurst University. Mercyhurst offers the same set of core value and commitment I am accustomed to."
Freshman,5,"i liked that theres lots to do around campus, and that buses will take me to the mall or other stores around campus. i liked the staff to student ratio and the fact everyone seemed very friendly"
Freshman,5,"Ever since I visited Mercyhurst University in the spring, I saw the immense sense of community produced by teachers and staff members that really care about their students. Coming here from the other side of the country was one of the best decisions I ever made because Mercyhurst could be described as my home away from home. As a bonus, the campus is beautiful and there are a multitude of events going on all the time that really utilize the lovely space."
Freshman,5,Attending Mercyhurst is the best choice i ever made . the students here are friendly along with the professor. They have a wide variety of clubs and sports to get involved in . In addition this campus actually make me feel safe everywhere i go. It also nice because all of the buildings are very close to each other so you have to walk a distance to get to classes. I am a Sports-medicine Pr-physician assistant (biology) and i learn so many new skills and i am always curious to know what we are going to learn for the next lesson . the reason for that is because the professors teach with excitement and factual information . Overall the staff and students are wonderful and if your looking forward to go to a college that you will like mercyhurst is the college to choose .
Sophomore,5,"My Mercyhurst experience has overall been great. I had my fair share of struggles as a freshman, however, it was nothing that couldn't be solved with time and conversation. I have met a few staff who have really encouraged me to push on and keep trying no matter how hard things got. I would not have made any other choice on  attending other Universitys."
Alum,5,"My whole four years at Mercyhurst I always complained and wanted to transfer. I am so glad I didn't. The relationships I've built with professors were so much more than just asking for help, I got to know them on a personal level and saw how much they cared for each student's growth. The winters suck, but the faculty and staff at MU made it feel like home for me."
Sophomore,5,"Mercyhurst University is a small campus. I like this fact very much. I am able to travel from class to class to my dorm room in a short amount of time. Also, most of the people at Mercyhurst are very friendly and easy to get along with. It has a a very pleasant atmosphere, and I feel very comfortable."
Sophomore,5,I am starting Mercyhurst in the Fall as a sophomore and I am transferring there from a small community college in my town. I have taken many tours of the campus and am very eager to start. I love it
Freshman,5,i enjoyed my visit very much i am glad i will be attending this school. The tour was great and they are the top school for my major in the whole country. They will offer me with great expiriences and oppurtunities that other universitys would not have.
Niche User,5,Mercyhurst is an amazing school that welcome people of every creed and wants to make students life better by enriching them with academic knowledge.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the combination of academic excellence and religious appeal. Mercyhurst University allows one to enhance their education while having the opportunity to join many clubs, sports, and activities and also express their religious beliefs and values in a caring atmosphere."
Alum,5,"Strongest point is the academic experience and critical thinking skills gained. College professors were wonderful and the academic workload is challenging and rigorous. The small class sizes give the students personalized attention from top notch professors that would be more of a challenge at a larger school. If you are looking for a great academic experience in a small setting, this is the place. I found the social experience great as well, because you really get to know your class and there is plenty of fun things to do in Erie. If you are looking for a large, big city party school, this isn't the place, however it was perfect for me. It's a small school, so the local employment ties are great, and the links to graduate schools, but it will be not as linked to big city employment on the coasts."
Sophomore,5,"The best thing about Mercyhurst is the flexibility with classes, majors, and minors. I am able to double major and double minor with Dance without much stress or issues, and many others do the same. Plenty of schools do not allow double majors with Dance. All of the faculty are extremely kind, understanding, and helpful, and truly want to us all grow. The food is better than many other places (though people still find reason to complain) and the school is always looking for ways to improve. We have a nice balance between the arts and STEM, and students get discounts for great performances that come to our theater. We have a strong emphasis on outreach and service, which is beneficial to both the students and the community. Also, we have Hurst Day. Enough said."
Sophomore,5,"Mercyhurst university is a beautiful campus. It is very safe and feels very home like.  The professors are very willing to do whatever they can to help you succeed as well as is the other staff at the college. I love my major, they make sure we are very well prepared to go to into our field and we are very qualified."
Alum,5,"Faculty is very supportive, accommodating and willing to work one-on-one. Class sizes are reasonable to not be lost in the crowd."
Freshman,5,"Mercyhurst University is a wonderful place. You're never ""just a number"" here. The professors and staff care about students and know them by name. Academics are great as well."
Freshman,5,"Mercyhurst has been a truly wonderful place to attend school so far. I love my classes and the professors who teach them as well as the friends I’ve made. If I were to change one thing about my school, though, it would be the limited resources offered to undecided students."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE attending Mercyhurst University. It offers the major and minor that I want to graduate with, along with numerous opportunities for improving my chances of getting hired with a career I want!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Mercyhurst because it truly feels like another home to me. Here, you're not just a number. They try hard to make sure everyone finds their place and the major that's right for them."
Sophomore,5,The professors in the Education Department are incredible. They want to see you succeed and make themselves available for so much more support than just teaching!
Freshman,5,I love the small campus and the great connections that the faculty has with the students. It is great to be able to sit in a lecture and have the professor know my name.
Niche User,5,My experience on my Mercyhurst tour was outstanding. It felt like home and everyone was very knowledgeable and welcoming. It was a complete campus tour and there is nothing I would change about my experience. Everything is so beautiful.
Freshman,5,"Mercyhurst has a beautiful campus and a great student-faculty ratio. Every professor knows students by name and wants them to succeed, helping them in any way possible."
Freshman,5,"I love the feeling I get from the small school community. Everyone is so welcoming and positive. The professor's are super helpful and understanding with any circumstances you may come across. Classes aren't too long, and there's plenty of time between class to not stress about being late. The campus is beautiful, and pretty small so it doesn't take forever to get to class. There's so much to do on campus, a lot of scheduled activities and a lot of space and places to just hang out with friends. Overall a really safe campus, I love every part of Mercyhurst!"
Freshman,5,"This campus has provided everything I needed, including my major and minors.  Not too many other colleges or universities have that.  The people here are very personal as well and give you that community feel."
Junior,5,"Mercyhurst is a great school with a very close-knit community.  The campus is beautiful, especially from the view from the main gates.  Class sizes are smaller, so students get to know each other and their professors.  Everyone can find their place in the Mercyhurst community, whether in a club, organization, or simply a group of friends.  Although it is a small school, there is a lot of diversity with students and faculty from all over the world."
Freshman,5,"Mercyhurst University is a wonderful school. I enjoyed my first semester and I felt at home. I made a lot of friends and great academic success, so far."
College Junior,5,"I have a good experience with the courses and professors on campus. Due to the small class size (an average of 20-30 people per class), I think I am getting the best classroom experience. There are a variety of different classes offered to accommodate for the different interests people have. Most professors use Power Points to lecture from, which I really like."
College Junior,5,Low to no crime rate on campus and areas around it
College Junior,5,Variety of sports to play
College Junior,5,Going back for another degree!
College Senior,5,The security guards are very friendly and approachable.
College Senior,5,As a first year student at Mercyhurst University North East I absolutely enjoy my experience!
College Freshman,5,"There's a good range of courses, as well as courses in any given major offered for freshmen.  The profs are great.  Because most of the classes are so small they know the students' names and their strengths and weaknesses.  It's very personal."
College Freshman,5,"I'm at my first choice school, one that has one of the best programs in the country for my major.  The clubs are great, my classes are worthwhile, and I overall love it.  There are many opportunities for me on campus in all areas that I'm interested in, which is nice.  I would choose my school again for both the program and the atmosphere itself."
Junior,4,"I like the tight knit community on campus, the opportunity for personal connection with professors, and the fun events and traditions."
Junior,4,Teachers have been very accommodating given the situation and are trying as best as possible to make online learning the same as being in the classroom.
Senior,4,"The process of transitioning from in-person classes to remote or online was difficult at first, but Mercyhurst has done a nice job of training professors and making sure students are learning in an enjoyable manner."
Sophomore,4,"At Mercyhurst University,  I can honestly say,  I have met some of the most wonderful, genuine people. This can be found in both the student life and the staff/faculty. Each student has the opportunity to create a relationship with each of their professors, counselors, and the AWESOME cafeteria staff which is extremely beneficial for both parties. The quality of food is great, but that all depends on your personal preference. The dorms there are actually quite nice except for two specific freshman dorms, but thats a part of the college experience. The bonding over creaky wooden floors and crazy hall mates is what brought me and the various friends I made together. Overall, Mercyhurst University always has their students best interest at heart and always have their phone lines open to discuss and problems you might be facing."
Sophomore,4,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, our campus was closed down for the rest of the semester, and many had to return home and finish classes online. Once situated back at home, classes began again, and it translated well from traditional classroom learning to online. Teachers there understood the struggles of online learning and made sure it was accessible or all and made sure everyone was able to learn. Labs, which thought to be the hardest with online courses, were excellent in an online environment with how our professors handled it. However, there were some points where it became difficult to engaged with the students in the class and became somewhat harder. However, many professors were willing to stay back and help students understand the current lesson."
Freshman,4,"I ended up taking all my courses online after my school sent us home because of Covid-19, but some of my teachers were not the best on transitioning from in person to online. However, there were a lot of teachers who were very good with communication with the students throughout the whole transition process and kept sending emails about what work is due the next few weeks."
Freshman,4,The teachers are very understanding and will help you with any problem you have. Overall very professional and organized.
Senior,4,Loved the small class sizes at mercyhurst. Never felt alone when I did anything. Beautiful campus and facilities
Freshman,4,"Warm and friendly campus. Professors and advisers are very knowledgeable and helpful. Mercyhurst cares about its students. Campus food is acceptable. There are plenty of amenities on campus. Campus is located in Erie Pennsylvania very close to many activities in the surrounding area. As a commuter, I find parking easy to find, and safe to walk through the surrounding neighborhoods to the campus."
Freshman,4,"I love it here at Mercyhurst. I feel the education I’m getting is great. In my art classes I can really tell that I’m developing in how my art looks. I feel this is preparing me in small increments so it’s not to overwhelming, which is nice."
Niche User,4,I went to Mercyhurst with my high school and I was surprised on how beautiful the campus was. I've been to many other college trips but Mercyhurst was my favorite. The food was made by the students and they did a good job of accommodating everyone. The teachers took time out of their schedule to come talk to students who didn't even go there. It was overall a nice visit and I plan on going there next fall as a freshman.
Freshman,4,"The grounds are gorgeous and the staff are all approachable. If you are someone who enjoys parties or activities with other people, you'll be pleased to know that the school hosts a whole slew of events (including a student favourite, Hurst Day, where all classes are cancelled for the day and the campus becomes akin to a fair or circus). There are also many places you can visit if you need help academically, including the Tutoring and Writing Centers."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Mercyhurst University. one of the things I like most is the professors really care about you as a person, one thing I don't like is how small the campus is and how little of people attend."
Sophomore,4,"There is always something to do here at Mercyhurst. The student council holds events every Friday and Saturday for students, so weekends are not just filled with homework. We have a bunch of clubs ranging from ice skating to an LGBT+ club. The theater program holds plays every couple of months and are a great time. From a graphic design major's perspective, the teachers here are excellent. They know how to get students jobs, which is excellent considering most art teachers only teach students the skills, but not how to apply those skills. The campus is beautiful, which is a major plus. One downside to Mercyhurst is the president makes plans without student input."
Junior,4,"My experience at Mercyhurst has been pleasant. I really like how everyone there from the teachers, in office staff, other students are very informative and helpful with any questions you may have. Only thing I would like to see change is more attention on the transfer students such as giving each of them mandatory tours around campus so they can learn their way around."
Senior,4,"A great school in that they have great ideas on how to keep students entertained, happy, and engaged. They are highly involved with the students and put on as many free programs/activities as they can. There are tons of giveaways and Hurst Day is a fantastic way to keep students motivated. Downside to all of these great ideas is that sometimes there’s no communication and the way that the school goes about things could be seen as wrong. 
The school is great in the sense that they are upgrading all of the facilities, the campus is absolutely beautiful, and the surrounding areas are very safe. The downtown nightlife is great and has a lot of options if you are 21, as well as plenty of options for those who are not 21, as well. There are a lot of good places to eat off-campus that are close, within walking distance, and some that are only a 10 minute drive. The cost of living is cheap to where you can go bowling for two hours (unlimited, w/shoe rental) for 10$ or to the movies for 5$."
Freshman,4,I like the beautiful scenery and the kind professors and staff members who work there. I also like the friendly and inviting atmosphere.
Junior,4,"I am a Junior Fashion Merchandising major at Mercyhurst University. The professors in my program are excellent, always willing to help and guide you in the right direction. My only complaint with the school is the location and weather. During the winter there is an obscene amount of snow and cold weather which makes it difficult to stay motivated at times."
Junior,4,"Mercyhurst is a beautiful campus with great academics, and focus on the teacher/ student relationship to advance the students education!"
Sophomore,4,"a majority of the staff was professional. Friendly and open atmosphere, small class sizes. Buildings need renovation"
Freshman,4,It is close to home and in a city so many amenities. They have been very friendly and helpful during sign up. My audition was stress free. Orientation is next week and they are sending me information and I feel prepared  I am excited about starting my future here!
Freshman,4,"I enjoy my time at Mercyhurst, small classes sizes which is helpful so I know my professors and they know me."
Sophomore,4,"I like it here. The campus is pretty, and usually has a lot of events. The food isn't bad and has a lot of options. A little hard to get a nice schedule but a lot of options even though its a small school."
Freshman,4,"The class sizes are small and the faculty really cares about the students. Most of the students here are serious about their education and there is not much partying, not to mention the non-existent Greek life. It's in close proximity to many attractions in Erie such as three huge hospitals for potential field work, a huge mall, presque isle state park and the lake, and many shops and restaurants in Erie, along with several performance venues. There is no shortage of things to do. There are vegan and dietary need options but there are not many, they are improving."
Junior,4,"Mercyhurst University has many pros and cons. Class sizes are small, but I would like to see improvement in the facilities they have for less popular majors."
Senior,4,Great school. Little pricey but over all I love the staff and everyone is very helpful. Great honor society and nursibg programs.
Sophomore,4,The small school exeperience is truly worth it. Definitely not a party school if youre looking for that. But if you want to form close friendships and focus on academics this is the school for you. The majority of the professors really want to see their students flourish.
Freshman,4,"As a commuter, I would love to see less of a separation between the students that live off campus to the school. It’s really hard to juggle school, work, and make time for a social live because the activities on campus are mainly geared toward the students that live in residence halls. The overall “college experience” is just different for commuters, and I think everyone should get the opportunity to experience college the way everyone dreams about it being like."
Niche User,4,Mercyhurst is a great catholic school. The professors are awesome and the atmosphere on campus is welcoming
Senior,4,Mercyhurst is an awesome school that is preparing me for my music education degree. The teachers in the music department are especially kind and want us to succeed. They offer an extra time for help. The music department is my family away from home.
Niche User,4,My sister seems to love her Alma Matter. She was majoring in architectural design but switched to psychology. Her only complaints seem to be that the band director is extremely strict and that her roommate she was paired with this year isn't very neat.
Freshman,4,"I love the faculty, they are very invested in the success of their students. Many go out of their way to help if you are in need of any assistance. Erie is a fun area to be in, lots of events and opportunities around. The cost is extensive which is my only real complaint."
Senior,4,"I’ve had a wonderful time here at Mercyhurst. The caring professors, small class sizes, clubs and organizations, and the dedication to Mercy Values are amazing."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school with a gorgeous campus. The academic support is very good about working with you to accomplish your goals. The only downside is that the surrounding area isn't very ""college friendly""."
Sophomore,4,I love the variety of clubs and activities. The professors truly care about the students and go out of their way to help them. The food isn't half bad.
Sophomore,4,"Mercyhurst university is a very well kept campus! Good professors, classes, student life. The campus is more concerned on looks than much else but still a great school."
Niche User,4,Mercyhurst University is a very excellent school because it's a small school so there is a chance for more help and interacting more with the professors.
Junior,4,"I am attending my dream school. Attending a liberal arts institution might not be appealing for everyone, but I truly feel like I am experiencing utter diversity in my studies from experts. I enjoy that each department is in tune with their students. I honestly have not had a professor I have disliked, and although that does not mean easy teachers or easy classes, it means I am being challenged, supported, and guided by all of the professors I have had so far. I truly love Mercyhurst for its community, beautiful campus, and overall help and guidance."
Junior,4,"Mercyhurst has a very beautiful campus since 1925. With numerous majors, top Intelligence studies, Fashion Merchandising, Archaeology and many more. Each class has no more than 35 students you have the opportunity to get to know your professors. The professors at Mercyhurst are amazing they truly care about your success. In addition, Mercyhurst is in a isolated area that makes the campus feel more like a community."
Freshman,4,"You can tell that all of the faculty really value your education and well-being. However, the main food area, the Grotto Commons' food is subpar at best, and the housing is too expensive for the quality of it."
Sophomore,4,"Wasn't so sure about my decision at the beginning of my freshman year, but now that I've started going to a lot more events and have become involved in more things, it's really a great place to be. There are so many opportunities! I'm a science major here, and so far the classes have been challenging, but they really make you know your stuff. Most of the profs I've encountered in my major are great."
College Junior,4,The teachers are all great they are very enthusiastic about their topics. The other students are all friendly. Everyone is helpful
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics is great, we have just about anything you would like to do. Also some of our teams are nationally ranks in the NCAA. The small pick up leagues are nice too, the intramural soccer, football and hockey."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is amazing and all the faculty are very helpful. No one is ever given the cold shoulder, everyone at mercyhurst is welcomed."
College Freshman,4,The classes here are great and the professors are very helpful. I like that they have a wide variety of classes.
College Freshman,4,Housing is nice there are things that can be fixed but other than that it's nice
College Freshman,4,I am liking the schools and I really like my classes and how the teachers teach.
College Junior,4,There are always internship and job opportunities professors are telling the students about. There are usually job fairs in the fall and spring that can help students determine what they would like to do.
College Junior,4,"I always feel safe walking around campus due to the amount of safety stands- there are numerous ""safety"" polls where you can press a button to connect to police and safety if you are not feeling safe."
College Junior,4,"The athletics at Mercyhurst are some of the best. We have an awesome D1 Hockey team, so going to the games in the winter is always fun to do."
College Junior,4,"So far, I am having a great experience at Mercyhurst University. If I could start all over again, I would think about choosing a less expensive college, but I do not believe that I would receive the same education at a less expensive school than I would here at Mercyhurst. Carpe Diem!"
College Junior,4,a lot of students show up to various games and school always gives out free shirts and other cool things during the games
College Junior,4,"Mercyhurst University is a smaller school with around 5,000 students currently enrolled. Out of those 5,000 more than 1,000 of students are internationals which adds a lot of diversity to the campus and invites different cultures to learn from each other. With a smaller sized campus the feeling of home is everywhere, among your friends, roommates, professors and even caffeteria staff. Mercyhurst University prides itself with it's beautiful campus which reminds every student of Hogwarts with just aa little bit more flowers! I love this school, and I'm grateful for all the people I've meet and all the knowledge and skills I've gained. I would recommend this school to anyone!"
College Junior,4,I feel safe when I'm on campus
College Junior,4,Most of the student in school are athlete
College Junior,4,Mercyhurst is a great school!
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletic teams are an important part of the school but need to be more open to walk-ons.
Recent Alumnus,4,Mercyhurst University has a variety of extracurricular activities to participate in.
College Senior,4,The school often has career fairs and the academic center is available for all students.
College Freshman,4,"The drug scene is pretty small and not very evident, and while the alcohol scene is bigger and more prevalent, there is no pressure to partake."
Freshman,2,"If you can go to a cheaper in-state school..... then go, its expensive for no reason. The best majors here are Intel and Hospitality."
Freshman,2,"I originally chose this school because from the outside it seemed like the perfect place. It seemed like there was so much school pride, tons of opportunity and everyone seemed so nice and welcoming. After a short month I realized this school wasn't for me. After being there, I realized there was no school pride. Barley anyone went to football or even our hockey games. I tried to get involved in different clubs, for example the sailing club, which folded because they couldnt get student government to acknowledge or help fund the club. The one thing I did really enjoy about the school was the academics. My teachers were very passionate about what they were doing and were willing and able to assist you whenever needed. I do recommend this school to people who like a very small school feel and are very very dedicated to their academics, but be careful to pay attention between the difference of a small college and a high school."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a bigger high school, mercyhurst was not the right fit for me. I felt like I was in high school all over again as I saw the same people every day and was treated like a high school student.  Professors are very strict about having a phone out in class and attendance as well.  This university really does hold your hand all the way through which I didn't like.  There are also only 2 different places to eat on campus which gets very old especially as a freshman.  There really isn't much school spirit/things to do on weekends as well. Every once in awhile there will be a good house party but they all get busted at some point in the night every weekend.  Mercyhurst really does not allow for much freedom/fun for the students it's a very strict academic school"
College Sophomore,2,"I pay way too much money to be here, and I'm not happy with the staff."
College Sophomore,2,The housing is not that great. The best is the Warde dorms. Other than that the apartments are not the best and they are too expensive for what they are. They need to be updated badly.
College Freshman,2,Mostly pizzas and burger places. There are a few Italian places about 20 mins away but still not good enough if you want to take your date to.
College Freshman,2,"Get used to basement parties overcrowded with too many guys and too few girls, the smell of vomit, and a about enough alcohol for 10 people shared by over 100."
College Freshman,2,"All the financial aid goes to athletes, if you're not an athlete don't bother applying."
College Freshman,2,There are so many athletes here who can barely manage a 2.0 and make classes difficult with their mental handicap.
College Freshman,2,Erie is where hopes and dreams go to die. This is not a college town. Erie is full of drunks and drug addicts.
College Freshman,2,Too far from the university
College Junior,2,I did not get much assistance even after emailing and stopping for help.  I missed a lot of scholarships because I didn't know I would still need so much aid.  It was a little disheartening.
College Sophomore,2,makes many sick could use more health/organic
College Sophomore,2,"I would advise going somewhere else. It is a pretty high priced college and with the weather and lack of night life, it can easily be a big regret."
College Sophomore,2,"There is absolutely no parking, and if you try to park somewhere you are not aloud you will get a ticket. Also campus security, along with Erie police drive around constantly on weekend nights and are very intolerant of noise of any kind."
College Freshman,2,"The drug use is not that huge at Mercyhurst University, but many students drink alcohol like it is water on the weekends"
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are small

The food is not always promising

The cost is outrageous"
College Junior,2,"The social atmosphere for me has been excellent everywhere I lived on campus. However the buildings are old and plain. Lots of issues with plumbing, and heat isn't turned on until maintenance thinks it is needed."
College Junior,2,"Rough weather during the winter, and classes are almost never cancelled. It would suck living off campus, but if you live on it, its doable, if not fun. However maintenance needs to get the major walkways cleared before classes start."
College Junior,2,"Being only a few miles from Lake Erie the weather can be very unpredictable. In the fall it can get pretty cold, it snows almost everyday in the winter and rains almost everyday in the spring. However those days that its not raining or snowing is beautiful and campus is always buzzing and full of energy on those days."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Makes you fat, the put things in it to make you go to the bathroom. Overly priced."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Erie weather is crazy and unpredictable in the winter. Freshman year the dorms were in campus and the sidewalks were always cleaned no matter the massive amounts of snow. Sophomore year I moved into an apartment next to campus (but still considered campus) but it barely snowed at all.. so no problems. However, Junior year was a whole new story. The school hired. company for the campus maintenance instead of work study students, and the sidewalks are NEVER cleared. When some are, they're random and not all of them, they use mounts of salt on occasion. So the snow ends up super packed down and into I've and it's impossible to walk anywhere without slipping all over the place.. they need to figure out their winter maintenance routine before too many people get hurt because classes are never cancelled so we are forced to walk through the mess."
College Senior,2,"To me this is one of the worst parts of Mercyhurst. The housing generally poor. The freshman housing is ""lived in and small"" but I liked my room a lot. There is also a new dorm which is nice. But starting at sophomore housing it gets pretty bad. Many of the apartments are run down and one of the biggest issues this year is leaking and mold."
College Sophomore,2,"Most are out of date and need to be fixed. Most of the buildings, even the new intel building flooded this past year and it took them days to fix it. If you live anywhere on campus but the new freshman Warde dorm, be careful for mold and bedbugs, two problems which are prevalent on campus which they have tried to silence. Be proactive about your living situation and be a pest to the housing people until you get what they want. You are paying close to 3 times the average local rent so you shouldn't be nice when it comes to problems"
College Freshman,2,"The school has a shuttle, but it runs at awkward times.  The city buses are a couple blocks from the school, but they run infrequently, and don't always adhere to the given schedule.  Even though we don't pay to ride the E, you really need a car."
College Junior,2,4 Seasons – Expect it to be hot in the summer and cold in the winter with lots of snow
College Junior,2,Not Much – Most students seem to come from good white families
College Sophomore,2,"Snow and Rain Galore – Because Erie is right on Lake Erie, there is a lot of snow and rain. Classes rarely get cancelled due to the weather."
College Freshman,2,"Crowded but Important – If you do not have a car then it can get pretty boring being on campus 24/7. But the cost to get a car permit is pretty expensive and if you do then the parking availability is not enough. Also, police and safety do not give any slack on ticketing so if you are in the wrong area then you can expect a ticket and fine."
College Freshman,2,Dreary Erie – Erie is located right by the lake so winter and spring is snowy and rainy. There is already not a lot to do around the city and the horrible weather makes it worse.
College Freshman,2,"Not Accepting – There is a good amount of diversity among the students at Mercyhurst; however, the acceptance and accommodations could be more prevalent. There are people of many different racial backgrounds, but not many different religious backgrounds. This is a Catholic school and many teachers and advisers assume everyone practices Catholicism."
College Freshman,2,Good luck finding parties – Mercyhurst has no fraternities so the burden of throwing parties falls on upperclassmen who rent houses.  Friday and saturday night you can usually find a party but they are not always that great.  If you want to party during the week you are out of luck.  Erie does have a few clubs and bars but they are rarely crowded
College Freshman,2,Good...for a week – The food from the main dining hall isn't very good.  The menu is very repetitive and most foods are very bland tasting.  Some things from the caf are good but they are few and far between.  The laker inn in the basement of the student union offers slightly better options but the freshman dining plan doesn't pay for meals there.
College Freshman,2,Not a thing to do – Erie is lacking in ways for student to do.  The locals don't really embrace the students.  As far as the neighborhood surrounding Mercyhurst goes there really isn't anything within walking distance other than a CVS an Arby's and of course the liquor store.  Local family owned restaurants are almost non existent.  If you want a meal off campus good luck finding anywhere other than a chain restaurant.
College Sophomore,2,The facilities could be better. there needs to be more places to study and places for students to hang out besides their dorms and apartments. I really wish there was a big student union where a large amount of students can hang out.
Recent Alumnus,2,Small College = Not Many Options – I only spent one year in the dorms at Mercyhurst College and that was enough. They were old and too small for 2 young women. My second year at Mercyhurst they built new dorms for incoming freshman so the dorm experience could be better at this point but I would not be able to tell you. It is a small campus so no matter what dorms you stay in you are close to everything. Try to get into the newer ones!!! Campus food is half-decent and as a freshman you are forced to have a dining plan so I wouldn't complain about the food you are literally being forced to eat. Otherwise I would go to the local farmers markets and get food that way.
College Freshman,2,"Cars=amazing. People can get where they need to go.

NO car=public bus. free! but, sometimes inconvenient. only goes to the same places all the time"
College Freshman,2,"Freshman: Arby's, Corner Stone, Pizza place.

Everyone else (with a car): any place you want to drive.

suckss!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"There Were Drugs? Drinking is preferred, but of course there were drugs present.  The real debate is whether the minor presence as a problem or a potential area of expansion."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Private Catholic Expectations? The school is a small private catholic college, do people really attend for the diversity?  There were individuals from every creed, race, color, origin, and background so it was technically diverse but for all intensive purposes it was not."
College Freshman,2,"Not for Everyone – The school has 2 options for meals: Egan Dining Hall and The Laker.  Egan recently changed their food service to Parkhurst Dining and the food is alright. There is a sandwich station, a small buffet line (2 hot vegetables, starch, protein, vegetarian option), then there is a station where a chef will make one dish usually of a certain culture (ie asian), and there is a grill station (fries, burger, hot dogs, sometimes chicken). These places all are monitored and some of the servers won't give you more than one serving. There is pizza, a salad bar, cereal, and toast that is always offered and you serve yourself. If you don't go during meal times though there isn't much to choose from and there are rarely good soups.
The Laker is in the basement of the Student Union and there is a wok, grill, mexican, and sub shop. It can get really busy and food may take awhile. Its not a good choice if you're in a hurry between classes. Quality is questionable though, it really depends on who makes it and such. 
I guess how you feel about the food is in respects to what you're used to."
College Senior,2,Dry Campus – Dry campus makes on campus night life non existant. North East police have nothing better to do than bust people for drinking. Go downtown or at least out of the town of North East.
College Junior,2,"Drug Scene – small college, tighter relationships with the students, which makes the inevitable by-product of drinking/smoking a definite"
College Junior,2,"I know that financial Aid is very busy with the school year coming around, but, it is very hard for me to contact them. I have tried calling, leaving messages, emailing, and showing up to recieve help. One tip that I could give would be to possibly have more financial aid staff to help. I feel as though they have too many students versus the staff to be able to help students in a timely manner. I can say that when I do reach them they are very helpful. Financial aid is a big stressor, not just for me but all students! So, It would make a big difference if more staff were available to help."
College Sophomore,2,"NOT ENOUGH – Unless you have a 8:00 am class, getting a good parking spot is impossible.  After 10:00 am, the only parking is across campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Wouldn't Know – I went to Mercyhurst for Archaeology and spent the majority of my time in the basement of the science building.  I have never been very sports oriented, but what I can tell you is that hockey is the big thing on campus.  Even I knew who the hockey players were and went to a few games, and like I said I am very sports unaware."
College Junior,2,"Average College Life – The attractions nearby are somewhat limited around Mercyhurst College.  Besides Presque Isle and Peach Street, there isn't much else to do.  I don't feel that students are really safe during the dark hours because there have been many stories of assaults, etc. on or near our campus.  The mall is decent in Erie and there are good restaurants, but unless you have a car, Erie is not the most exciting place."
College Junior,2,"I am a commuting student at Mercyhurst College, so I do not eat on campus, but I know that some of my friends think that meal plans are too expensive, especially because they don't always use them."
College Senior,2,"The wind can get really bad in the winter, worse than Ohio."
College Senior,2,"The off campus housing, if interested, only seems to be available early in the year when some students haven't even begun to think about the next year. Also some of the housing is further away from campus where you need a car and from what I have heard it can get expensive. Not many college students besides sports teams rent a house."
College Junior,2,Limited Parking Available given the amount of cars. many spots that appear to be available end up causing you a ticket for parking in it. Many spots require a lot of walking and freshman especially have to park their cars across campus.
College Junior,2,"Get Yourself a Car – Public transportation is kind of a joke, and is only used by desperate freshmen, or if your friends left you downtown, drunk, and without a ride. Unfortunately, the massive amounts of snow makes caring for your car a pain in the ass, but it's better than any other option."
College Senior,2,Sports Are Not So Hot – The varsity sports at Mercyhurst are not that great or well attended with the exception of hockey.  A lot of people use the gym facilities though.
College Sophomore,2,"The Facilities on campus are average or satisfactory. The gym could be a bit bigger (to allow more room and less crowding with all the people that want to use the gym, especially after the breaks/vacations.) Also, the campus could use a bit of expanding. With the university status on the way, the campus needs to grow, there is now an extra dorm to allow more people on campus, but the campus is beginning to get cramped."
College Senior,2,The actual sports team aren't bad but there is absolutely no school spirit.
College Senior,2,"food is either always the same or something crazy, like a foreign dish you would never eat. Sometimes they need to be more simple as that is usually the only type of food that is good on campus."
College Senior,2,There are no rewards or differentiation for good and bad students.
College Junior,2,"Small Houses Are Over-Priced – Houses are available for rent very close to campus but are very expensive. They are about the same price as on campus housing, and they tend to randomly charge service fees."
College Junior,2,"Ever hear of Seasonal Affective Disorder? If you end up going to Mercyhurst you'll probably learn what it's like real quick. The campus is super pretty, don't get me wrong, but once you get half way through the winter and a ridiculous amount of snow, it starts to get real ugly. I joke on a regular basis that I'm going to walk into lake Erie, usually because ANYTHING sounds better then walking through 3 feet of snow (up a hill in my case) to get to class. Also, don't plan on your classes getting canceled, even if your experiencing a blizzard. It never happens. And just some advice, you should probably invest in some hardcore snow shoes if you end up going to Mercyhurst. I never enjoy slipping on the snow/ice and falling in front of half the campus.... it gets old after the third time."
College Senior,2,"Not Very Diverse – Our school has a pretty high percentage of international students, but they're not very present in clubs other than their own.  I don't know if it's the students or the campus not making an effort."
Alum,1,"I did not take on-line classes while I was at Mercyhurst, therefor I cannot rate the learning experience."
Alum,1,"I went to Mercyhurst as an adult learner and tried applying to their grad PA program.  It was a nightmare. 1st, they could not offer the class I needed but instead offered me, 2 classes, with 2 labs, which cost me twice the price of the class i needed. they reassured me that they didn't know of other classes they provide until I found the class I needed in their catalog. then they tried to charge me 900 dollars of insurance money even though I provided them my own insurance. I had to email the president about it and only then they have resolved the issue. 
Next, when applying to their PA grad school, they had no idea what they were doing! They were not accredited at that time. After 2 month of waiting period i finally called to find out that i had something missing, that the admissions office told me i did not need."
Works Here,1,"The place is actually terrible and I am quitting within the next few weeks. Anyone who plans to go here in the future for work or school, all I have to say is good luck :)"
Senior,1,Mercyhurst is awful. Majority of the professors are lazy and the hardest part about the classes you will take is going to class.
College Freshman,1,"For how much of an ""athletic"" school it is, i was extremely disappointed with the facilities. Especially the football field and weight room.  It's absolutely embarrassing."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life on campus.  I'm only writing anything in this section/chose answers for this section because I was required to in order to move on.
College Sophomore,1,we dont have that here
College Sophomore,1,"Have had miserable experiences with Residence Life. I pay $6,200 for a very small apartment."
Recent Alumnus,1,We do not have greek life
College Freshman,1,"We have the worst greek life, because we don't have it"
College Sophomore,1,The weather here is terrible. If there was one I could change about my college it would be the weather.
College Freshman,1,Snowy and windy and painfully moody.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek life.
College Junior,1,"There's an Arby's, a bar, and two sandwich/pizza shops off campus within walking distance. Only one of them is any good."
College Sophomore,1,you can't parl on campus unless you have a pass. most students park on the street which sometimes sucks when it snows and they plow the roads...cars get stuck in the snow. My best advice is drive a lifted truck because i went through hell and back to get to work during the winter months because i drive a mid size car.
College Junior,1,Freshmen dorms are great but after that are too old
College Freshman,1,"Downright awful. One minute it is raining, then hailing, then hailing. Very unpredictable."
College Sophomore,1,"The Mercyhurst Financial aid office completelty sucks. The aid the school gives you is great but if you have any questions going to the student financial office is a complete waste of time. They are rude, and dont even know how to help you."
College Freshman,1,"At Mercyhurst the food does not taste very good.  They have two dining halls, the Student Union and Eagan Dining hall.  Student Union costs separate money.  Eagan offers a starbucks coffee station, a made to order sandwich station, a regular breakfast/lunch/dinner station, Pizza Station, Soup/Salad/Fruit station, Waffle/bagels/breads station, icecream, cookies and snacks, and a fried station of assorted grilled or fried foods, and another station set up for random different foods during lunch and dinner."
College Freshman,1,Look out – You are given 3 alcohol strikes but the 3rd will get you suspended 2 terms.  Drinking in the dorms is risky and RA's can stop you if they think you have alcohol in your backpack.  The campus police are a little too big for their britches considering they are rent a cops and love driving around campus giving students the death stare.

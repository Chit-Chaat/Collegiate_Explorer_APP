Senior,5,I came back to this college after already receiving a degree here. I am a veteran and they have dealt with the VA whereas other colleges could not or had no knowledge.
Sophomore,5,Trine University is a perfect school for students searching for a smaller university experience without sacrificing education quality.
Junior,5,"From the first time I visited the campus of Trine University, I fell in love with it. From the class sizes to the professors; it was a dream come true to be a student at this university. If you are looking for a school that doesn’t charge extra for out of state tuition, this is the school for you."
Junior,5,"Classes were a challenge to handle online, but we students managed to pull it off. Internet issues and technical issues were the main problems that went on, but nothing severe. Professors made it clear to keep studying and made sure to inform the students to reach out if help is needed."
Senior,5,"My experience at Trine has been fantastic so far. The vast majority of the professors are very friendly and genuinely want you to learn and pass their class. The buildings are nice and well-kept. There is always one or more construction projects happening on campus, improving or adding to some part of it."
Junior,5,"TrineOnline is a unique experience that I was NOT prepared for at all. I was so completely stressed out about the format and not being in a classroom sitting front and center jotting down all the notes and paying attention. I struggled HARDCORE, but with the level of compassion and love for education and their students, the online professors extended themselves as the valuable resources they are assuring me that I was not alone. My professor for a high level Psychology course reacted instantaneously to my stressed out email regarding the beginning of the semester by immediately reassuring me that I would not be left to drown in material, but that she would also extend one on one time if need be and particularly called me and worked over the first two chapters of the course. Further, the transition to online class for our regular in class purses was seen less and offered a surreal experience comparable to the experience TrineOnline provides."
Junior,5,"I went into the whole college experience unprepared, misguided, and with no specific interests from what I wanted from it. I knew what I wanted to major in and become, but nothing more and nothing less. With my tour of Trine and meeting with my now Academic advisor and one of my Major’s head of the Dept. I knew that Trine was for me. The past two years, and this year specifically I benefited plentifully due to the close quarters interactions and small student-staff ration. Moreover, the level of gratitude and respect I have towards all members of the staff is immeasurable as they truly go above and beyond to help you find the best opportunities academically, socially, and with your collegiate and professional career. Even with TrineOnline, I struggled because I’m a very hands on/visual student and the online instructor called me and went over the chapters with me that I was struggling with simply due to the format. This year was incredible, even with regard to the global pandemic."
Sophomore,5,To me Trine feels as though it is a second home. I enjoy the workload that the professors give and the time they spend on making sure you know exactly what you are doing to further your education. The dorm life is outstanding and the people I have met along the way are a second family yo me as well. Overall Trine University has given me everything I not only want but need to pursue my lifelong career!
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently a sophomore at Trine University studying Biomedical Engineering. So far I have had a fantastic experience at Trine, from the amazing friendly professors to the beautiful engaging campus. There is always something to do, and always someone to help you. I can't imagine receiving a better education anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"Trine gives you more opportunities to make connections with students , professors, and alumni. These connections help grow your web of resources which inter leads you to a internship, CO-OPS, and finally the career your looking for. Trine has a vast amount of resources to help students to succeed such as an online library that has access to libraries and the large amount of electronic books and articles they hold in their data base. It may be small but there is something you can always do during the week. They have the Ignite/Surge program that gives you points towards an auction at the end of the semester where various products are auctioned off. Trine is ever expanding adding onto its's engineering building that is soon to go under construction."
Sophomore,5,"I love Trine! The teachers are great, the people are great, and the campus is so pretty. I wouldn't change a thing, it is perfect if you want a small school with a college experience!"
Freshman,5,"It's just my first semester at Trine University but I really love it there. I am close enough to home that I can go home easily but stay on campus for convenience (time and gas wise). I have some great friends who enjoy all the extra activities after class hours with me. The teachers are really involved and many know my name, which is hard to expect especially with all the students they have. Trine is also small enough that you are able to go to your teachers for any help."
Senior,5,"I really enjoy Trine at his best. A small school that is being grown in a super-fast pace, with the addition of the hockey ice arena and the MTI center is the most beautiful place to be, proud to be a Thunder."
Niche User,5,"Trine University had a very welcoming and kind staff. I have been to a few events in the past for school, and they were always well organized. They allowed me to meet the Dean of Education on my college visit, and it is very evident that they truly care about the incoming freshmen. The school even offered a follow-up meeting so they can help me with financial aid, scholarships, etc. to best prepare me before I start school. They are an amazing university that I would highly recommend, especially for those entering the field of education."
Junior,5,"With such a small campus, everyone knows everyone. Which allows for great groups of friends to be made and an overall close relationship within the school. The school itself is fully dedicated to the success of the students."
Freshman,5,"Incoming Freshman, I was welcomed with opening arms. Easy transition. Answered all my questions, they were always there when I called. I'm playing football there this fall, teammates have been great. Facilities are great. My academics counselor was fantastic. I can't wait to start in the exercise science field. Just an over all great experience."
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at Trine so far has been great. The staff is very friendly and the professor are always willing to answer any questions you have. The housing and buildings on campus are very clean and an overall good experience.
Sophomore,5,"I love Trine University. I like the smaller campus and how hard the employees work to make our experience great and memorable. I love the on campus activities the school puts on to help you make friends and get out of your comfort zone. Bigger schools do not out forth that kind of effort. Overall, the only thing I would like to see change is the price, but that's nothing but a dream."
Niche User,5,My visit to Trine was amazing. The atmosphere was incredible and the faculty members were the best I have met. Facilities on campus were impeccable and well maintained. It was a great experience.
Niche User,5,"Trine University has a very warm environment. When I toured the campus, everyone was very welcoming and nice. The safety around the college is amazing and the dorms appear to be very comforting."
Niche User,5,Nice campus with multiple activities for students to get involved in.  Dorms are clean with various living options.
Niche User,5,Trine University is a great school with great Instructors. The staff in the office are very helpful with helping you decide your future and are very encouraging and uplifting.
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high school and I have gone on a visit to Trine and plan to go on more visits. When I went on my visit, I was given a full campus tour. I love the fact that the library, writing center, health center, cafeteria, and so much more are all located in the same building. Something that makes Trine unique is the fact that laundry, printing, and home athletic activities are free because the University already knows you’re paying to go there, so why make you pay extra for simple services."
Niche User,5,"Trine is a private college. It is just the right size for me, not to big and not to small. The campus made me feel safe, secure, and comfortable. The dorms are more like little apartments. Trine doesn't do sports scholarships only academic ones, which is great. I am more focused on my academics then sports. Trine has exactly what I need, like a major and minor, for what I want to pursue. Trine is also far, but still in Indiana which is great."
Sophomore,5,Trine is always finding new and exciting things for us to do. There is always a chance to meet new people and gain experience. The classes are smaller and more personal so you get to connect with your professor more as well as your advisors.
Junior,5,"Trine is an excellent school, the professors are amazing and are always willing to help inside and outside the classroom, trine does a very good job as well of keeping kids on campus connected."
Senior,5,"At Trine University, I feel that the teachers genuinely care about each and every student.  Teachers do everything that they can to help students further their education."
Junior,5,"Very safe and friendly. Greek life here is different from anywhere else I have been; no one judges you for not being Greek and if you are Greek you aren't usually stuck up or rude. Professors are genuinely concerned when you don't show up to class. The dorms are like hotels all with private baths and controllable AC (except traditional styles). Housing off campus (save for Greek life) is super expensive and really not worth it for the condition they're in. Would definitely recommend staying on campus and upgrading to the Villas as an upperclassmen. The food is good at first, but gets boring after awhile try to downgrade to a lower meal plan. There is a party scene, but it manages to be fun and safe. Math department isn't great but the engineering, chemistry, physical therapy and business departments are all great programs. Would not recommend liberal arts majors."
Freshman,5,"I liked the culture they have there, they make you feel at home and widen your look on college. It’s a good fit with plenty of activities to stay involved in what’s going on and meeting all kinds of different backgrounds."
Junior,5,I really like how great the teachers are. I think they should make it more of a food court rather than buffet style.
Sophomore,5,"This past year at Trine University I have become very close to all the people I have met. It is a great place to meet new people and to get involved. There are plenty of things to do at Trine. Some which include, participating in a sport, band, attending concerts or a sporting event, going to all of the fun activities throughout the year hosted by all of the different clubs, and much more. You'll always know what's going on around campus as well! They are great at advertising events! It's very easy to talk with professors too! Whether you need help or just want some clarification, just ask! I have loved every minute at Trine and I'm super excited to see what the next few years bring!"
Freshman,5,I like the academic approach on this campus. At Trine University there is a lot of one to one with the professors. They provide a lot of help.
Graduate Student,5,"Trine University offers education in various programs for local and International students, The teaching method of this university is very unique and the professors highly motive the students, Trine is like a family for me every semester a lot of International students graduate from this university with a high rank and knowledge in there field of Interesr, The success rate of this university is very high."
Freshman,5,"At Trine University, everyone is somebody, instead of just another face in the crowd. I absolutely love Trine due to the clean campus, athletics, clubs, and professors. All of my professors care about each student beyond their academic career, and take time to learn about you. Trine is also a small campus, which is surprisingly great because I know everyone. Something I would like to see changed on campus is the parking and the food. The food is a hit and miss as far as how good it is, and the parking is atrocious since there aren't enough parking spots. Therefore, I absolutely love Trine and can't wait to see it grow even more."
Niche User,5,This college gave me the small home feel I have always looked for. it allows you to have a personal visit even if you are in  a group setting. the professors and students are amazing at including you in all activities while on visits and the food is really good.
Niche User,5,Trine is excellent! Nothing but good things to say! I love their science department. Food is great -- lots of options. Some dorms are nice and others are nasty.
Freshman,5,"Great school there is always some activity to partake in. Being a part of Trine you will never feel like a number you will be known like family, you can also get to know your professor."
Niche User,5,"When I visited Trine University last month it was an unforgettable experience. The amount of hard work and effort the owners and employees do is something out movies. They sit down and talk with the students to discuss what Trine could do better or offer. Such as last year, a group of students bowled all through high school but Trine did not have a bowling team. So, they talked with Trine and inevitably they started their own club and played a few other colleges nearby that had bowling teams. They actually did quite well. As of the fall semester of 2017 arises, a 6 lane bowling alley is being built and a bowling team had been established."
Freshman,5,I like how Trine takes how well their students are doing seriously and have so many programs to aid struggling students. They also have a lot of unique housing choices that give options for what a student would want. They also have very helpful professors that care about their students. Their admissions process is also very personal and the student feels that the University truly cares about your experience and wants you at their school.
Junior,5,"The professors here always there to help, the campus is gorgeous, we get a lot of free trine merchandise, and there are MANY student organizations available!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"I wouldn't go anywhere else, the class sizes are small and comfortable. The classes you can choose from is a wide range. The teachers and other faculty are very friendly and take that extra mile to make sure you are completely satisfied and have all you questions answered."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The value of the degree from trine can take you far, it is highly notable around this area."
Recent Alumnus,5,Trine University has been my dream college since graduating high school and it has been nothing short of it. I love the atmosphere and the programs and classes you can choose from. I would definitely recommend Trine to anyone.
College Senior,5,Career Services = most helpful office on campus!
College Senior,5,Small school but has lots of greek life. Almost 50% greek life.
College Sophomore,5,Ready to get a job on campus.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe.
College Sophomore,5,The greek like in campus is outstanding.
College Junior,5,Apparently we have a 99+% career placement rate after graduating within six months so I'd say that's one of the best
College Freshman,5,"While being at Trine, I didn't experience any campus crime. The campus is a very safe place and they have poles located around campus for students who have a problem to push. They also have a system to where if you call the number, they will walk you across campus to keep you from feeling unsafe."
College Freshman,5,"Classes at Trine are very comfortable. Though some of the classrooms are very dull, the professors make up for it. The professors are really outgoing and strive to help their students. Sizes are average making it not overwhelming. With classes ranging from 20-40, it makes it easier for the professors to get to know you one on one."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is something that is very big at Trine University. Because I am in a sorority, it makes it easy to talk about. The fraternities and sororities on campus is full of outgoing individuals who strive to help out everyone and their community. They are more than willing to help anyone out. Non-Greeks look at Greeks as if they're just another one of the students at Trine. Housing that is available is only for the fraternities. This is because the sororities houses don't tend to be recognized."
College Freshman,5,Everything at Trine University has been to my benefit. The advisors are exploding to get to know you on a more personal level making them very easy to talk to. The professors I have encountered were easy to contact and talk to whenever I had a question about my grades or the class overall. They have a lab that is open 24/7 making it very accessible to get work done if my laptop crashes or if I need to print out anything. Everything is close together making it a small and friendly university.
College Junior,5,I have help when I need it and they know my name and have helped me gain internships.
College Junior,5,Everybody I have talked to that has graduated has had a job lined up before graduating.
College Junior,5,You will know all of your classmates in your field and work on projects with them throughout your schooling. The professors are very helpful and their doors are always open.
College Freshman,5,Looking forward to working with them in the fall
College Freshman,5,The education here is excellent
College Freshman,5,Every day I get about five emails containing a job/internship opportunity. They really care about your success after school.
College Freshman,5,"At Trine University, the student is not just a number but a part of the community. Professors know you by name and want you to succeed. Choosing Trine University was a great decision and I recommend anyone interested in a strong community and a great education, come to Trine!"
Senior,4,"Most of these courses seem pretty structured. Though some have flaws, they seem to be addressed at a relatively fast pace."
Sophomore,4,Trine University has an entirely separately staffed campus entirely dedicated to online learning at an excellent quality and accessibility.
Sophomore,4,The staff are all excellent and are very friendly and helping for every student. The facilities are mostly new and well maintained. The food is better than anticipated for most school establishments. The academics are great preparation for the workforce. Job placement rates are impeccable. Trine University really is a gem in a more rural area.
Sophomore,4,"The reason I gave this 4 stars is not because professors did not adapt well to online learning, but simply because I do not perform well through online learning. That said, the professors handled the transition very well by implementing policies that allow more leeway for assignments, cutting down the amount or intensity of assignments, and spending more time on topics since the face to face compatibility was lost. Overall, a very good experience, if you yourself are compatible with online learning that is."
Sophomore,4,Personally I did not take any classes online for the full duration of my schooling. I did hear that taking an online course was a huge help for athletes in season and those trying
Sophomore,4,"Expensive, but it is worth it. Professors care, and the environment is loving. The overall feeling that the University gives is like no other. Trine gives you a great college experience, and on top of that, the staff and administrators are all looking for you to succeed. The classroom sizes are manageable and orderly"
Freshman,4,"I'm a student athlete at Trine University, environment is safe, food is decent, and education is fine."
Sophomore,4,All the professors and Advisors are really nice and actually care about the students. There are also really good food provided at a low price.
Freshman,4,Trine University is a great college with close knit small town feel.  Excellent opportunities for academics and sports with top notch facilities!
Sophomore,4,"I love that Trine is a small school. I am close with my professors and I feel comfortable talking with them! It's a short walk to anywhere on campus, which really helps in the winter. The food is better than normal schools, but after a while, you get used to it."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere. It doesn't feel like a small college, yet it's easy to find the opportunities that a small college offers. Small class sizes, easy access to professors, and even easier access to help sessions and tutoring if you are ever struggling. It's so easy to make friends here, especially through athletics. But even if you're not an athlete, there are so many ways to get involved and meet new people all over campus. I'e already met some people that I think will be my friends for the rest of my life. The food options here are also excellent. The cafeteria is buffet style, which is very beneficial as an athlete. There are always 3 or even 4 options of a wide variety. Plus, you can always go and swipe at the depot, which I would equate to qdoba or chipotle. It's a fantastic place to be, and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
Sophomore,4,"I love that it’s a small campus and that I can have more help from professors! The food is good compared to other colleges, and it takes 10 minutes tops to walk to class. There are two coffee shops on campus, one you can actually use meal swipes at for breakfast and lunch so that’s really nice. I would like to have a pool/swim team on campus. The closest is at the Y. Also at the coffee shops lunch starts at 10:30 am and you have to buy coffee instead of getting it with your meal swipe, so it would be nice to have lunch at 11 that way I don’t have to get up super early to get coffee included with my meal. There are “flex dollars” which you get $75 of a semester and you can use those to buy stuff with instead of actual cash if you run out of meal swipes, it’s extremely helpful!"
Freshman,4,"Trine University has an extremely nice campus, and the professors genuinely care about your success in the classroom, and in your future."
Sophomore,4,"Professors get to know you as a friend and mentor, easy to find friends and groups to join.  The community has everything needed and more for students away from home."
Junior,4,I like Trine because its close to my home. I also like Trine because of the instructors and the faculty. I think the curriculum is spot on for my degree and the saff are very helpful.
Alum,4,"Good academics with great facilities in a great area. While Trine lacks the academic rigor of many private institutions, it definitely does enough to help its students succeed."
Niche User,4,They are very helpful with the admission process. They make you feel welcome. The campus is beautiful and the housing is nice. The cafeteria is very accommodating and the food is pretty good. All in all I think they have a very nice school and I hope to go there in the fall.
Senior,4,"My overall experience with Trine University has been a great one.  It is a smaller college that offers what all the big colleges offer.  My siblings both graduated from Trine University, also.  One in the education field and one in the business field.  Both have great jobs."
Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small with a focus on the students.   Professors are very accessible and helpful.  The focus is on student success.  Internships are a strong part of the curriculum and professors are active in helping students obtain them.
Sophomore,4,Trine is a wonderful school with a great atmosphere. All offices are super helpful and do their best to make Trine affordable for you.
Sophomore,4,The faculty at Trine University not only says they care about students but they also show it in their actions. I have very good relationships with all the professors I've had and they all care about my education along with my personal life. They make great effect to accommodate for any issues that may arise and overall are good at teaching. The smaller size of the campus is what allows for this close-knit community and also makes walking to class easier. Although I've run into a few issues I would definitely recommend this school to anyone who wants a good education and good professors to give it.
Freshman,4,My first year has been really good.  They have given me plenty of opportunities to engage with the school.  Getting a job was really easy and it doesn't get in the way of your academics.  The teachers are really nice and fun to hang around if you have the time.  I can't wait to spend my next three years here at Trine.
Freshman,4,Trine is a great place if you are looking for a smaller school that's actually not that small once you are here. The athletics here are great as well. I'm a baseball player and the opportunities Trine gives me are top of the line.
Junior,4,"Trine University is a small campus, but it feels like a perfect fit. Getting to know people is easy and the small class sizes make learning a lot less stressful. Walking around campus and seeing a lot of familiar faces makes you feel like you found the perfect college for you."
Niche User,4,This school is one of the fastest expanding around! It offers a small school experience with personalized resources to help you find big opportunities.
Freshman,4,"Residences. Not enough rooms for everybody and not many common rooms. And they were not prepared for so many students. But everything else, I couldn't ask for better. All of my professors enjoy what they are doing, want to help, and I have a lot of opportunities to get involved with organizations, the campus, community and employers!"
Freshman,4,I enjoy the campus very much and the faculty and staff are very welcoming. Professors are always wanting students to succeed to their highest potential and are willing to help you in any way possible.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Trine has been good! It isn't a huge school so everything is very personal with you and your professor. There is always something going on as long as you are willing to venture out of your room. I get the feel that they really care about the students, and that really makes me like going here."
Senior,4,"For being a small campus, I couldn't have asked for a better college experience. They have everything that a larger school has, but keeps the promise of small class sizes!"
Sophomore,4,"Small classes, informed teachers, and great people. The class sizes are minimal which allows you to get the one on one help that you may need for the harder classes. The teachers definitely know what they are talking about, which makes the learning experience that much more enjoyable. 
On campus living is not so bad as they are always offering get togethers to help you get close with the people who you will call your family soon enough."
Freshman,4,I've loved everything about Trine from the friendly people to the one on one help received by the professors.
Sophomore,4,Trine is a small university and has a comfortable atmosphere. The professors I have had experience with are always willing to discuss your experience with you.
Senior,4,"I am a senior at Trine University, I am taking Trine classes at the Ivy Tech Community College in Columbus Indiana. I transferred to Trine last semester as a senior, I really like how the classes are set up for working adults and I have the option to take evening face to face classes, online and distance learning classes at the main campus in Angola Indiana. "
Recent Alumnus,4,Trine makes sure that you are able to report any susipicious activity on campus to help deter any unwanted behaviors.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Trine is very Greek Life oriented, almost everyone is a part of Greek life; commuter or not."
Recent Alumnus,4,I am not an athlete but the athletics is highly encouraged to participate or to attend and support.
College Freshman,4,Love the small classes and teachers are always committed.
College Freshman,4,"Campus security really cracks down on you. There had only been about 200 students who were in trouble because of dumb stuff, but not because of sexual assault. It was primarily drugs."
College Freshman,4,"Small campus, but ideal for amount of students!"
College Freshman,4,Mostly academic and selective based on grades
College Freshman,4,Not bad. It is hard to get in contact with the coaches when you're off campus
College Freshman,4,Great School with small class sizes!!
College Senior,4,Only one or two issues per semester.
College Senior,4,Campus Safety operates like Soviet Russian police
College Senior,4,"Lots of restrictions by the school, but still good"
College Senior,4,Professors are fantastic! Admin is not very good.
College Senior,4,Everyone makes the teams for the most part. Huge football team. If its sports related then this school dumps money into it
College Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is great, but can be very expansive."
College Freshman,4,"New buildings

Positive staff that prepares you for future job careers

surveys determine a teachers position on campus and are taken very seriously

High job placement percentages"
College Junior,4,"Professors are generally great, have office hours often and are pretty easy to talk to and deal with."
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe really ever on campus
College Junior,4,"I have loved where I lived in the apartments, but of course you have to pay a good amount more for them than the normal dorms, which aren't that great honestly"
College Junior,4,"For the size of our school, it is a great Greek life scene, but a few more national sororities I think would be a great thing to being to campus, and maybe attract more females to the school in general"
College Junior,4,"Did play lacrosse there for a while and loved it, however being an engineering major and playing an NCAA sport, it got very time consuming"
College Junior,4,"Love the campus and environment at Trine, the Greek life rocks, and many people find a good balance between their academics and sports and social life"
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I lived in the traditional dorms for my first year. At Trine, some of the traditional dorms do not include A/C so during the summer it was very hot and we were forced to buy fans and keep them on at all hours. Sharing a bathroom with other girls wasn't as bad as I would have imagined it to be. For my sophomore year, I was put into the lottery. With this, I chose a roommate of my choice and decided where we'd like to live. I liked this way because it gave everyone a chance to have a say with where they'd like to go."
College Freshman,4,Athletics are good at Trine. Everyone who is in sports are always positive and there is always a good turn out with people going to events. School spirit is one of the biggest thing with more than half the students always wearing trine gear. The teams work together well and their attitudes show for it.
College Junior,4,Everything is good except campus safety gives out parking tickets even when you have paid for a parking pass. Along with the parking problem.
College Junior,4,I like living on campus but there are rules that restrict alcohol and tobacco even if you are of age. You also cannot have animals/pets. Another thing is if you want to live off of campus you can't until you are 21.
College Freshman,4,The process of getting into the graduate program has been a great experience for me.
Freshman,2,"go here if you are not interested in going to college. Trine is the right place for you if you want to go to a spread out medium-sized high school in the middle of nowhere. there are no parties unless you want to join a frat with kids you would have made fun of in high school, or if you are one of the 300 girls that attend the school of over 1,500. the students and faculty treat you and each other as if you are a high school junior."
College Freshman,2,"The administration has been very quick to judge, not very helpful. Have made good friends."
College Freshman,2,"Had roomate problems, lack of communication between RA's and residents."
College Junior,2,"School would rather have you stay on campus, so they make strict rules for living off campus to ensure that students do not."
College Junior,2,"Depends on who your RA is and if they care, most of them don't care what happens. Parking is the worst part about the entire campus. They want you to bring your car and pay $80 to park it in lots that do not have the capacity. They also make us move them to odd locations frequently for random school events which is a HUGE hassle."
College Junior,2,"Too much foreign food. All we want are the basics that we get when we are at home like lasagnas, burgers, and pizza. They try too hard to be different and have a variety but it is just not what any of us are looking for. At least a few nights a week I eat cereal for dinner."
College Junior,2,They do not give a lot of scholarships to Business students.
College Sophomore,2,rains a lot and it always seems to be windy and cold
College Sophomore,2,I don't paly sport but the students have great spirit
College Freshman,2,"The campus is small, so there aren't really any transportation options.  However, on really cold days they offer free shuttles to class."
College Freshman,2,Not much for us college students to do besides ride go karts or go see a movie. There is only about 4 or 5 restaurants that are good enough to eat at around town limiting our options for off campus food.
College Freshman,2,"They need to remodel the main athletic building because it is lacking many things that a university needs such as a wrestling room, swimming pool, and it needs a bigger free weight room."
College Freshman,2,There is no variety its only taco bell McDonalds and Arbys.  There is also only one restaurant that is open 24 hours and its in a gas station.
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of rules about being a dry campus, but it is never enforced."
College Freshman,2,The surrounding houses are normally owned be locals or even teachers..
College Junior,2,Small town so not much to do for underage. There are a few bars near campus but no clubs. For underage there is a park and movie theaters. Fort Wayne is a short drive though so there's that.
College Sophomore,2,some parking arrangments are unreasonable (three parking lots in particular)
College Sophomore,2,i've never had a negative encounter with campus security but a few of my friends say they get harrassed.
College Sophomore,2,everyone appears normal. there are a few unique people
College Sophomore,2,the wireless network is usually slow unless you use a wired connection
Graduate Student,1,"This University is very marginalizing to me. It does not have diversity to my liking and it fails to appeal better to thee women's . 

Oh yea the safety is sub par because a Brazilian pickpocketed me @ Whole foods"
College Sophomore,1,You can't live off campus unless you have been on their campus for 4 semesters no matter what your technical year in college is.
College Sophomore,1,"The day you move in, it will look like it has never been cleaned. It's disgusting. The only housing where you can have your own room is Villa's which are junior and senior only but the only place on campus reasonable to live in. Dorms are terrible, ""Apartments"" are glorified dorms. It's way over priced and because of a lack of kitchens in anything but the villas you have to pay the over priced meal plan and trust your luck with the cafe."
College Sophomore,1,"You have to be 21 to live off campus. It's cheaper to live off campus, there's plenty of housing, but since Trine wants your money they make it so that most students can't live off campus until they are seniors, or possibly never at all. Because not only do you have to 21 you have to be 21 before the first day of classes in the fall or else you are suck for a full year!! Not only that semester!! I have a friend who turned 21 2 days after the 1st day of classes, she can't move off campus until next year in the fall."
College Sophomore,1,"You will get screwed over every time you enter financial aid. Whenever you hear someone saying they have to talk to Financial Aid you will more than likely hear sympathetic apologizes. It tends to be best to just go with what they give you at the beginning of each semester, because every time you go into the office for some unapparent and unexplained reason your aid just got cut."
College Sophomore,1,"There is like two off campus dining places within walking distance, The Kitch and Rice Bowl, and its possible they are the best in the town, the price is even good. However even within driving distance there isn't much. There's fast food places that close earlier than most town, not even the McDonald's in this town is open 24/7. Fast food is fast food where ever you go. Nothing special here. And as for the few sit down restaurants in town, they are all chains and below average quality of said chains."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking for a college where there is absolutely nothing to do on or off campus come here. The nearest things to do are a minimum 30 minute drive, up into Coldwater or an even longer drive to Fort Wayne"
College Junior,1,Cafe food is not very good.
College Freshman,1,THe school is awfula nd i am never gonna get a job
College Freshman,1,Literally all white rich kids its so weird being here
College Freshman,1,IT sucks its so boring i want to leave but im not even sure if trine is a real school
College Sophomore,1,the football coaches suck. Most of them are a bunch of tools
College Freshman,1,You must have a car to go anywhere unless you want to walk a ways
College Sophomore,1,we have one snack machine and one soda machine.
College Sophomore,1,i'm here to finish college. period.
College Sophomore,1,"Fort Wayne, IN weather is horrible."
College Freshman,1,I absolutely hated my school.  I never felt safe there and it had more of a community college feel.
College Junior,1,we are no allowed to live off of campus.
College Sophomore,1,the parking permits cost a lot ($80.00) and some of the permitted parking areas are unreasonable for certain dorms.
College Junior,1,the major problem with the girls at Trine is that they are few and far between. Though over the years the ratio of guys to girls is improving it is still to low for my liking

Niche User,5,"I believe that it is by far the best college when it comes academically and environment wise, and overall accomplishments you can be apart of. Their criminal justice program is one of the best to prepare you for your career."
Niche User,5,It's tough but overall it is the best and well done. The college professors lay out what will be taught during the time and how it will be taught as for the schedule
Alum,5,UC Irvine is a welcoming community with great pride due to its' unique mascot! There are countless of resources for students to excel in all career fields.
Niche User,5,"I literally don't go to this school. To be entered into a drawing for a scholarship I could possibly use at this school I have to review the school, interesting method of giving out scholarships I guess Niche. Now the actually rating of this school and others is not acurate."

Junior,5,"Great environment to study, location is great, professors help you and answer most of the questions, there are a few hiking trails around that help release stress form school."
Junior,5,"It is a very nice online experience with flexible hours, and classes are recorded so you can watch it if you miss a lecture."
Sophomore,5,"Students are generally nice and welcoming. UCI is known to be inclusive. Also, we're a legit meme, so we have fun."
Junior,5,I took most of my classes on campus except the ones that required virtual learning due to covid. The switch was sudden but the professors were and are very understanding about the current situation.
Sophomore,5,"The University of California, Irvine is a beautiful campus with a great environment for studying. I really appreciated all the resources available to the students, whether recreational, educational, or health-wise. However, I did notice there being a bit of a trash issue, specifically the Aldrich Park area."
Sophomore,5,"Considering the rapid change that Coronavirus brought to our lives, the teachers did a great job adjusting their classes and helping the students do the same. Honestly, virtual classes made learning easier considering I could go at my own pace and re-watch lecture videos."
Freshman,5,"Everything about this campus is amazing, from the staff, people, security guards, and the students. Everyone is really friendly, and the learning environment is very calm and safe."
Freshman,5,"Professor really reach out to you if you need help with anything, because they care so much about their students. They really don't want to leave anyone behind, therefore they'll do whatever it takes to help them stay on track of succeeding."
Freshman,5,It is very different from physical learning but still very doable. It is much more challenging to do and requires more focus to the class but it is also easier for certain tasks.
Freshman,5,This university has a beautiful campus and amazing people to talk to. All of their offices and buildings are helpful for students dealing with multiple problems.
Sophomore,5,"What I enjoy the most about the University of California, Irvine would have to be the work ethic of the professors as they manage to keep personal relationships with their students in order to ensure that they can complete every assignment to the best of their ability and as stress free as possible. Additionally, they make sure that all resources are consistently available to and understood by the students, so that the work submitted is always clearly analyzed and thorough. One thing I believe can be altered is the financial aid office due to the fact that they are a bit disorganized and consequently unhelpful."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience so far pertains to the classes I was enrolled in last quarter- Humanities Core as well as Criminology. In order to adjust to the online setting, my professors were very thorough with their explanations posted on every assignment, they were very insightful and clear in their prerecorded lectures, and they posted daily agendas for each day as soon as the quarter had begun. Furthermore, my professors kept their office hours open for almost any time that worked for their students as they wanted to provide as much help as they could on an online platform."
Freshman,5,UCI fosters  a campus of diversity and acceptance which is evident from their emphasis of specifying pronouns. They have a great campus life with people who are open and accepting of people from different backgrounds. They don't fall to the stereotypes of engineering being a male field with girls being included in a classroom setting but also in clubs on campus. Their math department is not particularly strong with some professors being unclear but their English department has amazing professors.
Sophomore,5,"In terms of online, most professors were understanding of circumstances and gave a helping hand whenever it was needed."
Niche User,5,I loved it so much! It was amazing! I enjoyed everything there especially the professors. They always supported me in everything I did.
Niche User,5,"I did not take any online classes but professors were so helpful and I enjoyed everything about it! I loved the environment and meeting so many new people along the way. I made friendships I never thought would happen and my experience overall was so good. I would go back there if I could. I hope that if anyone is thinking about going there, definitely go!"
Alum,5,"The campus is always clean and has a great studying environment. The campus is very safe. Campus staff is always eager to help you with your needs. All the professors I've had are fun and easy to work with. They encourage you to succeed in your studies and pursue your career. The campus has many amenities and lots of places to eat. The University Town Center next to campus has top brand restaurant chains. With the recent constructions done on campus, the campus is much more lively appealing."
Sophomore,5,"First off, college is what you make out of it. While I love my UCI experience, keep in mind that not everyone feels this way. UCI is a very welcoming and clean campus. Everyone is extremely friendly and you never feel unsafe walking around. Aldrich Park, located in the heart of campus, is quite beautiful. The surrounding area is also relatively safe, and there is tons to do outside of campus (huge malls, food plazas, Disneyland, etc.). The school has many resources and clubs. They advocate for many issues that personally match my ideals (diversity, sustainability, etc.). Teaching quality can vary depending on which classes you take, but there is no shortage of interesting classes. The newer dorms are quite luxurious for dorms. The dining halls have plenty of options, and campus has food places everywhere. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to go to football games or watch super competitive athletics. Parties happen, but the culture for that isn't really big here either."
Alum,5,"UCI is located in central Orange County. There are a lot of diverse food locations around and it is near local attractions like Disneyland. A decent drive from SD and LA for weekend trips. 

Irvine in general is a beautiful area. The campus is well kept and all facilities are clean. Some of the older buildings are outdated and have whacky bathrooms but they are still clean. UCI probably has the best gym I have ever seen with 3 full size courts, a separate volleyball court, upstairs indoor track overlooking basketball courts, a main gym, as well as a smaller gym. A total of 6-8 squat racks and 6 barbell benches and numerous dumbbell benches. The pool is also great. 

Professors for your major are great (I was BIO) and all my professors were great for the main courses. If it is a random GE or lower div course it can be hit or miss depending on your learning style. You do have a lot of resources for tutoring and study groups.

Great school all around."
Senior,5,"Compared to my community college, UCI provided more rigorous and enjoyable courses. Aside from the quality of education, the administration services were always helpful and on time."
Alum,5,It was fun being in Irvine and hanging out with my friends that i met in the classes that i was taking.
Sophomore,5,"Online learning is a new experience for me, but UCI's professors made my experience awesome! Professors were understanding and available for Zoom calls in their free time, trying to help as much as they can. Even though they have their own lives and are busy as well, I was fully supported by them. They also were lenient on grading because of the stress due to COVID-19."
Alum,5,This school is absolutely amazing. I have had so many opportunities here that allowed me to grow. There are a diverse group of students and staff which allows students to be able to be more socially aware.
Alum,5,I had to take classes online for the last quarter due to the pandemic. This was not ideal but all professors were extremely accommodating and willing to help with the class load.
Alum,5,"University of California- Irvine was a wonderful school that provided me with an excellent education. I would recommend this school to anyone serious about their education and am very happy with my decision to attend UCI. Top notch facilities, professors, classes, and student life."
Junior,5,"UCI's a very diverse and awesome school, with tons of programs that continue to make going there worthwhile. Though there might not seem like a lot to do out there, UCI's near 3 beaches and both Spectrum and Fashion Island. Dance culture is also heavily prevalent if you're into that."
Junior,5,I'm very happy to be a part of this school. IT has a good program for my major and has good resources for me.
Senior,5,I enjoyed the online courses that I took. Most professors make themselves available to answer questions and encourage students to attend office hours. They make it easy to get help.
Senior,5,"Writing this makes me feel so nostalgic. I am a current senior at UCI and it breaks my heart to not know when in-person classes, research, and activities will resume. I adore the campus, the location, the weather, the courses, and the faculty. I met amazing people, respected faculty, and engaged in research opportunities. Your experience at UCI is truly what you make of it. Since it is such a large institution, there are so many opportunities to try new things and get involved. The party scene is okay, but honestly I have way more fun with my friends anyways. Sometime we go to night swimming at the beach, play volleyball, or go camping. I love how close the campus is to Newport and the beach, concert venues, and the SNA airport. My only complaints are the cost of housing, lack of efficient transportation, and parking. I wouldn't have wanted to spend my undergraduate experience anywhere else-- and I truly mean this."
Junior,5,"Online experience has been pretty good, most professors are very understanding and knowledgable of remote work."
Junior,5,"I love UCI, it has been a great experience and everyone is very nice and respectful. Athletics is lacking, but education is very high and competitive. The campus has many different clubs and sports that the students can participate in."
Senior,5,Great school. Very competitive academically. Could be a little more diverse. Great faculty. Beautiful campus.
Senior,5,Everybody's experience is different but I enjoyed my online learning experience.  Professors are great and made the transition feasible. Also depends on the professor and course.
Junior,5,Online learning has been really great! Professors and advisors are very available for any concerns or anxieties. They've been very accommodating and understanding of the international pandemic affecting students' focus.
Alum,5,"UC Irvine is a university that I wholeheartedly enjoyed my undergraduate experience at. Everything from the campus efforts of going green to the school faculty and students, it was an amazing experience. I couldn't have asked for a better place to go to school at."
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online but some of the coursework was done electronically. The faculty made the process of completing assignments online very easy to understand and were open to helping any student in need of assistance.
Junior,5,"Due to the pandemic, the University of California, Irvine has quickly and successfully transitioned to remote learning. Although there were many stressors and challenges that arose, the university was understanding and provided relief to the students through housing, academics, and the like. Professors are really supportive of the students and constantly provided students with resources and platforms to help continue their studies through these times. One setback that this university has is that the administration at UCI had been very hard to reach and unresponsive ever since the transition to remote learning. However, the transition to online learning was very smooth and is to be commended."
Freshman,5,"I had to take online classes in the spring quarter because of the whole pandemic, but the professors were pretty understanding and lenient with the work since it was many student's first time taking online classes."
Freshman,5,"UCI has a beautiful and huge campus. The Aldrich Park is an area where any student can go to study, relax, workout, and much more."
Alum,5,"University of California - Irvine is located in the heart of Orange County. Although quiet and conservative,  UC Irvine provides the perfect environment for students to thrive as they are pursuing a higher education."
Alum,5,"I have only experienced online learning during summer quarter where I took an online class. However, from my experiences, the online learning experience at UC Irvine were on par with in-person courses."
Freshman,5,UC Irvine provided us with free Zoom calls which was very vital to our learning. I thought that this type of learning as well as pre recorded lectures were very helpful with the the online learning. I was pleased that UCI accommodated to our needs.
Freshman,5,"I have yet to start classes, but from the looks of it the school seems very prepared to start remote learning."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the design of the campus and the proximity of Irvine to beaches and other cities. The professors were always very helpful during office hours. The sports, arts, and student organizations provided a friendly and entertaining atmosphere. The libraries are very massive, so many texts can be found for research. There is plenty of study space and technology available for use."
Alum,5,I liked the location of UC Irvine. The student life was really great and engaging. The student organizations were amazing. The only thing I would change is UC Irvine being more inclusive of its minorities.
Sophomore,5,It's been a wonderful experience both academically and socially. There are so many opportunities to get involved in campus. In terms of sports the basketball teams are really fun to attend and the sororities and fraternities have sports games against each other as well which are very exciting.
Freshman,5,"Online courses at UCI are very rigorous, however; UCI administrators and professors are willing to go the extra mile to help you in anyway they can. UC Irvine has a very close-knit community, and are willing to work with students anywhere you go! There are so many opportunities for course help as well."
Freshman,5,"UCI has a beautiful learning environment, great administrators, and wonderful students. Overall, UCI is the perfect place to further your education."
Niche User,5,Overall friendly environment and scenery. Campus is beautiful and kept as clean as possible as all times.
Niche User,5,Planning on applying for the fall semester of 2021 as well as dorming on campus to enjoy all the qualities it gives
Junior,5,This college is very welcoming to students. It provides a vast amount of resources available for students to help them to succeed. It is especially helpful with multiple study areas available that opens till very late.
Sophomore,5,"With the support of UCI’s conducive environment, I feel that I made significant contributions to UCI and the campus community. I have been involved in research, tutoring, sports and clubs that will help me excel in my career. Personally, I felt a greater than normal duty to perform to the best of my abilities in order to become a contributing part to UCI’s vast achievements. 
First of all, I started as a research aid with UCI’s research at the Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC). 

Secondly, I have been the secretary at the UCI chapter of a Medical Society, in which I helped organize fundraisers and create pre-med student opportunities to gain experience needed to pursue their dreams.

Thirdly, I was a volunteer peer tutor for a freshman Biology course. 

My academic pursuit is to become a doctor since I was 10 years old . In conclusion, UC Irvine has created many dreams come true."
Alum,5,I loved UCI! I earned my Bachelors there and learned so much from their training conservatory as a theatre arts major!
Freshman,5,"UCI is the perfect school! It has so much culture and amazing academics. The opportunities in research UCI offers is astounding. The surrounding neighborhood is very safe and makes you feel super comfortable. Although there is not much school spirit in sports, UCI makes it up in its student organizations and events."
Alum,5,"UCI is a stimulating campus where research, the arts, diversity and wellness are well versed. Students are very involved outside the classroom and Professors make themselves available in office hours or for research. Highly suggest living on campus for your undergraduate experience as it will positively shape your experience. Irvine is also a very green campus as a literal park is in the middle of the school and classrooms surround it- you'll see bike lanes and bike paths all around the city. It is also one of the safest cities to live in so you won't have to worry much when studying late on campus. For any nerds out there, UCI built a second (science) library rather than a football field. Not to worry, their baseball and basketball team are very active so you can get your sports fix there."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the welcoming environment of the university and how it's fairly easy to make friends. I like that many people are willing to help new students and everyone else. There's many food options and there's always something to do. However, something I want to see changed is probably the guidelines and also trying to improve on making sure that everyone is staying safe and doing well."
Alum,4,"During my time at UC Irvine, I took a few classes online which allowed me more flexibility to work while being a student. The professors put a lot of effort into their Canvas modules where you don't feel as though you are missing out on in person education rather you are being educated and have a flexible schedule."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are pretty understanding of the situation and want to alleviate the stress or anxiety of Zoom. They're supportive, which is nice."
Sophomore,4,"I like that UCI offers great financial aid awards and they have worked hard to achieve a diverse campus. However, during the time of the pandemic, it has been difficult to contact important services."
Sophomore,4,The professors are understanding and accommodate students to the best of their abilities during the time of the pandemic.
Alum,4,"I attended the University of California, Irvine from 2007 to 2012. What I enjoyed about the institution and my experience were campus life, some of the classes, and the extracurricular offerings that allowed me to develop my professional and leadership skills, along with my understanding of diversity. 

UC Irvine was ahead of its time in incorporating diversity into student leadership programs. I apply many of the learnings to my personal and professional life to this day. 

I've intentionally left ROI blank as I pursued a career that is outside of my major. However, from speaking with former classmates, they have made huge strides in their careers based on their studies at UC Irvine. 

Overall, I highly recommend UC Irvine for an undergraduate degree."
Junior,4,I always feel safe on my campus. I love the how environment friendly the campus is as well.  The professors are amazing and the staff is always helpful.
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online classes yet, since I am an incoming freshman. However, from my experience in their webinars, the staffs are really helpful and answer every question you ask. The only problem I had at the webinar was the Financial Aid's webinar as they only answered questions that could be found online."
Freshman,4,"One thing I like about UCI is that all departments are very encouraging, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic.  Also, most departments and faculty staff would answer very quickly. They answer your email between 5-10 business days, but most of the time they answer quicker than that. Lastly, I like how most webinars at UCI will answer your questions and clarify on the topic at hand. One thing I would like to change is for the faculty in the Financial Aid department to answer emails faster, but it is understandable since they receive a lot of emails and it takes time to go through all of them."
Senior,4,"I've had a positive experience at UCI. The campus is nice and most of the professors I've had have been great. Even as an AB540 student, I have received additional financial aid during the pandemic. One downside is the price of parking permits. It can cost up to about $250 per quarter."
Senior,4,"Before remote learning, I took one online class. The professor taught well through her recorded lectures and discussion sessions were insightful."
Niche User,4,"UCI is geared towards pushing their students towards success, while making the most of their student pride to encourage creativity through thought."
Freshman,4,"UCI has made online learning relatively easy with most professors using the platform Canvas for assignments and lectures. The only big issue with online learning is the confusion of how tests like midterms and finals will take place. However, most professors are understanding of the unreliability of wifi and will offer extensions or reschedulings."
Sophomore,4,Love the environment and the plentiful opportunities offered. The campus is beautiful and the diversity is exquisite.
Junior,4,Learning in University of California Irvine has been very interesting as professors use teaching styles I have never seen before. Using platforms like Kahoot and mindtap have been an interesting experience for me.
Junior,4,University of California Irvine is a good university that encourages diversity and offers a wide range of majors and minors for students. There are also many job opportunities on campus and the campus is really beautiful
Alum,4,"Took only one online class, but based on this one experience it was good. Not too different from taking classes in-person."
Sophomore,4,"The pandemic shifted all of my classes online for the 2020 spring quarter. All of my professors were very understanding and accommodating of various students' situations, and altered the class expectations and workload to benefit as many students as possible. All of my classes were also made asynchronous since students lived in different time zones. While this is can be helpful for those whose daily schedules changed due to the pandemic, it also makes interacting with classmates and professors much more difficult than if classes were synchronous or in-person. I appreciate the effort the professors made to keep students engaged in their classes. However, I did feel as though I was missing an essential experience in some of the classes due to us not being able to meet in person, especially since some of my classes previously relied heavily on discussion and in-person interaction."
Alum,4,N/a I did not have many online courses- I had one bio research thing but everything else was just supplementary websites for the stem classes I took.
Alum,4,"i personally do not like online classes. however, the teachers in irvine made the experience fun and easy for me."
Sophomore,4,"UCI honestly felt like high school. It is much bigger than I expected, and so I recommend to go to as many clubs as you can to make friends and build relationships. The classrooms have 30-400 students, so it does require some effort to make friends. That being said, they provide a lot of resources to help you out and I never felt unwelcomed here!"
Alum,4,Had a great four years here. Clubs and student organizations were abundant. Classes here are hard (for the sciences at least).
Alum,4,"I had a few classes online during the summer, easy if you put in  the work. But other than that, the rest of my classes were in person."
Alum,4,"I took some summer classes online and they were good classes with solid learning material to take place of traditional in person classes. Although there was no interaction with the professor and other students, it still gave you the chance to take in the important material the class was learning about."
Sophomore,4,"Being at UCI has been an amazing experience. Stepping out of high school into college with a welcoming diverse atmosphere made the transition a lot easier. In the beginning, it could feel lonely and overwhelming due to how big the campus is and how many different clubs there are. To help fight this, UCI provides groups to help that transition better where you can meet fellow students that will take you in and make you feel welcomed. UCI has many different opportunities for you to grow in your major and interests. I am an Education major and UCI provides clubs, events, and amazing knowledgeable professors to help guide you through your college career. There are also opportunities and programs for students after they graduate in their specific major. As an education major, there are workshops to help me in my future in teaching and graduate programs to help me earn my teaching credentials."
Freshman,4,"Despite the perks of online school where you decide your schedule with more flexibility and working in comfort from your own homes, I definitely would not choose it over going to school. Being physically present means I can attend office hours where I will get the undivided attention of my professors and form study groups to keep me disciplined. I really disliked it, to be honest, I felt unmotivated and my grades weren't as high as I would normally get if I was present to ask questions during the lecture. Professors were also struggling with the transition so it makes learning so much more difficult than it should be."
Freshman,4,"I spent my first year at UCI as an undeclared student. Peer advising through the Undergrad/Undeclared office was super helpful in figuring out what interested me. I learned experience that students here must learn to be very independent and reach out for help when they need it. 
Although the school is a strong academic institution for high-quality education, I did not see myself there for the next three years. Instead, I've chosen to withdraw and transfer to CSULB where I could major in what I wanted. Now, UCI does offer a wide variety of career paths but I wasn't completely interested in any of them to stay. My advice for undeclared undergrads is definitely to do your research early before deciding on a major. UCI allows you to reach the end of your second year but having a clear plan early on will help so much with your education. Overall, faculty are great and will help IF you ask. 
p. s.  I suggest joining a lot of clubs and build your network."
Sophomore,4,"UCI is a really good school! I lived in the dorms my first year, my roommates overall were nice. Moving into the dorms was really easy because there are other students helping you along the way."
Sophomore,4,It was tough transitioning from in person instruction to online but the professors were very helpful with transitioning to online classes.
Freshman,4,Most professors were flexible and more lenient in terms of due dates. A few provided office hours almost every day for 5+ hours.
Freshman,4,Pretty dead socially. The most diverse you’ll get is different Asians. The new dorms are great with great selection of food around and the campus dining is good too.
Junior,4,Online learning is very different than in-person learning but most professors have been very helpful in the switch.
Freshman,4,"The campus is surrounded by a lot of greenery with a park in the center of it. The it is convenient to get around campus. The professors I had were great and were well-educated on their subject. The classes were challenging and the work was easily manageable as a full-time student. Living in the outskirts of Mesa Court, it was possible to hear music or noise disturbance all the way from the Anteatery. In a two-person dorm, the room was decently sized, the beds decently comfy, the desks old-fashioned, and there was no air conditioning."
Alum,4,"Many STEM courses are concert room style classes, so asking questions is limited  to front seats. However discussion portion with TAs will decrease that engagement gap. Good learning experience when you find the right social clique, otherwise very competitive."
Alum,4,"Good school, very nice green campus. TAs are very engaging when actual professors seem unreachable. Gets peaceful and quiet after 3pm when most classes are done."
Junior,4,"The university is a great place, with welcoming students,  a beautifully designed campus that is kept up to date with new technologies and amenities for students to make use of, and is close to a good number of locations to go out and do some shopping or adventure around in, its just a really great place."
Alum,4,I liked the diversity of the  students as well as the faculty staff. I had some great and inspirational lectures and professors.
Alum,4,"Great college experience- great people, boujee area with beaches nearby. The only thing is everything closes up early; it can also be a family oriented area."
Alum,4,"It was hard at first, but through time management and asking questions, I was able to excel through my courses."
Alum,4,Ive taken a few online classes when I was enrolled and there are a ton of available resources available to students. Online learning offers great flexibility without jeopardizing your education.
Sophomore,2,"Transitioning to online learning with the University of California, Irvine has been difficult. Classrooms and lectures at UCI are not made to be remote therefore professors often have a difficult time teaching through a new venue. Especially during COVID 19, it has been extremely difficult where I had to become the ""breadwinner"" for my family due to my parents' loss in work hours. Tuition at UCI remains the same despite their transition to remote learning forcing me to focus on working more rather than focusing on my schoolwork due to the fear of not being able to afford tuition. Lectures often are mandatory and many professors aren't able to record their lectures whether it be due to personal reasons or they are unable to figure it out. I truly believe UCI will better their online learning experience for this upcoming school year because students are paying extremely high tuition for a quality education that should be provided by that college."
Junior,2,"This one really varies with professors, but for the most part professors are still trying to learn how to switch their in person lessons to online formats. General chemistry labs especially become especially infuriating when professors require students to use websites that are severely outdated."
Alum,2,"Honestly, I prefer the in-person lectures. Online courses were sometimes too long and boring compared to the interactive atmosphere of classrooms."
Niche User,2,"If you are focused on sciences, pre-med, and engineering, this school might be worth your while, but if not, PLEASE take this into consideration: I went to UCI some years ago, and long story short, dropped out because of what was going on in my life, and saw that education was turning more into indoctrination with regards to certain breadth requirements and fields of study. This shift affected the campus life immensely to the point where you couldn't have a dialogue, and saw a clear bias in the campus newspaper. Campus life, and the OC community is very cliquish, and nowhere near as diverse as they claim to be. Groups that bond over cultural interests tend to treat you as an outsider passive-aggressively if you don't come from that specific culture. The campus used to have more Division I aquatic sports, but the team's funding was cut, and now what remains are largely club sports. If you are looking for a university with a well-rounded academic and life experience, this isn't it."
Junior,2,"To me this school is more focused on how it appears rather than how it runs. It seems like money issues are more important than education as well. A lot of the teachers are barely ok. A handful of nice and sincere ones, but even then there’s not enough time to even acknowledge them, because of how fast paced the quarter system is."
Freshman,2,Super intense and stressful program. Counselors treat you like a number and don't care about who you are or what you are going through. Must be a full time student in order to manage academic life
College Junior,2,I don't know about the Greek in UCI
College Senior,2,I think it is a waste of time.
College Junior,2,"VDC Norte is a dump if anyone wants to live there, just don't."
College Junior,2,I am not too familiar with sports on my campus.
College Freshman,2,no one likes doing greek life at our school because we have a high commuter based school. greek life is not very big and is very low key.
College Freshman,2,I applied for housing 15 minutes after the application opened (the options are first come first serve). I got the last place on my list...
College Junior,2,"one campus pubs, most nightlife requires driving and public transport isn't great."
College Junior,2,"Not many big parties, mostly lowkey small gatherings. Greeks have more parties if you're involved."
College Freshman,2,"The fact that my high school did not praise much attention to the academic rigor of the school is what sparked my determination into doing better not only as a student ,but as an advocate and a volunteer. I experienced one of my greatest accomplishments my senior year--winning the national engineering design competition for the construction of a prosthetic arm. I was able to overcome the gender and racial inequality gap that was present in our school."
College Sophomore,2,"My first year of college was very challenging. I took up a job to help my parents pay for the finances that weren't covered by financial aid. Because of that, I lost time to study, sleep and fully enjoy my freshman year. I had to be on top with time management and it was even more important to take care of myself since it was fairly easy to get sick in the dorms. I also got a little homesick being away from home. My overall experience at school was hard but I definitely learned a lot in terms of what I can handle and what I should expect in college. Everything that has happened has made me a lot more prepared for the incoming year and I am hopeful that it will be better for me."
College Junior,2,Classes are hard. Community very friendly though!
College Freshman,2,Very Very small. Those who party are often seen by non-partiers as ridiculous.
College Freshman,2,Super unhealthy. Totally greasy and limited food options. What food they do give you is small in portion and yet loads of fat.
College Freshman,2,DON'T BE PREMED UNLESS YOURE BIO.
College Freshman,2,"If you're pre-med, understand that you'll only be able to get classes you need as a biology major, and occasionally a public health major. They practially require you to major in  biological sciences to get classes, otherwise you're screwed - which is my issue right now. Discussion sessions help break down the large class size, but the TAs aren't the most helpful. Professors are at a wide range - they're all very good at research, but only half of them can actually teach well."
College Freshman,2,"They seem to do a rough job dealing with aid and grants unless you're a regent's scholar. Being a public university, they have too many students and not enough time to deal with financial aid. They usually just leave it up to you to go to them if you have an issue. Works out for the most part though, it's not something to always worry about unless you're in desperate need of financial aid."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not that great at all. Frat parties are the worst.
College Freshman,2,Make sure you apply for FAFSA and Cal Grants as soon as they are available to maximize the amount of money you get.
College Freshman,2,"From a non-Greek perspective, Greek life at UCI looks pretty lame. There are no houses, only campus apartments that Greeks have turned into their houses. Parties are small and lame. Greeks here aren't as attractive as those of other schools. It seems like they accept most people."
College Freshman,2,Got no aid. I am irritated.
College Freshman,2,There is a positive vibe coming from the communities near UCI. Nothing interesting to do outside of UCI unless you have a car.
College Freshman,2,If you came looking for a party school look elsewhere. There are rarely any parties here at UCI and weekends can get a little boring when everybody practically up and leaves during the weekend.
College Freshman,2,"From who I've talked to, and myself included, not many people got accepted for financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"Well, it's UCI. You aren't going to get many parties unless you join a fraternity or sorority."
College Junior,2,"Housing at Irvine is super expensive and definitely not worth the price we are paying. For example $2350 for a 2 bedroom one bath is ridiculous. This price is supposed to be ""cheap"" too. This is total nonsense and the companies are definitely taking advantage of the students."
College Freshman,2,I didn't get a lot of scholarships or grants and I am forced to take out loans
College Senior,2,"From my experience at UCI, there has not been much of a party scene. When there are parties to attend, they tend to be awkward and people get too out of hand too quickly. For a real party, it's best to go wherever the grad students are! They have a good time!"
College Junior,2,It's been very difficult for me to receive any aid and I might have to drop out for a quarter if I don't receive any aid ir scholarship
College Freshman,2,"i don't understand why any school would take away funding if you add a new scholarship. If you're getting a scholarship it means your demonstrating financial need, it shouldn't count as income."
College Junior,2,"I was laughed at for attempting to apply for financial aid because they saw my mothers income on paper but had no clue what was really going on in my life. She told me ""you're not going to get any aid."" Sure enough, that afternoon my request was denied."
College Student,2,It's pretty bad considering how many kids do drugs or alcohol
College Junior,2,I don't really know much about it.
College Freshman,2,Computer labs such as gateway are always busy. The printing also is extremely costly if printing a lot of stuff.
College Freshman,2,You need to get help because you never know what you're doing.
College Junior,2,There just are not a lot of great options for nightlife. It's much better to just stay in most nights
College Junior,2,I come from Texas aka real greek life. The greek life here is sad and nothing I would want to be a part of.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to shop, or do any fun activity is not a good place. The university is far from any attraction or activity if want to have fun. However, UCI does do a lot of events throughout the year which are pretty fun like the shockfest, rallys, concerts, cultural events too."
College Freshman,2,"I personally like a vibrant atmosphere, but this is a suburban city so I would find it harder to interact or find interesting things to do especially if you don't have a car."
College Freshman,2,I feel sick every time I eat cafeteria food
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus dining consists of Wendy's, Subway, Wahoo's, Panda Express, In N' Out, Taco Bell.... (all fast food). University Center has a few nice places to eat, but not many options and hours aren't very convenient either."
College Freshman,2,They always try to fine students in order to get commission.
College Freshman,2,"YOU NEED A CAR to go places. things don't happen on campus a lot, so having a car is a great thing"
College Junior,2,I would have looked into waiting for another school to accept me if I had realized how hard it is to find a bio anth course at UCI.
College Junior,2,"I don't feel that there is vast diversity in race, class, sexual orientation, or religion."
College Junior,2,"Irvine is a boring sort of white bread upper class area with expensive restaurants and shopping centers nearby. There isn't very much fun, cheap options for students to take advantage within the city. Most people head to the beach or LA for fun."
College Freshman,2,The cost for the parking is way overpriced.
College Freshman,2,Hard not to get a ticket for parking and they are really strict about parking rules.
College Junior,2,"Campus parking is bad especially for visitors, or clubs that want to invite speakers. Everyone must pay $10 for the whole day, $14 for overnight and 2$ per hour. Parking is strictly enforced and it is always pricey when coming from home to the dorm to transport materials. The best thing one can do is go to the 15 minute parking spot which is not always open, or buy a parking ticket. I have tried to look for but haven't seen any off-campus parking that are near a reasonable distance to the campus. In essence the campus parking is not friendly to visitors or club speakers, due to it's high cost. Buying a parking permit isn't cheap either, racking $400+ per quarter, and it only allows parking in certain areas, it's very costly and limiting."
College Freshman,2,Everyone's into their own thing.
College Freshman,2,I have no money for books.
College Freshman,2,"Always have to pay, I can't."
College Student,2,Do not have many chances to get an aid. Open on-compus job opportunities to all students rather than to students with fellowship.
College Sophomore,2,Parking at UCI kind of sucks. It's about $900 for a year and even then you can only park in certain parts of certain lots at certain times. A running joke here is that you're not a UCI student until you've gotten a parking ticket
College Sophomore,2,I HATE PARKING AT UCI. I'm not Paris Hilton. $66 a month? Ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,This might just be from my point of view considering I don't really pay attention to sports but I feel that a lot of people here are like me-not very interested.
College Freshman,1,"I was one of over 1,000 students who either had to move out of housing withdraw from the school or struggle with financial aid to stay at UC Irvine. The schools websites are horrendously ancient especially considering they are supposed to specialize in computer science...financial aid office is crap not helpful at ALL impossible to get the information or help you need. They do NOT CARE. The people working in the financial aid office are mostly STUDENTS who do not know how to answer your questions or tell you the information you need. And the actual administrators that work there have been verbally abusive, unhelpful, and just overall extremely extremely rude. This school was nothing like what I expected UC Irvine does not deserve to be starting to be compared to UCLA, UCSB, etc. If I would have known what UC Irvine would entail I would have just went to UCSB or NYU, two other schools I got into. I had to withdraw from the school as well as my friend and another guy in our hall was kicked out of the dorms and had to move into an on campus apartment. Neither my friend or I will be re-applying after the way we were treated and I plan on going to another University next fall."
College Senior,1,"I am an applied physics major here at UCI and that requires me to take alot of engineering courses. I have read many reviews saying not to come here for engineering but the prestige of the school trumped everything, and I wanted to come here so bad. Well folks, I hate it here. The engineering professors here are so bad, its like a glorified online school now. I am transfering next fall, I know other schools will be hard but atleast they will be known for engineering. Word to the wise, If you get accepted to a school known for engineering (despite the prestige) GO TO THAT SCHOOL."
College Freshman,1,"As I said before: only do premed if you're a Bio major. Otherwise, you're stuck, as there are no flexibility between the school. Changing majors can be difficult too, as if requires taking prerequisite classes that are major restricted and impossible to get into."
College Freshman,1,There is no housing available.
College Freshman,1,We don't have much of a financial aid office or any assistance at all. It is a really negative thing about my school but the positives outweigh the negatives so I have been looking for scholarships and grants and any assistance I can qualify for.
College Freshman,1,"People are not into partying what-so-ever, people are a little older, and take this schooling very seriously."
College Freshman,1,We don't have this either.
College Sophomore,1,"Since I am considered a middle class student, I did not receive any financial aid from school. My parents are unable to pay for my classes, so I am forced to work part time and take out loans. It's a scary process that I am dealing with because I don't want to graduate college with a lot of loans on my back. Unfortunately, I am left with no other option."
College Senior,1,I've never received anything but loan offers from UCI.
College Junior,1,"I had a bad experience with the greek life and as a result I stay clear of them. I understand on one hand you are trying to promote brotherhood; however, on the other hand, don't make others feel lower if they are not in it and as if they're outcasts."
College Sophomore,1,Parking permits are too expensive and if that's not the case then there's only one free parking spot when possibly there's four of us in need of a parking space. Rent is expensive unless you really move out further from campus.
College Junior,1,The bus leaves you or doesnt come. Its not an interesting palce to live in.
College Junior,1,"The area is not a college city at all, people should not come to irvine."
College Senior,1,I am not a U.S. citizen therefore not eligible for financial aid. My financial need of tuition is above and beyond most college students. I have always applied for a monthly payment plan to accommodate for my financial short-comings each month.
College Freshman,1,"Frankly, as an international student, I could barely get anywhere without a car, thus spending most of my time on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Campus shuttles are not too bad, but are not in service on the weekends!!!!!!!!!! Taxis and zip cars are expensive, and public transportation consists of the OCTA bus which isn't too bad. If you want to use the metro, you have to drive to the station.."
College Freshman,1,"Although Newport Beach (Fashion Island, beach, small restaurants) is ""close"", it is still a drive away. If you plan to have a social life, buy a car."
College Freshman,1,Irvine as a city is pretty dead.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is expensive as hell. When friends visit, they park 2 miles away in some suburban neighborhood then i drive them back"
College Freshman,1,No such thing as parking exists in Irvine. 
College Freshman,1,"There are virtually no places close to the school. even if you find one, chances are you have to be 21 to enter."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid because both my parents have jobs and the aid I applied for usually chose students that were in more need of it than me. 
College Junior,1,What nightlife? Ahahahahaha... there's parties but hahahaha nightlife... sure...
Recent Alumnus,1,"No football team, the school actively voted against it in favor of a science library. The basketball team isn't competitive and there doesn't seem to be an effort to make it more competitive. The sports that the school is competitive in are dull. On the whole, the school isn't really spirited enough and there doesn't seem to be any steps done to increase the school spirit."
College Junior,1,Very strict. Irvine police and campus police do not have tolerance for much.
College Sophomore,1,"There is a police station right across campus and they regularly check the housing areas to make sure that there is no underage drinking. They are serious, which is part of why Irvine is one of the safest city in the US. If you're going to drink, you cannot/ should not make it obvious."
Recent Alumnus,1,"At UCI, there are so many Biology majors that the curriculum is geared at eliminating students from the major the first two years. Once a student has survived past the second year, it is up to them to finish, counselors are abismal."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no leniency with campus policies. For example, parking tickets will almost never be appealed successfully."
College Junior,1,There isn't much diversity at this school. Although you may be able to find different races and religions around campus they make up a small percentage of the campus.
College Junior,1,"Our men's volleyball team is very good and some of the members go to the Olympics. However, school spirit is not very present. Intramural sports aren't very active. Most people that come to UCI attend for the school not the sports. We don't have a basketball team either."
College Junior,1,I am giving UCI a poor grade for parking mainly because it is outrageously expensive and also confusing as to where the correct zones and lots are located that coenside with permit
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process was absolutely horrible. They gave me an email that I was eligible for aid, and then months after the email, and two weeks before fees were due they suddenly revoked it without even a warning or an email. I didn't even know about it until I asked when my financial aid would kick in and they told me that it was revoked. Many many mannnyy phone calls later they finally put in my financial aid. Worst time ever. Financial aid is absolutely horrible. No apology either when they suddenly revoked it without even letting me know."
College Senior,1,"Very pricey, small portions, very miserable workers who just want to dump your food and get to the next person in line. Its convenient, though."
College Senior,1,"Very expensive, other UCs have free parking on the weekends but not for UCI. Even the town center across the street is very strict about no-student parking and they have parking enforcers watching out. Parking in UCI itself is expensive and you are assigned to certain zones so just because you have a permit doesnt mean you can park anywhere. the more expensive permits are the only ones who can park close by."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is expensive and most of the time its small parking stalls. Sometimes you have to park very far and just walk across campus. Because most of the students commute to school, there are A LOT of students with cars. Best bet, get to class super early, maybe an hour before, park where you're last class is, stop by whatever food restaurant is nearby and catch something to eat before class. If you have multiple classes, just walk, don't drive and when you finish your last class, your car will be right there."
College Freshman,1,"It is SUPER expensive! On average I believe that a parking permit for the campus is $300 a quarter. ($100 a month) Also, most housing facilities near campus also charge a parking permit fee. You'll end up paying about $600 a quarter. ($200 a month)"
College Junior,1,"There are a few garages splattered through campus, but half the spaces are reserved for faculty. If you can't get to the top in time, you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,Buses Are Inconvenient – Public transportation is not good because you have to wait an hour and 30 mins before the next one comes on week days and on weekends 2 hours which makes you want to stay in the house and be bored.
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife at UCI is calm. If you want to party you need to search for the parties. There is not much to do in Irvine if you don't have a car. Transportation is horrible all day long.

Freshman,5,"Incoming freshman.
I am so excited to get started at the school!
The advisors were so nice, and welcoming.
The coaches were great as well, very excited to say the least!"
Freshman,5,"I have not taken courses yet, I also have not taken them online so I cannot speak for the experience just yet."
Freshman,5,"Judson University is a loving, caring, and honest community full of great people. I recommend high schoolers to look into this University."
Freshman,5,The staff and administrators At Judson University are very nice and always there to help you with anything school related and have the best answers to point you in the right direction.
Junior,5,I love this University! Everybody is so friendly and always willing to be there for you when you have a problem. The professors are incredible and are always happy to help their students as well. All in all this university is amazing.
Freshman,5,"After my small time with Judson, I have come to realize how amazing the atmosphere truly is. The people are very close knit and the support is spectacular. For people who love this environment I would highly recommend Judson university."
Freshman,5,I like Judson University's moral code because it creates a peaceful environment. This is my first year at JudsonU and so far it's a bit refreshing walking into the big glass doors to the school. The curriculum is put together in a way that Judson isn't just school it's an experience. And the staff/ faculty members are very friendly. When I need someone to talk too they are always willing to give an ear and I do not think they understand exactly how helpful they are to me. I have not eaten any food at JudsonU's cafeteria but there is a Subway here and the environment  is really clean.
Junior,5,Offers 100% on-line programs that fit my lifestyle.  Admissions counselors are great and have my personal interests in mind.  Participation and feedback are good.
Freshman,5,"Haven't started yet but it's a college for working adults ,it's something I need badly need my degree to be able to coach at different levels.but the staff is great and very very helpful."
Niche User,5,Judson is an amazing place to grow spiritually and intellectually. My favorite part is that I felt welcomed the moment I walked on to campus. Everyone knows everyone and there is such a positive atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"Judson University is a great school if you care about a close knit community, ample chances for spiritual development, and caring faculty and staff. The university cares about the students from a holistic perspective, with a counseling center for emotional health, challenging classes for academic development, and chapel for spiritual enrichment. There are multiple ways for students to be involved in leadership, including resident life, student government, university ministry, and student organizations."
Junior,5,Judson is a school that will allow you to spread your wings as a student to achieve the educational goals to enhance your future.
Junior,5,I would recommend Judson to everyone. I have had great experiences with the school advisors and teachers. I am an older student returning and I have received so much encouragement.
Junior,5,Judson has a great community and one of the best atmospheres for building lifelong friendships. I met my best friend at Judson and she is getting married in the summer and she asked me to be her Maid of Honor. Our relationship has been able to grow because we are involved in some of the same extracurricular activities and it has just been a huge blessing to get to do life with her.
Sophomore,5,"Judson University was always my dream college and it happened. I love all the faculties and teachers there, I get along with them really well, they are teachers that I can talk to whenever I need it. Also the students there are amazing, I haven't made this many friends ever and that is what this school is about, just changing the world with shaping ourselves with others. Also being involved in this school is another thing that works around with me. I can be involved in so many things just so I can get the student life more in a bigger spectrum."
Freshman,5,Judson is a really good college. There's so much of love in the atmosphere and there's community too. The professors are so hardworking and want all the best for you. The college also works towards your growth in every area of life.
College Junior,5,There's a job fair every semester as well as a small team devoted to finding jobs/internships for seeking students.
College Junior,5,Great mixed community with campus-wide events common.
College Freshman,5,I know that many people who come out of the same program come out of school with a job already lined up
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here! For the most part I love my classes, and the professors are all so approachable"
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe around campus all the time
College Freshman,5,"I've gotten to meet so many girls and make so many new friends, I love living in a dorm!"
College Freshman,5,I love it at Judson and have really been enjoying my time here so far. The professors are knowledgeable and approachable and I have met so many great people.
College Sophomore,5,The class size and courses have been worked out really well and the professors really care about and get to know the students in their classes.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel perfectly comfortable walking across campus even late at night by myself, although the community is so strong that rarely happens."
College Freshman,5,It is such a great community and I love the campus and the people
College Freshman,5,All professors care so much
College Freshman,5,Staff/professors help in anyway for job readiness
College Freshman,5,"The loving, Christian atmosphere is so present!"
College Freshman,5,My major requires me to have an internship
College Freshman,5,Great Community! Ohio is for all fresh girls
College Freshman,5,I love my school! It is a great community to be in
College Freshman,5,The campus is extremely safe. You're going to be just fine. My door stays unlocked all the time and nobody has messed with anything.
College Sophomore,5,I love my college. It has a great community that is very supportive. The teachers and  small classes make learning a fun and challenging experience. The religious basis of my school is also very great and helpful. This school has taught me a lot and even built me up as a person.
College Senior,5,It's a great school that has a lot of personal attention and actual caring for your spiritual growth. How there is worship and music business courses offered makes this the perfect school for me that is close enough to home so I can save money by commuting.
College Freshman,5,"They are strict in many things. If it is something that could potentially hurt you (drinking, drugs, etc), they care more about it and it is enforced. If it is something that does not hurt you (noise violations, attendance, parking) they are more likely to give warnings rather than take action against you. 

I think they have good judgement when it comes to our safety."
College Sophomore,5,"LGBT community people are accepted, however their beliefs are not. Diversity Is a big part of Judson, they encourage it."
College Sophomore,5,Plenty of beautiful comfortable places to be and continually updating current facilities.
College Sophomore,5,The faculty does not fore their beliefs on you rather they support and encourage your personal growth in your beliefs.
College Sophomore,5,Just the right amount of strictness to protect students livelihood.
Sophomore,4,I really like the community Judson has to offer. It is a faith based university that allows its students to really discover that aspect of their life on their own. The community is very supportive of its students and overall very accepting of many different view points and perspectives. The student body has a lot of diversity and brings in many international students. The classroom sizes are small and offer a great opportunity for one on one time with professors should one have further questions.
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, our university went to online classes in March. This was a bit of a difficult transition at first especially for design majors losing access to the studios. However, the professors gave everyone the proper materials for projects and were very understanding of the changing circumstances. All professors were able to switch to an online format in a timely manner, with all assignments, lectures, powerpoints,  and books being made available"
Freshman,4,"I took two online classes during my first year and it was less stress. Instead of getting reading and going to class, I would just sit in my room and open my laptop to do my classwork."
Junior,4,"It's a small school with a small campus. I'm a little older, so I knew what I wanted before going in. The school does not have much of a party scene, so it is not for those who are hoping for one. With the CoVid 19 Pandemic going on, I think they were one of the schools who sent their students home reasonably early and moved everything online."
Sophomore,4,"Judson University is a good Christian school, with a really good Architecture program. If you are Christian or an Architecture major I would recommend this school. There is strict rules when it comes to open dorm hours between genders. There is chapel three times a week and in order to get an ""A"" in chapel you need to go 28 times each semester. Yes, the Chapel grade affects your GPA. It is a beautiful campus, but on the downside the campus is pretty isolated, in order to do something, you will need a car."
Alum,4,I did the adult cohort which was great! The courses you needed to graduate were all set to start soon after you finished the one class. This helped make sure I didn't take time off and was focused on the next class versus thinking of the next course to pick.
Senior,4,My experience was incredible. The advisor are always willing and are there to help you ever step of the way.  I do wish they had a better online tutoring system.
Alum,4,"Academics were okay. Being a small school, its sometimes difficult to get the classes you need when they are available."
Junior,4,I like the environment at Judson and the people there.  One thing that could be better is the availability of classes.  Often times it is very hard to fit classes that you need into your schedule because of the infrequent times they are offered.
Alum,4,"The professors are amazing, they really care about their students. If you're attending for academics it's a great school, if you're looking to party not so much."
Sophomore,4,"Judson University is a gem, the university is small but has used its academic resources well for students to excel, the campus is still developing and has plans to keep working to do better. It's a young school and has many years to go, but they have a well established community of faculty and staff with graduates working in prestigious locations around the area."
Sophomore,4,"Judson University is a very small Christian college in Elgin, IL. My experience has been very positive here at Judson. I have created many friends and because of its size I have been able to interact with my professors more. Although my experience has been positive there still are some negatives. The food is average and the dorms are also average."
Freshman,4,Judson has been such a great eye opener for me. With the small campus and the great people I couldn't be happier!
Freshman,4,"Judson university is great except in some dorms it is extremely hot with no AC. The campus is very active and with various animals such as deer, squirrels, raccoons and geese."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Judson University. So far I love everything about it. Everyone throughout the whole process of registering and moving in has been so friendly and helpful. The campus is small and easy to navigate. I feel very safe and have made a lot of friends already. I love starting my day with chapel and getting inspired by the people around me. I'm looking forward to 4 special years at this University!
Freshman,4,Judson University has a great Campus and degree variety. The students and faculty on the campus are all nice people that respect you as another student and if you are in need of help will do their best to help you.
Senior,4,"Judson University is a great faith-based college, in which students have the opportunity to grow mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This college helps a person to broaden their horizons while learning in a safe environment."
Alum,4,"I believe I got a great education from Judson. It just lacked diversity and felt as if I lived in a bubble. Overall, great environment and great experience."
College Junior,4,Overall the quality of living on-campus is above average and the campus staff and faculty are always working to maintain and improve the university's campus and resources.
College Junior,4,"During the day one can feel safe when walking alone, though at night through the darkest parts on campus one might feel uncomfortable."
College Junior,4,"Three of the four residence halls were constructed in the late 1970's, and the fourth a renovated 7-story hotel, so room value and spaciousness is adequate and average. However, the dorm life and roommates/dorm neighbors generally spice up the mood."
College Junior,4,"High student involvement particularly for attending varsity games and attending/participating in intramurals. The ""Blue Crew"" is what us students are called that attend and support the games of varsity sports' teams."
College Freshman,4,"There are certain sports we don't have here but I like that our school really focuses on Christ, its not all about the athletics"
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, the professors seem to care about their students.  A wide variety of courses are offered."
College Sophomore,4,My school is revered for its art and architecture department.
College Sophomore,4,My school takes student safety very seriously and cares about their students.
College Sophomore,4,The one thing I don't like is the separation of freshmen from everyone else--they are in their own dorm.
College Sophomore,4,The school draws athletes internationally and the coaches care about the spiritual life of the athletes as well as their academics.
College Sophomore,4,I would definitely choose my school again because the classes are challenging.
College Sophomore,4,There are a ton of people who come in to talk to students and make sure they have jobs and internships for the present and future.
College Sophomore,4,They make sure that students are loved on and in the best situation that they can be in.
College Sophomore,4,Our Athletics are great and an intricate part of the campus culture.
College Sophomore,4,I love the grading system in the History of Civ I and BST-101&102
College Sophomore,4,I grew spiritually and academically in this school. Professors and staff are always glad to help students.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall crime is very very low. Safety is huge on campus. There are campus security whenever you need them and for whatever you need them for. Health center does a great job of being open most hours of the day. Not entirely sure on the rape culture on campus but did have a friend that was raped and the school did nothing significant to help her. The university could not rule it a rape but that they did have sexual intercourse. By by that standard, in accordance to Judson's lifestyle agreement, they both should have been punished in some way or expelled from the school, which did not happen either."
Recent Alumnus,4,Application to Judson was fairly easy to do and complete. I was able to apply within 20 minutes and I was accepted fairly quickly as well. Not a huge wait time on acceptance or denial
Recent Alumnus,4,There are great facilities on Judson campus. Track is a huge sport on campus yet there is not track field anywhere on Judson's 19 acre school yard.
Recent Alumnus,4,Judson is a great school with a great education program. I wish that the classes were available at better times other than early morning or late evening into the night. I also wish they did not raise the prices of tuition every two years as it is already very expensive and I do not think that the tuition is appropriate for the lack of class times and lack of flexibility in majors.
College Freshman,4,"Great atmosphere, lots of ways to get involved"
College Freshman,4,"I am currently a student at Judson University and I have to say that it is a great school. The school is known for its strong sense of community and it definitely fulfills that. I am currently not a resident student, I am a commuter, therefore getting that sense of community is harder for students such as myself. Everyone in the school seems to know each other and respect each other. I completely admire that! 

What I do not like about my school is that most of us commuter students fee,l in a way, under appreciated. There are some events that help us get to know our fellow commuters, but not other events that are meant to encourage unity between resident and commuter students. It seems as if we are invisible. I feel like the school could do a better job in assisting commuter students and making them feel like Judson is meant to be a second home."
College Senior,4,I love the teachers and my co hort.  THe support staff leaves alot to be desired
College Freshman,4,The community is great. I do feel like certain academic requirements are too much.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't participated yet, but others say that it's phenomenal."
College Freshman,4,"The Judson community is amazing. The courses are challenging, but the professors are amazing."
College Junior,4,One of my professors was relatively uninterested.
College Freshman,4,Campus safety is pretty good but takes a bit long when locked out of dorm. Needs a bit more lighting on long paths.
College Freshman,4,Most professors are great- some grade late
College Freshman,4,Good sports but not great facilities for athletes
College Freshman,4,It's really a lot of fun most days. Sometimes it can get a little boring but for the most part you'll have a good time.
College Freshman,4,If you try getting to know your professors and make sure they know how you are they will line you up with jobs.
College Freshman,4,"Wilson Hall is the best place to go if you want to hangout with a bunch of guys all the time. I live on first floor and it's pretty sweet except the spiders and being the only floor, yes floor, on campus with communal showers. It's the closet to everything."
College Freshman,4,"I don't do a lot of sports, so I can't say with a 100% certainty that they are up to what they need to be, but I don't hear much complaining about them around campus and I would assume that if they weren't up to par then they people would complain."
College Freshman,4,"So far, I love Judson. The staff and the community genuinely care for one another and create a warm, rich, environment to learn and grow from. The only real concerns I have are improving some of the living spaces and adding to some programs that don't get enough attention. Some majors get a lot of attention, like any involved in design courses and music business, and I understand why. They are some of the popular majors and are what a lot of students come for. With that being said, some of the other majors fall through the cracks a little bit. Psychology majors only get a handful of professors to choice from and I think the students hurt from that. Not everyone learns from one main teacher it would be nice to have variety. The housing could improve. Some of the dorms have a lot of pest problems. Overall, I am enjoying my time at Judson and can't wait to finish out my 4 years here."
College Sophomore,4,"Love the campus and all of the people that I have meet here. The layout of the campus and all of there buildings could be a little better mainly because we are a architecture and you would think we could do a little better in that area. But thats the only problem I've had here at judson which isn't even a big problem. I love the professors, and the classes, and the staff and all the activities they have provided to us. Overall one of the best colleges I've ever stepped on."
College Junior,4,"Very intentional students, finding their purpose in life. Nice campus."
College Sophomore,4,Living off campus is a must. If you truly want to experience college then you need to get an apartment off campus. There you will be able to do what you want and engage with the opposite sex in social activities and be able to have a party or two and not have to worry about people wandering around and barging in and ruining the fun.
College Freshman,4,"Alexander's Cafe has great meals and great deserts, and is only 1-2 minutes from campus.

Al's Cafe has great ice cream and is a cute little downtown restaurant.

There are always places (think typical fast food) you can go to eat if you want to in the middle of the night, but you will need a car."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid process was easy enough. All the staff here is very helpful in trying to get you as much money as you need to come here. They told you about scholarships offered that you could apply for and they answered any questions you had. 

I would recommend if you were concerned about financial aid you set up a meeting. Don't hesitate to ask questions or see if there are scholarships you can get."
College Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere here! The people are great! Ohio Hall (freshman girls dorm) is friendly looking and decorated nicely, and there rest of the dorm buildings are too. 

The only problems I have had about location is Lindner Tower is a little further away from the rest of the campus, so on rainy days (or really cold days) you dread the 5-10 minute walk over there. 

For what we are getting I think the cost is adequate. The beautiful friendships I have made because of living on campus are worth much more than any price tag."
College Senior,4,the sports programs give goo scholarships
Sophomore,2,"It is a religious school. Therefore, if you are not from this religious background you might feel excluded from most of the activities in campus. The small classes are really helpful. However, some professors talk too much about religion in subjects that you simply can't put religion in it. The athletic life is average. The campus is well located, staying about 50 minutes from Chicago."
Junior,2,"I did not like the school. It used the money it received poorly, was incredibly strict on the students, and overall was way too expensive for what you were receiving."
Senior,2,"This college on a personal level has given me nothing but grief. Consider living on campus, if you don't you wont have any friends. If you aren't a religious person, don't come here. Most of the faculty, classes and student life make it necessary to be a religious person to enjoy whats offered. That being said the chapel speakers and events have improved over the last few years. There are also plans to expand the university and to greatly modernize the housing and dorms."
College Senior,2,Seems like a push to get you enrolled and no one at the local office knew what they were doing afterwards.
College Sophomore,2,"The fact that you can only have the opposite sex in the room if the door is open and your feet are on the ground is absurd. Although this is a Christian University, you should be able to close the door and lay down on a bed or couch without needing to keep your feet on the ground. Also they need to extend the hours and days that you can have the opposite sex in your dorm."
College Senior,2,Unless you're living with your parents-- you shouldn't live off campus
College Sophomore,2,I personally like it but I hear many negatives about it.
College Junior,2,"There is a bus system that runs right next to campus but I don't think people use it very much. Still, its available and I think it connects to anywhere you would want to go in town, but more likely you'll just get rides from people if you don't have a car. A car isn't necessary though, as the campus from one far end to the other is only like a 10-15 minute walk tops."
College Senior,2,There is a bus route that comes by the school but it does not get utilized very much and does not come often. There is train station about 5 minutes down the road that offers great affordable round trips to Chicago.
College Junior,2,Parking is very limited and restricted. Tickets are given frequently but it isn't the fault of the students that the parking is not always available where it should be.
Recent Alumnus,2,everyone goes home on weekends and its pretty dull if your not from the area
College Sophomore,2,Campus safety tickets everyone. They are fake mall cops with a flashlight and roll around on a golf cart because if they start walking around campus they might break out into cardiac arrest. They are clowns.
College Sophomore,2,"The Aid in the Aid Office – I am currently dissatisfied with the service rendered me by the financial aid office at JU.  Apart from the fact that my aid the second year was significantly lower that last year-despite the fact that my GPA was unchanged, it is nearly impossible to contact my adviser.  I am actually still waiting to hear back from the office regarding questions I had posed to them several weeks ago."
Freshman,1,My online learning experience is horrible sometimes I don’t get emails from teachers then sometime my wifi always messing up then some of my work do not save or never submit but it’s very hard
Alum,1,This university is all about making an extra buck wherever they can. The professors are easily their for the money and nothing else. Most of the classes I had take on campus could have very well been online classes due to the fact that a majority of their professors just read off slides provided by the textbook companies. The quizzes and tests would then just mirror that. The environment was not very inclusive. It was more exclusive and judgmental.
College Senior,1,Would not know anything about it.  Have not heard anything.
College Freshman,1,There is only one frat on campus and it was made up as a joke..
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely nothing to do on the weekends. If you want to have a good time you need to leave campus and go to someone's apartment to engage in social activity.
College Sophomore,1,They close the library at 11 making it hard to stay up late for all nighters.
College Sophomore,1,Sciences are not taken seriously
College Senior,1,"Judson University does not let you live off campus unless you live with your parents less than 45 minutes away, are married, or are of 23 years of age."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive very much financial aid and trying to get the small amount of financial aid was difficult.
College Sophomore,1,"JU Food Blehhh – Judson University has limited dining hours. They are constantly serving food that lacks taste and is served multiple times weekly. The only thing consistant about food in the dining hall is the cereal, unless that is if they run out of milk."
College Sophomore,1,There are very few clubs near Judson University and the few are too far from the school to be accessible to students

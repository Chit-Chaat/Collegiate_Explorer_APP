Senior,5,Online learning experience at MSUM has been exceptional. The professors are always available through Zoom and always willing to even reschedule the time for international students who have been back to their countries.
Sophomore,5,"MSU-Moorhead is a medium sized college, with a home town feel. Being in the heart of Moorhead gives you access not only to the Moorhead area but the Fargo area! Besides it being a great university its an even better place to live!"
Niche User,5,I really like the campus and what the area has to offer. The buildings are all pretty close together which makes navigating the area easier.
Freshman,5,"I liked the overall atmosphere of this campus. I felt as though it was a very positive atmosphere to place myself in as well as the classes themselves were challenging, but in a good way."
Niche User,5,"I loved the community feel of the school. Close relationships can be created with so many students and teachers. The campus is beautiful, organized, and welcoming. Getting to places was so convenient and the location of the school is great. The professors focus on the good of the students and providing them with the best education they could receive. Great school."
Niche User,5,"It is a great college and I can not wait to go there next year. That have a great campus, and great academic and athletic programs. I definitely recommend going here."
Freshman,5,"I like Minnesota State University Moorhead because they offers in-state tuition to all student. They have an average class size of 24 with 17:1 student -faculty ratio which helps facilitate one on one interactions with professors. Taking about facilities, MSUM has one of the best State-of-the-art facilities Langseth Hall and Hagen Hall which are modern facilities providing experiential, student-centered learning in interesting spaces that are devoted to research and discovery. In addition to outstanding labs on campus, you can learn and do research at a field station at the MSUM Regional Science Center.
Furthermore, faculty-mentored research is the hallmark of the Biosciences department. Faculty and student collaborators regularly publish in academic peer-reviewed journals and present at regional and national conferences. Faculty and student researchers meet regularly to discuss research. These are but a few reasons why I like Minnesota State University Moorhead."
Senior,5,"I love both the classroom size and the professor involvement. My advisor has not only helped me every step along the way, but she was a crucial part of why I wanted to get my human resource minor! She is open and honest about each class, and has helped me to lay out my schedule in advance in the best way possible. I am able to have such a good relationship with her because of the size of the school!"
Freshman,5,"When I started the hunt for the perfect campus, I accidentally heard someone taking about MSUM and decided to take a look, it was a great decision. The campus is small and a close knit community. Everyone here is so nice including professors, advisors and upperclassman. Never be afraid to ask questions around campus as everyone are willing to help you out. The one experience that struck me the most was move in day, there were volunteers standing outside each dorm hall waiting to help out. The atmosphere was welcoming and warm, helped freshman feels comfortable in our new home. Student life is excellent at MSUM because there is always something for you to do. There are so many chances to make new friends and be familiar with the community. Overall, if one is looking for a small, warm and close knit community to be apart of, do make Minnesota State University Moorhead a place to visit before making the final decision."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is very kind and welcoming on campus and there are many activities and opportunities to connect with other students!
Junior,5,"MSUM is the only university in its area of the Midwest that has 4-year programs for film and animation. It’s not necessarily a large or “big name” college, but they take pride in their students and what they can accomplish."
Senior,5,I love MSUM and I think it is a university that truly offers several amazing opportunities! I feel welcomed in all aspects. The professors and faculty really do all they can to lead students in the right direction towards success. I feel confident graduating from MSUM and comfortable to go out in the real world with the things I have learned there.
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my major program at MSUM.  The program was small enough that my professors all knew me by name; this make working with them closely as a junior and senior on research and internships much easier than if there were more professors who were too busy to get to know their students.  It was unfortunate that the Native American Studies program when I was there was being dismantled; I had intended to have a minor in this area, and was unfortunately forced to withdraw from classes at the last minute due to not being able to get the necessary credits."
Sophomore,5,"This school feels like home! From helpful professors to a close knit campus, everywhere I go I always recognize a friendly face. We have a wonderful education program and many other accredited programs. I have enjoyed every day at MSUM and I'm sure you will too!"
Junior,5,"From the moment you step on campus at MSUM, you are in a welcoming environment from everyone you meet. The faculty and administration works to ensure that every student has the opportunities nessesary to achieve. The student life is a cut above the rest. With over 100 student organizations and clubs, students are given the freedom and opportunity to find their place based on their own interests. The facilities are clean and well maintained. The campus is accessible and well planned out. The surrounding Fargo/Moorhead area provides a welcoming community that has all the amenities of a metropolitan area, with the connected community feeling of a small town. A close knit community where you’re bound to see someone you know on your way around campus. This creates lasting relationships between friends and peers that can last a life time. If you’re interested in a University that will work to propel you to the next stage of your life, then Minnesota State University Moorhead is for you."
Niche User,5,"My brother attends here and has good things to say! It’s small which he likes and preferred, the class sizes are not large so he feels comfortable. The campus is nice and suprinsgly up to date and very nice! Food is good and the people at  all very nice and friendly"
Junior,5,"I love how beautiful our campus is, and all the student organizations available to get people engaged with other students and campus life. I also enjoy most of my professors and their teaching styles."
Alum,5,"I graduated from MSUM's ABA-approved paralegal program.  The professors are excellent and it is a small program, so you are more than just a number.  MSUM is a small campus (it reminds me of a large city high school).  There are a couple of places to get food, either on a meal plan or just regularly.  The library is quite nice.  It is a respectable school, and there is quite a bit of diversity considering the area that the school is located in (upper Midwest)."
Junior,5,"I love being a student at MSUM because I am surrounded by a community that cares about my success. I enjoy the hands-on learning experiences. There are so many opportunities available to students, even on a smaller campus."
Freshman,5,"This university is like a family, and I would recommend it to anyone to study here. When I came here as an in terminational freshman, I thought it would be hard for me to adapt and get along with the other people, but this all the people here treated me like family, everyone is nice and this made me feel like home here."
Freshman,5,"My first year at MSUM has been amazing!  I enjoy the diverse on-campus activities that are available. My professors and advisors have been an invaluable bonus to my education.  The classes offered through MSUM, as well as the tri-college arrangement, will prepare me for my future.  Dorm life, while being an obvious change from living at home with my parents, has been a major asset to starting my education.  Moorhead is a great community to be a part of."
Freshman,5,MSUM is an inviting environment with many activities available and a close knit campus that is easy to navigate and fun to explore.  I has a very homey feel yet independence is evident in the college scene.
Senior,5,I love MSUM! The class sizes are small. The campus is small. The professors take time to get to know you! I really enjoyed MSUM because of the teaching program. They made sure I had plenty of opportunities to get out into a classroom to make sure I am in the field I should be in.
Freshman,5,"I love MSUM so far. The campus is gorgeous, the professors are awesome, and the overall environment is great!"
Freshman,5,"I'm so glad I chose to attend MSUM. It has a small town community feel in a urban area. Everything on campus has easy access, and the campus mall is wonderful regardless of season. The dining hall has a pretty good variety of food, along with the six different restaurants located in the student union. There is a great variety of classes, and my experiences with professors have all been positive. The campus is near several grocery stores, which comes in handy. Public safety is quick to arrive if you ever need help, from wanting an escort across campus or jump starting your car. Overall, I'm very happy with choosing to go to MSUM!"
Senior,5,Excellent faculty with wonderful staff. Small class sizes and a genuine sense of community. More communication and collaboration between majors would be helpful for preparing students to launch successful careers. Many professors are willing to work with students on an individual basis to assist with classwork. Moorhead it's self is a pretty dry town but has a lot of potential to be something more.
Freshman,5,"The classes offered are interesting and fun without being too difficult to complete. A lot of the professors are very cool and funny along with being able to teach their subjects extremely well. The students and organizations are very diverse and inclusive. I am doing well academically and socially, better than I had thought I would, and I am very glad I decided to go here."
Junior,5,"I could go on and on about how much I love my school, but I'll try to make it short. MSUM is a place you can always call home. No matter where you are in life, whether you're still living on campus or graduated 15+ years ago, MSUM has a sense on community among it's members that make everyone feel welcome and like they belong here. I am very involved on campus and have met so many wonderful people over the past few years. I like to call MSUM the ""Goldilocks School"" of the Fargo-Moorhead trio of 4-year universities. It's not too big, but it's not too small; it's just the right size. At about 6,000 students, it's small enough where you really get to know your peers and make lasting friendships, but it's big enough where you can meet new people every day, whether it's in your new semester class, joining a new organization, or through mutual friends. I am a proud Dragon. Also, President Anne is a fantastic human being. #AnneFan #DragonPride"
College Sophomore,5,"I know housing seems expensive, but it is such a great way to meet friends, be close to campus, and stay involved since you are most likely on campus more. The renovations they are working on are excellent! The housing process is a smooth transaction. You can always go to someone if you are having troubles!"
College Sophomore,5,"MSUM wants the best for their students! They try to get us all involved on campus by joining clubs, sports, etc. They something for everyone. There are tutoring stations when you need help on certain subjects. We are like one big family!"
College Sophomore,5,"Rated as one of the top schools in Minnesota, degrees from MSUM are valued and appreciated. Internships can be found in almost anything, and is it relatively easy to find a job in your related field after graduating."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus housing here is absolutely fantastic. I'm staying in West Snarr, and I absolutely love it. All of my classes are within a 5 minute walk, and both the fitness center and Kise are across the street. Everything is within close range and is easy to navigate."
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of team spirit, and great fans. The athletic facilities are up to date with anything students need, even those not participating in team sports but rather for free time."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Students from all over the globe provide insight and force the majority to be more culturally tolerant. In general, everyone is already fairly open-minded. I've never witnessed discrimination on campus grounds."
Recent Alumnus,5,Time with my professors in the art department were rewarding even when I struggled. My professors are very dear to me and I will always feel comfortable going to them for advice and guidance.
Recent Alumnus,5,I had wonderful relationships with professors at my school.
College Sophomore,5,The value of my degree from MSUM is one of the best. My program at this school opens many doors for me!
College Freshman,5,Public Safety is always around campus and the president works very hard on preventing sexual assault.
College Freshman,5,I like it. It is the best school for my program as it has the best education program in the state of Minnesota.
College Freshman,5,"I am a part of a learning community, many of us have the same classes which is a huge help when working on homework and studying for tests."
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and the people I have met there. Wouldn't have done anything differently!
College Sophomore,5,"MSUM is a wonderful campus.  I love the many opportunities to get involved and meet people on campus.  I made many close friends in my learning community, sorority, and various clubs.  There are always a lot of events going on too, many of which are hosted by Dragons After Dark and Dragon Entertainment Group.  I've found it very easy to find my niche and feel very at home here."
College Sophomore,5,It's fast and easy and the financial aid office is extremely helpful. There are tons of scholarship opportunities.
College Sophomore,5,"We have so many different courses offered on campus its crazy. You can take your major classes and take generals that have nothing to do with your major like Japanese Culture. The curriculum for the most part is pretty interesting when it comes to what we are learning. The workload isn't too bad, but again it depends on the class."
College Junior,5,"Because I'm an international student there are limited scholarships I can apply for, but because I'm international MSUM gives me an automatic scholarship for just attending the university and this means that I get to pay in-state tuition. This saves me so much money and is also the reason why our campus is diverse."
College Junior,5,"There are groups for LGBT, and many different ethnicities on campus. I think they do a good job of helping everyone find a group to support them and understand these individuals."
College Student,5,"Ballard Hall, the dorm I live in is at most a 5 minute walk from basically everywhere on campus. This is really convenient because it means that I can wake up 10 minutes before class and still be able to make it in time for class. One thing I dislike about the housing are the quiet hours which I think start too early. It's also much more expensive to live on campus but amenities like water, electricity and internet are provided."
College Student,5,I've always loved working with computers and studying computer science only makes studying more fun for me. I like the program because the professors make learning easy and they slow down to the pace of every student.
College Student,5,MSUM is a very diverse campus with students from all over the world co-existing peacefully and striving for a common goal.
College Freshman,5,"Being a film production major has been really awesome so far. The film department has a convenient system for checking out high quality professional film equipment. They also have made computer labs available with the proper software needed for editing all film assignments. The classes are great and really informative. There are a few clubs available, but I didn't really enjoy either of them. 
Workload has been easy to manage so far. It's really really nice that all the film profs know each other and kind of know what's going on in each other's courses, so they work together and often are teaching coinciding material at the same times. 
From what i've heard a lot of internships are available for the upper classes, and we also have great exchange opportunities. "
College Junior,5,I'm still new at this program but I'm confident it will help me get a job in the film industry. I'm very passionate about working in the film industry but I don't specifically know where I would be suited best in that industry yet.
College Junior,5,No difficulties. No criteria. You just apply if that is what you are interested in.
College Freshman,5,The major and emphasis that I was looking for is offered and the professors are helpful in finding the correct one for each student
College Freshman,5,Everything went smoothly and I got the financial aid I needed. They were helpful and the forms were easy to understand
College Freshman,5,"Always a spot to park in, never have to walk too far. Reasonably price for convenience"
College Sophomore,5,"The libraries are the best.The libraries have variety of books, study areas, and many computers to satisfy student needs.Places where students can carry out group discussions and individual studies are available."
College Sophomore,5,The school is located in a place where is condusive for studying away from noice destruction and the class size gives each student an opportunity to learn and be explained of topics they don't understand.
College Freshman,5,Majority of the computers are Apple brand. Everything is high tech and very nice. The internet is fast and you can print for free.
College Freshman,5,I am an Accounting major and I have no problems with it. I love everything about it.
College Freshman,5,I think everything to do with computers is fine especially the fact that the lab is open every hour of the day.
Alum,4,"I attended for social work. It was a good school. Most of my professors were excellent. I liked the diversity and the opportunities available at the school. I really enjoyed my internship, as well. I learned a lot at Minnesota State University Moorhead and am grateful I had the opportunity to attend."
Alum,4,The online experience was alright. I didn't mind taking the online classes. They require you to be more self-motivated but the professors were good.
Sophomore,4,Overall great school. Weekend activities basically don’t exist so there’s nothing to do on campus. WiFi low key sucks
Senior,4,"As a senior student at MSUM, I love the size of the classes and how we can interact with professors more compare to larger size universities. Our campus is always secured by 24/7 campus security and i have not seen any major crime happened on Campus. The only thing that I would like to see in the future is that more STEM majors."
Senior,4,I like the atmosphere here and the way the professors are willing to help you out when you need it. Most of the other students around campus are friendly and so is that staff.
Senior,4,Most professors did pre-recorded lectures or held discussions via zoom. It was quite helpful to have help from them and not just a textbook.
Sophomore,4,"MSUM is a good college that's very diverse and accepting so it's easy to feel at home there. Facilities recently renovated so the campus itself is very nice. College is compact, almost all right next to each other so commutes between classes are very easy. Fargo Moorhead is a quirky artsy city but very cold in winter."
Freshman,4,"Campus dorms are really nice. All people here are friendly and always ready to offer help. The diversity of students also on high point. Professors kindness and intention to help students is just perfect. Would love to come to this school again, if i had chance!"
Junior,4,"This is actually still the beginning of my first semester here at MSUM, but so far it has been great. The professors and staff have been very helpful and informative as I get settled in."
Senior,4,"I don't think there's anything I would change, there are a few professors that I would replace but that's something every college deals with."
Senior,4,The classes and overall help I've recieved from professors were great. If you want help they will provide it. Everything goes pretty smoothly and living on campus makes all the buildings close by. But even if you didn't live on campus there's ample parking spots near almost every academic building.
Sophomore,4,"Really enjoyed my time at MSUM, since it’s a smaller university, there’s naturally more limited options and diversity as opposed to a much larger university, but very good for the price. Very safe and affordable and easy commute."
Sophomore,4,Completing my first year at MSUM has been really good. The overall atmosphere I would rate would be 8/10 in my opinion. I really loved the people there and the classes provided for my major. The grounds were always well kept. Only reason I'm not this a 10 is because the food could be better.
Junior,4,"Everyone on campus is nice. The professors that I've had so far are extremely helpful and truly want their students to succeed. All of the amenities on campus are easy to locate and are within walking distance. The campus is in the heart of Moorhead, which makes it convenient to go to the local stores and restaurants. One change that I would like to see happen is that a couple of the dorms need more renovations, particularly in Holmquist. There is no air conditioning in the rooms on the top two floors and the heaters are not automatic and only run for 10 minutes before blowing cold air."
Niche User,4,When I toured everyone was so inclusive and inviting and it just felt like they wanted me. I’m now so excited to go there and become a dragon.
Sophomore,4,"I think the biggest thing I like about MSUM is that they're known for their education program. That's the field I'm going into so I'm very confident in the education I will receive to become a teacher. I also like that MSUM is one of the cheapest 4-year schools in Minnesota. One thing I would like to see change is our diversity. It's better than I thought it would be based on where we're located, but we still have work to do. There aren't as many professors who are POC and/or LGBTQ+ as I would like to see. The school also advertises diversity, but a majority of the POC on our campus are international students. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the advertisement, it seems a little misleading because you assume the students are from MN or another state."
Sophomore,4,"Minnesota State University Moorhead is quite the diverse campus. Students from all over the world come to this school and leave wishing their friends and community would join them back home. It's a home away from home, but it doesn't always know the best ways to keep up with the culture side of things. With so many different styles of learning, living and leading MSUM at times lacks on it's inclusiveness of staff to student (extracurricular funding) needs.. Something to grow and improve in but a welcoming community."
Sophomore,4,"I just transferred to Moorhead and I can easily say I am pleased with my decision. All the professors are passionate about what they teach, but more importantly they show interest in every individual student. It is easy to grow a student/ teacher relationship because the professors prove they care about your success."
Sophomore,4,Very friendly and all my teachers have been good. Clean place. Has nice gym. Inexpensive compared to other schools in Minnesota. Everything is a short walk which is nice cause it’s freezimg cold in the winter.
Junior,4,"I enjoy the size of the campus; it's still a larger school, but its still easy to connect with people and faculty on campus."
Senior,4,It is a small school so that the professors can really connect with the students. I feel like I have had the ability to learn quickly and easily because the professors care and because I am able to connect with the other students in my small classes. The only thing that I would change would be that we all want a D2L app that can be downloaded to phones/tablets.
Junior,4,I have loved every minute of my time at MSUM and would recommend that if you are thinking about attending this university that you do. #GODRAGONS
Junior,4,The school is small so it makes it easier to interact more with your professors. The professors are willing to listen and assist if you put in the effort. There are tons of student club and activities to get involved with.
Freshman,4,"I had an amazing time at Moorhead pursuing an Animation degree. I took many film classes for this degree and the professors were great! They knew how to teach and made it interesting. Every once and a while I'd run into a tough professor that may have made a class challenging, but as long as I worked hard, I got amazing grades. The food could use some work. I remember the food takings awesome in the beginning and really starting to suck at the end. They do have an asian grill though, so that is a huge plus! The student life is great. I got an updated dorm, so that is nice. I would recommend 100% joining a learning community. I have that to thank for my success academically and socially on campus. The athletics aren't horrible. I know a lot of people say they go unheard of, but I was on the rugby and ultimate frisbee team. It was fun and the people on the teams took it seriously."
Niche User,4,"I like the fact that it was in my price range, great financial aid, and also the staff was very relatable."
Freshman,4,"It is a college that has a great campus, wonderful instructors overall, and a great variety for the cost of tuition. The music program in particular is very refined and exceptional."
Freshman,4,"I love that it's a small campus and that you get to know almost everyone pretty quickly. It is also a very nice campus, meaning the people, because everyone at least smiles at each other is not they say hi. One thing that I am not very fond of on campus is Kise Commons because they don't have much of a variety, it seems to be the same things everyday, which gets old after a while. But the professors are very understanding and kind. They are pretty lenient when it comes to things like extending deadlines and helping out the students with classwork and assignments."
Freshman,4,I love the overall feel of the campus and the size. It is a small campus without being too small. The classes are engaging and professors truly care. It provides a great college atmosphere.
Junior,4,"It is a very small beautiful tight-knit campus. Literally, every single one of the professors want to help you and support you every step of the way. I just recently transferred there after attending a community college and everyone I met--faculty and peers-- is so helpful. I've only been there for one semester so far and it feels like my second home. This is definitely the college you want to attend if you want a small, heavily student-focused community."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Minnesota State University Moorhead is unlike any other! The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education."
Freshman,4,"I liked the professors, they are very engaging. The campus is pretty, and the people are very welcoming."
Senior,4,"It's a nice, small campus. The classes are all really easy to get to and I have run into more good professors than bad. Moorhead is connected to Fargo and it's not too big, but big enough to find things to do. The only problem is how they're cutting some classes out."
Senior,4,"I absolutely love it here at MSUM. Every professor I've had has been great, they have been respectful, and they all have been very understanding of any problems that may have arisen."
Freshman,4,"I love the running program at Moorhead.  I don't like the campus food much.  Not a lot of healthy options.  The academics is average.  Nothing outstanding,"
Freshman,4,It's a nice area with quite a bit to do in the nearby cities. It has really low tuition but gets you where basically every other college does. The housing is a wash where you can be like me and get a really good hall or get an absolutely terrible one and pay way too much for it. The food in the dining hall is actually pretty good too. 
College Junior,4,What makes my school unique is the fact that its a very small university.  We have less students in classrooms than the normal campus which makes learning easier as professors can have their classes set up to be more focused on which type of students he or she has.
College Junior,4,"Coming from a small college, I was shocked to see how many fans come to university sporting events. I love the environment of school spirit and cheering so loud that it amps up the performance of the players. There is nothing like it. It's amazing to see wins and even great loses, hard work always shows on the court/field/etc. and to see fans appreciate the hard work makes it worthwhile."
College Junior,4,"I just transferred to Minnesota State University Moorhead this fall from a small community college. I had the expectation that the class size would be huge and the professors wouldn't care as much about personal lives of the students. I was way off. I walk out of every class I have with a smile on my face even after an hour and a half lecture. I feel more connected to this school than I did with community college. The class sizes are bigger, but the professors try their best to have everyone involved in discussions. Moorhead is known as the best small city in America, and I agree. You have a large population but it feels small enough to have a lot of personal relationships with people, just like campus. I would definitely choose this school again. It's refreshing wanting to go to class and knowing I am taking in information that will actually benefit me in my future."
College Senior,4,I enjoy my time there.
College Sophomore,4,"They have courses for most anything, but if MSUM doesn't offer a certain class we have Tri-College. Which means you can attend a class at Concordia or NDSU for the price of MSUM classes! It is awesome!! Professors are willing to help you, but I'm always to scared or nervous to go to their offices."
College Sophomore,4,"They have courses for most anything, but if MSUM doesn't offer a certain class we have Tri-College. Which means you can attend a class at Concordia or NDSU for the price of MSUM classes! It is awesome!! Professors are willing to help you, but I'm always to scared or nervous to go to their offices."
College Sophomore,4,"There is security walking, biking, and driving on around campus especially at night. You can reach them at any hour if you need help of any kind. They do a grand job!"
College Sophomore,4,"I know they do a lot of volunteering around the campus and community! I was asked to join Delta Zeta, but I honestly just don't have money or time to do so. If I did I would really like the experience!"
College Junior,4,"My college is very accepting of others as well as inclusive. It offers an excellent teaching program which is why I decided to attend, as well as a comforting small campus appeal. The classes usually average around 30 students, and that allows for more one-on-one time with professors which I enjoy. If I had to choose again I would definitely choose MSUM again."
College Freshman,4,"Nice, and even renovated buildings too!"
College Freshman,4,I am not a part of greek life.
College Freshman,4,"Division 2, and very competitive."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are welcoming and engaging, and bring together a range of teaching styles to show students the real world. The variety of courses offered is very helpful, and class sizes are relatively small, giving students a better one on one relationship with the teacher."
College Sophomore,4,"Over all this is a very safe campus. With good lighting at night, and many officers being in close vicinity, it is a safe area to walk alone compared to many schools. I feel comfortable knowing that there are people doing what they can to make sure I'm safe."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a fun an exciting school to attend. With a diverse range of programs, there's something for everyone. The classrooms and students are diverse, making it a cultural experience for everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,Courses from seasoned professors are highly beneficial and give out a fairly reasonable workload. They understand their students and work alongside them to assist them in achieving their goals.
Recent Alumnus,4,There has been sexual assault reports from campus but I'm not familiar with how the situation was handled and if extra precautions were set in place to prevent future occurrences.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As mentioned before they've renovated all but one dorm building. Everything is fairly new, clean, convenient and less gloomy."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy living on campus. It is very convenient, and easy to make new friends, especially as a first year student. The social atmosphere is great in every dorm building. I have not heard of any complaints on anything, or any dorm floors."
College Freshman,4,"I voted four stars because I don't know much about the Greek Life. What I do know is here at MSUM we have a dry campus, and our Greeks do not throw parties. What are Greeks do is help out, and do a lot of things for other students on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,The alumni network is great through athletics and even with professors.
Recent Alumnus,4,Administrators try hard to make sure to keep everyone informed of what is happening around us.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors were great, I had a really good educational experience."
College Senior,4,"The athletics program is growing, but fan involvement is still relatively low. The athletic department is doing a good job considering the budget it is working with."
College Senior,4,The University does a great job preparing students for life after college and giving them a connection to the growing community.
Junior,2,"Moorhead has very limited staff in the film department and only one professor for animation. We really could use a bigger department with more teachers and better rooms to work and study in. 
Right now we are in the basement of the Arts and most of the film equipment is either broken or needs repairing, so watch out."
College Junior,2,The Greek life isn't talked about all that much.  It exists and you know the location but it's not much of interest.
College Junior,2,MSUM isn't know for its athletics.  Its nothing to write home about and the students and athletes know this.
Recent Alumnus,2,"While the school board seems to invest a considerable amount in our campus' athletics the majority of the students are well aware that, compared to the teams of two other colleges in the area, our school's athletes are mediocre at best."
Recent Alumnus,2,The greek life comes off as non-existent though there are a small amount of people involved.
College Freshman,2,Scholarships are pretty small and don't have much impact.
College Junior,2,"I did not enjoy the campus dining hall during my freshman year. I have heard that it has improved, however from my experience I noticed that there were not that many healthy options. There was a salad bar at all times but no fruit except random days. Pizza was served everyday and cheese pizza was sometimes the only vegetarian option, besides a salad. The drinks in my opinion were disgusting. No fresh juices and only sodas. The juices that were available was pretty much sugar syrup. However the hot dishes were pretty good. I liked the breakfast menu where they make fresh individual omelets. Sometimes they had good stir fry. Rarely did they offer seafood. Pork, beef and chicken were popular options with every meal."
College Freshman,2,It's the border between Minnesota and North Dakota. Neither state is known for great winters (unless one loves snow and cold). The campus does a pretty good job of keeping campus sidewalks and roads clear as best as can be expected. The same cannot be said of sidewalks and roads off-campus.
College Sophomore,2,Fan support is terrible for football. Winter sports are more fun to attend 
College Freshman,2,"There is almost nothing to do in the town of Moorhead, and the clubs and activities offered on campus are pretty weak. "
College Senior,2,It's a small town but it doesn't mean there cant be close restaurant near by nor stores.
College Freshman,2,"It snows a ton here, and often drops below 0 because of the windchill."
College Freshman,2,If you have a parking pass then parking would at least be a B but parking passes are over $100. There are some meter parking but you are only allowed so much time and sometimes there's a 3 hour lab you have to do. The roads aren't too bad but you might have to park a block or two away. There's very little food places in Moorhead so you would have to drive to Fargo where there are hundreds of stores and restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,"The main campus dining center, Kise, tends to be sub par/terrible.  Some days will be relatively good, when they have certain meals, or if it is a dragon day (freshman registration) and they're trying to impress the parents.  Weekends at Kise also tend to be worse than weekdays.  Else, the food tends to be overcooked, not have much variety, and the staff's attitudes are so-so.  Kise is also pretty small, so during certain times (ie. lunch - usually 12:30ish) it may be hard to find a seat.

Union city, Subs and Sweets, and the Dragon Stop however (where currently you can use dragon dollars here, but not any of your meal plan meals), are actually pretty good."
College Freshman,2,It is so windy and cold. I am not used to it but I will have to adjust. It's just good that I live on campus and the buildings are close to each other.
College Junior,2,"They're pretty decently cheap and there are a lot near campus along with houses right next to campus. The only bad thing is the trains that come through at night especially. I'm a light sleeper so I wake up from the trains. Another thing is that the apartments aren't exactly the nicest, but they do for a college student."
College Senior,2,"aug-sept is hot, oct- nov pretty chilly Dec- march COLD FREEZING april and may are cool and warm"
College Senior,2,"Housing is okay, some places are old and gross and you pay like 150 bucks, and some places are really nice and you pay 400, its up to you.  But just a warning living off campus is very lonely. People are very busy and friends seem to be just a luxury."
College Freshman,2,"They have a ""No smoking on campus"" rule yet, I have never seen it enforced.  On a daily basis I have to pass people literally right outside my dorm and smell nothing but smoke.  My health should not be in jeopardy because of others' choices.  Not only is it right outside many dorms but there are cigarette butts left on the ground where people smoke and many times it's also outside the cafeteria.  I don't care if people smoke, but they can and should be forced to abide by the rules and not be affecting many other peoples' health.  My life and many others should not be based on the actions of those who decide to destroy theirs."
College Freshman,2,not a lot of greek activity on campus. relatively new to the campus
College Senior,2,"There aren't many unique, convenient, affordable, and student friendly off campus resturaunts. There are some fritzy expensive resturaunts in downtown and then across the bridge in downtown Fargo but besides that just average fast food joints which are low in the variety of options near campus. Not many healthy, local, organic or student targeted and friendly resturaunts."
College Junior,2,No Help from School – I had trouble getting my financial aid processed let alone any scholarships. I never received any information on scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,2,Hard to Get – It is hard to get a scholarship unless you are in sports. I currently work 40hrs a week and take a full class load and can't get any sort of help from FAFSA.  Kinda sad that hard working students get nothing while people that don't work are getting the scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,2,"You pretty much have to go to Fargo in order to get any sort of shopping, entertainment etc.  This is only a few miles away, but if you don't have a car it could be difficult."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Winter in Minnesota – The school is in Moorhead, Minnesota, so there is a lot of snow and there is a lot of wind.  The second half of fall semester, as well as the first half of the spring semester are very cold.  However, classes are rarely cancelled, and the school does a good job of shoveling the snow and of salting/ sanding the icy sidewalks."
College Sophomore,2,Buses Are Not Too Frequent. There is only one form of public transportation available in the form of buses. Buses are infrequent and come every half an hour or so. At night services do not even run so it makes it very important to for people to have cars.
College Junior,2,"Kinda boring, no one seems to want to do anything but go out to eat which is boring. And its cold so no one hangs outside"
College Sophomore,2,"It Varies – The campus security team at MSUM seems to have nothing better to do than drive around the parking lots all day and ticket cars that are parked in the wrong lot or do not have a permit. Also, they roam the hallways quite often and seem to get on students case's for noise violations a lot more often than necessary. Drinking in the dorms on campus is always heavily cracked down on. In addition, the academic honor code when it comes to writing papers and turning in projects is heavily discussed at the beginning of each course. However, the one thing that the campus does allow is visitors at any time without them having to check in with any one or be approved."
College Freshman,2,"A parking pass costs $150 and allows one to park all around campus in the given lots. With out one you must park on the streets surrounding the parking lots and can only park places on certain days. In either situation, if violated- tickets are either $20 or $40 (unless ""booted"" than about $120). The parking isn't always convenient because you can end up parking really far away."
College Junior,2,"Lot of Alcohol – There isn't a lot of alcohol on campus, but Fargo (which is two miles from Moorhead) was found to be the second drunkest city in the U.S. this past year.  With MSUM being located in a college town there are a lot of college students who do go out looking to have a good time and there are more than enough places to do so in the F/M Area.  There are also several shops in town that sell drug paraphernalia.  What is worse is that it has been on the news a lot because both Fargo and Moorhead are trying to create zoning for these shops and they don't want to be zoned so they are getting a lot of ""free advertising"" with a group of people who are under high stress."
College Freshman,2,"Artsy, Yet Businessy – The FM area is huge and widespread. Downtown is a great arts scene with tons of art studios and events like studio crawl. Fargo is very much a shopping city. If you go to fargo its to spend money more than anything. Warning COLD!!! and very windy. Horrible Traffic too takes about a half hour to get around town"
College Freshman,2,Needs Improvement – While some days the food at Kise might be good there are many countless days the food is bad. Kise has gotten a bad reputation due mostly to sodexo food service. The dining hall on campus is a great looking place but the food is pretty iffy. There are other great places though like cafe connection and the place downstairs in the CMU.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting Fin Aid Not as Easy as You Think – Both years I have attended MSUM I have received the maximum in financial aid. Both years it has turned into a long, drawn out process because the income in my family is so low that I have been ""randomly"" selected for review every year I have applied for FAFSA because the school doesn't trust the word of the student. So if you think that you'll be getting a lot in financial aid, I'd advise you to get it done IMMEDIATELY or your aid will be withheld and you'll have to deal with not getting your bill paid for on time."
College Junior,2,"MAT Bus – Students get free pass to ride 'MAT' bus, but they do not come on time and not very convenient to commute through."
College Sophomore,2,"People are not drawn here for the sports, that much is pretty obvious. Not a lot of people go to the games, and not a lot are really heard about. Its hard to root for teams that don't do well."
College Freshman,2,"its fun, pretty low key and a lot of interesting people, get a lot of flak from surrounding universities."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is very windy, and it gets really cold in the winter."
College Junior,2,"Use Common Sense – Don't ignore your homework to avoid academic probation. A lot of freshmen get minors and have to do community service for underage drinking, so just be smart about when and where you have fun."
College Freshman,2,"Tried talking to people on and off campus, just to strike up a conversation with them, and usually the person just seems indifferent/rude--Students at MSUM aren't particularly friendly. Clubs are generally affordable, but heavy drinking is prevalent on campus. Also quite a few deaths in the past due to alcohol poisoning off/on campus in the past few years and the community has cracked down on this. Alot of sloshed students on campus at weird hours of the night and day--I wouldn't feel comfortable walking home alone from the bar here.."
College Senior,2,"The Athletics Department is getting better. A few years ago the only time students went to games was during homecoming. However, a recent campus organization called ""Nemzek Noise"" has turned that around. Our football team is lacking, but most of our other sports are pretty average. A variety of sports are offered including intramurals."
College Student,1,The weather is tremendously cold in the winter and scorching in the summer. The weather also changes very often and without warning.
College Sophomore,1,I did not receive aid that I needed and scholarships are difficult to get 
College Junior,1,"Transferring here was horrible. My transcripts were lost. I had to resend them. Two people that were supposed to help me retired while I was trying to get accepted here. I had to be extremely motivated and remember to bother them to get accepted here. In hindsight, it was worth it but I didn't like that stress."
College Senior,1,"There are very few men on campus, Most of them are pigs, and if they are single and even remotely attractive they are in such high demand because of the scarcity that 30 barbies are fighting over them.  The men have it really good here..... As a female it sucks ! Go to NDSU girls !!!"
College Freshman,1,"They need to have more parking spaces, coming back from work late at night and having to park a couple blocks away from the dorms sucks."
College Freshman,1,"Quiet Hours – We have quiet hours in our dorms starting at about 10:30 pm. On my floor we have girls running and screaming at all times of the night, they need to be more strict about this."
College Junior,1,Primarily White and Two-Thirds Female – A majority of the students on campus are white and if memory serves correctly a recent survey of students showed that approximately two-thirds of the student population (a little less coming in ~63%) were female.  There really isn't a lot of diversity.
College Sophomore,1,"We have parking lots that are filled almost instantly, and then we get to park along streets that allow it, up to 10 blocks away because we have another college 5 blocks away that also has bad parking situations. It's the worst parking ever."
College Sophomore,1,"All the buildings are blahhh, nothing exciting about any of them, especially the gym"
College Sophomore,1,"Strict, but Not! The school is amazingly strict about the grading policies, in fact telling me that I was on academic suspension only later to find out that I wasn't, they also don't bother telling you until a week before class if you ARE on academic suspension even if you've appealed financial aid. As far as drinking policies go, students adamantly talk about their late night parties in front of teachers and nothing is done about it, even though the teachers know that the particular students are underage, let alone the fact that students aren't supposed to drink on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life at our school is hardly available.  We have to travel to NDSU if we want to be apart of Greek life.
College Senior,1,"Three Block Walk – I don't drive, but I see people parking three blocks away from campus. They must be upset since they have a parking sticker, but no available parking spot. 
I live three miles away. I walk because it is faster and more reliable than the bus."
College Senior,1,"Bring a Friend – This campus is not friendly! I've been here 4 years and can't get the time of day. I've had a different advisor for every semester, everybody seems to busy to be helpful."
College Sophomore,1,"drug use icannot say,one of big rasons i transfer t omoorhead was to get away from that life and have been carefull nto to get involved again.  alcohol is all over fargo moorhead and the semester i lived in dorms had no problem get alchol in at all, abait was almostly always on my own with not one else ,but still never even close to getting caught."
College Sophomore,1,"the welness center is quite impressive for the school size and one of few deparments on campus that have decent staff. other then small corners of the cmu not much for on campus studing unless you highjack a unused class room.  fodd service is a pathetic, sodex is a scourage on all food service providers."
College Sophomore,1,"Winter.. Uffda – The winter months are kind of outrageous up here, then when everything thaws out it's flood time. It's really no fun to walk to class in sub zero weather with a 40 mph wind in your face... Good thing the campus is small."
College Freshman,1,"Snoopy Instead of Helpful – Campus Security is all over the place, and seem more snoopy then actually doing anything security wise.  There are intoxicated people all the time in my hall, yet they've never been busted.  It's so obvious they're wasted (loud and obnoxious)."
College Freshman,1,"Geek Life Is Pointless – Greek like at MSUM is pointless.  There are only two sororities, and all they do is waste paper by putting stupid flyers in the dorm mailboxes like 3 times a week.  Unlike big schools, being in a sorority isn't ""popular"".  Nobody really knows about the sororities or even cares.  They don't seem to do anything special on campus, and are therefore, pointless."
College Senior,1,"Parking is TERRIBLE. They issue WAY more permits than spaces.  I end up circling the parking lots up to a half hour before class and most of the time I STILL do not find a spot in time. AND that's WITH a parking pass! If you park on the street, you'll be looking at up to 5 blocks away for a walk."
College Senior,1,"My only words of advice are to get there early and pay for the $100 parking pass. 

 It's very cheap compared to other schools, but in between 10-1 there are no parking spots to be found. I have a friend that thought he didn't need to buy a parking pass and decided to pay for the metered lots.  He ended up paying at least $300 and the semester isn't even over yet."

Alum,5,"The UC Davis undergrad experience is extraordinary! Not only is the college a leader across the country in academics and research, the community atmosphere is vital to the success of the students."
Alum,5,"The campus is absolutely stunning and extremely bike friendly, which complements the atmosphere during the spring quarter perfectly. You'll find students wandering the downtown area or slowly ambling their way to class. The arboretum was a favorite to chill between classes and on the weekends.  Professors and TAs want you to succeed and there are so many opportunities for you to do so both academically and professionally. Davis is the perfect college town and I honestly never felt unsafe during my time there."
Freshman,5,Davis is such a beautiful campus. The opportunities the school offers are amazing. I would highly recommend Davis.
Freshman,5,Davis is an amazing school. It provides an abundance of opportunities for all its students who are passionate of learning.
Niche User,5,I went for a college tour its beautiful and has very crisp energy. I will be looking forward to attending this school next year.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love UC Davis. The student community is so supportive and peaceful. I don't feel like I am competing with the other students, rather we are all working together for a common goal. The staff is very personable and easy to talk to. Also, the resources are endless; you can find help with almost anything, whenever you need it. Finally, the campus itself is unbelievably beautiful. From the ducks at the Arboretum to the eggheads scattered throughout grassy fields, you are bound to find your place somewhere at UC Davis."
Sophomore,5,"Incredibly diverse campus, great people that are especially friendly. Lovable college town and great food."
Sophomore,5,UC Davis is an amazing university and I am so lucky to be a part of this kind and diverse community.
Sophomore,5,I had an excellent online learning experience at Davis. All my professors were very accommodating and taught very well!
Sophomore,5,Honestly I think I like UC Davis. A big plus is that it carries the major that I wanted to take. A negative is that its so windy sometimes. On the flip side its nice that its really wide open and there are a lot of trees. A negative is that housing is a little expensive but that's to be expected in California. Honestly a city is its people and so far I've made some good friends here and that's whats important to me
Sophomore,5,"I think the online learning experience is pretty good for the online learning of this time period. I got good grades in all my classes and theres a lot more wiggle room to go at your own pace also this also means that there could be less motivation. There wasn't much the university and the professors could really do, so given the whole COVID situation I think they handled it the best they could. Although I would've preferred to have reduced tuition fees since everything is online."
Sophomore,5,"The culture at Davis is Amazing. Although it is known as a cow school, I personally only ran into them once on my way to tecero dorms. My experience has been the perfect UC campus experience and you can't get UCD scenery anywhere else. However, I will say getting feedback from certain services are hard to get, however i haven't had much problems."
Junior,5,"Most of my professors have been accommodating! I think I actually prefer online learning, but I do miss being on campus."
Junior,5,"Davis is amazing. The campus is lovely and everyone is so friendly. Professors are nice and so is the administration. Lots of organizations to get involved in and lots of opportunities to further your career. Plus, there are cows!"
Alum,5,Loved my time there and miss my time there. I grew to love the small town. All the resources I reached out to were immensely helpful and professors I reached out to were eager to give advice.
Alum,5,"The only online experience I had was using Canvas. It was easy to use, never had many issues. I did not take online classes."
Sophomore,5,"I really like this school overall. I think it is perfect for someone who is looking a laid back vibe setting, especially if you are a nature person. The college is in a good setting where it is close to downtown Davis, where you can find anything you might need, and closer to other big supermarkets such as Target or Walmart. People are really friendly and it perfect fits for the ""college town."" The instructors are helpful if you choose the right ones and they're easy to get to."
Sophomore,5,The online school is definitely new for everyone during this global pandemic. I think the school adjusted well to it. The workload were somewhat reduced because of student's mental health concerns. I really like my personal experience on the online side. All the resources are there for you to use and extra resources are also provided. The professors/advisors are easily to reached to and are very helpful. They are very understanding about the situation.
Sophomore,5,I love this school so much. The students are all very friendly and welcoming and the town is adorable. Everyone has a bike and you definitely need one because the campus is huge. Pick UCD!
Sophomore,5,"I took Spring Quarter remotely because of COVID-19 and although I missed the campus and town, online learning was still worth my time and money."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at UC Davis was everything I hoped it would be. There are so many resources to take advantage of such as academic assistance, mental health and wellness resources, inclusive clubs, and is overall such a welcoming campus. There will always be a place where you feel at home, and the students and staff are always more than welcome to help you. My teachers and mentors helped me adjust to transitioning to college and they are always there to give you advice."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are taken via zoom and some professors have proctored tests. Most online classes are chill and professors are still passionate about their professions even through online teaching. Just because there are online classes, it shouldn't mean that one should lack in their studies. Some classes require participation in discussions and for grades. Online classes are more lenient, though, as some professors may cancel classes at times, post their lectures for students to view at any time, and give students options for their midterm/finals."
Sophomore,5,"I am still currently attending Davis. This is my (upcoming) second year. The 2019 fall quarter as a first-year was personally rough to get used to, but it was simply because I wasn't prepared for such a drastic change. As the quarters go by, one can find themselves warming up to it and the environment. If one needs help, don't be afraid to ask peers or professors for it. There are many helpful academic departments as well that one can search up and go to. The students mind their business (usually) but be aware of weirdos and sketchy people every once in a while. Speaking of sketchy people, there are people who will unfortunately steal a bike/bike seat/bike wheel(s) if not locked properly. Also, take biking rules seriously because it gets chaotic and be aware of all surroundings. The professors are usually knowledgeable about their subjects and are helpful. The students are also very diverse in their styles, beliefs, etc so it should be easy to find clubs and meet people."
Junior,5,"UC Davis is one of the most diverse campuses I have came across and before applying and choosing the college I would attend I visited a good amount of campuses and none were quite like Davis. UC Davis has some of the friendliest people and is a beautiful campus surrounded by nature. The opportunities at Davis are endless, everyone there helps one another out. Since the moment I stepped foot on the campus I felt safe and comfortable to be my complete self."
Junior,5,I have taken about 5 courses online at the University of California Davis and while most people think it is difficult to do so I believe that they are quite simple so long as you put the time and effort into them. Although it is easier for one to get distracted with such courses I also believe it gives an individual a sense of responsibility in managing how to use their time. I believe there are more benefits to online courses than there are negatives. It is important to have a balance of online courses and in-person courses in order to ensure efficiency. I take no more than 2 online courses per quarter if needed.
Junior,5,"Though it was a hard format for me to get use too, I felt that my professors were able to engage me with the material in a new refreshing way. It was a very unique experience however, I felt that I was still able to learn in a fulfilling way."
Junior,5,UC Davis has given me So many valuable experiences. It has given me the space to explore and gather a better understanding of myself. There are so many incredible places to explore on Campus and the atmosphere is one that is incredibly soothing and comforting. There is no limits to what you can essentially do and there is always more to learn.  I love this school as it is a space that has cultivated so many memories that I will take with me for the rest of my life.
Sophomore,5,"UC Davis is a great school for a variety of things, both in academics and activities.  There are many great clubs you can choose to be a part of, and the classes provide a great mix of challenge and engagement.  The students and staff are very accepting, making it very comfortable to be yourself and who you are."
Senior,5,"Great school and the campus is beautiful. Tuition could be cheaper, especially online! The professors are very knowledgable and nice. The location is great as well and is close to an airport."
Alum,5,"Davis is a city that does not have much but because it is so separated it provides a good environment for learning. Davis has just enough entertainment in and near the city to keep students going, while giving them a good environment to attend college."
Alum,5,"I have never took any online classes specifically but there were classes with assignments online. They were very convenient because the students were not strictly forced to go by the pace of the professors. Of course, there were due dates but the there was flexibility in which students can get things done as long as it’s before that due date."
Freshman,5,Very nice campus and great faculty. The school is really good and offers great specialization programs for higher level degrees.
Junior,5,"My favorite thing about the University of California, Davis is the people and the friendly, welcoming environment! It is a wonderful atmosphere that makes you feel at home away from home. I have found my best friends at Davis!"
Alum,5,"UC Davis is a big and beautiful campus! There's a lot of cool places to hang out on campus, and the food trucks there aren't so bad!"
Alum,5,"I only took one online class during my 4 years there, but it was easy and relaxed. I attended weekly discussions in person."
Junior,5,The teachers are very accommodating and a really here to help in any way you can! Zoom is readily available to students during exams and office hours.
Sophomore,5,"Davis was a great campus with very great opportunities. It has so many study spaces indoors and outdoors, so there is always somewhere nice and convenient. The campus itself is large, but is really easy to get used to and navigate. There is also a lot of help, professors are very accessible and most classes have teaching assistants who are also extremely responsive a lot of the time. Overall Davis has a very welcoming environment with people who are always willing to help you out."
Sophomore,5,I love Davis! There is such a welcoming environment and the campus is really beautiful. Everyone on campus always seems to be happy!
Junior,5,"UC Davis provides a welcoming environment. It is accepting and provides so much help to make the transition to a four ear university smooth. There is always someone to lend help or answer questions in a timely manner. When I was looking at schools to transfer to, I decided on UC Davis because it is a larger school, but it has a homely feel. The advisors are truly there to help. They want to get you on the track and path that is right for you, and help you do all of the things you dreamed about doing. I was worried that going in as a transfer student I would not be able to study abroad, or add a double major, or minor, but the staff at UC Davis makes me feel like I can do anything and everything, all doors are open, and it creates a sense of excitement I didn't expect to have. I cannot wait to move on campus and join the Davis culture. Go Aggies!"
Freshman,5,"My online experience has definitely been interesting, but all of the professors and TAs have been eager and willing to work with the students and various online platforms to keep our education as high-end as possible. What has impressed me the most is how far they were willing to go out of their way to make lab experiences as interactive and educational as possible. Though it was difficult, they did their best, and kept communication open every step of the way so the students could say what worked, what didn't, and what might be added in the future to make the experience better for the next round."

Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of California - Davis has been great. The campus looks beautiful, the students are very nice and down to earth, and the town of Davis is very cute. This college checks off all of the boxes of what I was looking for."
Freshman,5,"In my experience, the University of California-Davis has provided a safe place for me to further my education and learn more about myself. It has many opportunities and is enriched with diversity. I love the openness of the campus and how it cares for its students. My favorite part of campus is the Student Community Center which allows for people of all different backgrounds to come together and have a safe place."
Freshman,5,"University of California Davis has a very comfortable and easygoing atmosphere. Students as well as faculty are very friendly and are eager to help socially and academically. When winter ends, the grass and trees are the greenest and the sun is out. This is one of the reasons why I love Davis because during times like those, you can sit out in the quad and study in your free time. There are many resources on campus that can provide assistance and support if one needs it and everyone is extremely helpful even the squirrels running around campus; they are great listeners."
Freshman,5,"Because of the pandemic, our spring quarter 2020 was based on a remote learning experience through the help of zoom and pre-recorded lectures. It is very different from in-person instruction so in order to stay on track you must try not to procrastinate to heavily and set priorities for course materials to be completed. I had trouble following along with my set schedule which was very unproductive, but luckily I got back on track before it was too late. Thankfully throughout remote instructions, my instructors were accommodative and understanding with how things were playing out this quarter. Because all platforms must be online, professors created online labs as well as zoom meetings to mimic in-person lectures. I was able to have a great first-year with one quarter of online classes."
Junior,5,"what i love the most about the university of California Davis is Eco friendly environment, it is known as the largest community of biker riders."
Junior,5,i have not taken any online classes however judging on the in person professor i am sure those classes will be fantastic as well.
Freshman,5,"I grew up in a very small town with a population of 2,000, so coming to Davis was right in the middle of big city and small town. There are so many specific communities within Davis, on and off campus. Whether that be religious, ethnic, or based on interest -- there is a community for EVERYONE. While most people think that everyone here is solely focused on schoolwork, they also make room for fun! When you find your little community that you connect with (which won't take long), you will be able to experience all the hidden gems in Davis! And if you need a little more city to the small town vibe, Sacramento is only 25 minutes away where you can go out dancing, to the Golden One center for a concert, or a walk about the city. The UC Davis campus is also VERY safe. The diversity is immense with all cultures and values to expand your knowledge. There are sororities, parties, and plenty of opportunities to spread your wings. I don't know what I would change?? UC Davis has become my home!!"
Alum,5,I loved my experience at UC Davis. It was a good combination of strong academics and good social opportunities for networking and building relationships. There were a lot of opportunities to get involved.
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus, diverse student demographic, access to plenty of resources. Would like to see better response time from administration to issues regarding students."
Freshman,5,"UC Davis is all about community and diversity! The diversity among the campus is probably the thing I like the most about the Aggies. A place where you can express yourself , be yourself and always be accepted and belonging in the community. One thing I would like to change is that I would like to see more Chicanex STEM professors."
Freshman,5,"As a freshen at Davis, everything is new to me, but I was able to adapt easily to my surroundings. Do remember when it comes to picking classes, choose good professors so that you can actually understand and learn, or else your grades are not going to be great."
Alum,5,This is an amazing school! So many of the opportunities available to the students here are focused on helping students succeed in all the school but in other aspects of life and career goals!
Junior,5,"UCD is a great school with one hell of opportunities that can help one to grow as an all rounder. Tier 1 research, 800+ clubs and student run clinics, Davis is all about the community and inclusion. People are supportive and won't mess you up on purpose like other top institutions. Even though classes are hard, and there's a lot of competition, Aggies are fair to one another and are there to help!"
Niche User,5,I had gone over the summer for a college visit. I absolutely loved the campus! It's huge!! The school is very concerned with the environment and how human actions are impacting the world. They are also very conscious of student mental health. Every program at the school is well taught and I am excited to be a prospective student for the fall.
Alum,5,"UC Davis is very community oriented and since it's a college town, you'll make and see your friends all the time."
Freshman,5,I have loved my experience at UC Davis so far. You'll meet very friendly people and find a beautiful campus and town. It is the perfect place if you love cute little towns. The town itself is very environment-friendly.
Niche User,5,"UC Davis is surrounded by an amazing community. Family friendly area, with shops close by the school.  The school offers so many opportunities to the students and devotes themselves to encouraging their students."
Alum,5,"UC Davis provided an exceptional balance of rigor and support. The Educational Opportunity Program allowed me to belong to a community, provide supports for others, and learn skills that I would carry with me post graduation."
Sophomore,5,great school with a huge campus. Lots of things to do and really good food. Downtown Davis is fun and great.
Niche User,4,I went here for a tour and look forward to attend this school next year! the ambiance is very happy and uplifting.
Sophomore,4,My professors did their best to adapt to online learning and provided a lot more flexibility for students in different time zones.
Freshman,4,I am a new student however things seem to be taken care of and learning will be organized through zooms and canvas.
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman during COVID-19, I feel that the university is trying their best to still give students the new sensation of entering college and becoming a part of a new community. Go Aggies!"
Sophomore,4,"All my classes were online for winter 2020, I found that all my teachers made adjustments to accommodate students such as making it so we had all day to start a test  or making pre-recorded lectures"
Sophomore,4,Great environment to study especially for those who are pursuing for veterinary medicine. A lot of opportunities for hands-on experiences with different kinds of animals.
Freshman,4,My professors are great and have been really good at communicating with us students about the homework and all of that while also understanding the tough situations that we are going through.
Freshman,4,The administration care a lot about the students and the advisors are always ready to help if I have any questions. The campus is also very nice and easy to walk or bike around. The people are also very friendly and helpful and I definitely feel safe being on campus which is really important to me.
Junior,4,"Overall very good opportunities, caring professors and advisors, and beautiful campus. The classes are challenging but very good quality in terms of the education you receive."
Junior,4,"Some professors make the classes very engaging, while others fall very short. Overall, the university has been accommodating amidst the pandemic."
Alum,4,I went to UC Davis for my undergraduate degree. I enjoyed my time there. There were many different activities that students could participate and be involved in. There were a lot of on-campus job opportunities and easy to find internships.
Alum,4,The online courses at Davis were really good. The professors were well prepared and created easy to follow modules.
Niche User,4,"UC Davis is a diverse university and one of the best schools in the state of California. I visited Davis one time and it has some really cool classes, a good mascot and a beautiful landscape."
Sophomore,4,"My Spring Quarter at UC Davis was online, and although it was difficult having to completely transition to online courses, the teachers completely understood that students would have trouble adjusting. The teachers made sure to provide office hours through Zoom and were always available to answer emails. Personally, online assignments were easy to access and lectures were still helpful."
Junior,4,"It has been good, professors have been quite flexible with assignments given our current situation with the pandemic."
Junior,4,"It is good, except there is always construction going on which calls for less quiet space to study. Students now go outside of campus to study because campus is way too noisy to study in."
Alum,4,"Davis is a nice, college town. The downtown area is conveniently located right next to campus. I wish there was a greater variety in the restaurants. They keep opening more boba shops but only have a few different kinds of eateries. Area is usually pretty safe, decent night life."
Junior,4,"Considering that online courses were abrupt, most professors managed to adapt smoothly and continued their courses with understanding for their students. I have had a productive experience in my online courses and had encounters with professors that are willing to go the extra mile for their students."
Junior,4,"In my experience, the education that I am receiving at UC Davis is delivered by instructors who care and are willing to provide help when needed. Students often get involved in the community and there are many opportunities to find a group you feel comfortable with. The university has also been taking extra steps to advocate for diversity and inclusion. I have had great professors and learned a lot to prepare myself for my future career."
Sophomore,4,"I took my 2020 Spring quarter online due to the coronavirus so I gained a lot of experience with the University's adaptation to online learning.  The school overall did a great job of working out all the details and mechanics for online learning in a relatively short time span.  I thought taking classes online would be difficult, but once I settled in they felt just like normal."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience with UC Davis has been great, however, lectures are longer than they should be for some classes which is unfair."
Alum,4,"I will always cherish my time at UC Davis. I met lifelong friends, learned invaluable lessons from the classes I took, and gained incredible experience from the extracurricular activities I was involved with. Greek Life at UC Davis gave me great opportunity to develop my leadership skills. Sports games were fun to engage in with friends on the weekends. The local area is very unique and cute. The campus is absolutely beautiful to walk or bike around at. Everyone is always up to something interesting."
Alum,4,"I only took a few online classes at UC Davis, but they were great experiences. I took online classes in conjunction with in-person classes, so the only difficult part about that combination is I found it easier to forget about deadlines in my online classes. Students often get so many emails that they already know the information to, so I found myself deleting emails from Canvas without reading them- do NOT do this when you get an email related to your online class, however, as it could have information that you never knew about! My online class experience was boosted by the opportunity to have in-person office hours and extra credit."
Freshman,4,Some classes were online due to the Covid 19 outbreak but otherwise was great. Classes were given in a way such that they were similar to in person.
Freshman,4,"The school gives me a friendly and inclusive vibe. I'm a badminton player and I'm really happy to see that Davis has a badminton club and team, despite the fact that the sport isn't very relevant in the states."
Junior,4,I've taken a lot of classes online (given the current pandemic) and I can attest that many professors have been very understanding and accommodating in these uncertain times. It really makes you appreciate their humanity.
Senior,4,"I love UCD, especially the campus and city of Davis itself. However, I wish the professors cared more about their students. Many of the professors only care about their research and don't pay any attention to actually teaching their students."
Junior,4,"The feel of the school is like no other, being on campus is calming and allows you to really focus on your studies. There is also a lot of resources on campus and in multiple places so that way you are able to get help wherever you are. As one of the biggest campuses of the UC system, there is a lot of nature places and  places to study. Being by downtown also allows for a nice walk to get boba and places!"
Freshman,4,"I really like the diversity of this school! Plus, everyone is so friendly. There are so many resources on campus as well!"
Freshman,4,"My professors tended to be very accomodating, though I know not all of them were. As a university, it seems that we all were trying to understand and work through the difficulties together."
Sophomore,4,"I had to do online courses due to the pandemic, but prior to this I took a hybrid class which was mainly online and they ended up working similarly. Personally, it was a little difficult to manage classes but my professors and TAs really helped to make it easy to navigate and less stressful. They were pretty understanding and fit made accommodations for students."
Sophomore,4,I did take classes online and I found it to be very difficult. My professors were very good but it was difficult for them to present the material at the same level as if the classes were in person.
Freshman,4,"For spring quarter, all students transitioned to online learning. While challenging, for both the students and professors, it was manageable. Although I believe in-person classes are more beneficial, the online learning environment was a unique one."
Freshman,4,Professors and advisors were easy to connect with online. Davis seemed well equipped for the switch into distance learning.
Freshman,4,UC Davis is a great school with an amazing atmosphere. It has a small college town and a diverse population. The admissions process can be grueling but its worth it in the end. :)
Junior,4,"I love how many resources they provide to help students succeed and the diversity of classes, majors, and minors available. I also really enjoy the friendly atmosphere of campus. There is so much to do and see both on campus and in town. A few of my favorites are the arboretum, egg heads, clubs, silo/memorial union, restaurants, and farmer's market. However, some aspects that I wish would change are tuition cost and dorm costs, availability of classes, more helpful counselors/advisors, and campus safety (biking rules are not well established, it takes safe ride vehicles awhile to respond, buses are not dependable at night). Lastly, high housing costs are another problem."
Junior,4,"For fall quarter, due to the coronavirus situation, I took three classes online. One was already an online class, while the other two, which were a design class and biology, were not. We had lots of difficulties with testing. Our proctoring site was not working and many students were not able to see images on the exam on Canvas. Design was difficult to take online since the class could not fully engage with each other and we could not critique each others work. I often got headaches from staring at the computer every day. A previous quarter, I took NUT10 (nutrition) as an online course and it was excellent! It was structured and organized really well and there were no issues. I took a hybrid class (half online half in person) my freshman year and it also was great."
Freshman,4,"UCD is an amazing campus with a very vibrant and positive student life. The students there are so helpful and the professors positively encorugaes the students, which I think is very important in a college campus."
Freshman,4,"The location of the campus to downtown is very nice. The teaching is mixed, but generally provides great learning, and there are free tutoring services to assist with general subjects. The campus is pretty and fairly easy to get around on foot; there are many clubs to get involved with."
Sophomore,4,"UC Davis has a really nice, clean campus with ample resources for its students. It is a very large campus with many many bikers, so that is something to get used to along with large class sizes. It runs on the quarter system which is quite different for those who are used to semesters. I really enjoy the program I'm in and I feel very strongly that the faculty at UC Davis are great teachers."
Freshman,4,"I love Davis and I find myself missing it every day. Classes really aren’t as tough as I expected them to be (granted I’m just doing mostly GEs now), but still a challenge and I’ve had some great professors. No matter what people tell you, the social scene is not dead!! Even without being in Greek life, you’re bound to find something to do if you just talk to people. Praying for a fall quarter and the chance to experience a real spring quarter next year."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken all of my classes online. The result given the suddenness of the situation was excellent. Lectures can be glitchy and OH can be less than desirable (technology-wise). Otherwise, having a great time."
Sophomore,4,I'm having a great time with UC Davis. The clubs that I am invovled in are great and preparing me for great things ahead. I will say that there aren't that many opportunities for research but I'm assuming that this is a problem with most universities.
Freshman,4,"With the current situation, professors have had the opportunity to put their remote skills into practice. Professors at UC Davis are for the most part good at using remote learning platforms. Some professors need a little more practice than others but they always make up for their lack of knowledge on the tech world."
Junior,4,"UC Davis has an amazing culture, wonderfully large campus with things to discover everyday!  There is SO many things you can do here, so many organizations you can be a part of ! 

What I would like to see more of would be parking spaces, and less large scale classrooms so most students can get the help they deserve and are paying for. Sometimes in these large classrooms its hard to get to know the professor and if you are trying to go to graduate School, it is even harder.  Nevertheless, its not impossible and very doable. Most professors are very kind."
Alum,4,"I liked how diverse Davis was. Even though there isn’t much around Davis, there are a lot of good food options and a lot of places nearby that offer things to do such as Sacramento and Vacaville. The dorms are really nice, especially the ones in tercero, which are on the newer side."
Alum,4,"I appreciated that the atmosphere at UC Davis was extremely inclusive and fostered community. Yes, the classes were rigorous, but my classmates and I worked together to do well instead of stepping over each other on the way to the top. I also loved that the campus was eco-friendly and a bike town. It helped me to decrease my carbon footprint and be more conscious about how the earth is affected by what I do. Although it wasn't perfect, UC Davis was a great blessing in my life!"
Freshman,4,"The place is simply beautiful. The wide area of the campus gives it many opportunities to improve itself, making it a perfect place to bike in! If biking isn't your fancy, the campus also provide transportation services to help you get around campus!"
Sophomore,4,"I loved studying here because of the ambiance and culture. Everyone really valued studying and of course, destressing in the best ways. You don't necessarily have to party every weekend to have fun but even taking a bike ride to get some air, visiting the cows, or strolling in the arboretum."
Freshman,4,UC Davis is a wonderful school. The students and faculty are very welcoming and accepting. I've met many people who are willing to help me constantly through classes. The campus is also beautiful with lots of trees and squirrels.
Alum,4,"If you are looking to attend a university with a nurturing and encouraging environment, UC Davis is the place for you! Undergraduate students have so many research and extra-curricular opportunities; you truly feel that the school values its undergraduate students and wants them to excel. For the most part, all of the professors you will get are extremely capable and passionate teachers as well."
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at UC Davis. There is always a lot happening on campus, and overall my classes have been fine. As a STEM major, I found the lower division classes to be very difficult, and very much weeder classes. My upper division classes have been much more enjoyable and I have done better in them as well."
Senior,4,"When I first placed a step into UC Davis I was very impressed with the campus. The dorms, student life, and culture at that campus. It is a very eco-friendly campus and I really enjoy visiting this place because I picture myself in it in a few months. There is diversity on this campus which is great because I have been in a school where there is no diversity and this school gives people like me to get exposed to other cultures and that is great. The students on campus seem very responsible and that inspires me to apply here and be part of this wonderful university."
Freshman,4,"I love Uc Davis. A small college town with many nice people from all over and super cute cows! Many resources, clubs, and wide variety of interesting classes. A beautiful and clean campus overall!"
Junior,4,"My experience at University of California Davis has been good, I will like to see more individuals of color. Specifically latinos and African Americans."
Alum,4,"A warm and welcoming campus, UC Davis provides an excellent education across disciplines while also guiding students toward rewarding careers."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the student life while I was at Davis. Everyone was very welcoming. One thing that I did not like is that many professors had tenure so even if they weren't good teacher there wasn't much that you could do about it.
Alum,4,"My experience with UC Davis was overall very good! A lot of classes will be difficult but no class is impossible to do well in as long as I did all the assignments and went to office hours. Although there may be times when it feels like there is nothing to do, I was able to keep myself busy with the amazing  dance groups on campus, easy-to-find health related internships, and student-run clinics! There are many opportunities to succeed, all you have to do is find it."
Alum,4,"I liked the knowledge, care, and passion of the professors for my major: Animal Science. What I did not like about my experience was feeling isolated from the rest of the university/ other students."
Freshman,4,"UC Davis provides a healthy cultural environment that helps build individuals. UC Davis offers many student resources. However, some aspects of UC Davis, such as the WiFi quality can be frustrating. Especially when it stops while I am in a middle of a online quiz."
Sophomore,2,"It honestly feels like I am not going to UNI, paying full tuition for online classes and not really paying attention to the content. the professors are doing the best they can, but some don't operate the online services because they don't know how or they are too old to know how..."
Alum,2,"This is a ""you're on your own kiddo"" kind of school. Huge classroom sizes, not very diverse, and very little guidance for freshman and transfers. This is not a school I would recommend for first generation students who would like to make the most out of their college experience. There is a get in and get out type of dynamic amongst the faculty especially towards underrepresented/underserved communities."
Sophomore,2,"Generally, professors use technology in an organized and helpful manner, adding effective grading and communication to regular in person  instruction. During Spring 2020 (Covid-19) all classes became remote. My experience with these recent remote/online courses has been really difficult. The course materials have been extremely disorganized, communications (deadlines, announcements, and instructions) unclear or inaccessible, and grading remains quite harsh, un-tailored to the circumstances. I acknowledge that some professors have done very well, but the courses that have been difficult in online formats have been really terrible."
Alum,2,The administration was not helpful and they did not care about the students. The professors were amazing but could do little about the ridiculous rules put on by the administration. Amazing Professors who really care but awful administration.
Senior,2,"Now in my last year of Davis, I can say that the students in this college were terrific, but the professors and advisors left me with a very bad experience. It's sad to say, but Davis makes you feel like college is a business. They over-enroll, don't give students enough seats in classes, have a very crowded campus and with the overload of students, making appointments with advisors is almost impossible. At the end of the day, the faculty don't  really care about you. I was in a very difficult situation with a particular professor here in Davis, and the faculty completely sided with the professor and did not care about my concerns of discrimination."
Junior,2,"As a Design and Fine Art major, I felt UC Davis to be especially lacking in resources, materials, experienced professors, and enthusiasm that would create an ideal, stimulating environment for creatives. In my first year, I was a Biology major and the classes were easy to ride the curve to at least a C and professors were not passionate about what they were teaching. The campus is lovely, safe and beautiful for student life."
Junior,2,"I like the campus and the freedom it offers . However I would like to see people more involved with the school , no one has spirit and no one cares about others. Davis is not friendly at all and people go on opanoit their today without caring much about others around them. It is not community based at all."
College Sophomore,2,For my major which is biomedical engineering there are not many opportunities and internships available besides genentech which is very competitive. I have also not found many research opportunities in this field on campus.
College Junior,2,"Sports are not really big here at all. Even when certain teams are doing well, people generally don't talk about them much, and if they do, it's because they won a game or title and are hosting a party later that night."
College Freshman,2,Athletics are fun for the athletes. Students not very supportive except for basketball.
College Freshman,2,UC Davis is not a school I would bring up to brag about in the athletics department.
College Freshman,2,"This school is way too expensive for what I consider it's worth. Almost everyday, I wish I went to a junior college near home."
College Freshman,2,Sports teams at Davis are rarely supported which is disappointing because that is an important part of college life.
College Junior,2,"Professors don't care, very boring place to go to college, curriculum is insanely difficult"
College Senior,2,I have hardly received any financial aid and it's honestly been a struggle the whole way through.
College Senior,2,More food options and places should be available.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know. I'm not in the Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,"I am not a big fane of the greek life and don't find them interesting. They usually are circled around themselves and 'brag' about the parties, which are not even good as well as interesting..."
College Freshman,2,"Although my family is in need and I applied for scholarship, I received a fair amount and can definitely say I needed more. Although I am a California-resident the school gave me out-state tuition and informed me after 5 months! It is bad and am afraid it will cost me to drop college..."
College Freshman,2,"I can't say I am a party-person but from what I've heard, most of the parties tend to get rather boring after a while. Coming from a different country and having had a 'legal' party scene there, I do not enjoy the party scene here and find it unsatisfactory."
College Freshman,2,Internships and research opportunities are hard to get because a lot of people want them.
College Freshman,2,"Most people do not look favorably upon Greek students. Very snobby and fake. Each chapter has a house, but most are small. Frat houses are completely run down. Open parties at frats are usually well-attended."
College Freshman,2,"School spirit is eh. Football games are not that exciting, and the only time people show up to sports are when ESPN comes. Teams are OK as well. Occasionally we will have a winning team, but not a regular occurrence. Club sports I would say are less supported by the university than IM's. Hickey pool is a mess. ARC is nice, as well as the baseball field and Schaal Pool."
College Freshman,2,"All the open parties are packed( and not in a good way), and really are not fun. Kickbacks or closed parties are usually more fun, but you have to have an in."
College Freshman,2,It seems like a lot at first but their menus repeat itself and get repetitive.
College Sophomore,2,People that work for financial aid are rude and unhelpful. I had a bad experience.
College Junior,2,I am not quite sure what jobs my major allows me to find.  It appears that it would involve research or working in labs.
College Freshman,2,All the teams at Davis are pretty bad. I'm sure there are a few teams that are decent or even good but no one really pays attention to them unless they're the athletes on the team or the athlete's friends.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I did not like living on campus. My dorm mates were okay, but I did not totally connect with everyone to say the least. Regan hall in the Segundo area is really not nice. Run down, old buildings with cruddy amenities. You look at the new high rise buildings and you think, ""Wow those people are lucky!"" It is all down to the lottery system. Considering that you pay a ton of money to live in the campus housing for 10 months, you may as well skip the dorms and go straight to apartment living. There are tons of decent apartments available for cheap. Dorm life wasn't all it was cracked up to be for a studious individual like myself."
College Sophomore,2,I don't like Greek life and I wish it was less prominent on campus. The parties are known for being really gross and they usually don't have enough alcohol for non-Greek. I've never actually been to a frat party
College Sophomore,2,It's a public school so they don't offer you that much. Expect applying for student loans.
College Junior,2,"I didn't receive the financial aid I needed, thus, my family is in a difficult financial situation. I suppose that my frustrating experience at a public university pales in comparison to what most private universities fail to offer."
College Freshman,2,I needed some financial aid but they said that I didn't qualify.
College Senior,2,Davis should offer more scholarships and should advertise their scholarships because no one knows about them until after the deadline.
College Senior,2,Prices are very high everywhere and its not worth living far from campus just to get a few dollars off the rent.
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of attractions and activities to do. You can only shop at gap or forever 21. There's no mall.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is mainly only drinking places, and not much else. If I was into drinking a lot I would like it"
College Sophomore,2,It took the University 3 months to review my financial aid when my dad decided to retire.
College Junior,2,"the majority are caucasians and asian americans. they mostly are very individual and not so friendly towards international students compared to my previous community college. since i am enrolled in a very competitive major, that might be a contribution on why the people in my classes are competitive and not friendly."
College Junior,2,"there are not that many restaurants which are good enough for the price. better off to dine at nearby cities like sacramento. the good thing is that Davis is not that far off SF, which of course has excellent dining options"
College Junior,2,"the classes are too big, and often times we have to rely on the TAs to answer questions since the professors are mainly researchers, therefore most of them do not explain things clearly although they know their materials. the program is very competitive, the major classes often have many students from similar majors. graduate students are also in the class, combined with the undergraduate. the classes are often packed, the tables too jammed and crowded. not the best learning experience."
College Sophomore,2,"They are terrible dealing with FAFSA, you really have to hound them."
College Junior,2,The price is so high outside the compus.
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman i dont have a car, it is not necessary at this point and most people ride their bikes everywhere which is more reasonable and convenient. Classes are close enough to bike, a car would only be necessary if you wanted to go somewhere far for the weekend. Shopping for food and other things is also within walking or biking distance. Anyway, parking is too expensive and there are limited inconvenient spots not close to where the students live. Cars are not allowed on campus either way so there is not point."
College Sophomore,2,New soccer coach is horrible
College Sophomore,2,Super duper cold in winter and hot as hell in summer.
College Freshman,2,I hate when it rains because we have to bike in the rain. I also dislike when it is windy. The sun is fine but rarely comes out.
College Freshman,2,nothing to do here except playing with the cow patties near tercero
College Freshman,2,Computer labs typically have plenty of free computers but the wireless connection in the North Segundo dorms is TERRIBLE.
College Freshman,2,"Biking in the rain is horrible! especially when you do not have fenders, and your bike gets all wet because there is nowhere else to park your bike except outdoors."
College Junior,2,Its very difficult to receive financial aid at UC Davis. I come from a low income family and its so hard to receive aid.
College Junior,2,No one really attends the varsity sports at UC Davis.
College Freshman,2,"All the alcohol is in plastic and can beer. And there are LITERALLY no drugs besides pot. Honestly this was a letdown because I like to have a little fun and like to have an actual brand on my vodka. To be honest, come to college with a fake ID and connections if you want harder drugs."
College Freshman,2,It is very limited for out of state students to recieve aid. Need based aid is for VERY low income families. The application process is extremely lengthy and has many loopholes and requirements.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone drinks, everyone smokes pot. It's not so much the school's fault as much as the students are just really careful about hiding it. It's also very easy to store these things in the dorms because there are no checks"
College Freshman,2,"Okay the computers in all the computer labs (save for the ones used by film students) are really awful and slow. Don't even get me started on the constantly-crashing wifi network. Printing is decent, as we get 100 sheets per quarter and it's convenient to print something, but, seriously, old computers are no good for anything else."
College Freshman,2,My school is pretty much located in the middle of nowhere. Bikes are the ideal mode of transportation; hardly anyone uses a car anyway.
College Junior,2,"The weather change is extreme. In fall, it can be very hot in the afternoon yet very windy in the morning at night. In winter they are not as extreme but the wind is terrible."
College Freshman,2,"Wind makes biking difficult, and it's very unpleasant when raining or too cold. "
College Sophomore,2,"The parking permits are ridiculously expensive. A friend who attends another school must only pay $45 for the entire year. Meanwhile, we pay $136....for a single quarter. "
Junior,1,"I have only just enrolled into the college as of a couple weeks ago and will start my first semester in the Fall, the only reason I am here is for the scholarship I was told I can receive according to scholarship searching websites."
Alum,1,"Terrible school, lazy teachers, inadequate security, rotten school police. The pepper spraying of students in 2011 will never be forgotten and attempts to  cover it up with 200k will not be enough."
Senior,1,"This place has given me nightmares. All I've ever wanted to do was follow my dreams. This place puts up so many road blocks in administration that it makes it impossible to seek help. The administration has no idea what they are doing most of the time and could care less about helping a student out. All they want to do is sit behind their decks and get a pay check.  The college of engineering counslors make me sick especially the electrical and computer engineering because of the fact they only have one...yes that's right ONE counselor for all of those declared majors.  This school is the red headed stepchild of the UC system.  Out of date, resistant to change, and money sharks is how I would describe this school. Pick any other UC campus!!"
Freshman,1,"They lost my FAFSA paperwork 5 times. Then, they refused to give me any of my FAFSA due to ""being too late"" even though they admitted it was on them. Then, they told me to apply to work studies. However, every work study I applied to never contacted me back. The on-campus housing had 3 people per room in the smallest of rooms. Many of the dining commons did not have enough food for the amount of students they had. The dining commons had parts that were closed even though they were suppose to be open. I would also like to bring up that the students run all the help sources for students. And, they are not trained to run them. You just go in circles trying to find anyone who knows anything. And, they come in an hour late, take a 2 hour lunch, and work for maybe an hour more before leaving. This means the only time a student can access these services is when they are suppose to be in class. And don't ever try to get ahold of a counselor, it will never happen."
College Freshman,1,You lose your identity starting as a freshman in the dorms. It's rather hard to make genuine connections with your peers because you are only in class for 10 weeks at a time. There isn't much to do in Davis. The international student population is generally rude in groups toward U.S. residents.
College Junior,1,Professors are terrible and classes are too large
College Sophomore,1,They only enforce policies on certain minority groups.
College Sophomore,1,"All the food, is ancient places. I think we need to generate new foods places where there is a lot of variety."
College Student,1,"My parents make to much money when they put info in the Fafsa. But since hey are not paying for my college I recieved no financial aid and I have to pay back 33,000 in tuition on my own."
College Senior,1,"Administration itself is a huge problem. 

Many of them do not communicate with students nor do they care for the betterment of the education."
College Senior,1,"It is too bureaucratic. Too many jumps and hoops, and paper works, and offices without any coherent communications in between."
College Senior,1,"Too expensive.

It is another way that the UCD is becoming the coporation."
College Freshman,1,"There are some really outspoken people on campus that LOVE protesting. Sometimes they have good points, most of the time I just want them to go away. Religion is not really supported, local church of my faith is a good 10-min bike ride away."
College Freshman,1,Professors are the worst. Have had maybe two I liked so far. Registration is a joke if you are not an upperclassman. Workload is outrageous.
College Freshman,1,"Absolutely would not choose to go here again. I did not even want to go here in the first place. Hate it so much. Classes are way too hard, professors are awful, classes are too large, no one cares about you, and the food sucks."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, professors do not care. Class sizes are way too big. Tests are extremely difficult and often aren't based on what your professor told you they would be on. For such a large school, there are far too few ""fun"" classes."
College Freshman,1,"I am a pre-med student, and ever since I have arrived on campus it seems that everyone has been trying to drive me away from that."
College Freshman,1,Food is nauseating. I mean it is convenient but as for taste it is almost worth it to make all your own food.
College Junior,1,"the classes are too big, most classes are offered only quarterly, not many options for professors, the grading system is really bad (converting A-D to 4.0 scale), and the major advisor is not helpful at all. students mostly have to figure out themselves on their classes (what to take, etc). 

too expensive and the faculty to student ratio is too small."
College Freshman,1,"I don't think that UC Davis is any worse than other public schools at allocating financial aid, but it's still extremely frustrating to continually seek financial aid and never receive any despite having equal or higher test scores than other kids that receive financial aid (my family is middle class so I receive no financial aid)."
College Freshman,1,"After I was accepted into the university, I was given a $10,000 grant and a couples loans that would overall take off half my tuition every quarter. Then I updated my FAFSA, and all of my financial aid was taken away, even though I still really really needed that money. It was devastating. Now, I am going to school with no financial aid and don't exactly know if I will be able to pay for next quarter. That has been legitimately the most stressful thing since I have been in college."
College Freshman,1,"It's rough...it's a consuming process and requires a lot of time. You're also competing against many other students, and it is difficult to actually win the money."
College Freshman,1,"Most campuses have free things for students, but almost everything here cost out of pocket, I'm not sure where my tuition is going. "
College Freshman,1,"The internet is very difficult to connect to, and even once connected it is slow and unreliable. "
College Freshman,1,"If you love partying and the nightlife,don't apply to Davis. We have some parties but it's nothing compare to UCSB."
College Sophomore,1,"Sports are not big at Davis. Going to football games or really any games on a regular basis is not common. There is not that much school spirit when it comes to sports. But we do have amazing facilities. The teams are D1, but a very low average D1 team."
College Senior,1,"While there are several programs here to support the diversity in Davis, the vast majority of students are Asian or White, and the school ends up having the same reputation as other UC schools as far as diversity is concerned."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I gave it that grade because there isn't a variety of orgs. All of the active Greek orgs. tend to be white orgs. Frat row is a bunch of white frats that drink a bunch of beer. I like diversity, and the visibility of orgs is not diverse at all."
College Sophomore,1,The school is VERY strict about underage drinking and drugs in the dorms. The main goal is safety and the faculty will do everything to uphold this and the reputation of the school. Don't do anything risky and above all do not get caught because there will be repercussions.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus during the weekday is terrible. Freshmen are not allowed to have cars and all the spots on campus require to be paid. Daily parking costs $8 whereas quarterly parking costs around $250. Also, it is very difficult to park during the day, but becomes easier as night comes. There is free parking on the weekdays, however, and that makes up for the + in the grade."
Recent Alumnus,1,Had a 4.0 while applying for scholarships for my senior year and still didn't get any. There are few scholarships to be had.
College Junior,1,"The racial diversity is appalling.  It is very unfortunate that the UC does not make a conspicuous effort to educate its Black and Latino/Chicano populations.  A few years ago the old LGBT Resource Center was disgustingly vandalized and there have been noose's hung on campus.  Despite this, administrators' responses have been negligible at best.  On top of that, ethnic and gender studies departments are among the most marginalized and underfunded on campus."
College Junior,1,"The food in the dorms gave me food poising, watch how they cook for you.."
College Freshman,1,the distance to school is too far. and the enivornment is bad
College Freshman,1,the computers in our school are ok to use. but we dont have access
College Freshman,1,"Parking is horrible, expensive, and difficult to find. They are very strict to and you will get a ticket."
College Junior,1,"Tiny dorms, for way too much money. If you get stuck in an old one also, there is lead in the faucets and you have to sign a waiver before you move in saying that if you get any lead related issues its not their fault. There amenities are pretty much ac and heat. You have to pay for laundry, and in some of the dorms you also have to pay for gas and electric. The cost is through the roof, off campus housing is anywhere from 750-2k and on campus is anywhere from 1k-1.5k. rooms are small and even suites are small. Its easier to room or house share in town or in a nearby town like woodland. Only thing is if you drive to school you have to pay a quarterly parking pass at 185$."
College Junior,1,Parking permits are very over priced. There are many parking lots but are only allowed to park certain places. It is easiest getting around the school and Davis on foot or bike. There is often much traffic with cars in Davis.
College Freshman,1,"Drugs are rarely ever a big deal. I haven't seen or heard of drug use so far in the dorms, but I don't know about off campus use. Alcohol is a lot more frequent."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The process for getting into my program proved to be fairly difficult. I had started my college experiences at a community college and completed IGETC, but UCD admissions was still not accepting my completetion of their specified requirements and my GPA was up to their standards. I had to make multiple phone calls and spent hours on the phone asking what I needed to do to get accepted into the college."

Senior,5,"With COVID and general online classes, Bellin does a very good job of providing help with classes. The professors teaching the classes all have office hours on campus and are very good at answering questions through email."
Sophomore,5,I like all the hands-on learning that is offered with all my schooling because I learn best when I can be hands-on. So far I would not change anything besides maybe be closer to my home town.
Freshman,5,Im a freshman at this college right now and absolutely love it. The staff and students are both so understanding about the extremely demanding course work .
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming community, and it is small so it when in need of help from teachers it is very easy to do so."
Junior,5,Bellin College has the best reputation in the area for nursing for good reason. Friendly staff and an excellent curriculum sets this college above the rest.
Sophomore,5,"Bellin College has honestly been a complete miracle in my life. This is the first year of their Diagnostic Medical Sonography program and still my program is more organized than previous colleges I have attended. Plus, this sonography program offers way more than any other program I have seen: direct admission into the program, bachelor degree in three years, ergonomics personal training, and four board exams. Also, everyone at Bellin is friendly, sincere, and helpful. All my teachers are readily available to me, and due to the small class sizes, I feel that I get the one on one attention that I need."
College Junior,5,Bellin college makes sure that you will be successful. They set you up for success through portfolios and volunteering and campus groups
College Junior,5,As I said before small school=lots of one on one if you need extra help. All the students are really close.
College Junior,5,There is always a security guard and you have to badge in doors
College Junior,5,"Because Bellin is a private school, every one is tight knit and helps one another. We have advanced skills labs and and professors that are more than willing to help out and put in extra time."
College Freshman,5,The safety on campus is prime and there are security guards that are here in case if you need help.
College Freshman,5,The classes are very informative and the professors are very helpful and friendly.
College Freshman,5,"There are plenty of job prospects with nursing and radiology, especially if you work at the hospital before graduating."
College Sophomore,5,Everything about this school is amazing
College Sophomore,5,They help all students find a career after school
College Sophomore,5,Feel very safe and comfortable
College Junior,5,So far my experience with Bellin College has been extremely positive and I look forward to earning my BNS with them.
College Senior,5,"Although I have just started here at Bellin College, I have found my experience to be amazing. I have been able to take what I've known in the past and use it in my current classes.  The professors are very knowledgeable and make sure that every student can understand what is going on in class."
College Freshman,5,"Strong programs and professors, and so many other resources outside the classroom to help students learn and build their skills.  Major is nursing and going on to the nurse practitioner program. Academics is very fast paced enough to keep the student challenge but in a good way."
College Freshman,5,"Professors all do a great job giving the student as much as they need, many outside resources offered for free to the student for extra help, smaller class sizes so learning is more efficient and strong bonds can be formed between students and professors."
Senior,4,"Bellin College is a fantastic experience in a small school environment. If you are interested in a healthcare field such as Nursing or Radiologic Technology, Bellin College should absolutely be on your list. I love the small class sizes and the close working environment with your instructors."
Graduate Student,4,Bellin College has been a very professional school to attend compared to the state and technical colleges I have attended in the past. I was very surprised at how they intertwine their values into the curriculum with students.
Sophomore,4,"Great school. Extremely high standards but everyone knows it, including employers, so it pays off. Graduating with a Bellin College diploma works wonders for students planning on working in the area. Very much a commuter school."
College Freshman,4,So far my time here at Bellin college has been excellent. The professors are very caring and the work is challenging. I love that the Nursing professors tell us stories about their times in the health field. Recently we have gotten a new simulation device that helps provide different situations that might come up during a nursing career. If I had to pick a school to go to this would be the place to go.
College Sophomore,4,They want you to succeed and they will help you if you are willing to be helped and do what you need to do
College Sophomore,4,"Green bay is a safe place to live, and the cost of living is on the lower end of the scale. The process to obtain housing here is somewhat of a struggle, but once you are through all the paper work... The places here are nice and homie."
College Sophomore,4,"You might have to do some searching because a lot of the places that are good, do not appear as thought they would be good from the outside. But a lot of family owned business in the Green Bay area, and once you find that homemade cooking... It's hard to stay away. Cost is always reasonable in Northeast Wisconsin."
College Sophomore,4,It's free and there is always a spot. Can it get much better?
College Sophomore,4,"We have a small café located in our atrium. For the most part, the food is good. Salad bar, deli sandwiches (homemade chicken and egg salad), a special of the day, soup of the day, smoothies upon request, etc. The area also has many local restaurants. They have a deal on coffee's where you buy so many and get the next one free, and as a medical student... This is clutch"
College Junior,4,"Large lot, easy to find spots"
College Junior,4,"It's a small school, but great for the hands on experience and one on one help to make you a better student."
College Freshman,4,I chosen Bellin College for my master's in Nursing and have yet to start their program.  I did my undergraduate here and know it will set me up well for jobs and experience in the future.  I am excited about the task ahead and invite others to join with me in this quality education for Nurses.
College Sophomore,4,"Bellin is very grade oriented and they really look at what classes you took and your ACT scores. If you don't have a high enough ACT score, you don't get in. If you've maintained a B average and took somewhat challenging classes in high school, you should have no problem being accepted. You also have to have done one or more job shadows."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though there really aren't any internship opportunities for the radiology field, we have clinicals that are very similar. The number of credits and hours of clinical depend on what year and semester you are in. The great thing about Bellin College is that once you are accepted into the school for the program, you are automatically accepted in the clinical experience as well. Many schools require you to complete a certain number of credits before you can even apply for clinical (usually in the junior year) while we start right away our first semester of sophomore year."
College Junior,4,Everyone is very nice and works with each other to help one another.
College Sophomore,4,"Drug Free Zone – Students must take drug tests anually in order to stay enrolled at Bellin College.  Therefore, while some students may drink or smoke, there are few drugs.  Also, the campus itself is a smoke-free environment so any drinking or smoking is done off-campus."
College Junior,4,"I will have a major in nursing and become an RN when I graduate. The college does a great job with the teachers because they are all very specialized within their fields and know a lot about the topics that they teach. The workload is not easy, but that can be said for any college class.  It is not an over load of work but the teachers do a very good job at telling you what to study and teaching you what you need to know about the topics. There are some job opportunities at the school but you can get more experience working at a nursing home or at a hospital, which in Green Bay there are a lot of options."
College Junior,4,The college is very specialized and at the bachelor's level only offers a bachelor's degree in radiology and a bachelor's degree of nursing. This means that the teachers all have worked in the field for years before coming to teach and know a lot about the specific field that they were in. Professors are all very nice and want you to succeed. The graduating classes are small (around 50 people) and you take all of your nursing classes with the same people. This allows you to get to know everyone in your class very well. The registration process is very easy and you work with an academic advisor one on one to plan out the schedule and get registered for all of your general education classes.
College Sophomore,4,Costs of nearby apartments aren't too expensive and they are close to campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Transit System – Bellin College students are also affiliated with the UWGB campus, they do get a free bus pass which is really nice. The bus does travel to both campuses and around the city. It is really nice to have free transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"Bellin College is a private college. We are all way to busy to search for parties, and our days usually start by 6 am. Not much room to party here."
College Junior,2,"Our school does not have any athletics associated directly with it, but Bellin students are allow to participate in partner school athletics if they so choose."
College Junior,2,Unfriendly Atmosphere – if i have my way I would not choose my school.  The tuition is very high.  The program is OK but the students dont make life lovely over there if you are not from green bay.  Accormodation is difficult to find and is very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Doesn't Exist! The ""nightlife"" at Bellin College consists of study groups...and that's it.  The college pretty much shuts down by 6pm.  However, the quiet campus is a great environment for studying.  Nightlife is a tad more exciting in town or at the nearby UWGB, where there is always something to do."
College Sophomore,1,"There Is None – You got a little store with some food, not much.  The old building had nothing, so I guess its better then before. No meal plan obviously."

Freshman,5,I love the campus. I believe that the environment is beautiful and it is easy to walk everywhere and the people there are kind. Everyone knows everyone.
Alum,5,Not enough positive words for this place. It helped me grow into who I am and helped solidify what I wanted to do for my career. The people are fantastic and the community is wonderful!
Freshman,5,i am a first year student and absolutely love the atmosphere this college brings forth the faculty are very friendly and approachable always willing to help in any way they can
Freshman,5,"Thus far my experience at MCLA has been the best of my life. I have formed many connections, came upon new friends, and have learned a tremendous amount of information."
Freshman,5,So far it’s been the greatest experience of my life. All of the professors are so kind and really help you in any way possible. The campus is beautiful as well. I just wish there were more food options.
Freshman,5,"MCLA has the perfect environment for any aspiring artist. Surrounded by incredible assets, specially the Mass MoCA, MCLA is the perfect place to grow creatively and academically."
Freshman,5,"Lovely campus. People underestimate the power of a small campus and community. I’ve lived in western mass my whole life and have been in the student scene of, Smith, MT Holyoke, UMass and more and nothing comes close to this community."
Junior,5,"My experience with MCLA has been great. It's a small school that gives you the opportunity to stand out, matter, and succeed. The school being small allows you to build connection with friends and most importantly professors. I am never hesitant to talk to a professor after class or email them whenever I need help because I'm confident they'll be there for me."
Alum,5,"MCLA really was my college right from the start.  The faculty and staff were incredibly supportive and knowledgeable.  The President was always around campus and really made us feel like we were all important.  Truly a great experience and for a great price, I wish I could relive those years!  Anyone on the fence should really consider this institution."
Freshman,5,"What I like about MCLA is the small, but beautiful campus. Also, the faculty there is always there to help you when you need it. It feels like you are never alone in your journey to your future."
Freshman,5,"My first year at MCLA is going well, both peers and teachers had made me feel welcomed into this small community."
Senior,5,"Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts is one of the best state schools in Massachusetts. For its low cost, the education you can receive here is outstanding. With myriad departments run by doctoral professors, the opportunities for success and engagement do not end. I have been able to find multiple internships in my field and connect with opportunities for advancing my education after MCLA thanks to my advisors. I have no complaints about this school at all!"
Niche User,5,"The college provides a very nice small town experience. There are many little shops, and an art galelry in North Adams, which makes the college feel even more artsy."
Senior,5,My experience at MCLA has been life changing. The education department has a great group of staff members that are dedicated to helping students succeed. The only changes I would make for MCLA would be with their meal plans. The meal plans are expensive and there aren't enough options for food.
College Senior,5,You aren't a number to your professor. They get to know your name and about you.
College Senior,5,The facilities are getting updates as of recent. Games are fun to attend and the crowd gets to be involved during half times and breaks of games. Sports are becoming very competitive within their respective conferences
College Senior,5,"This campus is small but inviting, it feels like home"
Recent Alumnus,5,This is one of the most diverse campuses I have ever been to. You see people of every race and gender and even nongender.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved every class I took. They had many diverse classes so no one can say there was no classes to take.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved MCLA and everything it offered. Graduation was sad, but I knew that with my education I was ready for the future because MCLA helped me prepare for the future."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved MCLA and everything it offered. Graduation was sad, but I knew that with my education I was ready for the future because MCLA helped me prepare for the future."
Recent Alumnus,5,There are many departments and clubs that have safety awareness for a number of topics
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved my suite in BT my freshmen year and I loved my townhouse my sophomore year and junior year. They were spacious and provided a good sense of community.
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school changed my life. It made me think of a bunch of different career paths until I eventually picked one. While it is a small school, that was a big plus for me. This meant more opportunities in the department and more 1:1 time with professors and workers to learn and create those relationships to help in the future."
College Senior,5,"I have love nearly all my classes at MCLA. The professors always have a passion towards what they teach and generally a caring heart towards the students progress. The courses I have taken are well planned and laid out well too. Sometime the variety of courses offered is lacking and there seems to be a recent issue of not allowing student to do independent studies due to money. Class sizes are relatively small, but that leaves room for a more personal experience."
College Senior,5,The small community experience is great at MCLA because there everyone knows you and remembers you. I love being able to walk through the campus and be able to walk through the quad and be able to see someone I know. Or even walking about some faculty that you only spoke to once in your life and they remember who you are. I love that feeling.
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't go to any other school, because this one is where I feel a part of the community and I feel like i'm getting my money's worth,"
College Freshman,5,I've got a bright future ahead of me because of the education I'm getting at MCLA
College Freshman,5,"I feel a part of the community, and a part of campus. I love my courses, and I love how interesting it is to work within the tight knit community that MCLA is."
College Sophomore,5,The food around here is ridiculously amazing! So many options!
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is so small it is physically impossible not to know everything that is going on at any given time. However, everyone does what they have to to make sure everyone is safe."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone here gets some sort of financial aid and they are easy to talk to and hear all concerns of students.
College Sophomore,5,"Neither are easy. Ignore anything a freshman says. Seriously they are still in core classes, getting that well rounded part of going to a liberal arts School. Work load increases substantially especially for certain majors. Very close knit if you are not a business major. I know all my professors fairly well definite plus to a small school. For education they also have you spend way more time in the actual classroom, and earlier too another plus. You will be applying yourself once you start your major. Side note is professors must have a PhD within 5 years of starting working at MCLA they do know what they are talking about."
College Sophomore,5,Admissions is super helpful. It was simple. If you are going into education make sure you realize that you will have to take extra classes if you didn't come in with any.
College Freshman,5,"The best method MCLA has by luring in students is by giving out so much scholarships. But yeah, as a 4 high school honors students and overachiever it fooled me big time. Here's a piece of advice for all those considering MCLA. This is a liberal arts school. If you in the hopes of studying anything within the STEM field and business,this is NOT a school for you. The price tag is quite amazingly affordable, but I found the quality of the teaching to be a second level away from my high school's. With that being said, go to a place that will open doors for your aspirations and career paths. Many have found great success here within the arts program, but if your going into the health, engineering, politics,business, and science profession..consider another institution. Boston is practically our neighbor ! Why travel or stay so isolated from it when all the educational and economic activities are there !!  The scholarships are amazing but you will receive what you payed for. And I graduated my high school with a 5.0 GPA with AP credits guys...don't make the mistake I did. I'm glad. I'm transferring out debt free, but with no satisfaction of the education I have received here."
College Freshman,5,"I commend public safety for all the great work that they do for the college. They are well dispersed and seen on campus. Because MCLA is such a tight knit community and small in size, it is very easy for a student to walk over to the Public safety department and file a complaint. They work hard and it is shown every day the officers are on duty. As for students, college kids will be college kids. But this is a place of ignorance and lack of personal responsibility. Alot of freshman come here ready to explore and adventure the college social scene and aren't even educated on how to control their liquor/ alcohol. If your a light weight, don't go past your limit to make your self known. This school is a gold fish bowl. Everyone see's who you are and what your all about . Be safe, smart and educated ."
College Sophomore,5,The courses are amazing and there is a huge variety. Professors actually care about who their students are and how they are doing in their classes. The sizes of the classes are small which makes it easier for each student to get a better experience and a closer relationship with their professor. I love getting to know my professors and having them actually care about how I am doing with their workloads.
College Sophomore,5,We have a very diverse population rom the very very liberal to the incredibly conservative as well as many different ethnic backgrounds. With this there is no butting heads either everyone melds together so well.
College Sophomore,5,"The school is the best. They have been improving all the facilities, brand new science facility.  The teachers are there for you and willing to help and push you.  There are many clubs to join and everyone on campus is very friendly, it's not weird to say hello or smile at several people on a walk across campus."
College Sophomore,5,"There is always something going on on campus and there are always people looking to do things.  They are always looking for new ideas.  We have a great library, I believe it's the largest reference library in Massachusetts.  Both taconic lawn and the quad are kept nice and green and you can always see people lounging there."
Freshman,4,I did not do online work for them.  I am an incoming freshman.  I hope we don't do online classes because they stink.
Niche User,4,"I did not take any online classes, but during COVID-19 my brother has and he says that they are pretty good."
Niche User,4,"I took a dual enrollment class at this college, which my brother also attends. They have a great community, especially within their groups. The tennis team has so much fun in everything they do and a Christian group I attended was very energetic and exciting. The class I attended was hard work, but a lot of fun to participate in. The teacher drew everyone into the class and connected with each person individually."
Sophomore,4,"I think it's a great welcoming place and the education is amazing with great professors and a wonderful atmosphere. My goal for going to college is to earn a higher education to better my future. I plan to get my degree in Psychology--becoming an ABA professional, working with children who have behavioral issues. I work at a daycare in a preschool setting because I wanted to work somewhere I had the opportunity to work with children. I went through a rough patch where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety--I found no hope or drive to do anything. Then, my nephew was born and from that point on my life was forever changed. He made me want to get better because I wanted to be someone he could look up to and I never wanted anybody to have to explain to him what happened if I did not survive my depression. Thanks to him I continue to strive to be successful and encourage others while getting my college degree."
Freshman,4,"The quality of commuter education at MCLA is excellent, however on-campus education is average or very good. The overall rating I would give is very good for certain reasons. The professors are very determined and the layout for classes is excellent and well planned. The dormitories are average because the size of the rooms is comparable with other campus's but the food from the centennial room is excellently made but with a very small selection of food."
Sophomore,4,More connection with students. Less worry about image to the public and actually help with the issues on campus.
Alum,4,When it comes to Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts or just MCLA for short the main aspect of this school that I enjoyed the most was the sense of community. With the school not being that large in size it was very easy for everyone to know everyone and a lot of the staff made the campus community feel like one big family. One thing that I would change about MCLA would be finding more ways to cause more diversity in the student body  and finding  different ways to appeal to all cultures.
Freshman,4,"I went to go visit MCLA this year around April . What interested me about the college was the fact that it was community oriented, and everyone knew each other. Which is just like my high school City on a Hill. Everyone my high school knows each other and it's very giving in making a better for the students. I believe that MCLA is just like that as well. It being a small college and being able find myself throughout the college experience, gives me hope and excitement that they are there to help anyone and everyone. That they will help you continue your path to your future even if it's stating with tiny steps!"
Junior,4,"MCLA offers a variety of classes. However, it is sometimes very difficult to navigate through all the requirements of majors, especially for students who have a double major, double minor, and/or double concentration. There are a lot of clubs as well and it is very easy to create a club by going to the Student Government Association. Many teachers are willing to supervise clubs and are happy to help students develop their interest and skills with like-minded people."
Sophomore,4,"The student life here at MCLA is great! The community is free, welcoming, and open to everyone of any and every background."
Senior,4,"Transferred here after attending a big university and I definitely prefer the smaller school than the bigger one. Everyone pretty much knows each other and the professors get to know you more than just a student. If your in the science field, professors will let you do research on just about anything. I had a friend who did research about Orcas and the school is no where near an ocean but the professor gave her the green light and let her do it."
Sophomore,4,I love it here. I've been here for two years now and I am very happy that I have spent my time here.
Junior,4,"I just transferred, but the small community and beautiful surroundings are what drew me here! The professors seem very qualified, and there are so many opportunities for professional connections post-graduation."
Freshman,4,"The Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts offers a vast variety of courses and opportunities in all subjects and areas of study.  I have the ability to learn about all topics outside of my major.  What I wish would be expanded on is the fine and performing arts department such as theatre and music.  Overall, MCLA was the perfect choice for me to start my college career."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've had an excellent experience at MCLA.  Every professor I've had is extremely dedicated to student success and there are countless resources on campus intended to enrich the student's experience.  "
Freshman,4,"I personally love this school. However, I feel as though there is poor communication. It is difficult to hear about events happening on campus. Academics and teachers are wonderful. Food is not good. "
College Sophomore,4,We have a really great public safety team and there are always police patrolling campus to make sure students get home safely and nothing bad happens.  Campus is also very close to the towns police station and fire station and state police can be on campus in around fifteen minutes if needed.  We also have a really great counseling service on campus and it is easy to get in touch with a medical practitioner if needed.
College Sophomore,4,"For freshmen year you have to live in either the main dorm building, Hoosac Hall, or the suit style building, Berkshire Towers.  After than you can live in either those two or in the Flagg Townhouses at the back of campus.  Most people want to live in the townhouses because they offer a greater feeling of independence and you get to live with a larger group of friends.  It is relatively easy to change your housing throughout the semester if you need to, but most people like where they are assigned.  The dorm buildings have both been renovated in the past few years and are very modern and updated, the townhouses are a little outdated but still pretty great.  It is very easy to socialize and find fun activities to do within your building.  All the housing options are within a five minute walk of all buildings on campus.  There is a mandatory residency requirement of living on campus from freshmen through junior year, which is not unreasonable and most people live on campus all four years."
College Senior,4,Everyone has their own opinion
College Senior,4,The only downside is that our facilities need to be updated!!
College Senior,4,Classes are what you make of them. You will get out of them what you put into them
College Senior,4,The population on campus is very diverse and most everyone is accepting
College Senior,4,I always see public safety driving around campus and they are very friendly. There a multiple blue light emergency stations around campus that are at easy access. Overall I have never felt unsafe on campus
College Senior,4,Graduating in May and I have a few options of what I am going to do after graduation
College Senior,4,"I have had a great experience here, being a senior I wouldn't change my decision about attending here"
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is what you make of it, as for the cleanliness, that falls on you if your room is messy that's your fault."
Recent Alumnus,4,I think the rules that are in place are all very good. Students are the ones who need to use common sense and follow them because the rules in place are abiding by the laws of the state.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had too many problems with my classes. If anything, it would be my own laziness and lack of motivation than the courses or professors themselves."
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are very personable and friendly making class requirements realistic and educational
Recent Alumnus,4,I attended Westfield State University my first year of college but found that it was very far from anything other than a neighborhood. Very suburban with difficult transportation. Poor safety and too strict of alcohol policy. I applied to MCLA due to the difference in price and location.
College Senior,4,"Team spirit is great at MCLA! Students and Faculty are always there to support the college teams. The teams are always pretty good. Like the Softball team made it really far into the championship last year, which was awesome. The facilities are really nice looking. I don't always get to attend games because I live about 50 minutes away from campus, but I try to attend as many as I can!"
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety and the school's administration work hard in order to prevent any issues that happen on campus, and if called report fast, they also constantly patrol the campus to ensure safety, they do a great job, the only issue is members outside our campus community, creating harmful situations."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the fact there are multiple living areas within the campus, yet the one thing I don't really understand is basically the 3 year in-campus living contract, in which I don't see as fair because there can be alternative housing near campus which can be cheaper than living on campus, some students can't afford living on campus, and shouldn't be stuck living there."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a member of the Greek community within my school, yet the school fails to recognize my fraternity and other organizations on campus, to be completely honest, Greek life plays a major part in the social aspects within the campus, yet non-Greek students can't see past the parties, but fail to realize that Greeks, at least in my school actually have the highest GPA on campus and do multiple hours of community services collectively and individually. Hopefully faculty within the school, recognize the hard work Greek members within the campus do positive things, everyone should be open-minded and believe in stereotypes and stigmas. I am proud that I am a member of a fraternity in which there are members of different races and ethnicity but also of different sexual orientation together forming a brotherhood."
College Sophomore,4,"I love that the distance makes it feel as if I was away from home but can return home any time I can. It is a small school, in a rural area but that is what makes the campus community better. There is diversity within the campus and the multicultural clubs (which I am part of) on campus try their best to spread awareness on modern civil issues. For a school with limited resources, it provides mostly everything a student needs to be successful. One improvement I would like to see would be Greeks (Fraternities and Sororities) actually being welcomed by the school and appreciated, me being a member of Sigma Chi Beta, but never is recognized for the great work I do via my organization. The food isn't the best either, but I guess I can learn how to cook. Overall, my almost two years at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) haven;t been bad at all."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security could take their jobs a little more seriously. They are around, but don't really add a ton to the feel of campus. They are almost a last resort to an already safe campus."
College Freshman,4,I just wish there were a little bit more diversity choices
College Freshman,4,"I'm also not a part of greek life, but it really has no effect on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not really part of sports, but they are there for whoever feels that they want to partake in them"
College Sophomore,4,I love my college. It is small and in the heart of the berkshires which was important for me. I actually learn in my classes and the teachers know my name. I am the VP of two clubs and I am so happy I am a part of residential life. I have lifelong friends and I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else.
College Freshman,4,I haven't started classes yet but my experience with orientation and my athletic coaches has been wonderful.  I am looking forward to beginning my education at MCLA in a few weeks
College Freshman,4,Well from my first visit and from the moment I joined the group on face book the school has been so welcoming. I am glad that I have chosen MCLA as my college. The atmosphere is perfect I couldnt ask for a better school.
College Freshman,4,"I'm in creative Writing, so we're what the school's known for. It's great!"
College Freshman,4,"I get Dominoes a lot delivered, but I adore the Parlor! It's reasonably priced and has a lot of healthy options! The staff is so friendly and the open mic nights are fun. I hang out there a lot."
College Freshman,4,"The parties are great if the music's bumpin'; which in that case depends on your preference in partying music. If you're already lit and there is an influx of students, then you will definitely enjoy yourself."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are bigger than any rooms I have seen at other colleges, as well as various living options to choose from."
College Freshman,4,"I believe that the off campus options are better than the meal plan that first year students are required to have. The best places I think are best to go to are, The Parlor, Papa Ginos, D'Angelos and any of the oriental food restaurants. The food is always well prepared."
College Freshman,4,"I believe that the administration for this building does a great job at keeping to the rules, and making sure students follow them as well. I think that they are necessary and help students keep the environment safe and secure."
College Freshman,4,"I think the people over all are very great. I feel safe on campus being in this kind of scene. I think going to parties can help people realize what they do and do not want to be apart of for sure. Like it's often said,"" you don't know until you try something."" I think a part of the whole ""college experience"" is to go out every once in a while and just be in the moment with the people around you. You don't have to make poor decisions to do that, and it's very easy not to if you don't want to."
College Junior,4,"Please go to the Parlor Cafe. It's quick, convenient, and the owner of literally makes all the pastries and meals like quiche. The only thing not made there are the bagels."
College Sophomore,4,"It depends where you live. In the freshman dorms, the RA's can get pretty strict because you're so close to other people who want respect. In the townhouses you can choose to live in a loud environment or a quiet one, and the people surrounding you respect that."
College Sophomore,4,Several teams are on the rise. Soccer field is immaculate best in the conference. If you win fans will come. There is also plans to expand things like the weight room. School is improving.
College Sophomore,4,"There is more variety then people think. If you take the time to actually look then you can find a variety of option within delivery, walking and driving distance, you might have to venture into Adams or williams but that's literally a 10 minute drive and if you are too lazy for that well.... also if you pick up some will remind you that they will deliver too. There are also several nice sit down places too"
College Sophomore,4,"Off campus dining around North Adams is all extremely convenient. It's a short walk away from campus and everything is pretty cheap. Also, most places make deliveries right to the dorms on campus. MCLA students get a lot of discounts"
College Sophomore,4,The MCLA campus isn't that strict. It is easy for students to begin their own clubs and students/faculty members are always extremely involved. We do quiet hours in the dorms and that is used for students who need sleep or are staying up doing work. But most of the time it it 24 hour courtesy hours.
College Sophomore,4,"Every student who needs a job or internship on campus is giving the opportunity to have one. We have a strong alumni network, a lot of our alumni's are still on campus and helping out undergraduate students as much as they can."
College Sophomore,4,there are really good options for courses and you generally dont have to deal with bad professors if you manage well
College Sophomore,4,the political science department is GREAT and really friendly
College Sophomore,4,"it definitely works, they're there, but you won't always get caught"
College Sophomore,4,"i've had like two bad professors, and all of my classes are of manageable sizes"
Junior,2,"There are very few activities in the area and the culture is very party heavy. The students, for the most part, seem uninspired in the classroom and the attitude spreads to the professors and administrators as a result. Affordable."
Freshman,2,"At MCLA, I feel that the institution hires teachers that do not utilize their profession to help students. In several of my classes, such as Programming in Java I and Introduction to Statistics, I had to teach myself majority of the material because both teachers (Mike Dalton and Erin Kiley) were condescending and made me feel stupid for asking questions when I did not understand something"
College Sophomore,2,Classes are too easy. I feel like I am paying too much money and not getting enough out of my classes. Complete and utter waste of money and time. I want to get an education that will prepare me.
College Freshman,2,"There's not a lot of options and the Dining hall is hit or miss. I've had some good days and some bad. The food committee is trying to reform, but we go through Aramark and the school won't review the contract and Aramark won't listen/doesn't care."
College Freshman,2,You are kind of on your own when it comes to them.
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty in the mountatins, but unless you are rich enough to live in Williamstown everywhere else is pretty rundown."
College Freshman,2,"I believe the food here is the downfall. Although some options are alright, all around the quantity definitely overrides the quality. The people who work the kitchen are wonderful, and interact with most of the students really well. The quality of the staff overall does not reflect the food at all. Most of the food lacks flavor, and often tastes like heavily processed school cafeteria food. I think what would help a lot is if there were more fresh options and a variety to the fruits and vegetables already provided. I think another option would be for the school to strike up a deal with the other restaurants already around campus. It's already provided in the system that students can use ""Blazer Bucks"" to pay for meals, but if the meal swipes were somehow coordinated as well I think students would feel as though they had more freedom. Overall, I think MCLA has to expand it's horizons more than they have already."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus dining ? Well all I have to say is that Supreme Pizza, Dominoes and Sushi House have been my best friend. But the perks to all of that is the fact that as a freshman, you have a limited amount of money to enjoy your self off campus. But when you get the chance, explore and see what food options you like in Downtown...And don't get all excited when I say Downtown. It takes 3 min just walk the whole area. Its literally that small guys."
College Freshman,2,"The selection of your campus housing should match your personality . If you are a reserved, quiet and appreciate your own space away from nose, Berkshire Towers is the choice for you. But if your into a community environment space and are very social, Hoosac is for you. And of course, Townhouses are available to anyone who is a upperclassmen."
College Sophomore,2,It's very secluded but if you like nature you're all set.
College Freshman,2,"Lame. Don't even think they are recognized, nationally at least. Sororities are full of weird girls and frats are douchey and they are all already balding."
College Freshman,2,"I got enough aid, but they're mostly loans, not grants or scholarships or anything like that."
College Freshman,2,"Many people here party, even though it's a small school. I guess because it is a small school and there isn't much to do here, people party almost every weekend."
College Freshman,2,"The Wellness Center hours are super inconvenient. The condoms they give are not durable. Police Campus is around, but I feel as though they are not very helpful. However, they will give you a ride if you need one. Also, many people in this school sell and do drugs."
College Freshman,2,"There are not many places to eat off-campus. There are a couple restaurants, most of them family-owned, and then there is your typical McDonald's, Burger King, and Dunkin Donuts. There are a couple of pizza places such as Supreme and Village Pizza, which are actually pretty good, but anywhere else is sub par. Other restaurants in the area are not that good, and they are somewhat pricey."
College Freshman,2,"There are not many internship/job opportunities, which is disappointing. The English/Communications department is not anything special. I feel as though it is sub par. There also isn't anything unique about the program either. I feel as though I am not learning anything or getting any use or information out of the program."
College Freshman,2,"It is not very difficult or challenging to get into this school. As long as you were not failing any of your classes in high school and you have at least a 2.0-2.5 GPA, you should get in. The application process is pretty standard. SAT scores are not very important in order to be accepted. Also, there are not many majors to choose from. The classes are not as diverse as you would think. All of the classes are small and intimate, and personally I dislike that- I feel like I am still in high school."
College Senior,2,Other then meeting great new friends associated with Greek life and non-Greek life -- this school is a joke. You don't need to go to class to pass. The teachers will almost always accept work late even though they say they will not. If you want an easy degree come here.
College Senior,2,The food is awful and very expensive! Get off the meal plan as soon as possible!
College Senior,2,The gym is crap (very tiny and run-down) and there aren't many student hangouts other than the basketball courts and townhouses. 
College Senior,2,"The shuttle is free but inconvenient so people stopped riding, leading to cuts. There isn't any good transportation other than that so a car is pretty much a necessity. "
College Senior,2,"There are rarely spots to park in and if you need to have your car at school, it costs you an arm and a leg. "
College Senior,2,Financial aid office is annoying and no one really gives you options. I really needed aid this year but there was a decrease in funds and I was taken off the work study list for lack of school funding! People that do not need work study somehow get the jobs that others should have. 
College Senior,2,"There aren't many places to go if you are 21+ because one, you don't want to drive drunk, and two, places are far away and really sketchy and dangerous."
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere is not that good. There aren't much activities or attractions in North Adams. The mall is about 40 minutes away and not very big with little stores. However, the locals are really nice and supportive. "
College Freshman,2,It is not convenient. It only runs every so often and you rarely know when it is running. 
College Freshman,2,I feel like they do a good job for what they are but they don't seem to focus on the right things or people and when they do catch people that are crazy strict.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone was white, I was the only Hispanic in basically the school, I did meet other Hispanics and Haitians though, but about 97 per cent were white. But watch out, some of these white kids try to put you down. They did that to me and I ended up breaking his nose."
College Freshman,2,"It's really annoying really, a lot of people only care about being the coolest and most popular person they can be, I never had to deal with things like this before but I got into a lot of fights cause a lot of people thought they were better then me when they obviously weren't. so in other words, a lot of people are cocky. The dorms are good depending whose on your floor, mines, we were almost a family and had our doors open 24/7, applying for housing was really easy too."
College Freshman,2,"If you get caught you get in a heck of a lot of trouble, but if you don't, well, nothing happens!"
College Freshman,2,Only nightlife is at one of the frats.  the bars/clubs in town are lame and close early.
College Freshman,2,"Asides from the potato chowder, mac & cheese, and occasional good batch of fries- our meals really aren't all that good and as far as health goes I see too much starch in our diets."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Involved – There is Greek life on campus, but I'm not involved with the scene. I do not  like the idea of living with a lot of other people in not-so-great living conditions. I would take a clean dorm room any day."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The parking situation in my opinion at MCLA is horrible and I am not sure if it will get better. First, they charge $100/semester for a student living on campus to park! Second, they have switched a lot of parking around because they are putting new buildings in and I don't know if they have room for more parking. Lastely, they give us stupid parking tickets for parking in commutor parking stops over night!"
College Freshman,2,"-Printing is FREE
-Labs are not usually filled, most students have laptops 
-Wireless varies depending where you are on campus 
-NO MAC SUPPORT :("
College Freshman,2,"Well, We Are in the Berkshires – Since MCLA is located in New England the weather is, of course, unpredictable. Spring and fall are usually fine. Sometimes it rains but, c'est la vie. Towards the end of spring and into summer, we get up in the 80's and 90's during the day, then back down to the 40's at night. In the winter it snows, it rains and sometimes ice falls from the sky and coats the roads a sheet of invisible danger. If you're from around here, this is normal. There is the occasional canceled class due to weather. I know a few of the professors are from Vermont so the trip on the back roads can be very dangerous after a big storm. If you're a commuter and you can't make it to class due to weather, the professors are usually very understanding. If you live on Campus, however, there's no need to miss a class due to snow. There are mini-plow trucks that clean all of the walkways and drop a nice layer of sand. The sidewalks and stairs are all shoveled and sanded as well. There are some extra precautions taken now. We had a student slip on some ice last year and it caused a fatal injury. All in all, The school does it's damnedest to make sure that everything is as safe and clean as it can be on campus. The weather, however, is New England weather. Either you're used to it or you're not."
College Senior,2,"North Adams Is Not Bad, but Not Great . . . North Adams could be better when it comes to off-campus dining!  The coffee shops will close between 3 to 5 p.m., and the most of the places open late at night are fast-food shops.  However, Angelina Subs is open until midnight every night and make delicious sandwiches!"
College Freshman,2,"Safety Doesn't Care – People are walking around campus at night every night, swaying, people come in extremely drunk, falling down, to buildings, and nothing happens. Nobody cares. These people could get hurt."
College Freshman,2,"I love it here in the fall and spring, because everyone stays outside, and there are lots of activities, but it sure is a long, cold, miserable winter. While I wouldn't completely rule this school out because of that, definitely take it into consideration, especially if you have depression issues, or are susceptible to seasonal depression."
College Sophomore,2,"Lack of Variety – The food quality of our one dining hall is adequate, however there is an extreme lack of variety in options, especially in fresh fruit and vegetables."
Alum,1,"I took one class online — you are required to take a computer education course. It is tedious and irrelevant. I had to “write a book” about every single button in each Microsoft program like Excel and Word. It didn’t teach me how to use them, just how to write about them. It took an extremely long time."
College Freshman,1,"The girls here are mostly ratchet and ridiculously immature. The guys are incredibly thirsty and disrespectful. Then consider the fact that alot of inner city freshman from Dorchester,MA, Roxbury,MA, and Brockton,MA come in and goes crazy into the mix."
College Freshman,1,"If you are an applicant that has anything above a 3.5 GPA or higher, don't even think about coming here."
College Freshman,1,"Not enough for certain departments, especially for Political Science . I honestly believe that the workload is comparable to high school. Nothing to difficult or challenging. But, if your looking for a challenge, consider leaving or not even applying."
College Freshman,1,It's the worst....the quality is just horrible !
College Freshman,1,"The worst .. the parties are incredibly basic. Take it from someone from Boston and has traveled to alot . There is no need to cake your face with makeup or dress up nice. Most girls practically head out with sweatpants . The guys are incredibly rude and half of them do not even attend the college. One things for sure, it is really obvious to spot out a freshman. And if your thinking about being adventurous and seeing what the party life is like at MCLA.. LOL old ass music, basic DJ from the woods, houses with no AC, a bunch thirsty freshman and light weights. Its so sad. It makes the parties at Bunker Hill Community College live than this."
College Freshman,1,Division III in the middle of no where...enough said.
College Freshman,1,"North Adams,MA. Guys..do your research . This place is beautiful and oh yes the brochure you got at open house made you want to start hiking..WAKE UP ! This place is a desert. Half the shops in ""Downtown North Adams"" are closing due to the lack of foot traffic. If you do not have a car, your screwed because students actually travel to Pittsfield for shopping, dining out and etc.  There are a lack of salons and there arn't any ethnic ones. So if your African/African American, get used to braiding on your own. The nightlife is do dead. I swear the parties are nothing to get dressed for. To be honest, this year there was a stabbing at one of them and several cases of sexual assault. The parties are so mediocre, it made me remember my first house party...in 9th grade. 

The weekends are so sad, practically everyone stays in or tries to enjoy a good time despite the horrible night life. Coming to MCLA actually made me appreciate being a city kid . Seriously..why did I leave Boston?"
College Freshman,1,The food is seriously awful. I have to take fiber powder 2x a day to even stay alive. only 1 cafeteria and people literally get food poisoning. A couple pizza places and things downtown but definitely not great. One of things I hate most about this school.
College Freshman,1,"The professors eventually learn your name because the classes are so small, and it is very easy to get called out on. Chances are, you will get humiliated by the professor at some point."
College Freshman,1,"I can't wait to transfer. If you're thinking about coming here, make sure you don't. Please don't come here for your sake as well as your parents'. I am looking out for you. If you do end up coming here because of financial reasons, then stay for a year and transfer immediately."
College Freshman,1,"There is hardly any variety, the food looks, smells, and tastes bad, and it is basically the same thing every day."
College Freshman,1,"You're not allowed to have any alcohol in the dorms, and every now and then the RD and RA come by to inspect rooms. Smoking is prohibited as well as drugs, obviously. You can only have an overnight guest for two consecutive nights in a week, and you can only have up to two. However, if your roommate also has a guest, then you can only have one. Only two guests are allowed per room."
College Freshman,1,There hardly are any places to live off-campus.
College Freshman,1,"I'm from Pennsylvania, so if I want to get home by a bus, I have to either get someone to drive me to Williamstown, which is about ten minutes away from this school to catch a Peter Pan Bus. If Williamstown can't take me to Pennsylvania, then I either have to go to Amherst or Albany, NY to get on a bus or train to get home from there."
College Freshman,1,No public transportation is available.
College Freshman,1,"Appearance is not a huge thing for me, but it's always nice to have some eye candy. However, there is practically none. I thought my high school was bad, but compared to this school, my high school was a red carpet event compared to this school. Not many people get into relationships here, but almost everyone hooks up with someone, and since this school is so small, you'll most likely see that person the following week."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing unique or special about the academics here. The classes are small and intimate, which may or may not be a good thing, depending on how you look at it. Personally I hate it. The professors are not good, and I always feel anxious every time I go to class."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing exciting to do around here. Walking can only get you so far. Mass Moca is here which is nice if you like art, but other than that, the nearest anything is at least half an hour away. The nearest mall is 30-40 minutes away, but there is a Good Will in town. Panera is in Pittsfield, which is also 30-40 minutes away. The nearest Taco Bell, Starbucks, and Chipotle are an hour or more away. The nearest Chipotle is actually in New York. Basically this town is painfully boring and lame."
College Freshman,1,"There are only two or three fraternities, but girls can join too, so it is basically co-ed. They are pretty small, and most people join so that they can party whenever they want."
College Freshman,1,"The WiFi here is absolutely terrible. I have T-mobile, and I don't have service here, so I have to rely on WiFi to make texts and calls. However, it is absolutely frustrating to make a call or send a text here because my calls always get dropped. The WiFi is not strong at all, and most of my friends don't even have access to WiFi in their own dorms. I'm assuming it's because we live in the mountains, but it is extremely aggravating and disappointing."
College Freshman,1,"I hardly hear about sports, and when I do, I hear that the athletes aren't really athletes. Sport teams here aren't very competitive, and we don't have many sports teams either. Yesterday I found out that we had a softball team that nobody knew about."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do at night except party at the different fraternities houses or sports houses. The theater doesn't show much movies. There are no clubs at all. And since, I'm under 21, I can't really go to the bar. So, there isn't much to here and that is probably the worst about living in North Adams"
College Senior,1,Heard all the parties end at 10 pm
College Sophomore,1,Parking is unavailable for freshman but some freshman students get away with it because of favoritism.
College Sophomore,1,The rules are not as strict as they should be. People get away with a lot of things because of favoritism.
College Junior,1,"Small Town – There isn't much here. There are a couple of bars, but that's about it. It's a pretty dead town."
College Junior,1,"For a Bad Cause – The Greek life at my school acts like they do more philanthropy than they do. They are affiliated with the school, however, they secretly admit members that do not have good enough grades and therefore, partying brings their grades down even more. Those who are part of one of the Greek organizations at my school generally keep to themselves, start drama and don't except others. My ex boyfriend had to go through terrible things to become Greek such as eating random food mixed together and then throwing up on someone else. This gives them a sense of accomplishment and to me it just seems wrong. The school also does not seem to notice that these activities go on. Although they are extremely strict about alcohal on campus, they do not regulate the activities that go on with the Greek that are affiliated with the school. Perhaps they just don't know how?"
College Sophomore,1,Same Old Same Old – the food in the dining hall is so repetitive is sicking. everyday you can count on having a hamburger or pizza for dinner and lunch. the thing about the food is that they make food that is not appeal-able to the students. the food needs a touch of more salt and season to give it flavor. Also trying different cultural background food would be nice too especially for those students   who are from different backgrounds.
College Sophomore,1,It's Freezing. There's snow and ice all the time. The town is horrible at shoveling the sidewalks and plowing the roads and the school isn't much better. The stuff they use to melt the ice smells awful and stains your clothes.
College Sophomore,1,It Sucks – The school changed their gpa requirement to a 2.0 this semester so I got put on academic probation for having a 1.997.
College Junior,1,"With the recent campus makeover, parking is scarce. The most convenient spots were taken by the new Science Center that is going to be built within the next 2 years. It's not usually anywhere close to classes, rarely close to the dorms, and in the winter can get crowded with students who can't park on the streets anymore but still don't have permits. The permit situation is rarely enforced."
College Senior,1,"Really Hard – It's really hard to get a good financial aid at MCLA. Also getting work study is not guaranteed, they keep adding the name and charging you for things you already paid for."
College Senior,1,"The School and the Policies Are Excessively Strict. First of all, MCLA is a dry campus. Meaning that with the exception of 21+ Townhouses, alcoholic beverages are prohibited everywhere. It's not just alcoholic beverages though, items associated with alcohol such as funnels, shot glasses, beer mugs, and even martini glasses are prohibited and can be confiscated and used as an excuse to do a search. 

The punishments are also very strict and although you have the option of an appeal, don't expect to win the hearing. Ever."
College Freshman,1,"MCLA used to be North Adams State. That says something. The school had such a bad rep, they had to change their name. xD 
There is a street neighboring the campus called Blackington. This street is where all the sororities and fraternities are. Back when we were North Adams College, this street would be blocked off by riots. I'm a commuter and my father would have a fit if I walked around that area at night. 
There are parties just about every week, sometimes there are several to choose from. Alcohol is very present at these parties. The rumor on campus is that the Greek houses have a deal with the cops. If all of the parties are done by 10 and there's no major noise, they won't get busted. Sure enough, all of the parties end at ten and I've only ever heard of one bust. 
Drugs are VERY present. I think I met three people while at MCLA that didn't smoke pot. There were also shrooms and acid. All of this is easy to get if you ""know the right people"". 
However, if you take a tour of the school, you won't see any of this. Even during the semesters, it's all very hush hush. Unless you're a student or a local friend of a student, you wouldn't have any idea."
College Senior,1,"Greek Life Is a Joke! The fraternities and sororities are not affiliated with MCLA, and have a bad repuation!  There are some people that join these groups to be more involved in the community, while others joing just so they can party!  When a party gets out of hand, the local cops and capus safety are not afraid to break it up!"

College Freshman,1,Nothing is really unique about MCLA. It has the same things you would find at any state school- or college for that matter.
College Freshman,1,Party or Nothing – Nightlife at MCLA is a little wild. There is a lot of underage drinking. Partying is taken to an excess with the fraternities and sororities. If you don't party you don't have anything to do at night except stay in and watch a movie or something.
College Freshman,1,"Kinda Boring – To be completely honest North Adams as a whole was quite boring. The surrounding areas did not have much to offer. The most exciting thing to do was to go to MassMOCA [contemporary art museum] and I only went there once. Also, you could go to Dunkin Donuts, Wal-Mart, Staples, or The Big Y to get things for school and dorm life."

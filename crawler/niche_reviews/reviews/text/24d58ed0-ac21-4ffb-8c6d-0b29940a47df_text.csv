Niche User,5,"As a senior in high school, Castleton University gave me the opportunity to start college a year early. I plan to have 38 college credits completed by the end of my senior year."
Niche User,5,I have been in touch with my college professors and am prepared for the upcoming school year. The instructions that my professors and advisors have given me are thorough and well understood.
Junior,5,"Since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, Castleton University took the right precautions when it came to finishing out our spring semester. Although such video classroom platforms, such as Zoom, were already established within this institution, Zoom was finally put to good use! After the announcement that classes would remain in an online platform, the faculty and staff were very communicative about how the remainder of the semester would look in an online format, giving all of us a week off to test out the online platform, and to be able to receive updates in a timely fashion."
Junior,5,"I first graduated from Castleton University in 2015, with a Bachelor's of Science in Communications. But I had always secretly had a passion for medicine and working with the people. I continued my education, obtaining an Associate of Science in Medical Assisting, and I fell in love!  Being able to perform vitals, different diagnostics, and making people feel comfortable, made my days worth while.  Although I did not pursue a career in the Communications field, my background and frequent patient interaction came in handy. 

But since working as a medical assistant for about two years, I decided to go back to my alma mater, to pursue a career in nursing. Castleton University has been known to not only have a tough program, but an overall rewarding experience. Our nursing professors are very tough and understanding people, who only want to see us, as the future of nurses, succeed and change lives for the better. I hope when I graduate, I will be well prepared as a future nurse!"
Sophomore,5,"I love being at Castleton because there is a great connection as a community between the campus, students, teachers, and the surrounding areas. Being at Castleton gives me the best opportunities to learn in my style."
Sophomore,5,"I love Castleton University. The staff is definitely devoted to making your time there very successful. All of the nursing teachers I have had are amazing at what they do. As soon as I got my first call from the registrars the staff was so friendly and helpful, it's an amazing school!"
Sophomore,5,"The food is terrible and always cold. Being able to ski all the time and graduating in three years makes it worth it. Teachers and classes are a hit or miss, some are great!"
Sophomore,5,Always find your way into a group. Classes are great and professor's are amazing. They are there to help you if needed!
Niche User,5,"Castleton University has a wonderful music instructor, as well as a music program. Their campus is very student friendly and they really want to make you feel welcomed. If I had to recommend this college to anyone else, I would tell them that their admissions office is has a great, friendly, and non-intimidating experience. Compared to other colleges I have been to, theirs is the most friendly."
Freshman,5,My daughter is thriving at this college. I am glad she is going however it can be expensive.  And just because we make above a $$ amount she gets very little for financial aid.
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior and committed to attend Castleton University in the fall.  My visits to Castleton were great, the campus is beautiful and everyone there was helpful and friendly."
Freshman,5,I love being a student at Castleton! Everyone is very friendly and the professors are generally very helpful. The classes are small so you are more than just a number in the class.
Alum,5,"As an alum of Castleton University, I am proud to tell others about where I went to school. Castleton is a school where you know your professors, know the staff, and even know the president. While the school may be small, it has a big heart and has only improved and grown since I graduated. I'm always happy to recommend Castleton!"
Alum,5,"Castleton University is a small school located in central Vermont. Surrounded by mountains, this institution combines the beauty of Vermont scenery with advanced technologies throughout campus. As an alum of the Natural Sciences Department, the small student-faculty ratio allowed me to easily get to know both the faculty and my peers, while presenting opportunities such as undergraduate research. The commitment to the students is overwhelmingly evident, fostering an environment fit for success. I would not change a thing about my undergraduate years, other than I wish I could have stayed longer."
Alum,5,"I loved this school. Despite being a small school, it offers everything that you would want or expect from a school triple the size. The faculty in every department cares and clearly loves what they are doing. They get to know you on a personal level. The professors care if you are doing well and want to see you succeed in their class. The campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Castleton University is a great school for anyone looking for a small and close knit community. Since each department is so small, you really get to know everybody and it creates a sense of belonging. The academics are quite good and the professors seem like they want to be there. The only real complaint is the food. I personally, have had some bad luck with food not being palatable in the main dining hall, but there are different options on campus that make up for it. Other then that slight complication, Castleton University is a great school."
College Freshman,5,"I am receiving an awesome education so far, and I am sure I will continue to do so. The professors are all very competent and are always available to answer any questions that one may have. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for great academics."
College Freshman,5,"Yeah, people drink and do drugs, we're in college. I have a medical condition that prevents me from doing both and I have never felt judged or compelled to take part in any of that. The parties are either out of campus or in the farthest places available (Hockey house, I've heard), so they do not make any difference in the life of people that do not take part in them. If you wanna go, cool, if you don't, nobody cares."
College Freshman,5,I am in love with Castleton! It's a beautiful campus where you can get a top quality education in an amazing place (Vermont is so gorgeous) and everybody is so friendly there. The professors are great and they care so much about your personal success. Would 100% recommend.
College Freshman,5,"I'm only a freshman so I haven't really been on the lookout yet, however I feel very confident in my opportunities of getting a job that I love after completing an education at Castleton."
College Freshman,5,"Our Wellness Center is amazing, the people there are extremely qualified and helpful and will be ready to help you out with just about anything. We have free counseling available without any limits, meaning that you can go in once a week, or more if you need to, without paying. I'm an international student and this really surprised me, there is no such thing as free counseling where I'm from (and it's good quality counseling, too).

Public Safety is amazing. They are open 24/7 and they are so good at what they do, they have cars and vans and they will pick you up from just about anywhere if you're in trouble. I feel extremely safe on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus. I live in South House (the wellness/substance free housing) and it's a great option. I'm in a very spacious suite, in a room that would be a triple but is used as a double. I know some buildings are pretty old but ours is one of the newest and I would 100% recommend living here."
College Freshman,5,"I am an international student and I think I could not have made a better choice. The professors are amazing, the students are really welcoming and friendly and whenever you are in trouble there is always someone to help. Castleton is making me fall in love with the United States!"
College Junior,5,Public safety and the Wellness Center are very active on campus
College Junior,5,"The sports on campus have great coaches and talented, committed athletes. The facilities are great for athletes and non-athletes"
College Junior,5,"I love Castleton! I decided to go to a small school since I want to move to a city when o graduate and Castleton was the perfect pick. Though being small has its downfalls, the professors are always experts in their feilds."
College Sophomore,5,"I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. Castleton is the school for me. The University is far enough away from home for me to feel independent, but Castleton still has a hometown feel that makes me comfortable two and a half hours away from my family."
College Senior,5,I believe Castleton does a lot to ensure a student's success. One way they do this is by helping us form connections for beyond our degree. There are a number of resources and individuals that are readily available to answer questions or concerns for the future.
College Senior,5,"The courses are always interesting, small class sizes are great and give you the opportunity to have a great relationship with your professors. They genuinely care about students and their understanding and success."
College Senior,5,"Castleton couldn't have given me a better college experience. There is nothing better than knowing you are getting a top notch education, and are surrounded by people that are as invested in your future as you are. You can't go wrong with Castleton."
College Freshman,5,"Even though it is only my first year, I have enjoyed my time here. I have had many wonderful experiences, and the faculty and staff are very helpful, and people are pretty friendly."
College Freshman,5,"I love the small class sizes, the professors and how enthusiastic they are about their courses, as well as how engaged they are in our success."
College Freshman,5,"So far, school has been very great and I enjoy it a lot."
College Freshman,5,Amazing academics and Great professors that genuinely want to give you a good education.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,Great network created after completing the BSN program. Great clinical experiences that classes during freshman year and first semester of sophomore year help prepare for.
College Freshman,5,Very good professors who truly care about your education.
College Freshman,5,I played on the varsity volleyball team at Castleton and it was a wonderful experience! All of those involved were more than pleasant and I created many memories and relationships through athletics here.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Castleton University. I think it is the perfect place for me to earn by RN while also creating many lifelong relationships.
College Freshman,5,I really love how supportive and aware our campus is about sexual assault and the safety of the students is on campus.
College Junior,5,"I have been provided with an outstanding educational experience, as well as given the opportunity to prove myself to my classmates and professors."
College Freshman,5,A great community to be a part of. One big family.
Recent Alumnus,5,Castleton is really affordable! I got half my tuition covered with scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved living on campus. Brand new dorm and the best friends!
College Sophomore,5,Half of the student body participate in a varsity sport.  The athletic facilities have all been redone and the quality of the programs has greatly improved over the last 5 years.  Because the school is small there is significant school spirit.
College Sophomore,5,"Student services is very helpful and lets me know if I need anything to keep current. Financial Aid is mostly dependent on the FAFSA process, and nothing can be done without applying for this program.  My school does not have much aid based aid."
College Sophomore,5,i love my major because each teacher wants you to do your best but also they will make or break you for criminal justice
College Sophomore,5,Everything is a nice walking distance. We have a great library we can always go work at. We have a nice gym we can go work out at. Overall the campus environment is nice and everyone seems friendly when walking by. 
College Sophomore,5,I have never had a problem finding a parking spot.  I do often have to walk quite a bit to get to classes but thats good for my health.
College Freshman,5,Our facilities are amazing on campus and even off campus at our ice rink! I love them! The fan base is awesome here too. Everyone comes out to support our teams and our teams don't let us down. They work hard and win a majority of the time if not all of the time!
College Sophomore,5,"Castletons Nursing program is excellent! I've learned so much in just one semester. We have two nursing lectures a week where we learn from the book. This part is the most important and base for achieving excellence. Many hours are spent each week reading and studying to do well on lecture test. Next is virtual hospital, we have that once a week. Virtual hospital is like a real life hospital with 6 beds and manikins that breath, have pulses and can even pee! In the virtual hospital is where we learn our skills. We are not allowed to do these skills in the clinical setting until we successfully complete them in the virtual hospital. We have lots of time to practice on our own outside the classroom.Most nights the VH is open till 7pm with a past student overlooking ready to help at anytime!"
College Junior,5,I have never had a problem with parking. It's perfect
Recent Alumnus,5,Fast and Accessible! The computers at our school are brand new Macs and they are always updated so that they are fast and are always available for students who need them.
College Sophomore,5,Printing on Campus – We are allowed to print anything we would like on campus for free. It makes college that much more affordable because we do not have to supply our own paper and ink.
College Junior,5,"Business Management – The business department at Castleton is given a lot of attention from the school because it is a huge program for them. You learn so many practical skills in the classes and a lot of work is project-oriented, focusing on presentations so you can learn in the most hands on way possible. I recommend being a business major to everyone."
College Freshman,5,Castleton offers state of the art new field and athletic field house. It has spent millions to offer students the best. The gymnasium offers only the finest of resources.
College Freshman,5,"Friendly and Quaint in Castleton – Castleton offers a safe environment for students. You are within a shot distance from shopping and area attractions. Being a small school, it employs many local people which allows them to know many of the students. Many of the professors have returned to Castleton to teach."
College Freshman,5,"The overall experience here is awesome. I love it here, everything about it here is awesome."
College Freshman,5,"School Spirit – Everyone comes out to support the sporting events on campus. The nice thing about that is that there is even support for the clubs, particularly rugby."
College Freshman,5,"Campus Center – The Campus Center is great. It is brand new, and has almost everything you need in it. There is a little grill cafe in there, along with the campus store. Which also has everything you need in it. There is also the nurse with a huge lounge up stairs, the mailroom, and also a recreation room. It is the perfect place to go when you need anything. Most people go on a daily basis."
Sophomore,4,"I have not taken a full online course at Castleton, however, this spring we transitioned to online courses and it was a quite smooth transition."
Junior,4,It was great! Professors were very on it and active! The professors are always willing to help you no matter what and are great when it comes to your needs! They are very nice and help keep you on track while learning a lot! Overall great experience how ever I prefer inverse learning.
Junior,4,Castleton is amazing! Food is not great though. The people are so nice and the campus is small yet beautiful. You know a lot of people however its to a bad thing!
Sophomore,4,It is what you make of it. If you don't have a car or know people that do you are stuck on campus because there isn't anything to do in the town. It is very small and you have to speak up for what you want. Though the school says they listen it is hard to have people of power listen to you unless you keep up with pushing it. If you play a sport then you will know a lot of people otherwise you will know other people in your major and in your grade well during orientation. I suggest joining the many different clubs we have there are a lot.
Freshman,4,"Overall, Castleton is a nice place to be. It is a nice small community. It is a great size for people that want something small, but not too small. Most professors are really personable and care."
Sophomore,4,"I really love castleton! I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to such a small campus, but  I ended up liking it so much. The people there are so nice and always willing to help you and be there for you. While the students are the same way. I made so many new friends so quickly, it was incredible. The food was great, the work load wasn't to bad either. Overall, I would recommend Castleton University"
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the campus, and the professors are very friendly in the math department. On campus there is free therapy sessions and a nurse. Food at the main dining hall is meh, but there is the fireside cafe and coffee cottage which are pretty good."
Senior,4,"Very friendly college, easy access to resources and professors. The university makes an effort to immerse all students in different experiences outside of their degree program."
Freshman,4,"I like the people here, the professors are great.   They really care about the students.  It's a small school in a small town so you get to recognize people and feel at home pretty quickly."
Junior,4,"Castleton is a small university, where you can become close with your professors. The professors want you to succeed and will help you in anyway possible.  Castleton has great athletic teams, and a variety of classes to choose from.  If you like to grow relationships and feel like family, Castleton is the right place for you."
Sophomore,4,I loved the small school with hard academics. The Professors get to you and take the time to help you succeed. The small classroom size helped me thrive as a student and truly fall in love with learning.
Alum,4,"Castleton is truly “the small university with a big heart”. In my time at Castleton, I had the opportunity to be part of the Spartan family in many ways. I graduated in the Spring of 2017 with a B.S. in Biology. The science department, like other departments, was a close-knit group. The small classroom sizes allowed each student to get the individual attention they needed to succeed. At Castleton, you’re not just a number, you’re a person. Professors know your name, have conversations with you, and even go to sporting events to show their support. 
Castleton offers numerous majors, athletics, and clubs, making it appealing to those who want to do it all."
Alum,4,"Castleton gave me an great college experience. I was able to participate in clubs, meet many friends, and build lasting relationships with my professors. I value the education I received at CU and the opportunities it gave me. It allowed me to reach my goal of getting into graduate school and receiving a graduate degree."
Alum,4,"Castleton is a wonderful school, especially if you're looking to be more than just a number. Class sizes are small and professors are always willing to meet and get to know students. If you are looking for a huge school with a crazy social scene and lots of bars and restaurants close by, this may not be the place for you. If you are looking for a lot of outdoor opportunities such as hiking, swimming, skiing; Castleton is perfect. The campus is small, quiet, and easy to navigate. Faculty and staff are kind and always willing to help. Overall a really wonderful school."
Freshman,4,"The classes are very small and so enjoyable to be in, and if your'e an athlete it is awesome to work around your schedule and spend a lot of time playing. The school is incredibly small and takes a total of 5 min to walk to our furthest class. There is nothing to do in a walking distance, you definitely need  a car to get to Rutland or to anything really. "
College Freshman,4,"I'm an international student, and this year there's 30 of us. There is not a whole lot of diversity on campus but we are all accepted and loved, and people are very curious about our countries and want to know more. Castleton is trying to raise the number of international students every year and I think that's an awesome idea."
College Freshman,4,"I am not an athlete, or a sports person for that matter, but some of my friends are and I only hear great things about athletics. The teams are very strongly bound and the school loves them. We all love attending the games and have a lot of Spartan pride! The facilities are great, and all the students are welcome to use them."
College Junior,4,I've never had a professor who is rude or disrespectful. They are all kind and care about their students
College Junior,4,"Castleton is a small school so employers who haven't heard of it or who farm from top tier schools may not hire, but anyone who knows Castleton professors or students would absolutely hire."
College Junior,4,I love living on campus. The rooms could be bigger but the suites have ample space and the balconies are great
College Freshman,4,very small and they have a greta phys ed department
College Sophomore,4,"Public Safety does a good job of making campus fairly safe. However, at night, some of the officers make it seem like it is a hassle to drive/walk you back to your dorm from South Street Lot. I haven't had any terrible experiences with Public Safety myself and I feel that they are doing a good job, but rarely I do hear negative statements about their service to students."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at Castleton are very involved physically. That being said, the students that play varsity athletics are sometimes not the most attentive in class. Granted, if I had practice at six in the morning, I probably wouldn't be too excited about going to class all day either. Overall, I think that there is more to be done in athletics in relation to academics, but there are also quite a few student athletes that have made Dean/President's list so that should be acknowledged too. I love my school and going to all of the games, whether they are football games, soccer, games, softball/baseball games, etc."
College Senior,4,"From what I know, and my experiences, Castleton has always handled safety concerns very seriously. It is a small campus that is easy to navigate, even for students off campus. Many times I have felt safe walking around the town at night, or to and from Castleton facilities."
College Senior,4,"Although I never actually lived on campus, I spent a lot of time visiting friends in dorms. I've always felt that Castleton dorms were very average for students, and there are a number of offerings for housing types. It is always good to provide students with options, be it sober housing, suites, singles or triples."
College Senior,4,Castleton has a lot to offer for student athletes. The student body is very invested in sports teams and their success.
College Freshman,4,"There isn't much crime or assault, so I feel safe on the campus."
College Freshman,4,"The nursing program will allow great job opportunity, not sure about any other majors though."
College Freshman,4,"Variety of sports, fun to attend!"
College Freshman,4,its cheap and the teachers dont suck
Recent Alumnus,4,It was very easy to navigate the application and admission process. I got an email and a phone call from a professor encouraging me to attend.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most students are involved in some kind of athletics. Athletes are some of the best students on campus.
College Freshman,4,"We are a division 3 school, but we still have great sports teams. I don't really follow it much though."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Castleton University are extremely high quality, and it is a huge part of campus life to attend games and events."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of services offered, as well as lighting around campus for night time walks. There are also emergency buttons around campus of someone is feeling threatened."
College Junior,4,"Although scholarships are not offered for sports, there is a lot of pride in our sports teams."
College Freshman,4,"Courses are pretty easy.  You can get by without studying, but what is the point of that?  Professors go way out of their way for their students, and they are all very nice.  There are so many courses to choose from, but it is pretty difficult to get into some.  Class size is pretty small, decent sized."
College Freshman,4,The quality of the career center and the career services on campus are great!
College Freshman,4,"I love it here. I love the people, I love the campus, I love all of the clubs and activities you can join also.  There is not much to do around here.  The town is pretty boring.  It is a big sports school, a lot of the people who attend Castleton, play sports.  The classes are generally pretty small, and the professors care a lot about all of the students."
College Sophomore,4,Many get find jobs after graduation
College Sophomore,4,Never had any serious issues. CAs were always great!
College Sophomore,4,Castleton is a great school to have something to get involved in. It's very easy to make friends and become close with professors.
College Freshman,4,Great environment! Great sense of community in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,"I find it very easy to talk to professors about anything regarding class, or even other topics relating to the school. My workload at the beginning of this semester was a lot to handle coming into the school. I had a lot of family problems going on at home this semester so I did miss a lot of classes and that hurt my grades but for the most part I was able to talk to my teachers and get the work in that I missed or receive the notes from classmates."
College Freshman,4,"I love the different options there are for courses at school; I am taking a course on Buddhism next semester and I absolutely cannot wait! The class sizes are great, except I don't do too well with lecture style classes. Some of my teachers make it hard to hear when sitting in the back of the room, I guess I just need to adjust myself and sit closer to the front of the room. Otherwise, class styles are pleasing and my overall experience with classes have been wonderful."
College Freshman,4,I LOVE THE HOUSING. I can not imagine being roomed with any other girl than my own roommate -- or my suite mates! I feel like I am really welcomed and its a great sense of community in my dorm.
College Freshman,4,"I am apart of the women's club basketball team and we are treated very fairly -- which is refreshing since we are not a varsity sport. I am an Exercise Science major therefore I spend a lot of time in the athletic facilities; they are very clean and up-to-date facilities. School spirit is something to talk about at Castleton. It's wonderful to see not only the students attending and interacting at the varsity sports games, but also the professors and other faculty members."
College Freshman,4,"I would most definitely choose Castleton again because I love how involved I feel. The professors are very approachable as are the other staff members around campus -- to me that is a huge part in whether or not I like the school. I also get along with my suite mates so that helps the overall experience; they're very supportive and if I'm not sure what to do about something, I can go to them to ask for help. Everything is very accessible at Castleton, for example if I have questions about classes or financial aid, I have always felt fulfilled with the assistance I'm given. I am very grateful to go to a small college with a big heart."
College Junior,4,"Castleton is a small, but great school! Everyone is really nice and are there to ensure you succeed. Really no complaints."
College Freshman,4,Castle University is great. It has what I need to pursue a career and its instate which means it cheaper. That's all I really need from a college.
College Senior,4,"Castleton University is amazing. The Professors are extremely knowledgeable and helpful, the campus is beautiful, and it has an overall excellent vibe. There is something here for absolutely everyone, from athletes to actors."
College Junior,4,Dorms are disgusting but education is high quality
Recent Alumnus,4,I lived off campus just near the college my last two years. I found a good deal pretty easily.
College Senior,4,Always super easy to do
College Sophomore,4,If you live in one of the newer dorms it is very neat and modern. I enjoyed the quality and cleanliness of my dorm while living on campus.
College Freshman,4,Athletics are good for the rating of the school (D3)
College Freshman,4,"Honestly, if you aren't doing a sport you're going to be bored out of your mind. The facilities are great, the overall rankings of the teams are getting better, most people/teammates are rude but nothing too difficult to deal with"
College Sophomore,4,Lots of choices..the option to create your own major
College Sophomore,4,"Very big sports school, from huge varsity sports to intramural basketball or club sports.. everyone's involved in something"
College Sophomore,4,I play varsity football here and I love it.  We have a new stadium and awesome locker rooms.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of weed and alcohol use mixed with some slight cocaine use.
College Junior,2,Have not seen information on Greek life but it does exist. They have a bad rep.
College Freshman,2,Landlords in the area aren't great from what I've heard. Very expensive. No covered parking.
College Freshman,2,No one is helpful and the resources are minimal and the school isn't great at helping you out.
College Freshman,2,"Everything is disgusting. I threw up multiple times from Huden food, so I basically starved myself because even if I had food in my room, the common room microwave is always broken so snacks were my life. Fireside is pretty good though you aren't given enough points or meal exchanges."
College Freshman,2,The school has no money so they don't give out many scholarships
College Freshman,2,Everyone is stupid including the professors.
College Freshman,2,I ended up having to take an ambulance to the emergency room one day and no one from the wellness center came in the 30 minutes before the ambulance came to pick me up. Also Rutland ER is terrible.
College Junior,2,Public safety is a joke. Most of them let the idea of power go to their head but luckily none of them are particularly smart or in shape meaning it's quite easy to out smart them and even easier to out run if need be.
College Sophomore,2,This school doesn't give much for financial aid at all.  Unless your family is dirt poor or you live instate you will be paying a lot.
College Sophomore,2,There is almost no diversity on our campus and a lot of the ethnic groups tend to stay together and form bonds.
College Sophomore,2,Even though I will be living off campus next year it is very expensive and most rental units are owned by the same person.  It absolutely gouges the students.
College Student,2,I did not get any aid
College Sophomore,2,Huden is terrible! Go to fireside if you want food!
College Sophomore,2,I live off campus and I love it much more than the dorms
College Sophomore,2,It's in the middle of nowhere
College Sophomore,2,There aren't a lot of off campus options other than the blue cat and the diner
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one or two sororities on campus and a frat I think. They don't really do anything that I know of, so there's not a huge effect on the social scene."
College Sophomore,2,"You're safe as long as you don't go off campus to the hockey house, you'll get roofied."
College Sophomore,2,There's not a lot of diversity at Castleton.
College Sophomore,2,nt that bad but also i dont live on campus so i really dont know
College Senior,2,Mostly overcast with snow and ice
College Senior,2,Only a small handful of off campus restaurants
College Senior,2,Only one dinning hall but was worse before
College Senior,2,One of the two bars in town closed so no options
College Senior,2,Ratio is in favor of more guys
College Senior,2,It is common to hear students discussing drug use
College Freshman,2,We do not really have transportation.
College Freshman,2,You have to travel to get to a resturant.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much, people mostly walk or car pool. but the college does have a nice anti-drinking and driving program that is called save ride"
College Sophomore,2,Very little diversity. I am one of the diversity to the campus. Everyone is very accepting. 
College Sophomore,2,"There is really nothing to do, unless you are 21 because then you can go to local bars and hangout. The town is really nice, but nothing to do. If we have to buy something we usually go out to Rutland, which is a 40 minute drive from Castleton (where I am).  "
College Sophomore,2,There are places in rutland to eat but only a couple in castleton. There is one pizza place in castleton that tastes pretty good and another one that delivers close by. 
College Sophomore,2,"Standard clothing choice for both guys and girls are typically castleton sweatpants, sweatshirt and some sort of moccasin or sandal, not all that attractive
"
College Sophomore,2,Off campus dining consist of a very poor quality diner.
College Senior,2,Castleton didn't really seem to provide scholarships to students.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a couple sororities and frats, but they are more like clubs that organize events and sometimes parties at a local resturant/party spot"
College Freshman,2,As a psych major there are a ton of intro classes but lack of classes after intro... either fill up too quickly or can't fit it into your schedule
College Junior,2,"The places in town are not bad, Fishtail is great for wings but there is not much variety even if you drive out to Rutland. There is no mexican, indian, no pizza delivery in Castleton, and the restaurants in Castleton are all burger and beer places."
College Junior,2,"The biggest focus of our schools athletics is football, personally my least favorite of our American sports and our team is pretty terrible. The school has dumped millions into a program that should only really be at a large school that already has the space and education to back up such a large undertaking. Other sports are actually very good though, our ski team has multiple olympians/olympic hopefuls, our basketball teams both went deep into their tournaments this year, our lacrosse teams may not be amazing but are very entertaining. Intramural sports are pretty fun too, although could be improved if played on fields a little closer to full size. Half of a basketball court is pretty small for a soccer field."
Senior,1,"Don't go here if the following applys to you. Your a single parent, a parent, you took nursing classes out of order, you can't handle discrimination or being called vulgar names by the nursing staff for no reason (countless reports make no difference only when one of their staff members faces charges), if you have an inflexable schedule, you want to take summer classes or desire to take online classes. Expect zero sympathy and to be looked at as a dollar sign. A small college with no heart.  In fact one nursing professor gave a coarse on compassion then bashed all her patients and some of the students. They are behind on the times. One advisors laughed at me when I asked as a sr. If I could take classes over the summer. He said tough luck they dont offer those classes only on their campus and no they won't work then. If you want to graduate you have a better chance at another University."
College Junior,1,We have no organized Greek life
College Freshman,1,"The school does not actually acknowledge the ""greek life"" around the school. There is no official greek life. It's literally like five or six guys living in a random house, and the same is for the sorority. I don't know why they actually call themselves fraternities and sororities, because the campus is too small to really even have greek life to begin with."
College Freshman,1,Our university is too small to ever have a Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,SUCKS. On campus parties get shut down really quickly and the town is small so people hear about everything happening and then the off campus parties get so big that the cops show up basically every time.
College Freshman,1,"I hated this school from the day I set foot on it, the only reason I went was because I got a lot of money to go there. But it wasn't worth a single penny of it all, so I am transferring. Don't go here, I promise you, you will regret it. Half the people are friendly, the professors are stupid, the food is terrible, no one is friendly in the dorms, and there is nothing to do on or off campus. Plus maybe 5% of the student population is attractive. The only bonuses to this school is Hoff and Castleton  Halls, the athletic facilities, and the scenery. That's it. I would HIGHLY recommend NEVER going here."
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do here! The school is too cheap to provide and sort of entertainment and there are no real fun places to hang out on or off campus.
College Freshman,1,"This school is full of idiots, even the professors. I guess if you want an easy A come to this school, but it is way too easy."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do, I'm not exaggerating and the school provides practically nothing."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any Greek Life
College Junior,1,There is none. Some guys might try to say they're in a frat to get you to come to their house where you will most likely be drugged and raped.
College Junior,1,There is nothing. That's not an exaggeration. Most students kick rocks to pass the time.
College Sophomore,1,"My school is not great at helping with financial aid. You have to be there and really have a problem for them to help you. It is a hassle and I hate going through it. Now that everything is online it made it even harder because there is no room for any mistake. I need financial aid because without it I can't pay everything myself, so I have to deal with it.  "
College Sophomore,1,I have over been here for two years and it is getting worst and worst. There is no nightlife
College Sophomore,1,VERY few. could list non Caucasian students on my hands and toes.
College Sophomore,1,Absolutely nothing to do unless you love to hang out with friends to smoke and drink. This college is a serious party school. It is a school that jocks go to and big sports fans. business majors and sports admin majors are the vast majority of students. We do have a great nursing and education program however there is just too much partying and nothing else to do off campus unless you want to drive 15 miles to rutland to eat or go to the movies or bowl.
College Sophomore,1,There is two frats and you barely know that we have them. The sports teams are more like frats then the actual frat
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't any. They have something called ""The Bus"" which takes students from Castleton to Rutland and such. Honestly, I have never seen this so called bus before. If you don't have a car on campus you are trapped here because getting a taxi is super expensive and really hard to do. They also have no public transportation here. If you plan on coming to this college with no car....be warned that you will be bored out of your mind a majority of the time. Seriously, don't come here without a car...it SUCKS."
College Freshman,1,A lot of the parking is reserved for teachers and is poorly marked. They will give you a warning the first time you park in the wrong spot and after that you will get a 50 dollar fine. This school will do anything for money it seems. They have an over-flow parking lot which is about a five minute walk from campus but would be SUPER sketchy to walk back from at night time. The parking lots are poorly lit and are plain creepy at night time.

Niche User,5,"Life changing experience for my first gen Hispanic godson.  He found his footing on campus right away aided by the department of Equity and Inclusion.  Academically he's challenged, made life long friends and is currently applying for internships knowing that his experience at Bates will be a factor in his success.  Oh, and as advertised, the food is amazing!"
Niche User,5,All classes on campus were conducted in person but the semester was halved and courses taken two at a time to limit student interactions
Sophomore,5,"I love Bates. Everyone on campus is encouraged to take part in a little bit of everything. The students are all down to earth, welcoming, and intelligent. The professors are always helpful and will get to know who you are within your first week of the semester. Almost all athletes are also apart of different clubs and volunteer positions on campus. Parties are fun, not overwhelming, and generally easy to get into. It is encouraged to do something to make a difference while attending Bates. I truly believe the college has made me a more well rounded student athlete. I am able to go out on the weekends, take academics seriously, and compete in my sport. It is definitely work hard play hard, but I have walked away with one of the best educations, best friends, and greatest memories."
Freshman,5,"Academics are great the college helps students prepare for their desire future. A great supportive community, there are no cliques.A supportive community for pro-environment. Get to know your professors very well."
Junior,5,"I genuinely love to think of Bates as a home. Not only are the academics and professors superb, but the students are the most supportive individuals who value camaraderie and community engagement. Batesies are the friendliest humans out there which produces a pretty special network both during and after your four years. Bates excels in every aspect; however, like all predominantly-white institutions, admissions does continue to work on diversity. Also, the surrounding area is only average, but downtown Portland (45 min away) and the beaches along the coast make up for the lack of things to do in Lewiston. It also allows for so much to happen on campus. Overall, this school has proven itself to provide an incredible academic and social experience, and everyone likes to think of it as its “home away from home.”"
Freshman,5,"It truly is worth the while. Everyone is incredibly kind to each other and making friends was easy. The environment is academically rigorous, but not at all competitive. Both professors and other students want you to succeed. I've had good experiences with my professors so far and I'm excited to what else this school can offer!"
Niche User,5,"My son, a minority student. loves Bates for the sense of close community and for the strong connections he's made with various professors.  He received an internship at an investment bank in New York his freshman year, an opportunity he became aware of through the Center for Purposeful Work.  Bates is providing a transformational experience for him."
Senior,5,"Bates is a school full of people who care about you. Professors are sincerely invested in the success of their students, and will go out of their way to help you. Students also care about other students. Academics are very important and people try hard, but there is literally no hint of a competitive atmosphere. We just want everyone to succeed, which I love.
There is no ""type"" of Bates student, except friendly."
Junior,5,"Everyone will tell you this but it's true- the people make Bates a special place! The students, professors, and faculty give the school a unique quality that makes your time here truly invaluable. Whenever I am away from Bates for too long, I find myself yearning to be back on campus, back home. The thirst for change and the passion for diversity, community engagement, and social justice create a vibrant atmosphere that is exciting to be a part of. There's never a shortage of things to be involved in! Even with little to no idea about what I want to do with my life, I am confident that when I leave Bates I will be able to draw on what I've learned to craft a meaningful career. Yeah, there may not be much to do in Lewiston, but make sure to get out and explore the rest of Maine! Skiing, hiking, surfing, biking, running, canoeing, .... all can be found within an hour of Bates."
Senior,5,"Bates, at first, was a culture shock for me. Coming from Houston, a school of 2,000 majority rich, white students seemed overwhelming to handle, but when I arrived, I found an amazingly supportive community that was open and accepting to students of all backgrounds. Both the academic and student community were intellectually stimulating, collaborative, and open, and I found myself a community that I felt at home with. Though diversity could be better, food options could be more culturally appropriate, winters could be nicer and less conducive of seasonal depression, and student life could be less insular, Bates has been an amazing experience, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. The opportunities that Bates has granted me are simply incomparable to any other institution and I am grateful that I can translate my experience to the real world."
Alum,5,"I loved Bates. After having a close knit high school experience that emphasized camaraderie and empathy, Bates was the perfect environment to continue with this philosophy on a larger, more diverse scale. The professors genuinely care about you and really stress the critical thinking that is the hallmark of the liberal arts education. I would recommend Bates to any students who are both outgoing and introspective, well-rounded, and empathetic."
Alum,5,"I had the best experience at Bates. The student body is intellectually curious yet super down to earth, professors are always accessible (many of whom I am still close with over a decade later), coursework/the pre-med committee is challenging but prepared me well for medical school, Maine is beautiful with great skiing and hiking nearby, and there are a bunch of really good restaurants in Lewiston with Portland only a 1/2 hour away. I met some of my best friends at Bates and had an absolute blast!"
Junior,5,"My experience at Bates has been incredible. Obviously, there are going to be negative things about any college. However, I believe that the academic rigor, commitment of the professors and faculty, and the passion and community of the students are what sets Bates apart from other institutions."
Alum,5,"I cannot imagine a better college experience. Bates challenged me to grow academically and as a person. The close-knit collegial environment is unmatched, and the friends I made at Bates are the most important people in my life. I feel lucky to have ended up at Bates -- even though I have graduated, it will always be my home."
Senior,5,Attending Bates has been an incredible experience for me for the past 4 years. I have made lifelong friendships and invaluable bonds with professors that I don't think I would have found at just any school.
Senior,5,"My experience at Bates has been exceptional. The faculty and staff make students their number one priority, fostering a safe and supportive community. As a small but elite college, students have the opportunity to be exposed to top scholarship and immerse themselves in it in ways only small school allow with various research assistantships, fellowships, and internships. In addition, students at Bates are incredibly kind, making most students feel welcomed upon arrival."
Freshman,5,"I loved the environment and the people! The campus is beautiful, and the school is so deeply routed in tradition. It has been such a positive addition to my life."
Alum,5,"I graduated 5 years ago, and Bates is still my favorite place in the world. It isn't for everyone--it is small; intense, both socially and academically; and in a cold climate--but the school has shaped and inspired me in ways that I could have never expected. I also loved Lewiston, even though many people don't, because of how diverse the demographic is, how great the food is, and how many activities it offers for service-learning and getting involved."
Junior,5,Bates is an amazing place filled with so many wonderful people and unique opportunities! I have loved every minute I've spent at Bates :-)
Senior,5,"My experience at Bates has been wonderful! The relationships I've formed with my professors over the years have been so rewarding, especially in comparison to my friends at other schools. The student body is so incredibly friendly and the people on campus clearly want to be here. Bates is a perfect place to explore new interests, unleash academic potential, and make lifelong connections. I couldn't be more pleased with my experience."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful academic experience. Two really awesome and unique resources at Bates for academics is PALS (Peer Assistant Learning tutors) who hold weekly review sessions and make practice worksheets for intro science classes. Also, ARC (Academic Resource Commons) is an area of the library that has free tutors and writing advisors available for assistance 11am-10pm every day. There's always someone to help and answer my questions which is crucial. Really helpful people and kids at Bates are SO friendly and supportive."
Sophomore,5,"Bates has something for everyone, Maine is a beautiful state, and professors genuinely care about the well-being and success of their students."
Sophomore,5,"Bates is always very busy. There is so much going on in terms of sports, classes, and events that there is always something to do if you want to. The professors are amazing, and the level of attention and devotion they show to us students makes me feel incredibly lucky to be here. Most importantly, the mindset of the student body is one of action, striving to improve the college in whatever flaws they may see and being vocal on issues that matter to them. But it is also an atmosphere of welcoming acceptance and community, which makes every day at school a real treasure. I will never forget this college experience."
Alum,5,Bates College was a warm and welcoming environment where I grew as a caring human-being. I learned to question and seek answers to troubling problems and work with my peers through thought provoking questions. Bates College offered a challenging environment to learn and grow as a young adult.
Junior,5,"Bates College is an excellent institution of higher learning. Top notch academics, a plethora of extracurricular activities, and a terrific faculty are just a few of the things that make Bates an elite college. One of its most fundamental and  defining aspects, however, is its sense of community. Bates is a relatively small college, and with that comes a sense of closeness between students, faculty, and staff that's not typically found on a lot of campuses. If there's one thing that could be improved upon, it would be more opportunities for students to engage in dialogues with the administration to ensure that their voices are heard. Other than that, Bates is a fine institution that truly shines among the rest."
Freshman,5,"Bates is a great school, the teachers are engaging and you're going to have close relations to them. The social life on campus is cool there's almost always a dance or concert happening every weekend, recently Lewiston police have been cracking down on off-campus parties so there's drinking than before but it is definitely still on campus. Its been said the police are cracking down on drinking this year but it'll go back to being a better party scene next year. Lewiston is meh it's not amazing and there's like 2 to 4 good restaurants in Lewiston and you have to taxi or drive to Auburn if you want to do anything fun like see a movie, but the campus is really nice and I often find that I'm fine being on campus. Dorms are huge and there's plenty of nice amenities for students. The diversity could be better but everyone is pretty liberal and open-minded and there's a lot of visible movements and clubs on campus that do a lot of diversity-related activities."
Freshman,5,"So far, Bates is everything I hoped it would be. My dorm s nice, the food is great and the people are really friendly and welcoming. My professors have been really great about helping us first years transition into college life and I really love having only four classes to focus on. Truly, Bates is an amazing (and affordable) place."
Sophomore,5,"I think that Bates gives students the freedom to be whatever they want to be, so long as they work hard to become whatever that is. They've always stood by that creed. The food is amazing, and so are campus culture and the studies. The one downside is probably Maine's sketchiest city surrounding the campus, but Lewiston's not actually that bad compared to the image it has throughout the rest of the state. Bates undergrad is still comparable to that of Bowdoin, Colby, and the rest of the NESCAC schools, despite its relatively low endowment (around 1/3 of Colby's and 1/5 of Bowdoin's)."
Junior,5,"Students are serious but totally sportive, kind and friendly. School spirit is strong for athletics and other activities. Parties are numerous and welcoming and all about socializing - the point is not getting too smashed - so nothing too crazy. Dorms provide consistently good living choices with some truly excellent ones. Food is the best! Campus is seriously beautiful. Lewiston is a small city and past it's glory days but not without its charms, some really good restaurants, and intern opportunities. The real advantage of our location is being surrounded by beautiful countryside including both beach and mountains. Shoppers have Portland and Freeport nearby - but no one wants to leave campus often - it's a driven yet fun and exciting community where students look out for and appreciate each other. We know how lucky we are everyday to call this place home."
Freshman,5,"I love the mix of people here. There are outdoorsy types, hipsters, nerds, jocks, preppies, and everyone in between. I have met a lot of really nice international students, and students from all over the US. People are friendly and they care about their work, both professors and students. I like being around people are serious about getting an education, but who also want to have fun. No one is pretentious. There are so many talented people too, really good musicians and artists. This school does a great job of having a good mix of people."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a wonderful experience at Bates. I have found that classes are engaging, professors and classmates are passionate and welcoming, and the community at Bates is endlessly warm and inclusive."
Junior,5,"The community is one of the absolute best things about Bates. Because the student body is so small, everyone on campus can grow together as a whole family, without ever having to worry too extensively about exclusive groups or social cliques. Bates also does a great job of attracting friendly and passionate individuals, which fosters a climate of communal pushes for academic success and achievement across campus. Also, the food is fantastic!!"
Sophomore,5,Everything is very accessible and easy to find. The scholarships that niche provides are great as well. 
College Sophomore,5,"Workload is heavy and starts right away. Professors are great and easy to see. Help in the labs is really great, especially the writing lab and math lab."
College Sophomore,5,I see what goes on as moderate with little to no excess.
College Sophomore,5,I had no issues this past summer finding a high paying internship. I would say most if not all had the same experience.
College Sophomore,5,It is everything I wanted. Really not much to say other than I love this place and I love being in Maine.
College Sophomore,5,"Very engaged with students. Bates students are very fit and healthy. Food is healthy and Bates students work out quite a bit. They campus is very safe, the town has very low crime and I am not aware of any issues."
College Sophomore,5,Highly varied from traditional to theme houses to suites to brand new 55/65 College Avenue residences. These new residences are the best of any school in the Northeast.
College Sophomore,5,"The athletic conference is great, has many rivalries and student participation in varsity sports is very high, close to 40%. Club sports are very popular as well. Sports in a very healthy way are integral to Bates."
College Sophomore,5,"This is a great place, seriously great. Freshman year had early obstacles, mostly dealing with the workload but I adjusted well.  This school is a friendly and supportive place with great teachers and great, friendly and socially-engaged students. The facilities, housing and food are also great. It was a standout for me compared to peer schools in the Northeast."
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. The Bates Security is made up of a team of very great people who we know personally and respect. Sometimes they break parties on campus from noise complaints of neighbours. 

EMS does an excellent job in assisting students in an emergency, often from alcohol consumption.

We have a Green Dot certification program with the aim to increase awareness and to minimise sexual assault and abusive behaviour on campus. 

Bates policy respects the privacy of the students, since while Security can check the rooms,  they cannot enter without permission if the door is closed.

Bates Security has very close ties with Lewiston police. Bates ensures we have good relationships with the police by having policemen many times dining in Commons in a very friendly atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,"The Career and Development Center is very helpful. It has its own mail newsletter regarding events regarding job opportunities and info sessions. They hold very close ties with alumni in companies and various fields, thus expanding on the excellent Bates Alumni Network.

They prepare students with Resume and Cover Letters, Linked In profiles and mock interviews.

BCDC not long ago introduced Handshake. A very sophisticated portal where students can apply to on and off-campus jobs and internships, get invited to career-oriented events and more."
College Freshman,5,"The professors have the very rich background and very respected. Most of them have very friendly relationships with students. Students use office hours to drop in at their office for questions and sometimes even other times. 

Courses are very clearly structured about the grading and the assignments. 

Most students dress very casual for classes where others tend to wear more preppy clothes. 

Introductory courses are much larger than upper-level classes but still make it possible for the professor to know everyone in the class individually."
College Freshman,5,"All of the residence buildings for students are very well maintained and cleaned. The dorms compared to other Universities are very spacious. 

As a first year, you are required to live with at least another student (max 4 in the room) except specific personal reasons.

There are many advances in housing, new dorms will be ready for Fall semester 2016. Smith is also being renovated from 4 student rooms to 2 singles. 

From the end of Freshman to Senior year, there is a very exciting application process for housing. 

Many students apply for block housing and suites of 3, 4 or 6. Best other options are singles and houses on Frye Street and College Street."
College Freshman,5,"Bates has a very active and athletic student body. A big percentage of students are in varsity teams and many in club teams. Intramurals are very attractive to many because of how much fun they are (almost never taken that seriously). 

Bates is a DIII school and competes in the NESCAC conference. However, it offers a DI program in Alpine/Nordic Skiing and Squash. 

Garcelon field hosts football, soccer, and lacrosse games which also attracts the most fans. Especially in big games with rival schools like Colby and Bowdoin, the main stands get filled with students and there is lots of school spirit. 

Many athletes live in off-campus houses with their teams where also most of the parties happen. 

Go Bobcats!"
College Freshman,5,"Bates is a unique College. There is a very friendly, accepting and very social atmosphere on our beautiful campus. The academics are very rigorous but, the strong ties with professors and the vast amount of help resources we have, allows us to accomplish any of our endeavours. 

Maine is amazing, there are a lot of opportunities for hiking, skiing, climbing etc. 

Students are able to embrace nature and appreciate its beauty

There are so many fun student-run clubs to join where everyone is very supportive and easy going. 

I love how most of the students are very aware of the global problems and thus many are involved in community engagement work and volunteering."
College Freshman,5,"You don't have to go out to have a good time but if you do, you usually don't regret it.  Cool people to meet and some great events.  To find it, you usually have to go to a house or be invited to a dorm room that's going up."
College Freshman,5,Challenging but you really learn a lot. Professors know a lot and are always there to help. You'll get a lot out of your program.
College Freshman,5,"Everything is pretty great.  People are smart, healthy and friendly.  Classes are hard but worthwhile."
College Freshman,5,The degree from Bates will get you places but you still have to take initiative.
College Freshman,5,Good options to pick from.  Also two new dorms being built!
College Freshman,5,"Bates a very unique place.  I don't think I could have gone anywhere else that has such a friendly, intelligent and accepting community.  The academics and workload can be challenging but rewarding and every class seems meaningful.  The campus is also great looks beautiful.  Being an athlete, there is not a huge amount of resources put into athletics compared to other programs but there still is a good amount of luxury for an athlete and all teams work hard and put out a showing.  Especially the rowing teams.  Love this place."
College Sophomore,5,"Smith was an overcrowded pit, but this is its final year before a major renovation that will turn the current quads into doubles. Two brand new dorms going up. 280's great (I lived there sophomore year) but I also love the Fry St. houses."
College Sophomore,5,Very easy to be involved in sports even if you're not a varsity type. Lots of club and intramural sports.
College Sophomore,5,"Lewiston isn't a pretty city, but it's much safer than most cities."
College Sophomore,5,Purposeful Work program provides an internship or research job for every student. Great career services.
College Sophomore,5,"Love everything about Bates. Okay, maybe except the weather in February if you're not a skier. The people, professors, student life, and the FOOD are all fantastic."
College Freshman,5,A lot of cool parties.
College Freshman,5,A lot of options to socialize.
Sophomore,4,"I am a huge proponent of Bates College! Bates has extraordinary dining (serving anything ranging from grilled cheese to teriyaki tofu), beautiful brick buildings, an open quad that people use to chat and play lawn games in,  a pond with outdoor seating and wildlife, and a couple of stunning athletic fields. The real magic is in the people on campus however, everyone is friendly, accepting, and passionate about their studies, sports, hobbies, or any other sort of extracurriculars. Even with this hard-work mentality, there are plenty of clubs, organized activities, and areas off campus to have fun with your friends. There's even a ski mountain close by!"
Sophomore,4,"Bates College has permitted students to come back this fall, so I am currently on campus to take classes and go about my usual routine. Of course, there are restrictions with the COVID-19 pandemic at hand including mask wearing, grab-and-go dining, socially distance sports practices, etc. However, I have been able to be in person for my classes with a mask on which allows me to experience (somewhat) of what it is like during a normal year. Since there are kids that are at home, most of the assignments have been online and may include zoom lectures."
Alum,4,"Despite obvious challenges, my professors worked hard to ensure that students were able to stay engaged and feel supported."
Alum,4,Professors and instructors demonstrated care for their students in their online experience and made every effort to ensure that the online experience was equivalent to the classroom experience.
Alum,4,An incredibly competitive Liberal Arts college that prioritizes critical thinking and challenging the status quo.
Sophomore,4,Online learning has been tough but only because I do not retain material unless I am in an interactive environment. The professors understand this and have all been accommodating.
Freshman,4,"So far, I have enjoyed the social life at Bates. Most people are friendly, the professors are caring and are always there to help. I like the small class sizes for certain classes."
Niche User,4,"i haven't been to bates, but from the reviews, it's a good school. the people commenting on the party scene are so stupid... IT'S COLLEGE. NOT 'go get drunk' NIGHTS"
Senior,4,"Bates has an incredibly supportive and tight-knit community of students, faculty, and staff. The resources for student support on campus are incredible and there's always someone to help and offer advice no matter the situation. The food in commons is always great, but if you're not feeling anything at the vegan bar or brick oven, there's always 30+ types of cereal to choose from on a daily basis. Winter semester can be a little tough, as the temps are freezing and the sun sets by 4pm, so it can be tough to find energy and motivation during the latter portion of the days. However, Reslife and health services/CAPS offer tons of support. Plus, once short term and the spring comes around it all becomes worth it. Overall, my experience at Bates has been an invaluable one and I'm so grateful for the way Bates prepared me for life and work post-graduation."
Junior,4,"Bates provides a close-knit community, where the student body truly feels support from their peers and professors."
Niche User,4,"Looking at schools to continue with football at the collegiate level. Bates has a nice campus which is a bit of an oasis, since Lewiston isn’t really a town I see myself happy in. Obviously the academics are the draw here."
Senior,4,"Bates is a great college with a warm community. Most students are down-to-earth, hardworking, and witty. Fun traditions like Puddle Jump, 80s Dance, and late night breakfasts.

Hidden gem: Location in Lewiston, ME -- an old mill town with a growing number of East African immigrants. Lends itself to many amazing opportunities outside the classroom. Students get involved in local politics, schools programs, community centers, and small enterprises. Something you won't get in a quainter tourist-y college town.
Pros: Student-professor relationships; record producer of Fulbright students, community-engagement opportunities, funding for summer internships, campus life events, students are supportive & not competitive.
Cons: Lacks racial & socioeconomic diversity. Traveling out of state and outside of New England can be inconvenient/expensive. Party scene is limited/security is very strict. Campus culture is socially/politically liberal but not very alternative or radical."
Freshman,4,"Great school with amazing academics and great professors. There are a ton of resources for freshman; a social advisor, academic advisor, Junior Advisor and much more. Athletics at Bates are very good, but it can feel like a very jock-y place but there is also a good amount of mixing between athletes and non-athletes. The gyms can feel a little old. 

The surrounding area is a little rough and it can be hard to find things to do unless you really seek them out. There are a few really good places like Forage Market and Fuel and some other hidden gems around. There are quite a few good hikes around the area, usually an hour away or so. It's really nice to have a car on campus although parking is tight.

Bates is a really great place that does have its downsides as well, like all colleges. It is really what you make of it; who you spend time with and what you choose to get involved in!"
Sophomore,4,I am beyond happy with my experience at Bates. I couldn't have asked for a more friendly and welcoming environment. Really one of the only things that I've found a little difficult are the academic requirements because they have limited my course selection due to lack of room.
Sophomore,4,"The campus and the college itself are great, other than the lack of diversity. However, the location isn't prime, as there's no much to do outside the campus community, unless you have a car and are able to drive to other places. Also, it's Maine so the winters can be very long, cold, and gloomy. But, you already knew that because it's Maine!"
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful. The food is surprisingly diverse and not bad for a small school, especially the cool vegan bar. The classes and the professors are amazing and very helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Bates College is one of my favorite places in the world. Everything from the beautiful campus to the wonderful academics to the amazingly inclusive and tight knit student body. The professors are really engaged in their subjects and will do their best to make every student as successful as possible. The administration tries to work with the students and act on things that will benefit everyone at Bates and everyone coming in the future. Students are engaged about learning, and are also involved in clubs and committees, a capella groups and sports teams. The community environment at Bates is second to none. As a student at Bates, you always feel like you have a family and are included in everything they do."
Junior,4,"The best part about Bates is the tight-knit society that it promotes. Throughout the semester there are a lot of events that encourages students to get out of their comfort zone and try something new. The one thing about Bates can improve on is increasing diversity amongst student population. Although in the past three years they have increased diversity, but there are still room for improvement."
Junior,4,"Bates College has been extremely fulfilling for me academically. I feel deeply connected to my professors and I cherish the unique intellectual opportunities that you can't find at many other undergraduate institutions. For instance, as a junior in college, I am going to be published in my professor's book about U.S. public education and the Somali refugee student population."
Sophomore,4,"Bates is overall a great place to attend college. It has many of the quintessential aspects of a liberal arts school-a politically and socially engaged student body, excellent faculty who are willing to help out with anything you need, and small classes. Lewiston is given a worse rap than it should have, given the number of awesome volunteer opportunities available and restaurants nearby. On campus, the food at Bates is awesome, and definitely better than Bowdoin's despite their better rankings. 
My main complaint is about social life. While Bates does a great job of getting students involved on campus during the week, the school doesn't have enough events for the student body to attend on the weekends. There are a few awesome dances, and a great formal, but I feel that there could be more. Additionally, security is abound and shuts down student parties pretty immediately."
Junior,4,I love Bates. This is a great place with phenomenal teachers and a wonderful community of students. The fact that we only have one dining hall also adds to the familial feeling that I have being here. Every night is family dinner!
College Freshman,4,The professors are all really nice and offer their help all the time.  The material is difficult but there are a lot of opportunities to receive help.
College Freshman,4,Got in a brand new dorm which is really nice. The other dorms are alright and I wouldn't mind living in any of them.
College Freshman,4,All sports teams are cool and don't only hong with each other.
College Freshman,4,I'm having a lot of fun here. The people are great and everyone is really friendly. I am able to do all my work and have a GREAT time on weekends.
College Sophomore,4,Healthy levels of partying. Nothing extreme.
College Sophomore,4,Parties are moderate and social. Nothing extreme.
College Sophomore,4,I think New England schools are becoming more diverse but you can't expect schools this far from majors cities to be as diverse as others. It really doesn't matter though because we all get along and have fun.
College Sophomore,4,From what I hear (because I havent started searching for jobs yet or looking at the BCDC) that the oppourtunites made for Batesies are large and plentiful.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've had only good experiences at this school."
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on campus wherever I go and I am a female.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is nice because you have so many options, from dorms to houses."
College Sophomore,4,I really like how engaged everyone (from the students to the professors) are in their classes. Everyone wants to make intellectual contributions to classes so the lectures are often interesting and thought provoking
College Freshman,4,Always have a pretty good time.  Almost always on weekends but is usually pretty inclusive and is a good unwinder after hard week.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus.  Everyone is looking out for each other.
College Freshman,4,Athletics are great.  Coaches are good and so are the staff.  The facilities could be a little better but they do there job great.  Varsity athletes get a little more privilege than non-varsity athletes. All teams put in a huge effort and show well on game/race day.  Our rowing team is one of the best D3.
College Freshman,4,I haven't heard much about people feeling unsafe or having being victims of sexual assaults.
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a Freshman, but have heard good things about this."
College Freshman,4,They have really diverse courses and professors are really helpful. It's hard to get the best classes when you're a Freshman.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Parker Hall and even though it's an old building, it's pretty clean and things function pretty neatly."
College Junior,4,"Going to Bates has had its ups and downs, but none of those downs were particularly personal to Bates. Overall, it's a fantastic school: amazing academics, available, supportive, and intelligent  professors, a huge amount of school spirit, and truly wonderful people. You just have to be committed to seeking out all of these things, and you will find them very easily. Bates definitely values the student who comes to Bates looking to get the most out of it in all realms."
College Freshman,4,There are tons of great places nearby - they just don't always deliver and can be a little expensive for the average college student.
College Freshman,4,"Off-campus are where a ton of the best parties happen, they're generally pretty nice and accessible to students."
College Freshman,4,"There are usually good parties every weekend if you're looking for them, but at the same time the party scene is far from overbearing, so you can easily spend a weekend in without trouble."
College Freshman,4,"Aside from the occasional off-campus senior, on-campus is the only way to go for most Bates students. Almost all freshman live in your average college dorm, and after that, sophomores and older either continue to live in such rooms or in houses or suites. Freshman are given roommates based on a survey; sophomores and up go through the housing lottery or apply for theme housing."
College Freshman,4,"For varsity, intramural, or Sunday athletes, bates offers a lot of options for where to work out, practice or just have good time with your friends."
College Freshman,4,"As with other NESCACs, there can always be improvements in diversity, especially in terms of socioeconomic status. However, coming from a fairly diverse area, I am fairly happy with what is present. The numbers of POCs, first gen, etc keep getting better and better with each new incoming class- all the seniors agree that Bates is much more diverse now than when they were freshman. The LGBTQ+ community isn't too visible but is growing more prominent with each new year. In terms of political views, most people are either liberal or apathetic. Generally most people aren't too religious but the various religious clubs on campus hold many events which are open to the whole campus."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of great restaurants to choose from- the most popular include Mother India, Orchid, Forage, and Pure Thai. Costs are generally reasonable and most of these places have deals for Batesies. It would be perfect if, like the center of Lewiston, these places were closer to campus."
College Freshman,4,"It's a very extroverted school- sometimes if you aren't the most outgoing person, you can feel as if you're left behind. But it's completely ok; everyone finds their niche eventually and you'll settle in just fine. Otherwise I haven't been here long enough to accurately reflect on my overall experience. I will say that your experience will depend completely on you. It's very easy to isolate yourself with just work and friends. But if you reach out of your comfort zone, you'll learn so much and meet a ton of awesome people! I can say I've definitely become more knowledgable about social issues and more comfortable with myself since coming to Bates. Yeah we're an isolated small college in Maine- but there's so much under the surface."
College Freshman,4,"There's been some controversy in the beginning of the year with the cancelation of a popular drinking event. The student backlash to this decision however has forced the administration to reconsider its policies and sponsor some new late night alternatives in the meantime. I don't know where this whole episode will go, but it's nice to know that the students can unite if necessary. 

As for the people themselves, the various deans are always accessible and wiling to help out. I know two of them personally, they're that friendly."
College Freshman,4,"Fridays are usually for more intimate get togethers with your friends- nothing too big. Saturdays, on the other hand, can be all-night ragers. These can range from dorm parties to cool house parties. Especially when there's a themed dance that weekend, it can get crazy. Some nights can be more fun than others- it usually depends on who you know, what else is happening that weekend, etc."
College Freshman,4,"Not really sure about off-campus housing because I'm a freshman, but I hear it's pretty good"
College Freshman,4,"Student participation, School spirit, coaches, fan involvement, team performance- all excellent.  Bates is an extremely sporty campus- almost everyone participates in sports to some extent. 

However, the athletic facilities are less than sub-par.  Example: I am a varsity track athlete and have been injured with a stress fracture. Every day, I need to cross-train. My coach's (and my) preferred choice would be swimming, but the pool hours are pretty horrible. I always have class during those times and can almost never go. When we have practice at 4:00, because I can't run, I go up to the Merrill aerobic facilities to try to bike/elliptical.  I can almost NEVER find an open machine. I've had to start taking time out of my day in the morning between classes (which is inconvenient) to go to Merrill so I can use a machine.  For the amount of students that participate in athletics/students that work out on a daily basis, the athletic facilities are not at all sufficient."
College Freshman,4,"All the guys I've met here are sweethearts. I have tons of guy friends, much more so than I did in high school. However, there's not the biggest dating culture. I know some couples who are dating, but more of a hookup culture than a date culture."
College Freshman,4,"For big games (mainly between other NESCAC schools), there's a lot of school spirit and most Batesies attend to cheer their team on. However, overall sports definitely take a back seat in comparison to academics."
College Freshman,4,"Talking to other students, Bates has provided nearly all the aid they requested."
College Freshman,4,"280 is by far the nicest- some have even compared it to a hotel! Parker, Page, and Rand are average but most people are satisfied with them. That's even the case with Smith, the supposedly worst dorm on campus. There are also two houses (Clason, Milliken) for those who want a more close-knit atmosphere. Two new dorms are expected to be completed in 2016 while the Smith rooms will be converted from quads to two person rooms. This should solve the issue of overcrowding, as well as having people live on the dark basement floors."
College Sophomore,4,It's all about where you live but generally good.
College Sophomore,4,We have a large selection of majors and minors.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the party scene at Bates, but it is a little hit or miss. Usually it starts with a small pregame in someone's dorm room and then moves to Frye Street (on campus houses) or off campus houses (usually team houses). We don't have frats, but teams act like them if that's the scene your looking for. Fridays can be pretty up or down but Saturdays are usually really fun. Dances are HUGE at Bates. 80s is the biggest, but there are a lot (usually corresponding to some decade but not always) and everyone gets REALLY into them."
Alum,2,"Generally speaking, Bates faculty are dedicated to what they do and consistently aim to foster a positive classroom environment. However, student life at Bates is reminiscent of a high school experience in that it often feels limiting and cliquey. Though the school prides itself on being a diverse institution in which every student has access to this utopic experience, the day to day reality fails to live up to this marketed promise. The social hierarchy of Bates pervades every aspect of student life. In Commons, the only dining hall, students are categorized based on where they sit. On the weekends, your options are limited to a few parties that you only have access to if you are deemed socially relevant. At the end of the day, Bates is all about showing face, and while it is certainly possible to find your place even if you fall outside certain norms, i.e. straight, white, wealthy don’t underestimate the profound difficulties that go along with navigating an environment like this."
Sophomore,2,"The student body consists of privileged, white, boarding school elites who have accomplished little but all have an unfounded sense of entitlement. Students of color are ostracized. The surrounding area is extremely unsafe with a high crime rate and frequent stabbings. Downtown Lewiston is grungy and requires a 25-minute walk from campus. Campus is tiny and not very pretty. 3/32 housing options are nice; the rest are a nightmare. Page and Rand Halls are hell. Classes are hit or miss, depending on your professor. The nice gym, Davis, is always overcrowded and the other one, Merrill, is terrible – it was built in the 70s and has not been renovated. The food is yummy but the dining hall is often so overfull that you can't find a seat. You may have to wait in line for 45 minutes to access a single station/food item. Bates has great financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"Administration is sucking hard core this year. The students are having a hard time tolerating them. Cancellation of Trick or Drink, firing or ""retiring"" of most of the professor who are willing to support the students, and the overall ""Harvardization"" of the school is killing the culture that I have heard so much about but seem that I will never truly get to witness. They are causing security to crack down on parties too, but policies are still decently lenient in comparison to many other schools. I just wish we could see a true representation of the students wishes taken into account by administration. It's sad to see the inclusive culture of the school disappear before my eyes."
College Sophomore,2,"This is NOT a party school.  Also, the new administration is determined to get rid of the drinking scene, making an already stale party scene even more boring."
College Sophomore,2,Most students are white and upper-middle class.
College Sophomore,2,"During the months of late August up until late October, the weather is great. There is great scenery and Maine looks pretty nice. When spring comes around (usually late March/early April) the Bates campus is beautiful. However, once it hits mid November it begins to get very cold. It is very cold from mid/late November until around March. January and February are the coldest months, considering it can be 1 degree outside when you wake up for class. It is also pretty windy on campus which can be very annoying when it is already 10 degrees outside, (possibly snowing) and you have to walk down Alumni walk to get to class or Commons. With that being said, you need to prepare for harsh winter weather in Maine."
College Freshman,2,"It's Maine. It's cold. It snows a lot. Winter is really, really long. But presumably if you're going to Bates, you know that you're going to Maine and you're not expecting California weather. On the bright side, spring seems so much better when the last 6 months have been sub-zero. And the fall is simply beautiful with the changing leaves."
College Junior,2,"Mostly only live off-campus senior year, and only a select numbers of seniors can do so. "
College Junior,2,"There's a ""Bates Bubble."" Students don't really venture outside campus. "
College Junior,2,"You'll realize that the groups at Bates aren't exactly diverse. International students tend to stick to themselves, and same with non-international students. "
College Sophomore,2,"Hard to get a permit, even harder to find parking in the winter. Lewiston has a city wide ban on parking during snow storms... where do they expect you to put your car??"
College Junior,2,Housing is guaranteed all four years and the neighborhood around campus isn't that great
College Freshman,2,"COLD!! Snow and cold, even though the sun is shining, just great!"
College Freshman,2,"Who Cares – No the titles says it all...they don;t care about you smoking drinking having sex just don't get caught by security. The one issue they do have is the fire alarm, if no one owns up to it they make everyone pay for it."
College Freshman,2,Internet Access – the internet is really slow and the connections in buildings is not good
College Sophomore,1,"Bates has never had Greek organizations, so this section does not apply."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life on campus.  Greek life fails to affect the social atmosphere on campus because there is none.
College Sophomore,1,Lewiston.  Too small to be a city and too big to feel as if you could walk somewhere with a nice view.
College Sophomore,1,"The new administration is quickly changing the culture of Bates College.  The way things are going, we will be the place ""where fun goes to die"".  Security is very strict and for student-athletes (one-third of Batesies) there is a special system in place where write-ups for alcohol will get you suspended from your sport.  In the past two years, two Bates traditions (trick-or-drink and throwback night) have been cancelled by the new administration, and more will follow.  If you are looking at this school and care about the social scene, I highly recommend you stay overnight first.  The scene on the weekends is good sometimes, but overall very bad."
College Freshman,1,"Diverse on Paper, Not in Practice – There are people from many different countries at Bates, but usually only one or two per country. This results in a wide diversity on paper, but in actuality, the overwhelming majority of students are white, upper class, New England students. Being African-American, and coming from a diverse high school, it was a little shocking to first witness this. However, a lot of friendships are based on what activities and interests you have in common with people, not your race."
College Freshman,1,"Bates told me they would help me get home, which was supposed to be included in my scholarship, but I ended up paying for myself. Then I still needed to take out a loan."

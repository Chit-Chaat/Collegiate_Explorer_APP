Niche User,5,Mcneese is a great affordable college in southwest Louisiana. They are centered in a great little town.
Alum,5,"McNeese is such a nice, caring school with challenging academics and vibrant student and athletic life. They always bounce back from disasters and have strong, supportive faculty. Generous scholarships and honors college for above 27 ACT. Lots of international students. Rowdy cafeteria staff are so friendly. I studied business and learnt so much, got great internships and easily found work after graduation in my field. The broad curriculum gave me an edge over other applicants. I miss McNeese!"
Junior,5,"McNeese has great class sizes. You feel comfortable asking questions in lecture, and professors are approachable. There are also tons of help offered by the career services center. I've only had poor experiences with a few professors, but most are understanding of students' schedules and circumstances. This is a great university at a reasonable price compared to others in the state."
Junior,5,"McNeese quickly adapted to online learning for COVID-19. Then, with Hurricane Laura, they quickly switched all coursework online in order to better serve the students who were displaced. By doing that, they put their students and faculty first. It was one less thing to worry about in such a stressful year."
Junior,5,I love my school! They have very excellent programs and care about their students. I love how they never give you the opportunity to say I'm bored on campus.
Senior,5,"The instructors are always available and helpful. If you ever have any questions, they will reply back in a timely manner. I’ve never had any problems so far in any online classes. I like it because it’s very convenient for my schedule."
Senior,5,I love the art department’s atmosphere. My professors are great. I like the small class setting. The campus is a great place to be!
Freshman,5,Everything i have done on line with registration and communications has been a very easy process. I will enter my first year as a freshman this August 2020 and will probably have to take some online classes due to COVID 19. I am sure that process will be an easy process also.
Freshman,5,I will not start my freshman year until this August of 2020. But so far they have been very friendly and so easy to work with. They answer all my emails or questions in a timely manner and or forward me to the appropriate department or person. I am excited for my future at McNeese State University.
Freshman,5,"Due to COVID-19, I completed the Spring 2020 semester online. I finished the semester with all A's and B's, so needless to say it was not the most difficult thing I have done. The professors were as informative as they could be, despite the universal uncertainty. Otherwise, they were very supportive."
Sophomore,5,For the most part all of my professors have been excellent and have really helped me transition to college level learning.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy my online professors. Always willing to help. Fast pace but doable. I wish they had remedial courses online. It would help returning students but overall gre.

Senior,5,The experience has been great. I love the staff. Everyone has been very helpful at my time at mcneese
Freshman,5,"The university was very eager to listen to entering student. They gave great information for students, regarding safety, potential problems with being away from home and where to obtain assistances if needed. Discussed the what college life is about and if you put in the work, be accountable to yourself; you will be successful in this college. I given information for what I needed to keep my self safety on and off campus. Was given a list of places where tutoring was available."
Freshman,5,All the professors are willing to help if you show interest and work hard in their class. The campus is really easy to get around on. There is a close relationship between student and teacher. A laid back small rural college with friendly staff and student workers.
Freshman,5,"Mc. Neese has given me the opportunity to explore my liking and ideas! The staff is wonderful, and very kind. The campus is beautiful, and very clean. The students are extremely helpful. Everyone on the campus will greet you with a kind smile. The atmosphere is very lively!"
Freshman,5,I just started at McNeese and so far so good.  Great place to receive a great Education.  The only thing i would like to see upgraded is the dorms
Freshman,5,What I like about Mcneese State University is the campus and school spirit. I wouldn’t change anything .
Junior,5,Every staff member is truly here to help you make the right choices on what degree will work for you. No reason to ever stress over what to do next on enrolling. The staff is awesome and very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that the campus is small, so it is really easy to get around and not confusing. Its size also allows me to be able to talk to my professors more."
Junior,5,"McNeese is a smaller college, and you feel so at home. I am in the biology department and absolutely love my professors. They truly care and do their best to help you understand and thrive as a student."
Freshman,5,"What I like about mcneese would have to be the environment, it is a super welcoming community and everyone knows everyone and you get to have a ton of new experiences learning new things and people and your surroundings."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to McNeese and I love it so much. The campus focuses on academics which is great in my opinion.  All of my professors so far have cared for my education beyond their duties. Student life is very enriched. They ALWAYS have something going on for us on campus. There is free lunch around campus, BUT the Rowdy Cafeteria... has some ammmaaazzzinggg southern cooking. 10 out of 10 would recommend. The quad is beautiful and relaxing. It's a great place to go and take a deep breath during the many exam seasons you go through in college. GO POKES!"
Niche User,5,This is a very good school.I think it has a good agriculture program.Its a good fit from people.It has a very good campus.And some great dorms.
Junior,5,It great and the teachers are great. They help you a lot and give you advice if you are struggling. I’m have a great experience attending McNeese.
Sophomore,5,I love the size of the school and sense of community that I feel each and every day here! My knowledge is expanding in a very enriching and encouraging environment!
Niche User,5,"Great atmosphere, Great people, Great education. What more could someone ask for. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. Its not hard to learn exactly what you are wanting to. I just had an overall great experience visiting this school. I will use the money won to help pay for this school."
Niche User,5,"Don't really know a whole lot about McNeese State University yet.  Application has been accepted to attend next year after high school graduation. 
Really chose it for three reasons: 
major field of study - Mechanical Engineering
location - proximity to home
size - small enough to be personal."
Niche User,5,"McNeese has improved with renovations of their campus since 10 years ago. McNeese is steady expanding and support local businesses, industries and organizations. I will be taking classes there for my senior high school year 2018-19; entering into the dual program in which I am so exited. 
I've learn that my grandfather attended McNeese years ago, but that was when the campus had only a few buildings and less parking lots. I wasn't yet born at that time, never-the- less created. Researching and attending  McNeese campus has shown me alot  about their  strive for excellence support, education and expansion into the future."
Freshman,5,"McNeese is a great college/university! The teachers are very understanding and will work with each student to get them in the direction for success. The campus is beautiful and not very large, so walking to class doesn't take to long. The food they offer in the cafeteria is delicious and has a verity of options."
Sophomore,5,McNeese really gives you that close to home feel. Everyone is super connected and it's never a boring time. The classes could use some work but it's the smart choice when choosing an affordable university.
Freshman,5,Mcneese is an amazing school to go to especially if you are going into the agricultural field. They offer a bunch of experience for future careers. The professors are very hands on and are willing to work with you. They also have there own farmer and slaughter house! It’s really a great choice!
Freshman,5,McNeese state University is a great school. The professors there are very helpful and very easy to get along with. They try to help you to the best of their abilities and McNeese is just a fun environment to be in but McNeese could use more space in parking for the student body
Niche User,5,"I loved the at-home atmosphere, the activities/events, and the organization and pleasing aesthetics of the college. Not to mention, the low priced amenities, tuition,and fees."
Junior,5,"One of my favorite things about McNeese State is that the student life is absolutely amazing. I find that making connections in college is one of the key aspects to enjoying your studies, and McNeese makes it incredibly easy to do so. The campus is also very inviting and diverse which makes for a great time even when you are stressed beyond measure!"
Alum,5,"McNeese State University is a great school! Some faculty is okay, but the higher up faculty is great! The students have a lot of pride and mesh very well."
Freshman,5,"Greatest things were the teachers- each one was friendly and ready to help their students, from my math professor to my drawing teacher. All class materials were presented in a clear, easy to understand way. The campus is beautiful and has a friendly atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about McNeese except how open it is, because you get hot and sweaty going from class to class; however, everyone is friendly and helpful."
Junior,5,I adore McNeese! The faculty and staff are always more than helpful and willing to work around a student's schedule. I could not have chosen a better university and look forward to my remaining years at McNeese State University!
Senior,5,"Overall, my experience with McNeese State University has been mostly positive. I like that, in my particular program, the professors are understanding and willing to do all that they can to ensure that you will succeed. My school also alerts students when it comes to employment opportunities, although they are usually in the area of the school location, which is still advantageous for those who may attend school in-person or live in close proximity. My school is great when it comes to helping us with opportunities for learning too. I also like that we get assistance with internships required for our program instead of being on our on when looking for them too.  What I would change about my school would be the increase awareness of tuition so students have a better understanding and know what to expect with tuition. Sometimes fee info isn't available timely, and results in less time to accrue money for school expenses, and payment arrangements aren't too flexible."
Sophomore,5,"McNeese State University is a small state school of approximately 9,000 enrollment. It is a pleasure to attend this university. The classes are small and you have complete access to your professors. It is common to visit a professors office for help with class material. I am enrolled in the engineering program, and it is an excellent program. I strongly recommend McNeese State University."
Junior,5,"McNeese State University is a local college.  This university has enabled me to pursue a degree while working full-time and being a mother by enrolling in their online courses.  Their online programs help individuals like myself still pursue a degree to better themselves, despite life challenges."
Junior,5,I absolutely LOVE McNeese State University. The campus life is safe as well as fun. The professors here at MSU are awesome. They do whatever it take for their students to succeed and learn their material.
Sophomore,5,"I believe McNeese is a great college. It pushes me more than I have ever been before. The teachers teach in ways to where students have to learn the material instead of just memorize it. They teach us in a manner to where it benefits us in classes that lead on to others and help us keep that knowledge throughout our careers. It has many opportunities to get involved and get help from many professors that teach the same subject. I am not saying this just because I go to McNeese, it really is an overall great school."
Senior,5,I like the professors but I would love to see more opportunities for art majors to learn more contemporary classes like digital drawing and animation through more professors than just one great one.
Junior,5,"Mcneese is a wonderful college and it's very welcoming to new students. They are devoted to helping their students learn and they have interesting courses, like the art classes - which are a lot of fun to take. There're two student unions on campus and they both offer good food and a place to socialize and study. Mcneese holds many events for its students such as a casino night and an exotic animal night. Overall, I would highly recommend this campus."
Junior,5,"I love this university, the professors are there for the students and they have patience. Their school is know for their nursing program which I applied for spring 2017. I'm excited to start this journey and wouldn't have chosen any other school to attend than Mcneese university state. I love how the school gives out special activities to the students, for example fundraisers for special cause, like donating to sickle cells foundation. This school helps the community with free clinic visits in their nursing departments"
Sophomore,5,I love the academic environment and the miniscule student to teacher ratio here at Mcneese State University.
Niche User,5,"My Visit at McNeese State University was great. The Facility and Faculty was so nice and Organized. The entire time while I was there I felt like I was at home ,if I could do it again I would"
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy all that McNeese has to offer me. I am able to take classes that appeal to me and am able to choose how I want to learn. My professors have been passionate and understanding. I really have no complaints.
College Sophomore,5,McNeese is so involved in the community and makes many events available to its students. I love that there is a new event going on just about every week. McNeese gives students the chance to appreciate other cultures through the Banner Series and other such occasions. The professors are highly-qualified and have enriched my learning experience. I am proud to be a student at McNeese.
College Freshman,5,"Classes, for the most part are not big at all unless you're in a biology class or all  around subject course. Class styles range from laid back to more serious environment depending on the teacher and their teaching styles. They are numerous courses offered for any major.  My professors have all been awesome because they always make the class more than professional. They make students feel more than just a number."
College Freshman,5,"This center is very helpful. They are always there to help or assist in any way possible. They make sure you're straight at all times. They do their best to help find jobs/internships, etc."
College Freshman,5,Campus is almost the safest place to be because police are on the scene all throughout the day in rotation. They are always on call and there are emergency poles when needed for students to contact them. Nothing rarely ever happens on campus that isn't meant to happen.
College Freshman,5,"Campus dorms and apartments are really cool. They have parties, dances, free food, free prizes almost all the time.  There is always a way to have a good time where you live.  The housing office is always there helping students out and giving out door prizes and having contest to keep students involved where they live."
Niche User,4,I took 3 classes online and the professors  were really helpful. The classes were well paced and east to access
Niche User,4,Great school great people and I love the atmosphere the sense of feeling together is overall nice. I love the actual college experience I get and It's pretty nice.
Niche User,4,As long as you know your professors I believe you'll do well. Most of the teachers have been pretty flexible so far so no complaints there I have to say. The workload is as to be expected but sometimes I do wish teachers were considerate of our own personal lives when assigning multiple things at a time.
Alum,4,I only took a few classes online. Preferred in class. They were set up alright and i liked the efficiency. Quite easy but still learnt a lot.
Freshman,4,Great in-person experience and great ability to adapt to online schooling. Was very accommodating with issues due to the pandemic.
Freshman,4,Was really good at using forums to mimic in-person conversation and group participation. Online classes are very flexible with personal schedules.
Junior,4,McNeese was very quick about the transitioning from in classroom classes to online. A lot of professors gave an update on how class will resume if and when the transition happen and were understandable and patient with students.
Freshman,4,"The campus could use some updates, but overall a great environment with an even better staff. There are always activities to be involved in with a diverse selection of extra curriculars."
Junior,4,I like to study at this university and I would recommend to students to get accepted in any major in the university except for nursing and engineering to who is academic level is average. Rather than is a good university
Junior,4,I like to study at this university and I would recommend to students to get accepted in any major in the university except for nursing and engineering to who is academic level is average. Rather than is a good university
Niche User,4,I liked the overall experience and the size of the school which is why I have chosen to further my education here.
Junior,4,"I genuinely think our faculty and administration care about the students deep down, but a lot of things can get lost in context. I know my professors and advisers care about me academically, but we're at an age where there needs to be emotional support, as well. Things get really hard. My friend took her life on-campus and they had a memorial, but without stating her name. It was like they cared about the situation from the outside .. They cared about the student, not the person."
Freshman,4,Mcneese state university is a lovely school with a conducive environment and friendly atmosphere. However I would like for there to be an improvement  in their transportation. Overall I'm glad I chose Mcneese
Freshman,4,"Amazing diversity, campus involvement, and always new faces. Yes this is a small school nut everyday I am always seeing a new face or meeting new people. There is always something going on around campus and something to do. The greek life and clubs are amazing!"
Freshman,4,"My professors have been wonderful, they’ve given me great feedback and constructive criticism on my essays and artwork. They’ve helped me to improve my work tremendously. Meghan Fleming was my art professor and she really recognized my improvement in my work throughout the semester. Mcneese gives me the freedom to express myself and I’ve met so many friendly people."
Freshman,4,"McNeese is not the easiest school but I wouldn't want to go elsewhere. The students are very accepting and I've easily made many friends. The professors help you with the curriculum, all you have to do is make time."
Niche User,4,Many Mcneese recruiters was extremely helpful to help fill out an application and also help out a lot while I was filling out my fsfa.
Sophomore,4,"The ""excellence with a personal touch' is very true. Being a smaller school, professors encourage personal help and strive to make sure they do everything they can to help you pass their classes."
Sophomore,4,Love this school! Small campus that puts you at east and makes you feel at home. Faculty and staff are very willing to help and want you to succeed! Great location!
Sophomore,4,"It is easy to find all your classes because it is a smaller campus. The professors teach quickly but will go in depth and help if you're ever in need. The housing options could improve just a little bit. After staying for a year, I feel as though the rooms are a bit overpriced for what you get."
Junior,4,McNeese is a great school! Love the program I am in. The professors are some of the best. Wouldn't go anywhere else!
Senior,4,"The school itself are great, albeit some teachers aren't the greatest.  The biggest problem is the outsourcing.  The housing office is a nightmare.  Their solution to mold is spray paint.  They don't fix ANYTHING unless you hold rent, and then you face legal issues for doing so.  There is no care given towards the students past trapping them into a facade of affordable housing, and then increasing the rent next semester.  Every dorm is filthy, broken down, and prone to crimes like theft and rampant drug use.  Only about half of the RA's actually do their job, the rest use it as a easy paycheck."
Sophomore,4,McNeese staff has been very helpful with my being a non-traditional continuing student and working long hours.
Junior,4,"McNeese is a wonderful school. From the moment I entered I felt respected and able to participate in a myriad of things I had never been able to participate in before. 

I was not safe at my high school, I was constantly targeted and harassed, but said harassment has never happened here at McNeese. Its a wonderful place to be and has some of the cheapest tuition i've ever seen at a college."
Sophomore,4,McNeese offered many ways to get involved and enjoy your time on campus. Some of the professors I have not liked but then there are some that make up for the bad ones. You can tell that McNeese faculty put in a lot of effort to make sure college students are enjoying their college experience.
Freshman,4,I like Mcneese because the campus is easily navigable. I also like that there are various things to participate in on campus.
Freshman,4,Very safe place. Good academics. Could have better computer labs but still very good for a small university
Sophomore,4,Mcneese is a very good school. It has many options for not only degrees but for students to get involved and make Mcneese more like a home than a school.
Freshman,4,"Pretry good experience.. schools advisors are very kind , good counselling...They really helped me o get my visa... as soon as i sent the request they replied quickly..."
Senior,4,Mcneese is an awesome campus with lots of resources to help students succeed. The classes are relatively small and allow students to spend more time with their professors.
Alum,4,"It's a good school. It's smaller than most, so you get a more personal experience. The tuition is also not as high as some other schools, so you don't have to worry as much about going into debt."
Freshman,4,"The people here are very willing to assist and help students on their future education, here at McNeese. It feels like home and yet I could still work on my independence, since I’m from Lake Charles, Louisiana. For the betterment of McNeese and students, one thing I would like to see a change in is a focus on teaching students the style of studying they should pursue. For example, I’m mostly a visual learner with a hint of hands-on and audio. Thus, I would focus on diagrams, hands-on experiences, models, videos, PowerPoints, etc. Some students still struggle to understand how to use their fullest potential on learning and retaining the knowledge that’s been given to them."
Freshman,4,"I liked the overall feeling of a tight-knit student community which can be felt throughout each section of the manicured campus. This university offers impeccable choices for classes for any major imaginable, and the small-town essence in the city reiterates the closeness in both student and educational life."
Sophomore,4,"Since it’s a smaller school, you are able to make more connections and have better support from the professors."
Freshman,4,"McNeese is a very affordable college with good teachers and campus life for its size and budget.
It is a small campus which makes walking between classes quick and easy.
We have a very diverse student body with many students from all over the world."
Sophomore,4,I loved the environment and how small the campus was. I enjoyed the ease of traveling around campus and meeting new people. I’d recommend McNeese to anyone who is looking for a small college that will make you feel right at home.
Freshman,4,I had a very good experience at McNeese for preview day. Everyone was so  nice and willing to help us find what we needed. I met some of the professor that will be teaching in my field of study. I think I will really enjoy McNeeses it seems to offer a lot. They are also rated one of the top schools for nursing. The one thing I would  like to see change would be the price of dorms. they are really expensive for a teenager to afford especially when the student does not qualify for financial aid. Thanks for this opportunity.
Freshman,4,"McNease State University is an amazing school for all individuals of numoerus majors . The atmosphere , employees , professors and overall the environment is a great place to receive any degree. Each professor is dedicated to helping you reach your dreams and goals . They are all understanding indicualds who are patient to make sure we get the knowledge that we need to be successful .  The campus it self is not that large and there isn’t many people that attend . Although , it is the perfect school for anyone who is dedicated and want to stay and remain focused on studies ."
Senior,4,"Although I do enjoy learning here, sometimes it seems like the professors are chosen based on their degree level instead of how well they teach students. I'm a senior majoring in biology and I must say that half of the professors I've had in the biology department did not know how to teach or did not care about their students."
Sophomore,4,McNeese State University is overall a great school. I enjoy being on campus and for the most part enjoy the professors.
Freshman,4,There is not much to do around here but everyone is friendly. The classes are smaller which allows people to learn better. The professors are good as well.
Freshman,4,"I have been at McNeese for 2 semesters now and I have enjoyed my time there. I haven't been as involved as I originally thought I would be but there are organizations available for people of many different interests. I have had good professors in most of my classes. Making the jump from a small high school to a large university had me nervous, but many classes at McNeese are small and personal. Students build relationships with one another as well as with the professors through class discussions. I would recommend McNeese to anyone looking for a college to call home."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at MSU and I absolutely love it! Yes it is most defiantly a challenge but if you apply yourself and pay attention you will do fine. What I love most about MSU is the people. They are super nice and friendly. The professors are normal professors the do there job but they also like to make sure they are clear about the subjects they teach. I'm so glade I chose MSU, wouldn't change it for the world. Geaux Pokes!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently in my second semester at McNeese, and I can honestly say that I love my school. The faculty members are great and extremely helpful. Housing is affordable, and McNeese is ranked as one of the most affordable universities in Louisiana. I definitely recommend this school."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at McNeese State and have overall positive views about the university. I've liked every single professor I've had so far and hope it remains that way. The professors are very understanding and give enough time to finish any work given. I would like to see the Criminal Justice department expand. There aren't that many teachers that work in this department so they have to switch off all the time. The university is nice but it could be nicer, the buildings need remodeling. I enjoy being at McNeese and would choose it over again if I had to!"
Senior,4,I love my school! My major is mass communication and all of the teachers in my department are super helpful and really care about there students.
Freshman,4,"Its a good athlete school, the coaches are great, facilities great, lots of free gear etc. Classes are fine. Cafeteria is pretty good and they're putting more effort into having vegan options. Dorms are lovely. Good location. Campus events however are ALWAYS a let down. Haven't been to one that didn't suck. Campus isn't very attractive they should plant some flowers or have statues. It's hard for newcomers to find things to do unless they get a large social circle. "
College Sophomore,4,"McNeese is incredibly diverse; there are all types of people. I did hear about an intolerant person protesting the LGBT community, but it didn't seem that they received report. They weren't a student."
College Sophomore,4,I've never noticed any students or staff members participating in drug usage.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't searched for any internships. However, I have never had a problem with the staff at McNeese being helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus has emergency phones in various areas. I like this, but I do feel as if there could be more because they're scattered."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is comparable to a nice, expensive apartment. They are within walking distance of the campus and seem to always be clean. They look spacious from the outside. I've never actually been in one."
College Sophomore,4,"I know some students that are in a Sorority and they seem to genuinely have fun. When I have spoken to recruiters, they were kind. The Fraternities and Sororities put on events around campus that are enjoyable. One even had a book sale."
College Sophomore,4,"I have attended one Football game and there was definitely plenty of school spirit. This was before I became a student here and it helped make the decision apply. The athletic facilities are in great condition and some are open to all students. We even have a Yoga class, how awesome is that?"
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus usually. There is security on regular patrols and emergency buttons everywhere. The police station is on campus also.
College Sophomore,4,The school spirit at Mcneese is amazing. Everyone supports the athletics whether or not they are part of it. Everyone attends and enjoys the sporting events.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the variety of people that my school has. There are students of all nationalities, races, styles, and religions. You can learn so much about other cultures and beliefs from just having small talk with someone you don't know. There's no one who is just like another person. Everyone is different and respects others differences."
College Junior,4,"The campus cops are always driving around or walking around. There are telephone places on campus you can use if you don't feel safe while walking at night. I have used it once and they were there within seconds, it's a safe environment."
College Junior,4,"I live in an apartment on campus and it's very convenient. It's a short walk to all of my classes. My apartment came fully furnished, which made the moving in experience so much easier. The random selection of roommates worked great in my favor. I submitted my paper of what I do and my interests, and my roommates and I are the perfect match. Love living on campus and all the activities the RCs provide!"
College Junior,4,"The REC is a great place to hang out with your friends and work out. The indoor track is perfect for those who don't like to run outside. There is plenty of machines for all the students. My favorite part about the athletic facility is the free classes they provide. It's the perfect study break, and always has me come out of my shell to socialize with those around me. Yoga is personally my favorite class they provide!"
College Student,2,"My overall experience is below average. Maybe I had a higher expectation about college but I was wrong. The thing that bothers me mostly is I feel that the professors are not engaging and do not take time to plan out lectures.  The just tell the information and are done.  Classrooms are out of date and dirty in the buildings I attend classes in, and I usually finish the class not really feeling like I have obtained much."
College Freshman,2,I wish more companies would come in and build close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,The speed of the internet is very slow if a lot of students are connected on the network.
College Sophomore,2,You are responsible for your own transportation.
College Freshman,2,McNeese tends to flood often
College Freshman,2,"The parking spots fill up very quickly. The church is another place you can park, but you have to get a permit there. It seems pointless buying a school permit when you can buy a church one cheaper and be guaranteed a spot."
College Freshman,2,"The speed can be very slow, it also can take a long time to connect to the wifi."
College Freshman,2,"I have a car, but there is no campus shuttle that I know of or a bus that comes to school. "
College Junior,2,"McNeese State University is in southern Louisiana so it is smoldering hot for most of the school year.  When it rains, as long as you carry an umbrella, rainy days are not too bad.  Although I have gotten to my car, with soaking wet clothes.  I love the cold, so when we do actually get cold weather, I am in heaven."
College Sophomore,2,They give you parking tickets with not enough adequate information. 
College Sophomore,2,"It's not very affordable to students who dont want to live on campus, they are very nice and they're a lot of them to choose from , but arent worth the price."
College Freshman,2,"For me, student life is not that great. There are plenty of organizations and lots of events going on, but none that suit my interest. On campus we do have a rec center but I don't use it. McNeese is still working on its landscaping and renovating the library (still). I'd like to see more larger inside areas that are quiet and good for studying or hanging out, like how the library used to be before they started renovating it."
College Freshman,2,"Lake Charles is an average sized town that doesn't always have an abundance of activities to do. The only thing that attracts tourists here are the casinos. Most people living here will tell you that there is never anything to do, but there are live music venues, small festivals, fairs, and little concerts going on all the time. I go to the theater often because I love watching movies."
College Freshman,2,"While there is the cafeteria, with wonderful options depending on the day, the only other eating option on campus is Einstein Bros. Luckily for students and instructors, there are roughly 8 places within 5-10 miles of campus that range from fast food to restaurants."
College Junior,2,"As a Greek myself, I know my sorority is very active on campus and both non-Greeks and other Greeks alike get along with us just fine. We all help each other out, Greeks I mean. I have many friends and such who are non-Greeks.There are great parties to go to when you know the right people. Or just going out to the bars near campus can be fun enough on the weekends."
College Junior,2,"Parking was really bad, but they just built a parking garage which a great asset"
College Sophomore,2,In the new ranch we have an awesome coffee shop. There is also a convenient type store that has good options for snacking.
College Sophomore,2,"The drug use at Mcneese State University is very low key, but there are some hardcore drugs. It is not flaunted for everyone to be pressured into taking them. Drinking, however, is very popular for everyone due to all the bars we have in the city."
College Sophomore,2,"Every once in a while you will see greek activities but if you are not integreated into the Greek life, you hardly know whats going on"
College Freshman,2,"I do not feel that athletics are a huge part of McNeese. This could be due to the fact that this is a smaller college and it does not have that many students to create large athletic events, such as LSU does."
College Freshman,2,"Make sure you have rain boots because when it rains, it floods. And the weather is very strange because in the mornings it be hot, and in the evenings it get warm/hot"
College Freshman,2,Lake Charles La has lots of spirit for our school but there is not a lot to do here beside partying and what not. Are campus is amazing and at the moment is getting remodeled with a parking garage it is very friendly and kept up with!
College Student,2,"The permit cost is not unbearable. It's cheaper to get a permit than pay for one ticket.  Once you are on campus you can walk anywhere in under 10 mins.  I arrive by 7:30 am and there is alot of open spaces, but by 7:45-8am it becomes harder to find a spot on campus.  You can park across the street and walk over.  And by 9am people are following you as you walk to your car to get your parking spot. However they are building a large mulit story parking garage."
College Student,2,I really havn't seen a lot of bus that pick up students. I seen students mostly use their cars or walk around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Classes hardly ever gets cancelled, no matter what the weather is like. It rains and is cold a lot here, and my classes are very far from my dorms. It gets treacherous when walking in the cold and in the rain at the same time."
College Freshman,2,There really is not that much of a nightlife at McNeese. There is a few clubs but not that many. There really is not that much to do around there like would be at other places.
College Senior,2,"I have had good professors who took time with me and their other students. They make sure all the students are keeping up with the workload and don't mind answering questions and allowing the students to participate in class discussions associated with the present topics. they are fair with grading and do not pick favorites. They make sure to note those who are struggling and encourage tutoring and any other kinds of help students may need. I have also had bad professors who show no interest in helping their students learn the material. These professors just teach their classes, ignore students with questions, and expect their students to just kind of make it. Some professors even go so far as to tell their classes which students will fail and how long it will take for certain students to drop their classes. Other professors are known to show favoritism and grade tests and other materials accordingly. It really depends on who you know have already taken classes and had professors, so you can know who to take and who not to take."
College Senior,2,"The police at McNeese spend a lot of their time trying to find parking violations, instead of catching people who are going 20+ mph over the speed limit around campus (making for unsafe crosswalk conditions). There isn't a lot of forgiveness involved when people have obtained a parking ticket/ boot on their vehicle."
College Senior,2,"I attend McNeese State University, I am currently enrolled in two degree programs- Criminal Justice and Mass Communication. Although I have great mentors in both departments, I feel that most of my time in college was wasted with subjective assignments (assignments that didn't specifically enhance my skills for future jobs). Attaining the status of ""educated"" basically came down to me teaching myself."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the teachers do not help the students. They do not care whether or not you pass. When you go to their office, they do not help just make you feel really stupid."
College Sophomore,2,Bad for Underclassmen – Freshmen/sophomores have to park at the stadium and cross 2 busy streets to get to campus. Those with evening classes (after 4) are allowed to park anywhere.
College Freshman,2,"Rain Sucks – When it rains, its miserable to go to class, especially for those of us who have to park at the football stadium. Lake Charles and surrounding cities tend to flood so getting to class can prove a difficult task."
College Junior,2,"Parking at the Stadium – There is really only four options for how you will get to campus at McNeese. Live in the dorms, have someone bring you, walk if you live close enough, or drive your vehicle. There is plenty of parking for the most part, but it's a small town so public transport isn't a big thing. The worst part is freshmen and sophomore's have to park at the football stadium and then walk to campus through one of the busiest intersections in town. It isn't a long walk, but there has been quite a few accidents and a girl has even passed away a year ago when crossing that intersection. I'm going into my sixth semester of college and we just got cross walks, and lights at the intersection four months ago."
College Freshman,2,"A Good Mix – There are many different races around campus. There are mostly whites and blacks, but there are also many international students. Everyone is treated with the same respect around campus."
College Junior,2,"there is a lot of housing around campus, but most of it gets taken up quickly. finding housing away from campus is harder, but not impossible. some landlords are hard to deal with, while others are easier and take more time to hear about problems with the rental property. unless you have a good paying job (while in college, which is hard to find) or have a roommate, living off campus posing a big problem"
College Junior,2,"I am blessed that I haven't had to deal with the financial aid office very much. The one time I did (for a scholarship) it was awful. I can't speak for everyone, though."
College Junior,2,"Lake Charles – McNeese State University is the cultural hub of Lake Charles, LA. To be honest, I am not sure Lake Charles would draw in any form of entertainment if it wasn't for the school/ Banner's Series. Unfortunately, that is where the fun stops... if there are a lot of events or sports activities- I am not aware of it."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Okay...I Guess – There's not much on campus, but it's enough to say it's a small campus"
College Freshman,2,"The local weather at McNeese is always changing. It is either freezing in the morning and then blazing hot in the afternoons, or it is sunny all morning and raining in the afternoon. It is always hard to know what attire to wear to school."
College Junior,2,"Business Education – I am an Education major, meaning their is a number of steps I have to take before even getting into the teacher program. I have to take the Praxis I exam and maintain a 2.5 GPA. It took me an extra semester to get into the program because I failed the Praxis exam twice which actually pushed me back from graduating also."
Graduate Student,1,"If you really value you education, you should seek  put other opportunities. Teachers are complacent, curriculum is out dated, and campus is dilapidated. Only good aspect is the cost compared to larger universities. However, the cost is disproportionate to the learning value. Also, dont use words like disproportionate there, you will not be understood."
Niche User,1,As a parent of a student their get your child an apartment off campus. They will  charge them a full months rent for student housing although they are graduating that same month. Mind you the room will not be occupied during the summer. $595 can be spent on an off campus apartment. Also if your child lives off campus they will charge them a hefty fee for campus dining. Why charge for campus dining when they have an apartment. And the apartments are not all that great.  The school is in your wallet as well as your child's pocket.  Rip off. Of all the professors my child has had he only liked two.
College Freshman,1,"If you are an international student, don't expect to get aid. This school only give aids to citizens or permanent residents even if you have better grades and scores."
Recent Alumnus,1,Lake Charles is not the typical college town.  It does not really cater to the students
College Freshman,1,They pay too much attention to issues that benefit their gain. Not enough attention to drinking and parties.
College Freshman,1,Disgusting dorms. Apartments are worse.
College Sophomore,1,"The Campus would flood if there was just a little rain showers. The draining system in Louisiana is at its worst and you would need a pair of rain boots, a truck, and etc."
College Junior,1,"The cafeteria food is disgusting, the appearance of the dining facilities are very up to par, the menus in the New Ranch are great and the food is delicious.  If you have a meal plan you use your id to scan for meals or you have a monetary amount to use in the on campus store or bookstore."
College Freshman,1,Do we even have that?
College Freshman,1,"The weather changes a lot. One day it will be cold the next day it'll be hot, then raining."
College Sophomore,1,"Same old places, with not much vafriety. McDonalds, BK, Sonic"
College Junior,1,If You Don't Have A Car You Have To Walk. Nearly Mo Public Transportation.
College Junior,1,"I haven't seen or heard of any public transportation designated for the school. To my knowledge, there is no shuttle or bus available to the students. If there is, it is not very well advertised."
College Sophomore,1,If it rains over a longer period of time the campus gets flodded easily
College Student,1,"The parking at McNeese is not the greatest.  To get an actual parking spot on campus and not at the stadium, you have to be here by 7:20 in the mornig.  Thankfully the parking situation should be getting better since McNeese decided to build a parking garage on campus. It should be finished before the end of this semester"
College Sophomore,1,"I've always felt unsafe on McNeese's campus when it is dark outside and im walking to my room. It seems like all our police is there for is to give tickets and boots, but never there to help."
College Senior,1,"Internships and job preparation are sadly two areas that McNeese is struggling to make a difference in. I am expected to hold at least one internship due to my degree program, however, there are very few openings for my specific concentration (as with most small towns). I do feel it is important to hold an internship position (the more the better!), however- I think it is a burden for students who can't quit their paid part time job in order to search for usually unpaid intern positions that may not even give them any true work experience."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a total chaos for many students. Ever since they start working on the new student parking which is going to entitle a 3-story garage for students. Many students have to park in other places now such as the stadium and elsewhere on campus which you have to get there early to get a good parking spot.
College Freshman,1,Public transportation in lake charles is not very good at all. you will need to get your own car. There is a bus line that runs through town but is very unpredictable and does not go by the campous.
College Junior,1,"There is little diversity at McNeese State University. Located in Lake Charles, most students who attend graduated from local high schools and have lived in Lake Charles or surrounding towns for their entire lives."

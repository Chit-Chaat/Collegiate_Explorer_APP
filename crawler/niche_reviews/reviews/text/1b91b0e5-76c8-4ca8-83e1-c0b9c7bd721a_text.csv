Niche User,5,I love the beautiful campus. the professors are so nice and I get to meet people from all over the country.
Niche User,5,It is going well for me so far. My professors are making everything so much easier than I thought it would be and I am so thankful for them. I miss being in person though.
Junior,5,Amazing college with fantastic professors and unlimited academic opportunities!  Highly recommend UR.  Career services helped me find an excellent paid internship. I have made lifelong friends!
Junior,5,"Online classes were good, but can't compare to the in-person classes which are outstanding at UR.   Glad to be returning campus in Fall 2020 for regular classes!"
Alum,5,"For the time period (early 2000's), Richmond was as digitally advanced as possible. We were given access to laptops early on, and encouraged to make us of digital academic resources whenever possible."
Sophomore,5,"Great academics and culture of helping students succeed. The business school and leadership major is leading the way for all universities. I am challenged in my classes and look forward to an exciting internship in the summer. 
The bar in admissions has been raised as I have enjoyed the academic vibe of UR! The campus is beautiful and the people are warm."
Freshman,5,"I love how the university is relatively small in size, meaning I see a few familiar faces a day on campus outside of my dorm hall and classes."
Sophomore,5,"When it comes down to it, I love this school and I am so glad that I decided to go here. I have had amazing professors, love my classes, have made excellent friends, and love the campus. However, fair warning, social life is very dependant on Greek life. For girls, it isn't too bad but from what I've seen it can be difficult for guys that don't rush or find a solid group another way. In my opinion, the benefits of the university outweigh the social life negatives."
Freshman,5,The University of Richmond has been a great experience. My first year was educational and fun. The University provided many educational experiences such as academic fraternities and clubs.
Freshman,5,University of Richmond has a great campus and academics. All the professors I've had have worked hard and engaged with students.
Senior,5,The University of Richmond gave me the platform to pursue my interests while presenting the necessary tools to find new passions along the way. I would strongly recommend that anyone who is interested come down to take a tour. You will never want to leave.
Alum,5,"I'm incredibly grateful that I had a chance to attend University of Richmond.  It is a school with an amazing community, great student life and activities, ample opportunities for leadership inside and outside of the classroom, and faculty and staff who come to work every day to do their best.  I personally must recommend the Jepson School of Leadership Studies, which helps students think about how to do more with their lives and careers than just collect a paycheck.  Don't do what I did--be sure to take advantage of study abroad, for which there is better support and infrastructure than any other school in the world.  At this place, if you are willing to learn what you want and put in the work for it, you can really write your own ticket.  P.S.  Don't be intimidated by the price tag as financial aid is among the best in the nation."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of Richmond. The teachers are always engaged in your work and willing to offer assistance whenever it is needed. The class sizes are intimate enough to always allow your voice to be heard if you wish for it to be. The students are also incredible. Everyone is ready to interact with each other, regardless if they know each other or not. The food is beyond excellent and I never grow tired of walking across Westhampton Lake every day."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved attending UR. The classes were challenging but professors were easily reachable for assistance, the food in the dining hall and cafes was delicious, the dorms were nicer than an average college's dorms, the community was helpful and allowed lots of growth. Study abroad is encouraged and there are resources everywhere on campus for any issue a student may have. One drawback is the lack of diversity among students on campus."
Alum,5,I really enjoyed my time at the University of Richmond. The university was especially generous when it came to making cultural experiences accessible to all students. They also highly encouraged studying abroad and offered additional grants and scholarships to make it affordable.
Freshman,5,"Everything is pretty awesome here. Small classes allow you to be noticed and the professors really seem to care about you. Their focus on LA allows students to either branch out or stick on a designated route.The campus is beautiful. Basically, it's pretty cool.

The students are also pretty awesome. I never did anything with greek life and met my friends mostly through nerdy clubs (games club, anime, video games, etc), so my friend group is contrastingly diverse (though quite extensive) relative to the other reviewers.

The Comp Sci program (my area) here is also definitely growing, so I'm excited to see what happens. You could say I have no regrets!"
Graduate Student,5,"Small and quiet, private school. Expensive but it is worth it. Friendly faculty stuff and very good professors. Everybody works to make a good atmosphere for the students. The education process itself is very hard and intensive, be prepaid for a very hard work. The library is big and has only fresh editions of the books. The campus is spectacular and convenient. Great opportunities to play many kinds of sports. Excellent stadiums and gyms on a territory. A lot of post classes activities. Great help with the job and internship search."
Freshman,5,"Best choice I ever made was going to Richmond. Definitely a work hard, play hard atmosphere, which makes for a student body that is beyond friendly and happy. I did not know a single person going in and had no problems quickly making great friends and adjusting to the school. All the professors have been great and very helpful and the classes are fast moving, but very interesting. The social scene is super fun and parties are not very exclusive. Overall a great setting for happy, hard-working students!"
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of Richmond. They provide a stellar education, on a beautiful campus, with super capable students. After transferring from two different schools to here, I can confidently say that Richmond is my favorite of the colleges. Everything from their qualified staff, to the quality of their facilities, is top notch."
Freshman,5,"The University of Richmond is a great college with caring professors and wonderful staff members. The academics are rigorous, and the professors are always available to help."
Freshman,5,It's my second home. I love the beautiful campus where you can always slow down and take your pace. I love the professors who are extremely approachable. I love the people who always show great support. I love the life where you are not forced to do anything but make your own decisions.
Alum,5,When I visited the campus it was beautiful. All the people there were very friendly and the food was awesome!
Works Here,5,This campus is beautiful. Everyone who works here is so focused on the students and their future. Easy access to online resources and always able to get a help on the phone.
Sophomore,5,"The university is extremely personal and everything that you need or are in search of is either there or there is someone willing to help you start it. Small classrooms, personal professors, and engaging classmates, it's everything you want in a small liberal arts school."
Sophomore,5,"I love Richmond! It is the perfect size, combination of work hard/play hard, and in a great location."
Sophomore,5,"The education here is great: classes are kept very small, teachers are very invested and there are a lot of resources available to help us. Campus is beautiful and there is never a time I don't feel safe. However, social scene is a little like high school because of how small the school is and though party scene is fun, it is a little strange compared to bigger schools."
Sophomore,5,The University of Richmond cares about it's students. They support me and my fellow through difficult times and work on giving us the finest education. They support their students financially through one of the greatest need-based grant programs. They provide the greatest staff to help enhance everyone's college experience. I would recommend this university to anyone looking for a hands on college experience with small class sizes and the most caring professors.
Freshman,5,"Overall a great college. Although you can major in many subjects here and be successful after college, more than any other field, people are here for the business school. At the same time the smartest people here are arguably the math, physics and computer science majors, and the students going through the Jepson will have the only leadership major degrees (that I'm aware of) that carry genuine weight when applying for jobs."
Freshman,5,"Love love love it here. Absolutely no regrets in choosing to attend here. I got an amazing scholarship offer so I'm going to my dream school basically for free, and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. The people are great, the campus is beautiful, my professors are brilliant and personable, and the class offerings make me excited to start next semester."
Sophomore,5,"Great academics and professors, beautiful campus, and very good school spirit and social scene for a relatively small school"
Niche User,5,"Richmond has a very friendly atmosphere and the students seem very happy. You can tell that it's an academic environment, but the students still know how to have fun."
Niche User,5,I really love the overall atmosphere of the University because it makes me feels happy. The campus is beautiful and the academic courses available are great. 
College Freshman,5,Lottery system may not be the best but every dorm is spacious and comfortable. Special shoutout to our janitors who are always on the job. I've seen a sink that was made very dirty by a student at 2:30AM but by 5AM it was cleaned up and looked brand new.
College Freshman,5,"Best decision I've made so far! I've always wanted a work hard-play hard school with top notch academics, a diverse student body, and a welcoming community(great financial aid also). So far I have gotten just that. I'm an international student and the move has been so easy. I can't wait to see what the next 4 years have in store for me :)"
College Freshman,5,"The first thing you notice when you come to a competitive university like UR is that people actually care.  Its genuinely noticeable and, even if a student doesn't like a class, you will see them studying and working hard for a good score"
Niche User,5,Gorgeous campus! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Also provides a wide variety of courses and great for international students. 
College Freshman,5,"very chill people, great academics, beautiful campus. What more could you need?"
College Freshman,5,"Multiple parties every day, even weekdays"
College Freshman,5,Lots of off campus places to go and stuff on weekdays and weekends
College Freshman,5,they're cool accept for a select few
College Freshman,5,huge rooms and cool RA's
College Junior,5,"For people who are familiar with Richmond, when you tell them you are a student / have a degree, it holds a lot of weight. The school has a great reputation AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE HEARD OF IT. That being said, there are, unfortunately, may people who have no idea what a Richmond Education is about. For that reason, some employers love us while others just won't hire from here because they have never heard of it - thats the downside of going to a smaller school with a smaller alumni pool."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a variety of unique courses to take on campus. One course I took this semester was science fiction, it was one of the best courses that I found out that I enjoyed. I highly recommend it!!!"
College Junior,5,very safe campus. people generally watch out for each other too. the police is there for your safety.
College Junior,5,"-great classes that have challenged me

-great professor with an occasional one who is not so good at teaching (but qualified).. so you have to teach yourself

-sometimes not enough spots in the classes you want"
College Junior,5,"-High quality of the alumni network, though it is smaller than other schools'

-Robins Business School is well known

-Our chemistry department is particularly good

-As a junior, I have friends going to work for Bain, Deloitte, the FBI, Lilly Pulitzer, Google, and more.... and I know other seniors going to Duke, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, and London School of Economics for grad school. Not everyone is this successful, but if you work hard here, it's totally possible."
College Junior,5,"There are tons of great alumni connections, and given the school's reputation (especially in the business world), lots of opportunities for students after they graduate. Career services posts opportunities on their webpage, sends out interest-specific emails individually, and many recruiters come to campus. Most students attain internships and jobs easily."
College Junior,5,"Richmond is a great school with smart professors and students, loads of opportunities. The student body is friendly and driven in both academic and social circles, and it's not hard to tell that students from Richmond are going places in their lives. I would definitely choose to attend Richmond again, it has been one of the most important and impactful decisions I've made."
College Freshman,5,"We have many programs here like CAPS and Spiders for Spiders, which is student run, that help to prevent sexual abuse or try to prevent it from happening. There is minimal crime and theft here. People leave their belongings in the library unattended and nothing gets stolen."
College Freshman,5,"The career center here is one of the best. People are able to get very good internships, even if they're unpaid, due to the Richmond guarantee, which is where students get up to $10 per hour for work. The alumni network is very dedicated to the University and in seeing its graduates succeed."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus because it creates a sense of community with the rest of the students. It is very easy because all classes are a short walk away. Most dorms are being redone and are nicer, but some freshman and sophomore dorms like Moore and Robins are not very nice."
College Junior,5,"We are so lucky to have wonderful, dedicated professors who really do want you to succeed. Small class sizes mean that all of your professors get to know your name and are always available for help outside of class. Many professors will also host get-togethers for students at their homes or bring students to restaurants off-campus. We have five schools total: arts & sciences, business, leadership, professional & continuing studies, and law. Students can take classes in any of these schools, which is fantastic. Registration can be stressful, as students are competing for a limited number of spots. Scholars and athletes are given priority registration, which significantly helps with the registration process. The workload is heavy, and professors expect you to put in a significant amount of time & effort outside of class."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are knowledgeable and approachable. Registration is nerve-racking. There are a lot of interesting courses if you look out for it.
College Junior,5,"People leave their laptops and phones in the library while they get dinner, that is how safe this campus is. There are few reports of sexual assault, but they usually happen in the presence of alcohol."
College Junior,5,"People get awesome jobs after graduation. Many go on to work at Deloitte, some even make over 100k for their starting salaries. Jepson Leadership and the Business schools have the highest rates of employment. High rates of people getting into graduate schools for other majors, including medical, dental, and veterinary schools."
College Junior,5,"Classes are tough, this is a great school and the professors expect a lot about you. However, I did not even know I could learn so much. I've had a couple bad professors, as there are at any school, but the majority of professors are incredible and clear."
College Junior,5,"Everyone who lives off campus regrets it, because campus housing is great. They just renovated a bunch of dorms and built new apartments for seniors. I've made some of my best friends thanks to dorms, especially my freshman year. Very high quality dorms, which I didn't realize until I visited William & Mary."
College Junior,5,"Greek life is big here- most parties are thrown by the fraternities but anybody can go. There is no housing, which really helps the inter-Greek friendships and friendships between Greek and non-Greeks. Some people think the Greek system is bad, but those people usually don't know anyone in Greek life. There are 6 sororities on campus, and 6 fraternities. Sororities don't throw parties, but fraternities host parties at the ""lodges"" every weekend. Again, anyone and everyone is welcome. 99% of Greek life is also involved in other clubs and sports teams."
College Junior,5,"University of Richmond is the best, the students are generally nice and teachers are amazing. The stereotype is rich white kids, which there are a lot of, but these students know they need to earn their own place in the world. Lots of New Jersey and Pennsylvania kids, and people generally dress nicely for class, but it is pretty much a judgment free environment. I wear Nike shorts to class every day, and nobody cares. People love Richmond, it is the perfect combination of great academics, fun, and campus/city school."
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of Richmond. The classes are interesting, my major program is full of diverse course offerings, and my professors are always engaging and really do want me to succeed. The school has also connected me to tons of opportunities in the city of Richmond and beyond that I know will help me in my career."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are doing their best under the circumstances. Online classes were dissent, at least I didn't have to deal with cliquey students."
Alum,4,Overall I enjoyed my time at Richmond. The professors want to see you succeed.  I do think there could be more diversity.
Alum,4,"My favorite parts of my time at Richmond were the professors, the gorgeous campus, and my wonderful sorority sisters in Alpha Chi Omega. I developed lifelong friendships through my involvement in Alpha Chi Omega, and made profound connections with many of the brilliant professors. The size of the campus/student body was perfect for me as well. I do wish that the school was more diverse (when I attended, 2000-2004, the student body was primarily White). Since I graduated, I know the school has focused on diversity and greater inclusion, and I am glad of that. Overall, I had a very good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I am a rising sophomore. Overall, my freshman year was good, but not great. My expectations were too high. The truth is that college is completely what you make of it. At UR resources and opportunities are plentiful. Students must take the initiative in order to have a great college experience just like at any other university. The academics are challenging, but not overwhelming. One aspect that  disappointed me was how dominating greek life is on campus and the VAST majority of frat bros/girls are rich white people who are very cliquey. (To ensure validity, this is coming from an upper-middle class white male not in a frat). I lost several close friends because they rushed frats and never hung out with me and my other friends every again... In summary, the social situation is not ideal, but you can still easily find your group of people and have a wonderful time! Other pros: the dining hall and gym are amazing and basketball games are hype! All campus workers are angels! Go Spiders!"
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at UR because of the personal connections I made. As a small liberal arts college, you get a true community atmosphere. In general, students are real go-getters, engaging in student organizations and activities. Professors really get to know their students. Overall, students are able to balance work and play."
Alum,4,Beautiful campus - great facilities and small class sizes.  Felt really safe on campus and have very fond memories of various student organized clubs and activities.
Senior,4,I liked how everyone knew each other due to the size of the school however it may seem like high school to some students. I found the academic seen great and the strong network with the nearby community as well as downtown companies a big help my Senior year.
Freshman,4,"This is a beautiful campus with faculty, staff, and students that are kind and care about each and every other member of the community. The diversity of the campus is lacking in terms of both the student body and the faculty, even though the school stresses the importance of diversity in the community and in life."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, and the staff is super helpful. Its location just outside of the city of Richmond makes it a great place to be."
Sophomore,4,Professors are all nice and willing to help with all your needs. Improvements can be made in the safety of the school. I've received multiple notifications of incidents that have occurred throughout the campus.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my time at richmond.  Although the party scene gets a little drab sometimes and there is almost no school spirit, in terms of academics, there is nowhere i would rather be.  Professors are very knowledgable about their field, and students are very passionate.  The richmond bubble is definitely real as well.  when you are on campus it's hard to get off."
Senior,4,"Bubbly campus, people don't really explore outside of the university that much. Very white school, students are separated by race and even ethnicity."
Freshman,4,"University of Richmond is a wonderful place with excellent academics and a beautiful campus. However, social order rules Greek Life and Greek life rules the party scene so get ready for High School 2.0 at UR. That being said, I've loved every second I've spent at the University and would choose to come here again in a heartbeat"
Freshman,4,The quality of the faculty and staff at the University of Richmond is superb. They are valuable resources that never fail to help students out. The greek life at the University of Richmond is a bit intimidating as it seems all social gatherings are more focused on going out and partying on the weekends.
Senior,4,"Great academics, great research opportunities, great career services. The student services are amazing, you will always get responses to your emails from departments and professors."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Richmond is beautiful, a nice small size, with a large endowment. There are so many resources and opportunities available for students and the university id pretty helpful in making your ideas actually happen. However, it has a really prominent prep-school privilege vibe that sometimes feels intimidating. The talk about the ""Richmond Bubble"" is also 100% true, it is so easy to be isolated within the campus without even realizing it. However, I love the school and wouldn't dream of leaving."
Freshman,4,"Richmond is a great school! Good academics, good people. The campus is very beautiful. The professors are punctual and kind."
Sophomore,4,"I love University of Richmond.  It has great academics, and is a small size which is great for class sizes."
Freshman,4,Classic work hard play hard school with great parties and academics. Campus is in a bubble but it's easy to get into the city if you want/need to. Professors are very dedicated and willing to help students.
Junior,4,"The University of Richmond is a great school. It has solid aspects of all major realms of college life. We have great academic departments, staffed by some really great professors. Our sports teams are well known around the country, especially our basketball teams. We have a multitude of service organizations and opportunities, allowing students to really get involved in developing the community outside the campus. Finally, the students here are very friendly and welcoming, which contributes to a great social facet of campus. I just wish for a bit more diversity in the types of organization son campus. It seems that most organizations are focused on some sort of service, are a social/professional fraternity, or are sports related. I would like to see people expressing their interests Joe and reaching out to people who might share them."
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life plays the role Greek Life should, which is to create a brother/sisterhood for those involved, create great social events(good parties) for those not involved and give back to the community(at least most of them). Even if you're on the verge of joining Greek Life, take the jump, you won't regret it."
College Junior,4,"If you're a business or leadership student, this school is among the best in the country. The size is perfect for still having a relationship with teachers and small classes yet also seeing new faces here and there. You will have a good time if you come to Richmond, and if you work hard, employers will fight over you. I had 5 internship offers this summer - career services was a huge part of that. If you are on the fence of joining greek life, do it, it will make your experience that much better."
College Junior,4,"If your in it, you will love it. I am in an academic fraternity and we have tons of fun too. If you want to get the most out of your Richmond experience, I would say join."
College Junior,4,"Really happy I came to UR, the academic quality of the institution speaks for itself. Great teachers, amazing campus, and a work hard / play hard mentality. School is dominated by Greek Life so either join or have friends involved if you want to be a social butterfly."
College Sophomore,4,As a club sport athlete I love the athletics department. Facilities are great and there is a lot of funding. However school spirit for varsity sports is extremely lacking.
College Sophomore,4,"We are always aware if there was a sexual assault, break in, or any violation that took place on campus through email. They remain on top of their game."
College Sophomore,4,Career center/service is always helpful with getting students involve with jobs and other things.
College Sophomore,4,Housing is pretty clean and spacious. Some of the housing buildings look unique.
College Sophomore,4,I made new friends in the spider community. My professors were eager to help me when I needed it and they gave me advice on how to succeed at U of R. Everyone makes you feel as if your voice is important.
College Freshman,4,"Housing is fine. There is air conditioning everywhere and the facilities are fine. You can't expect much from college dorms or apartments. Juniors and seniors generally have on-campus apartments. Gateway apartments - generally for seniors - are new and the best (4 single rooms, 2 bathrooms, common room)."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is huge and hierarchal. It feels like high school. It's not a very pure recruitment system. Your sorority/fraternity is a big part of your label, but at least a lot of people hang out across different sororities/fraternities (especially girls). Parties are inclusive to all girls anyway though. Guys, well it still pretty much is but not preferred if GDI's attend greek parties, so a lot of times GDIs will find their own groups to spend their weekends with. There is a fair amount of philanthropy done. I know fraternities help brothers get internships and jobs."
College Junior,4,"-most people drink on the weekends, but it also calm down a lot after freshman year. 

-people generally respect it if you want to stay in for whatever reason, but going out allows you to meet a lot more people. 

-I know a couple guys that smoke weed pretty regularly but generally that's unseen. 

-there are rumors that some sorority girls do coke on occasion but it's really not prevalent."
College Junior,4,"Richmond is pretty good about renovating old buildings. However, a few people (usually juniors coming back from abroad) have to live off campus because there isn't enough housing. I think the school is planning to become more selective though, because they are making new housing *nicer*, not bigger, when they easily could. In general, I love living on campus because everything you need is a 5-20 minute walk away."
College Junior,4,"Greek life isn't everything. I felt pressure during my freshmen year because a lot of my friends were rushing, but I think I would've been just as happy if I hadn't joined a sorority. It's nice to know more people, but I have friends that are independent or are in other organizations. Thetas and Kappas don't have the best rep on campus because they sometimes come off as superficial, but there are still 4 sororities are more chill and fitting if you don't want to be seen as a stereotypical sorority girl.

I'm pretty indifferent about frats. Some of the guys are kinda douchey, others are perfectly nice. If you're a dude that meets other dudes you like and they're in a frat, consider joining. If that doesn't happen, no worries. I have independent guy friends and they can still get into frat parties and have a good time. It just helps if you're extra social and know people, since they do give you free alcohol."
College Junior,4,"We have some good teams, especially the new lax team (started 3 years ago) that just beat #9 in the nation, Duke. Our basketball team is also quite well-respected. I've met people in CA, TN, and MI and told them that I go to Richmond- and they've responded, ""oh yeah, go Spiders!"" 

On campus, on the other hand, there's not a big turn out for games (except when we play our neighborhood rival VCU.) People are too busy studying, sleeping or doing other things on the weekend."
College Junior,4,"Pretty much anyone can have access to alcohol and even weed. If you want something more, you'll have to look a little harder, but it can be found. However, there is very little pressure to partake in any form of drug or alcohol use, and students don't treat those who choose to abstain differently. The police are not looking to bust students, they mostly just want to make sure that students are safe."
College Junior,4,"I have never felt unsafe being alone at night on campus. The police truly care about the well-being of students and are not looking to get people into trouble, just to make sure that they get home safely. There is an emergency number you can call and blue lights all over campus that you could use if you ever do feel unsafe, however. If a crime does occur on campus, UR emails all students about it."
College Junior,4,"Great professors who truly care about their students and have a passion for what they teach - they are always open to talk to students and give any extra help they can. There are tons of different courses offered, especially given the size of the school, and most classes are fewer than 25 students. The school could improve the class registration process, however."
College Junior,4,"About half of girls and a third of guys are involved in greek life, but whether or not you join a greek organization will not hugely affect your social life dramatically. Frat parties are open to pretty much everyone, and many non-affiliated persons come to socials help by fraternities and sororities. There isn't any official greek housing available at school, but each organization has a lodge (for the frats) or a cottage (for the sororities) for hanging out or hosting events."
College Junior,4,"The facilities available are great - clean, lots of equipment, and plenty of staff on hand at the gym. The varsity sports are not very well attended, but lots of students participate in club and intramural sports. Aside from our basketball team's successes, people are proud to say that they attend Richmond, but mostly because of the academic and social reputation of our school rather than the athletic reputation."
College Freshman,4,"Classes and grades really do depend on the teacher you get, and some are easier than others. All of the courses I have taken here have been very informative and interesting. The class sized are generally 15. Teachers get to know their students and attendance is important."
College Freshman,4,"As a varsity golfer, I believe that the athletic facilities are very nice. However, student involvement lacks, as very few students regularly attend sporting events. Team performances are always good and the University always has success in tournaments or games. School spirit for sports lacks."
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Richmond has been great. It has been a big transition from high school, but the teachers help to make it more manageable. Socially, it is tough to integrate yourself if you do not know anyone before coming here."
College Sophomore,4,Faces are diverse. A lot of people are rich. There are poor people as well.
College Sophomore,4,UR has a lot of different resources and training for students to prevent crimes and work with victims.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty good housing I would say.
College Sophomore,4,Greeks are party people. Some none greeks are as well.
College Sophomore,4,"Not everybody attends but a lot of people still attend the events.

The gym is great and engaging."
College Sophomore,4,"Medium sized but has good business school , liberal arts, and other schools that you might be interested in.

Very beautiful campus with lots of resource. Very good career services."
College Junior,4,"Campus is an extremely safe place. I never feel scared walking across campus alone, even at night. When people have stuff stolen, it's usually because they left their room unlocked."
College Junior,4,"As an RA on campus, I have had a very positive housing experience because I don't have to go through the normal housing selection process. The decision to switch to the StarRez system has made housing extremely difficult for some people, and the school is at absolute maximum capacity in terms of space. The best dorms are generally regarded as Lakeview, Westhampton, and Gateway. The worst dorms are generally regarded as Moore, Marsh, and South."
College Freshman,4,"FYS's are annoying, but everyone has to take them. Registration is very stressful and competitive. The workload is relatively heavy, but manageable if you manage your time well. Most people go to the various libraries on campus to study."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not going to lie. There are sexual assaults that happen on campus. But unfortunately, there is not a single school that there aren't. I feel as though Richmond cares about the safety of its students and will provide support for any that are affected by sexual assault, or any crime."
College Freshman,4,"Although I've only taken one FYS, it was a terrible class. I haven't heard that many people say that they enjoyed theirs. But, they are classes for first years and are taken before you can really take any classes that will count toward your major."
College Freshman,4,"My dorm is very nice for it being a freshman dorm. The rooms are a fairly adequate size and are pretty nice. One of my only complaints is that it is separated from all the other freshman dorms (it's on the opposite side of campus). I know that the different sections and floors of my dorm have very different experiences socially. My section (one wing of one floor) is not the closest, but everyone is very friendly to each other and many of the girls are very good friends with each other. Two of my very best friends live just a few doors down from me. As for the housing process, it was very easy as a freshman. I know that for upperclassmen, it goes by a lottery system, but I don't know too much about it."
College Freshman,4,"While it is definitely possible that Richmond would not be a good fit for some people, I think it is a very good match for me. I've only been there for a semester, but I have had almost nothing but good experiences there."
College Freshman,4,"Freshman dorms are notoriously bad, but it improves! And honestly the dorms aren't that bad. People just like to complain. We really should have water fountains in every building though."
College Freshman,4,"Maybe we should install more blue lights, but generally I feel safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"As a first semester freshman, I've already aligned job shadowing with an alumna I met at an University event. I feel confident in finding internships and a job after graduation."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a pretty huge of Richmond campus culture. Sorority cottages and frat lodges are a great idea.
Sophomore,2,"The academic of UR is really great, but if you are a minority I wouldn't recommend this school. The large majority if students, staff, and professors are white and the school atmosphere is not very inclusive toward non-white students."
Sophomore,2,"Their financial aid office is full of unfulfilled promises. The school itself is that. They try to act like they are inclusive of different types of people, cultures, & socio-economic backgrounds but they aren't. They don't take any actual action for the very much so present racism and classism on campus. Their financial aid office tries to mask itself in the fact that it is 100% meets need but they don't ever go the extra mile to understand the very real financial circumstances of their students."
Sophomore,2,"On paper, the University of Richmond looks like an amazing school, but do not trust it AT ALL. I can think of one or two good things about the school, but if you want to be truly happy, PLEASE LOOK ELSEWHERE."
Alum,2,"I wish I knew more about the culture before. While financial aid is great, most students pay sticker price. There are events that serve to benefit the wealthy only. The abroad office like Richmond to seem worldly since 75% study abroad but it is because most students can afford it. As well, the abroad office says you can get reimbursed for expenses, but majority of your expenses would not be reimbursed.  If you are not abroad in the fall, it kinda sucks. Ring dance is another example. You do not have to book a suite but it makes the night SO much better. But suites can cost up to 2 grand or more, excluding the poor minority. Cant complain about academics or professors or the dining hall, but can say the party scene gets repetitive, no one has school spirit, and campus security does not help. ROI is low since if you are not looking in Richmond or NYC."
College Sophomore,2,"Students don't support the football team, which is the best team won campus and it's annoying."
College Sophomore,2,"The entire social scene revolves around Greek life. This is great if you find your perfect match but creates for a very negative experience if you don't. Rush is dirty and competitive. If you are preppy, upperclass, and from a well connected boarding school in the Northeast you will thrive. Good luck to everyone else."
College Junior,2,"The facilities are good, and the teams experience modest amounts of success. However, from the view of a fan/student, it can be very disappointing. First off, not many people show up to events and games. Second, there is almost no student tailgating before most games. Third, there is very little school spirit. From the lack of a pep band at football games to the low attendance to people not wearing colors to support their team, there is just not much atmosphere."
College Junior,2,"The police are fine, but the students often get so drunk that they damage property and make fools of themselves. I am fine with lax enforcement of alcohol policies, but they are so unenforced that people get really drunk and run around the dorms breaking things, often with little punishment! It is known that sexual assaults/harassment are not taken all that seriously."
College Junior,2,"People here go hard and make themselves look like fools. I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. They get destructive and act like idiots. They go hard like it is some huge party school, but there is actually nothing to do."
College Junior,2,"The lodges are disgusting. You really just want to get off campus to do anything. Greek life goes hard, but it does not seem very fun. They just get destructive and foolish."
College Junior,2,"You have to get off campus to do anything cool. Two stars because at least you can get off campus.

The lodges are disgusting and not very good party places."
College Junior,2,"Not as incredibly white as it was. Still very rich, very Northern, apathetic towards people aside from themselves. 

Politically extremely apathetic. 

Pretty good on LGBT issues. 

The Coordinate College System is an issue though, and is condescending towards women. For some reason, only social fraternities get ""lodges"" (read: Party spaces)"
College Junior,2,"I think it is really dumb that there are no Greek houses. Other schools have these nice areas where they can throw parties at the houses, while Richmond has disgusting ""lodges"" that never get properly cleaned because they are just for parties. Houses are much better.

 The Greek people, especially guys, tend to get so wasted that they get destructive, and the dorms have indications of this. 

Generally Greek life is very visible on campus, but they are also worse at this school than they are at others. If you really want good Greek Life, go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything is too expense for colege students to rent so the closest places to rent are a good gift eve minutes away. Plus, since everyone lives on campus you miss out on top much if you live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't heard of many people living off campus, except when coming back from abroad in the Spring. It is not ideal."
College Sophomore,2,The administration sucks when it comes to organizing events  (see Ring Dance) and gauging the desires of the student body. They make a lot of really poor decisions that anger the general student body.
College Sophomore,2,Most students live on-campus all four years. I don't know much about off-campus housing options because it really isn't necessary.
College Freshman,2,Off campus housing really isn't a thing. Unless you are in a fraternity you will not have much reason to live of campus throughout all 4 years here at UR. If you do decide to live off campus the only real options are renting a house with 3 or 4 other people.
College Freshman,2,"The services are there to help victims of sexual assault but because of the rampant party scene, the school has a seemingly endless amount of assaults. The administration works very hard to stay on top of it and support victims but the alcohol scene and unwillingness of bystanders is counter productive."
College Freshman,2,Only the frats can throw parties and the sororities don't even have houses and aren't allowed to have parties. All parties must be registered through the University which is easy to do. The Sororities are more for the philanthropy while the frats exist purely for parties.
Alum,1,I never took any online classes at this university. If they offered any of those classes I did not know about it.
Sophomore,1,"Racism in this school influences so many students, especially students who are marginalized. Countless incidents regarding sexual assaults and racism occur and even though there are so many students who are reporting their experience and reaching out to faculties and offices to share about how insecure they feel, the issues of segregation, racism, and harassment are still a strong feature of UR campus. People who express offensive behaviors and uncomfortable verbal abuse vary from students and faculties and personally speaking, it felt very unclear on how I can get support from a school that has professors who are also involved incidents. I ended up transferring from this campus due to the ignorance, apathy, and careless atmosphere that was felt by most of the minorities. If you are currently considering this school, I really hope this message will reach you and help you in your college decision."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is as cliquey as it gets. Girls in top sororities even exclude eachother. Rush is dirty and without connections you have little chance.
College Junior,1,"I transferred. I did not like the people at all, and now that I am at a different school in Virginia I have so many more caring, empathetic, generous, and involved people. The academics were not very good for my majors. The people seem to think it is the best, but it fails in many basic areas: school spirit, activism, discussion of serious issues, musical ensembles, music in general, artistic expression, a sense of community, etc. 

I wish I had not come, and I am very glad that I transferred.

Financial aid was good, but my other school (a PUBLIC school) has offered me better aid than Richmond ever did. Also, what is the point of financial aid if you don't like what you ended up getting?

Don't price yourself like you are Harvard or Columbia when you are the University of Richmond."
College Freshman,1,No student fan section. its bad.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office fought the process with me and denied my request to waive the non custodial parent information which immensely hurt my financial aid eligibility.
College Sophomore,1,Makes the university seem more so like high school
College Sophomore,1,"Bottom line: the diversity at UR is a joke. The majority of the campus is comprised of rich, spoiled, conservative, racist clones. Seriously, i'm so sick of seeing guys wearing salmon-colored khakis and girls dressing like 40-year old trophy wives. ENOUGH WITH THE LONGCHAMPS AND JACK ROGERS. All my friends who belong to a minority basically want to transfer schools, myself included."
College Junior,1,You will get a ticket. You have no hope. Assigned lots are very far from dorm.
College Sophomore,1,"If You Don't Have a Car, You're Poor – It sounds terrible but this campus notices these things. Furthermore, without transportation you're forced to order supplies or stuff for your room either online or bum a ride from a friend. They won't be your friend for long if you keep asking for rides. 
That being said, if you have a car you're the star of the show - because of the reasons listed above. 
The university recently got zipcars so that's good, but no one and I mean no one takes Univeristy provided transportation... Unless you're ""poor""
Oh, and parking on campus sucks. Follow @URparkingguy"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of the housing in the area is very expensive, and because most of the excitement happens on-campus, off-campus students miss out on a lot of fun experiences.  However, it is cheaper than living on-campus if you don't have financial aid, and you don't get sucked into the campus bubble.  If you can afford it, I recommend it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bad Choice for Education – The workload is insane.  You can go to another school, take the exact same class, do half the busywork, pay A LOT less tuition, and still get a valid college degree. Faculty members are often demening and although they are usually friendly and work hard to make the experience good, they expect you to respect them at all times, even when they make stupid mistakes regarding things such as academic advising (academic advising problems arise a lot more than they should for a school this small), student housing issues, and unfair grades.

Housing is dusgusting, water in at least one dorm is always cold.  If you want descent housing you have to apply for a special program and take an extra class.  It costs the same as all the other housing.

Students are cliquy and drink way too much.  Greek life and sports rule the school.  If you don't participate in one or both of these, it's difficult to get acknowledgment from peers and staff members.

There is no diversity. Most of the students are upper-middle-class 18-22 year olds.

If you are a working-class student it's impossible to juggle the workload and a job.

No flexibility in scheduling.  You get what you get and often times it isn't what you need/want to graduate, or your classes are spread out throughout the entire day so you have no time for a job or extra-curricular activities.  There are also a rediculous number of adminsitrative hurdles to jump over just to even get signed up for a lot of the classes.

Not enough parking (and they are demolishing lots as we speak)

The only good things about the school are the student employment opportunities, the financial aid program, and the pretty campus, although they spend a lot of unnecessary money on beautification.



"
College Junior,1,"Parking at Richmond can be a nightmare, not only is it difficult to find a spot, but the parking police rack up many tickets when students do not park in their correct lot."

Senior,5,"I've been a student at Bethany for over 3 years now and I have loved the community I've been able to be a part of here. The close knit, Christian environment has helped me develop myself and grow in so many different ways."
Senior,5,"Although most of my college classes were in person (even during COVID), I did take a couple online courses. The professors were very helpful and available if I had any additional questions from what they were teaching and posting on our online classroom."
Sophomore,5,"The online classes I took were as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although I never intended to take online classes, the professors were very flexible and helpful. The classroom online was very effective and I continued to learn just as well as I did when I was in the classroom. I would consider taking online classes in the summer as a result of this."
Alum,5,"I consider myself very blessed to have been able to attend Bethany. I met fantastic people on campus - some of my dearest friends - and I know Bethany's education really set me up for success. I was able to double major (and minor), study abroad, get a good internship in Mankato, and land a full-time job before I had even graduated (all while participating in numerous extracurricular activities). Every single one of my professors at Bethany knew me by my first name, and I was able to pursue what I loved in so many areas! Bethany may not have all the bells and whistles of larger universities, but it has something way more important: faculty and staff who pour their hearts and souls into their students and go out of their way to serve you. The community at Bethany is super tight-knit and full of passionate learners, and THAT is the finest thing you can find in higher ed. I wouldn't trade my Bethany education for anything."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at BLC has been rewarding in so many ways.  I have found a solid friend group, future career opportunities, and a faith based community that thrives off of God's Word. Yes, everyplace has it's pit-falls, but Bethany cares about students's education and spiritual growth and my Profs have my best interest in mind!"
Sophomore,5,"I love that the more you do on campus, from going to different athletic events to theater performance and choir and band performances, you get to know and meet so many people who become some of the best friends you will ever have in your life. The location is also awesome because there is so much to do, everything is reachable from the cities an hour plus north, to different hiking and walking areas as well."
Alum,5,"First rate college experience that fosters academic, physical, and academic growth that prepares students (and prepared me) from across the globe for their professional lives in the workforce and for eternal life as well."
Junior,5,Bethany has opened many doors for me and have made my plans for after undergraduate schooling more secure and achievable! The campus is full of smiling faces and the professors are great at being available for help on either small items or bigger items.
Junior,5,"As an out-of-state student, it was very important to me that the place I attended school felt like home. Bethany Lutheran College ended up being the perfect place for me. You will not find kinder students, staff, and professors anywhere else. They take ""Minnesota Nice"" to a new level, and they have made me feel welcomed and valued from day 1."
Alum,5,"This is such an incredible institution. The dorms are always well kept. The Old Main building is the home of the cafeteria, student union, computer labs and even a ""coffee shop"" where live performances take place. The gym and soccer field are also very neat. I also love the student to teacher ratio. You are more than just a number there."
Niche User,5,"Three of my children are Bethany grads, a teacher, a registered nurse, and a soon to be physician assistant PA.  They all received a superior education and grew into fine Christian adults.  Bethany was worth every penny."
Sophomore,5,I love this campus. The environment is very friendly and the professors are very professional and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Bethany Lutheran College is a great school for those who are Christians and are seeking a religion-based education. They offer a high quality education, and the community is very close as it is a small school. This school would not be ideal for someone who is not as focused on their studies."
Senior,5,"Bethany Lutheran College has been a new experience with it's highs and lows. I went here to play soccer and I got to play it at a college level. I got to figure out what I wanted to do with my life with all the new people I met and that have changed my life for the better. I joined the fine arts portion of the college and just fell for it. It's a school with so many beautiful and amazing things about it that you can't just talk about one thing. It's has strengths and weakness as we all do, but at the end of the day it becomes a home for all people no matter where you come from."
Sophomore,5,"I love the Christian focus of Bethany. The professors are always kind and willing to help. The students are always friendly, too."
Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is extremely nice. After my first year, I have made so many friends without really even trying too. The professors all want you to succeed and will help you out in anyway."
Sophomore,5,I like how the campus feels like a family. Everyone smiles and is super helpful. The professors know you and are willing to make time to help you with whatever you need.
Freshman,5,"Bethany Lutheran College is a quaint, peaceful school with fantastic professors and staff. It is a tight knit community and everyone feels like a part of it. Whether you're part of sports, theatre, or just trying to get your degree, Bethany will get you there."
Junior,5,"BLC is a wonderful school.  The student to teacher ratio is a great benefit as I am able to get one-on-one treatment.  The athletic program is a great plus as well.  It provides students to be able to associate with other students from different states, backgrounds, etc. and to expand socially with others at the college.  I love it here."
Sophomore,5,Bethany Lutheran College has given me a different outlook on life and how I am able to change the world from using my heart and mind in everything I do. This university helps people become not only classmates but friends. It's small and a very friendly environment for no matter who comes here.
Sophomore,5,"This place is one of those small, unsuspecting, rare gems in a big city. There are so many things being done right at Bethany. The atmosphere is  refreshing because you feel warm and welcome no matter your background. I have not met a single professor who is not passionate about his or her practice. Because of the people and the atmosphere I am continually inspired to be a better human and push myself to explore the gifts and talents I was blessed with."
Freshman,5,"Within my first semester here at Bethany, I have learned so much about music (my major) and about myself. The professors here are always very helpful. The dormitories are very nice and the people around campus are always so kind."
College Senior,5,"Athletics are very important to many students who attend Bethany. Even though there are no athletic scholarships granted, hundreds of students participate in sports and intramural sports across campus. All sports are publicized on campus and many people attend events to support the competing teams. The athletic trainers are fantastic and are extremely important for the athletes on campus to have access to."
College Senior,5,"Bethany Lutheran College provides a fantastic learning environment that is accommodating to current students and prospective students. The atmosphere of the college is positive and inviting. The students, faculty, and staff are friendly and are always helpful. I am fortunate to be able to attend Bethany, as it was my first choice college, and have made so many memories on the cross country and track teams and also in the classroom. I would definitely choose to attend Bethany if I had to choose to attend college again."
College Freshman,5,"Aside from the people who drink and do drugs, everyone on campus is kind and respectful."
College Freshman,5,"No one here does drugs, and very, very few people drink."
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe when walking around campus even late at night or early in the morning. The security are very nice and are always a presence that is noticed, which helps in feeling safe."
College Freshman,5,"The campus community is extremely safe, with very few exceptions. Currently, and this is a rare and unfortunate occurrence, I have been dealing with some issues that have arisen with a classmate basically stalking me. The administration has been really great during this whole process, and they are working on fixing this problem. I am very grateful for how supportive they have been."
College Freshman,5,I love Bethany! It's really easy to get involved on campus.
College Junior,5,"Drugs are strictly prohibited, and there is no pressure to drink or take drugs."
College Junior,5,"There are a huge variety of courses, and they are always adding more."
College Sophomore,5,So many parties at MSU
College Sophomore,5,"There are a variety of places to eat and it ranges from italian to mongolian to mexican. All places are delicious and most will even have a student discount. Some personal favorites would be Chipotle, Bakers square, Godfathers, and erberts and gerberts."
College Sophomore,5,Lots of Differences – There are people here from all walks of life and there are many backgrounds and colors.
College Sophomore,5,"They Have Security Trucks? Bethany has no public transportation system really, only the security trucks that will give you a ride from the parking lot if the weather is bad or you're scared in the dark."
College Sophomore,5,It's a Great Place – I love being at Bethany because I make all kinds of friends and it's in a Christian environment which I realized I really needed. The teachers are always willing to help you with things and everyone can get along well enough to study and get it done. I'm so glad I picked Bethany.
College Freshman,5,"Parking permits are cheap in comparison to other local campuses, especially for students who commute. Parking lots are close. Street parking is often not much farther than a couple blocks away and is usually pretty close. Streets can't be parked on in snow emergencies, but parking lots are around the same distance and offer you a spot for sure for a low price."
College Freshman,5,"There are both Macs and PCs on campus and it's almost always possible to grab a computer that you like. Computer lab is also almost always open, for those who do late-night homework. 
Printing is free in black and white. If you need color printing, there are options for that if you talk to the IT people."
College Freshman,5,"Feel Like I Learn a Lot – I'm in the Biology major. Instructors don't spoon feed answers, and promote learning with your own brain. Study tips are always helpful and classes and labs are almost always fun and exciting. Professors will learn who you are and interact outside of class as well."
College Junior,5,"Boys... <3 – Boys? Mmm... usually pretty sexy. There's a lot of different kinds, but most of them are at least cute. Also, they're almost all really sweet. Helpful too - I got my wheelchair stuck in a snowbank one day, and a guy helped me out within a minute. Now he walks me to that class twice a week :-)"
Sophomore,4,"Professional, yet friendly faculty. The cafeteria food could improve, or at least have a variety of meal plans. It is easy to be involved in the arts, even if you have a different major."
Sophomore,4,"Most professors adapted well to online learning. As a biochemistry major, I am thankful to have in-person classes again, as labs were only possible virtually last spring."
Sophomore,4,Online instruction is never ideal. My professors did good job trying to incorporate online students as much as possible.
Sophomore,4,"Bethany offers a great Christian liberal arts education. You get to build your knowledge, skills, and in faith. Friendly people and professors as well.

As a Media Arts student, I've had tons of opportunities to get hands-on experience creating things starting freshman year. There is a great community of student artists on campus which is really valuable as a creative. If you want to make things, Bethany can give you the tools to do so.

There is a decent amount of diversity on campus as well. Lots of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries."
Sophomore,4,I like the fact that it is a small college and you have a personal relationship with the teachers. also the fact that you get to meet people from all over the world and learn about other cultures. yeahhh
Sophomore,4,I like Bethany because it is small college and personal relationship with teachers and the fact that it is a christian college and the college life is good
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy how the college is smaller, especially as a person who graduated from a very small school. The students have the opportunity to form personal relationships with the professors, and have access to many excellent resources such as studios, labs, and professional equipment. BLC also has excellent staff, and very diverse, friendly students. Housing is very nice and affordable, and you get to know people from all over the world. The sports programs are wonderful, and the christian value of the school holds true overall."
Freshman,4,"Overall good campus and education, very homey, but with a small campus comes to light small problems on a bigger scale"
Sophomore,4,"Small college, cozy, comfortable, connected. Busy college town, nice food, nightlife, neat places.The professors are helpful and engaging and actually want you to succeed. Class sizes are small which adds to the quality of education. Cafeteria food is okay, but not great. The campus is quite small so it's easy to get from building to building, and you'll become familiar with nearly every face you meet. If you're looking for a college where everyone's pleasant and generally minds their own business, and has sports and study places and little clubs for everyone, this is it. The campus looks welcoming and feels safe. There are always several nighttime security on duty, and a quick phone call will get you a ride to your car or dorm any time.I attended as a post secondary high school student, and was accepted and fit quite comfortably in among the students, easy pace and class sizes. I likely will be attending Bethany for my college career and recommend it."
College Senior,4,"The housing is pretty good with spacious rooms. My only complaint is that the girls dorms (and Tiegen Hall) are not air conditioned and get very hot during the early fall semester and late spring. The atmosphere is generally good and the RAs are great people, both for the guys and girls."
College Freshman,4,"Bethany is a dry campus, so it's not very visible, but there are people who sneak it in."
College Freshman,4,"RAs were great in Gully! However, my hall always smelled like marijuana, thanks to some basketball guys living there, and nothing was done about it ever."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are good. Curriculums are good, professors are helpful and very knowledgeable about their field."
College Freshman,4,"We leave our backpacks in this hallway by the Caf, and no one's stuff has been taken."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't done an internship through here, but the programs for it are very good."
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are small, largest class I've had had 30 people. Professors are very knowledgeable."
College Freshman,4,"Never lived in the dorms yet, but I've seen them and they look fairly nice. People that I've talked to say they're great."
College Freshman,4,Professors are very approachable and are knowledgeable in there subjects. Always willing to help students outside of class. Class sizes are small so you get into good discussions.
College Freshman,4,"Overall I have had a great experience living in the dorms, the people here are great, the RA's are fantastic, and in my opinion it is the only way to go to college freshman year. Very clean and the AC is very nice in the fall when it is warm."
College Freshman,4,"Many opportunities to get involved in NCAA Division III athletic teams who have great coaches. There are a large number of IM sports that are offered and a lot of fun to compete in. They are competitive, yet still fun to play with friends."
College Freshman,4,"Overall I have had a great experience at Bethany Lutheran College. The teachers are very helpful and accessible. The atmosphere at BLC is unlike any other where you get to know almost everyone, and everyone is friendly. There is opportunity to become involved in a wide variety of groups or clubs and I have kept very busy."
College Senior,4,"Bethany is a very uneventful campus, which makes me feel safe when walking alone at night.  You can call security if you want an escort to your car at night, which is great."
College Senior,4,"My campus living experience was great, because I was provided with a good room and the lottery system works out nicely.  But, some of the guy dorms are not in good shape (Teigan)."
College Freshman,4,"The housing is really great, especially Anderson Hall, which is for mainly underclassmen women. It's located on the top three floors of Old Main, so it's basically in the same building as the bookstore, the cafeteria, the registrar, the business office, and a lot of other stuff."
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of diversity, mostly in economic background but there is also noticeable ethnic and political diversity as well."
College Junior,4,There are lots of great places to study.  Every building has lounges that are quiet and comfortable for studying.
College Junior,4,"The security services to a great job of making students feel safe, and they are always ready to help if there is a problem."
College Junior,4,"In most departments, it is not hard for students find internships."
College Junior,4,All the dorms are within easy walking distance from the rest of campus.
College Junior,4,"If I could do it all over, I would choose Bethany again.  The professors are approachable, experienced, and eager to help their students.  There are a variety of programs to choose from, and it's just a great atmosphere for learning."
College Senior,4,"I very much enjoy that my school is small enough that I know practically everyone I see on a daily basis. There are plenty of extracurricular activities, of which I have done violin lessons, string band, choir, intramural sports, and the activities committee. I do wish that the school had a football team but it has made me get involved in music more anyway. My school is unique because it is a private Lutheran college and everyone is super friendly."
College Sophomore,4,The v is pretty good
College Sophomore,4,I love the women's housing on campus.
College Junior,4,"Very easy to get into desired programs, some paper work and a few interviews but no sweat."
College Junior,4,"Even though going through a restructuring, it provides a lot to students looking at communication and prepares people for many fields. Workload is not strenuous but difficult, lot of high concepts to consider."
College Junior,4,Well care for facilities. There are also many club offerings and opportunities to get involved. During non-winter months lots of outdoor space to play.
College Junior,4,"My major has a lot of opportunity to it to be applied in many different fields. As a liberal arts college, it does a lot to develop a well rounded education and ensures students leave with the best education they can get. With it being a small college, I can have a great relationships with my professors and some of the connections the college has can open up some interesting doors. "
College Junior,4,"Compared to a lot of the other colleges I visited, the rooms, especially in the upperclassmen halls, have a lot of space and things to do. If a student, like me, is involved in a lot of activities, this really helps make life move smoothly. "
College Junior,4,The people here really help to make the experience all that it can be for students. They are willing to accommodate students needs and it is easy to set up an appointment with someone in Fin Aid. They are great and helpful people. 
College Junior,4,They are a little bit of a walk or drive but there are a good number of places. The really good places are either downtown or by the mall and it is not really worth going there everyday. A few restaurants close to school provide good variety of food.
College Sophomore,4,It is a dry campus so there is little to no alcohol actually on campus. Those who do drink underage are very few and the of age students sometimes have it. Partying is not as big of a deal here.
College Sophomore,4,"Time commitment is a very big thing at Bethany. If you are committed to your academics and you try your hardest, Professors and Staff will try their hardest to help you with anything you need. If your not committed they are not going to be as willing to help you out. It is your responsibility for your academics and taking care of yourself. I have not had an internship, but I do plan on having one my junior or senior year. Internships are a great way to experience the field or job you want to enter, and get the feeling of it. I do not have any concerns about finding an internship. The Staff and Professors at Bethany are always willing to help you find internships, and I know they will help me find a great internship."
College Senior,4,Extremely up to date computers. PCs and Macs in many different computer labs. Printing capability is easy and everywhere. Whether its from the labs or from your own computer.
College Freshman,4,With security officers like Buck how could it not?
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of good options around like chain restaurants and local restaurants
College Freshman,4,the academics here are great. they are centered around the student learning and the professors are great. lots of choices for classes for whatever field of study you might go into
College Freshman,4,"we are a close knit bunch. you see the same persons maybe three or four times a day and you may not have a single class with them. the people are friendly. but the city has a lot to offer to. lots of good restaurants, a mall and we have the wow zone not to far away"
College Junior,4,"Overall, Great! There are a lot of choices most nights.  Weekends can be skimpy.  It's great that they have a rotation bar to try to change things up, but it still can get boring.  They try out new food every month, which is great."
College Junior,4,"Pretty Good – There are usually computers available when I need them, both Macs and PCs and reliable.  Internet in the dorms isn't the greatest because the reception isn't very good in some rooms."
College Junior,4,Friendly and Helpful – I like that I can go in and talk to someone in the financial aid office anytime and they sincerely want to help answer any questions I have.
College Sophomore,4,"Best of Both Worlds – The nice thing about Bethany is that you get a quality, personal education without the huge cost of most private colleges. I know all my teachers outside the classroom and they know me by name.The class sizes are small and you really get to know people. BLC is just 2 miles away from a Minnesota State University too, so you get the big college town feel too. I don't think I'd go for BLC if MSU wasn't down the street, but as it stands I feel like I get the MSU campus life with the private college education."
College Freshman,4,"Student Center – The student union is a great place to hang out with your friends. With a grill to eat dinner or grab a snack, a movie and game room, and a coffee shop are great places to relax or have fun when not studying."
College Freshman,4,"Great So Far – Financial advisers are helpful and willing to meet and discuss options. I haven't needed aid yet as I am part of a PSEO program, but I am working on it for the future years. So far it has been a pleasant experience. Not much info provided on finding outside scholarships, but a lot on ones within the college and state."
College Freshman,4,"Mankato's Area Attractions – Mankato has a lot to offer for the outdoor individual. There are numerous bike trails to ride. There are over 50 lakes in the surrounding area to enjoy swimming, boating, or fishing. There is a small petting zoo for little kids at Sibley Park. There are several state parks in the area for hiking and exploring. There is  a lot of history in the area to find out about. It is just the right size of community that it offers most areas of business a big city would have. A person doesn't have to deal with any traffic jams or rush hours. Most places are easily accessible within 5- 15 minutes. Overall, it is a nice community to live in and raise a family."
College Junior,4,"The attitude towards students... well, depends on whether or not you clarify what college. Sometimes MSU students aren't too good. But Bethany seems to have a great reputation.
And there's a bunch of options for area attractions and all that. River Hills Mall, tons of shopping places, a theater, WowZone, etc.. 
.. and of course, sports teams. i don't really care, but it's nice for some."
College Junior,4,"Public transportation around Bethany is mostly un-needed. It's a really teeny campus, and people without wheelchairs (or with chairs, but good shoulders) probs would have no problem. I have crappy shoulders, but I've also got friends to help when I need it."
College Freshman,4,"Snowy, but the Tunnels Help. Since it is Minnesota, there is a fair amount of snow in the winter, but most of the main buildings are connected by an underground, heated tunnel, and the campus itself is small enough that you can get anywhere on it without much trouble."
College Junior,4,Just about everyone you meet at Bethany is willing to be your friend. There should be not problem finding a group that you get along well with.
College Freshman,4,We have a couple parking lots that are within walking distance of the student housing. There is nothing adjacent to the dorms at all. The lots are close and secure.
College Junior,4,"Only a Few Minor Problems – Bethany Lutheran College is fairly strict as colleges go. This contributes to a feeling of safety for those attending.  Alcohol is not allowed. Knives are allowed up to three inches. The strictest rules are the dorm hours, which are fairly limited due to limited availability of RA's. This doesn't interrupt study time, though, and gives students a chance to sleep at night."
College Freshman,2,"Again, it's not a party school. People have gatherings, but MSU has the actual parties."
College Freshman,2,"There's quite a bit of diversity in economic background, and some racial/ethnic diversity. Practically everyone here is Christian and conservative, so no diversity there.

The school has a Title IX exemption for religious reasons, so if you're LGBT, don't come here. If the school finds out you're LGBT, they force you to go through ""religious counseling."" If you refuse, I think they could kick you out of the school."
College Senior,2,"Advisors do not work with students to get them potential jobs after graduation and there are rarely employers recruiting on campus.  The requirement of an internship for many majors is great, because knowledge learned and experience gained from internships is more valuable than classes."
College Senior,2,"Nobody goes to sporting events unless they are part of the team.  Students have to be bribed to go to them, and even when that happens, only about 10 students show up.  It would be great if we had a football team, because students would actually go to those games and have a sense of school spirit."
College Junior,2,I don't know about off campus living
College Junior,2,"Some labs have certain hours, others open 24/7"
College Junior,2,There are a bunch of things to do in the area
College Junior,2,Not much flexibility once you get into the major
College Freshman,2,"Of the three main computer labs one (PCs and Macs) is open 24/7.  The computers are new, and the speed is generally pretty good, but there are newer and faster computers in the other labs. Unfortunately, those close at 10:30 pm and aren't always open on the weekends. The WiFi is always present in the dorms, but it is VERY weak (unless, of course, you stay over midterm break!)"
College Freshman,2,"Lots of White Students – Most of the students are white. There are not many african americans there, and not too many other ethnicities."
College Senior,2,"snow on our campus is not good, seems its not plowed and hard to get around it. also in summer or when its still hott out i should say, there no AC in dorms and they get super hot and very uncomfortable."
College Junior,2,"You get fined $100 for just being ""in the presence"" of alcohol on campus....."
College Junior,2,"The Bethany Standard – It sounds terrible to say, but there has been much discussion amongst the guys of BLC about how attending this college exposes you to the Bethany standard. The Bethany standard is the dropping of one's standards when looking for an attractive female on campus, due to the lack of attractive girls compared to the number of attractive women that one might see in every day life off of BLC's campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,Who Knows? Financial aid lacked communication. They kept telling me different things and couldn't get their act together.
College Freshman,2,"There Isn't Much Around – We do have a bus system here to bring church go-ers to Mount Olive, but other than that find a willing friend or get your own car."
Alum,1,"If you are a part of any marginalized group, I would strongly suggest that you find another school to attend. This place gets away with mistreating a lot of people. It is definitely not the place I would want representing my religion and faith. However, if you are white and straight (specifically male), this will be the perfect place!"
Alum,1,"If you are a part of any marginalized group, I would strongly suggest that you find another school to attend. This place gets away with mistreating a lot of people. It is definitely not the place I would want representing my religion and faith. However, if you are white and straight (specifically male), this will be the perfect place!"
College Freshman,1,"The school itself has no ""party scene,"" that's nearby MSU. There are a few bars in Mankato."
College Junior,1,"No such life exists, we have seminary and non-seminary but sem students are a lot of fun."
College Junior,1,"The cafeteria has limited hours, but other options"
College Junior,1,"there is nothing for bethany, at least that i know of. I wish there was some kind of sorority just so I could be more involved in stuff. MSU though has plenty"
College Freshman,1,"Okay but Never Good – There isn't much to eat around campus. The cook will try to change up the menu, but nothing really tastes that good that you want to go back for seconds."
College Sophomore,1,"Almost all following information is specific only to Teigen Hall, the freshman male dormitories:

Quite frankly, I was not satisfied with Bethany's housing. Living in Teigen Hall was nearly unbearable, as far as social atmosphere was concerned. I would guess that half of the people on my floor were a violent, unpredictable bunch, with no regard for their neighbors (as evidenced by blasting music in the showers' radio at six in the morning, so loud that it can be heard through in the dorm room furthest from the showers) or the facilities (as evidenced by the apple cores, bagels, and other trash left in the hallways and stairwells). To be fair, Teigen is the guy's dorm, but students ARE made to live in the dorms for their first two years at Bethany -- you have no choice, it's Teigen for 1st year males, Anderson for 1st year females. The internet in Teigen is also very poor, and it's supposed to have the best internet of any dorm house on campus.

It wasn't so bad otherwise. The rooms come with no AC, but they do have sinks in them."

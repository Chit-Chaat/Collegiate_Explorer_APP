Niche User,5,"My most favorite part about Wesleyan is the small campus. I go to school in a small town, so going to visit Wesleyan was like walking through the streets of my home town.  The campus was small but the people were absolutely outstanding in the aspect that whatever I needed/need help with there is always someone there to walk you through it."
Senior,5,"Nebraska Wesleyan taught me to appreciate differences. NWU challenged me to think outside my own experiences. NWU taught me how to critically think, confront tough situations and take constructive feedback. NWU message and focus by faculty and staff was consistent while I was learning more about myself and defining who I am, who I want to become. My experience is great from sports to academics."

Sophomore,5,"I transferred from a community college to Nebraska Wesleyan this last semester and it was the best decision of my college career. The students and professors were so welcoming and kind, it felt like I belonged there the first day in campus. The campus is beautiful and the professor are the most helpful and kind hearted people I have met. Some things I wish Nebraska Wesleyan would change is, creating an event where students get to meet more then just the professors they have in class."
Sophomore,5,I have taken online classes at Nebraska Wesleyan and it was an amazing experience. The professors mapped everything out perfectly and if I got confused on a certain instruction or assignment I would simply contact them and they would explain everything. The professors at Nebraska Wesleyan are one of a kind!!
Freshman,5,The sense of community at Nebraska Wesleyan is like no other and I wouldn't trade it for the world! The professors care about you and check-in to make sure you are doing alright! My favorite part about campus though would have to be housing. I've gained valuable experiences living in the dorms that I wouldn't be able to learn anywhere else!
Freshman,5,"I will be attending next year as a freshman. I have had great relations with the staff, they have all been extremely welcoming and supportive. I will be going in trying to pursue a double major, which they fully support and want to help me succeed on my goals."
Sophomore,5,My expierence at Nebraska Wesleyan has been wonderful so far.  At this time there is nothing I would change.  I have enjoyed the class room expierences and playing football for the Praiarie Wolves.
Freshman,5,"At Nebraska Wesleyan, I love the individualized time that the professors make to spend with their students. I also love their willingness to help students who are struggling or that would like more assistance"
Niche User,5,"The University encompasses everything that any student is looking for in a college all in one location! Academics take precedence, resources are available for all students."
Freshman,5,"The education received at Wesleyan intends students to be well-rounded, innovators, and inspirational individuals to the public. Nebraska Wesleyan provides hands-on experiences and one-on-one training that would make students more comfortable in their desired major. Student life is supportive and faculty and staff make the university a lot more inviting and accepting."
Niche User,5,It's such a beautiful campus and everyone there is so kind and willing to work with you on everything!
Freshman,5,I have been loving my experience here at Nebraska Wesleyan University. There are great opportunities for students in many different aspects. I am still looking for many more scholarships as NWU doesn't offer many through the school. College here is amazing and there are great resources to help students for academics. The professors are very helpful and understanding for students. I would not want to be anywhere else!
Niche User,5,"Nebraska Wesleyan encompassed all that I was looking for as an individual: great location, great diversity, excellent academics, people who are willing to work with you. It is truly an amazing university, creating such a warm and welcoming community!"
Senior,5,Wesleyan is like a close-nit family. The Professors will keep in touch with you and check up to make sure you are doing okay. There is campus police who will walk with you at night if you feel unsafe. They do a lot of Theater Productions each year and they are open to the public.
Graduate Student,5,"I have enjoyed my time at NWU! I attend the very convenient Omaha campus, classes are small and professors are available and experienced!"
Niche User,5,"Visiting Wesleyan was an amazing experience that I definitely will not forget. When I first arrived at the campus, the modern also new look of it just caught my eye. They had buildings that have been their for years and some that had just been built. The people on campus and in the buildings were very welcoming and accepting. I enjoyed meeting the professors and getting their input on what path I should take for my career choice. I liked the dorms/housing because they were pretty updated and we actually got to have a look inside them. They have quite a bit of space and they can be made to feel like home. I also liked how there was a police station right beside the University and that their is security guards on campus at all times.  I enjoyed meeting with the softball coach, she was a very genuine person and seemed to love the game. In all, NWU is a great college and you should visit sometime!"
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my first year at Nebraska Wesleyan. The reason my experience was so enjoyable was because of my classes. The biggest class I had at Wesleyan  was 25 people. This made learning so much easier and so much more fun. My professors really cared about how I did in the class, and helped me out whenever I needed help. Plus, the campus is beautiful, and so quaint. There isn't anything that I would change about Wesleyan."
Senior,5,"Nebraska Wesleyan is inclusive, and strive for diversity. They believe in making connections on campus as well as with the community. There is strong ties and opportunities created by alumni."
Freshman,5,"I love it, it is such a pretty campus. The student to professor ratio is perfect to get the hands on and one on one experience. It really helps students grow into great adults."
Niche User,5,I love that campus is in a big city but you still get personal attention from professors! You get the same opportunities as kids from other schools but you get to know your teachers on a more personal basis which I like a lot. The campus is also small so you will not get lost as easily as you would at a big campus. Everyone is super friendly and is willing to help with any of your problems.
Freshman,5,I enjoy going to school at Nebraska Wesleyan University because it is a welcoming environment. Every person on campus is there to help whether it is a professor or a fellow student. I have already made meaningful connection only being a student for one semester. I can honestly say I do not think there is one bad thing about Wesleyan! I love everything about this University.
Freshman,5,Being a freshman I have felt welcomed and the experience has been the best. I would welcome anyone looking into colleges to put Nebraska Welyan on their list.
Junior,5,This school is real amazing. The advisors work with you and try their best to help you. The professors here actually take their time to help you.
Alum,5,"Nebraska Wesleyan drove me into the career field of Chiropractics. I began my journey as an athletic training major and upon graduation, my advisors saw my determination in owning a practice one day and drove me to the path of Chiropractic school. Now only 4 weeks away from beginning my doctorate, I can certainly say that Nebraska Wesleyan not only offered top tier education, advising, and career building skills, but also grew me as a healthcare individual that is determined to help his community and all those seeking medical attention."
Sophomore,5,"Nebraska Wesleyan does a great job of offering so many opportunities to succeed in the community of Lincoln, and have the one on one connections with teachers that I know I wouldn't have if I went somewhere else."
Senior,5,Small classroom sizes and professors who truly care about you as a person. Understanding of the juggle between career/family and finishing school.
Sophomore,5,I just started at this university and already I know that it will be a good fit. Everyone from the first contact has been very knowledgeable and helpful.
Junior,5,I love how personalized Nebraska Wesleyan is. They have small classrooms with lower student to professor ratios than those of larger universities. They are constantly holding programs intended to help further the career of the students.
Niche User,5,"I learned that the teachers are very open with you when talking to you about your intended major. I learned that they are very nice to you and want the best for you. They genuinely care for you and you could go in and talk to them whenever their business hours are. They have a very beautiful campus with a lot of squirrels running around. Everyone is friendly when you walk  around campus. The teachers make time for you unlike many other colleges. They have a nice Greek life and they don't call it rushing, like other colleges do, because they want you to love the house you get into and how everything works. Everything about Wesleyan is what I was looking for in a college."
Senior,5,I love the small community and the one on one teacher interaction. Definitely something unique to a smaller campus.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone was knowledgeable and could answer my questions. I have no regrets deciding to attend NWU campus in Omaha. The career counselor in Lincoln has also been useful.
Junior,5,"Outstanding professors, great courses, and quality everything. NWU has been an amazing college experience for me so far. They are really invested in their students. Also, the college is incredibly inclusive and offers safe learning environments."
Freshman,5,Nebraska Wesleyan University has been a great college for me so far. I went to a small school and I knew that I would do the best at a small college.
Niche User,5,I loved their campus and how their professors know the students so well! I can't wait to attend this very friendly and home like campus next year.
Sophomore,5,"If you want big-time opportunity with a small-school feel, this is the college for you. There is nothing about this school that is limited by its size, but so much that is gained. The opportunities to travel the world, be involved on campus, and meet new people is unmatched by small and large schools alike. The faculty and staff are here because they want to be here, and it shows."
Junior,5,"So far, I have had a wonderful experience that I do not regret at all. The teachers I have had have all shown support, as have the other faculty members. I feel that they truly care about the students. 
Additionally, the dorms and the dinning hall are well kept. The cafe is always a good place to go to, and the library has good research materials. 
An issue, however, is in the occasional underground-pipe burst on campus grounds, though this is more due to rather drastic freezing temperatures that have lately occurred during the winter rather than failure of design. However, construction to fix said pipes do not usually cause much interference with daily life."
Sophomore,5,Nebraska Wesleyan has been everything that I was looking for in a college. Classes are just small enough for professors to have the ability to give each student personal attention yet large enough to be comfortable.  Campus life is quaint and personal. I feel at home and comfortable wherever I may be or whatever I am doing on campus. Because of Wesleyan I feel that I have grown academically and have found what my purpose is in life.
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely loved this school. It was small enough that the classes were intimate and I could easily talk to my teachers outside of class if I needed help. The theatre program was so much fun and I made a lot of great friends there. The campus is small enough to walk around and not get lost, and there are a lot of restaurants and amenities that are a short drive away. You can tell the professors truly care about their students work and your academic advisor will work closely with you to ensure you succeed."
Junior,5,"The university gives opportunities to everyone and the advisors there know you by name. True it is very pricey to come to this school, but it's worth it. The science department is expanding and is getting its own section. The professors are very friendly and always help if they can. There are a lot of sports and clubs that students can get involved into. The campus is pretty big but anyone can find their way around it. Most definitely it's a place that's growing rapidly and accepts anyone. The education department is very friendly and is very helpful. I love it and I think so will you."
College Sophomore,5,"There are many precautions such as awareness videos, easy access emergency phones, and more to prevent or aid in the case of an emergency. Although I have never seen anyone have to use any of them, nor have I ever felt unsafe."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone, students and faculty, are extremely helpful and nice. They want to see you succeed and reach your goals, and they will do everything in their power to help you do just that. It is a little bit pricy, but the benifits are definitely worth the cost."
College Freshman,5,"it is a well-known respected school, I study theatre and I find my career prospects very promising even with my degree."
College Freshman,5,I love the school I want nothing more than to get my degree from this school and program.
College Freshman,5,Extrememly safe small campus where you know most people and you all look out for each other
College Freshman,5,Excellent housing opportunities with brand new dorms and excellent staff
College Freshman,5,Strong Greek presence on campus all friendly people and a great community.
College Freshman,5,It has been an amazing experience! The faculty are very engaged in you and your education.
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience was great. Wesleyan has amazing classes, staff, and students. I enjoyed going here and will continue too for years to come."
College Sophomore,5,"Living on campus for the first time was interesting. I was nervous to be living away from home, with a random person, but in the end it was great. My dorm was awesome because there was a sink in our dorm room, so we didn't have to go to the communal bathroom to brush our teeth. Also the dorms were a good size, and I had the best roommate ever. The dorms were also close to our classes. I loved my dorm experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is nice. As a incoming freshman, Greek life members helped all freshman with moving stuff on Freshman move in day. While I myself am not in Greek life, a good majority of my friends are. I know how much work it is to be in Greek life, based on my friend's schedules, but at the same time, I know they enjoy being a part of Greek life. Greek life allowed them to meet more people and gain more friends."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at Wesleyan was amazing. As a incoming freshman, I was nervous. But all of the teachers and students were kind and helpful. I learned a lot during my first year, and I met many new people. I am forever grateful and happy to be going to Wesleyan."
College Sophomore,5,"It really allows everyone to have the same opportunity as everyone else. I get a lot of one on one time with my professors and if I need help, I know I have so many resources. We have an amazing campus and just a lot of really cool people."
College Junior,5,The campus is very safe and there is not very much crime.
College Junior,5,All of the professors I have spoken to are very helpful and encouraging.
College Junior,5,Wesleyan is thought of very well by employers so I feel confident in getting a job once I graduate.
College Junior,5,"I have never lived on campus, but those that do enjoy the experience."
College Junior,5,There are  only a few Greek houses at my school.  I am not involved in them but I do think they do good things for the community.
College Junior,5,My school has a very good athletic department.  There is a great gym and equipment for non-athletes to use as well.
College Junior,5,"I am at Southeast Community College right now, and will be transferring to Nebraska Wesleyan University in August.  I love both schools.  SCC makes it easy for me to schedule my classes when it's most convenient for me.  Wesleyan is a beautiful campus and it's the perfect size."
Niche User,4,I haven't went through classes yet but I am planning on going to Nebraska Wesleyan next year.  We did look through their website and it seemed all easy access.
Sophomore,4,"I had never completed online learning prior to March, so the professors and myself made it very in-depth on how the procedures would happen and this helped tremendously with me also being in a completely different state as well."
Sophomore,4,"NWU is a very inclusive campus and although it is smaller as compared to nearby University of Nebraska- Lincoln, I personally see more people enjoying themselves and being more involved as well."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the small community that is formed by those of us on campus. I very much love the personal education that I get because NWU is a small campus.
Senior,4,"It has been great. Coming from a background where many people don`t get to go to college, I am blessed to be where I am and to receive an education by such knowledgable educators. I do believe that campus diversity needs to be improved, but other than that it is a great place. I am happy to have gotten in because without it, I would not have met the people that I am so close with today. I will always be grateful for the professor who have opened their offices to me to ask questions about content ,homework, and test review."
Sophomore,4,"There were a few classes where the teachers' did not care when you missed class and did not reach out to you for not turning in assignments. However, I have had eight teachers that do reach out and care for their students' well-being."
Freshman,4,"Very strong academics and wonderful new President!
Professors are easy to reach out to and very helpful.
Many opportunities for on campus involvement."
Freshman,4,"I thought that transitioning and moving on campus would be a hassle, but with the support of upperclassmen, faculty, and staff it made the change easy to overcome. From my short time here, I have made many friends and I have been networking in the law industry. Also, the greek community is very loving and already feels like a family."
Sophomore,4,"I love Nebraska Wesleyan. The classes, professors, activities on campus and many more things are amazing. However, the WiFi is terrible. They took away cable to pay for better WiFi and the WiFi seems to be almost worse. It’s difficult to get through assignments when the WiFi doesn’t work. Also, the food is not the greatest. There are not very many healthy options and not a good variety of food."
Sophomore,4,"One of the great things about Nebraska Wesleyan University (NWU) is the connection between the professors and students. Every professor at NWU really cares about their student’s success. For example, one of my classmates was having a really hard week and my professor extended a due date for them so they did not get too overwhelmed. The small class sizes help with this but you can the professors try to connect to every student. NWU also has many resources on campus, including a career center, a gender advocacy place, and on-campus  counselors. The one downside is the lack of diversity. NWU is a small college in the middle of Nebraska, but more diversity would be ideal. However, the campus knows this is an issue and is trying to become more desirable to people of other cultures."
Sophomore,4,"As an out-of-state student, I was excited but also nervous about making friends. However, I have made some of the best friends I could ask for. The WIFI on campus is terrible. I wish that this would be improved. The food at the dining hall is not very good. They only rotate between a few items. I would also like the parking to be improved as the parking lots always seem the be full, so students end up having to try to find street parking. I love the small classroom sizes. This has allowed me to get to know my professors and have a relationship with them. I feel very confident that I will graduate with a job already lined up. I have very much enjoy the location of NWU. It is in a quiet neighborhood about 10 mintutes from downtown Lincoln. I have loved Lincoln so much that I have permenantly moved to Lincoln from Chicago. Overall, I have very much enjoyed my time so far at NWU and strongly recommend it."
Senior,4,"Coming from a small town, Nebraska Wesleyan University helped my transition into college life a lot easier. My professors have all been fantastic so far, and I feel like I am getting a great return on my investment."
Sophomore,4,"I love that it is a small campus and I have met some best friends. You get to see and meet new people everyday. Plus, you will recognize everyone and your teachers help you out if you need it. You aren't just a number, you are a student."
Junior,4,"I love attending Nebraska Wesleyan University; there is never a dull moment on campus as their is always something going on to be involved in. One thing that Wesleyan needs to improve upon is there marketing strategies. NWU often presents itself as a place of diversity, and its marketing only ever pictures people of that are not-white, despite the fact that the majority of campus is. This creates a false-sense of diversity on Wesleyan's campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here at Nebraska Wesleyan. I am a sophomore and I transfered last year from the University of Lincoln after my freshman year. Class sizes are perfect. I have an average of about 20 students in each class, which allows me to be more engaged in class and comprehend the information. The class size also allows for lots of hands on learning which helps solidify the knowledge learned even more. I've also been able to get to know and connect personally with every single one of my teachers. The education is amazing, the campus size is perfect, and everyone is friendly. The only downfall is the cost of going to school, it is very pricey."
Sophomore,4,The campus is small and beautiful. The professors are really student oriented and will help whenever.
Alum,4,I took classes at Nebraska Wesleyan through the Adult Advantage program. It was a mix of online and on-campus classes. I thoroughly enjoyed the instructors and all the classes.
Senior,4,"Really great school with wonderful educators and resources for learning. It is a bit expensive, but they give out many scholarships."
Freshman,4,I like the campus and the curriculum.  One thing I wish was different was their general education classes because they aren't like others so they don't transfer to other colleges if you choose so.
Freshman,4,Love the atmosphere and friendliness of all the teachers. Great Professors. Great theatre program. Very expensive.
Sophomore,4,"Nebraska Wesleyan University has a great campus, great students, and wonderful professors.  I recommend going to Nebraska Wesleyan for the small feel university.  While attending this school you will also feel the close-knit community with a big city feel of Lincoln. There is always something to do whether on campus or in Lincoln. 

Nebraska Wesleyan has many different organizations to join from sororities and fraternities, intramurals, to other organizations. I am in International Relations Organization, this organization you interact and have fun with foreign exchange students.  We have many exchange students. I would consider Nebraska Wesleyan to have a diverse community."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy going to NWU because it has the same feel of my small town community with the advantages of being in Lincoln. I am way more comfortable being active on campus and joining different groups because it doesn't feel quite so overwhelming as some of the bigger colleges. I feel that I am getting the best college experience and the best education from Wesleyan.
Sophomore,4,"Nebraska Wesleyan University is a place that I can call home. When walking to and from classes, the atmosphere is welcoming and safe. All the professors on campus will stop to say hello to you and ask how you are doing. You cannot ask for a more inviting University. When a high school student is struggling to decide where to go to college, I always tell them to take a tour at Nebraska Wesleyan University. My first tour here, I knew that this is where I wanted to go to college. Nebraska Wesleyan might be in the capital city, but once your on campus it feels like you are in your own little town. I would recommend Nebraska Wesleyan University to any in state and out of state high school students. Go Prairie Wolves!"
Freshman,4,"Nebraska Wesleyan University is a very good university. The professors actually care about the well-being and success of each and every student. They are always there for you if you need assistance, and they are understanding. The people there are some of the kindest people you'll ever meet. Its main downfall is its cost, but that's to be expected from a private university."
Freshman,4,"Nebraska Wesleyan is a great school to go to if you're looking to be a person and not a number. The student to teacher ratio is about 12:1! Your professors will know you by name and they are also fantastic resources for you when you are in need of improvement. There are also many activities on campus to keep you busy, but don't get too busy because there are some great sports teams to join as well, if you're up to it. Everyone is very welcoming at the school, and is also excited that you're there on this journey with them."
Freshman,4,"I'm willing to attend the one in Omaha & I went already registered for classes there. Overall It's pretty small, which is not that big of a deal because I'll have more attention from the Professors.  The advisor I've met with was very professional, organized,  very helpful, and kind. I'll give more ratings when I start attending!"
Freshman,4,"It's good, I haven't been here for long but some of the biggest pluses are the professors and a really nice and quite welcoming community. It's definitely safe. It seems like you either really like it or you kind of don't connect to it, I'm not quite sure why."
College Junior,4,The career center is always very helpful in assisting student.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall very nice, the floor leaders care about you and they are very clean. The first year dorms could be a little bigger, but after the first year you get larger living spaces."
College Sophomore,4,"Again, I am not a part of Greek life so it is hard to comment, but the Greek life on campus is very active and all the members are very nice."
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities are nice, but I do not regurly attend and can not comment much on how the events are ran."
College Freshman,4,Its a small Division 3 school yet there is a strong presence of athletics but it is not overshadowing anything.
College Sophomore,4,I feel that our school has a great alumni network and that a degree from Wesleyan will help many students find jobs after college.
College Freshman,4,I visited and fell in love with this school
College Freshman,4,Wesleyan has a pre-med track and an 86% placement rate in medical school. Professors and advisors talk about placement in the first conversations.
College Freshman,4,Classes are smaller than most colleges and taught by the professors. Wesleyan encourages many community service opportunities.  They also have a special fund for research projects and a house on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. for use by students at no extra cost.
College Freshman,4,Wesleyan has a 24 hours crisis line and a Title IX Coordinator as well as Campus Security with special telephones located around the campus. They also have a campus victim advocate and other confidential resources.
College Freshman,4,"Residence halls for underclassmen are very similar to any other college. Upperclassmen are able to make choices between townhouses, suites and regular apartments. Theme houses are available to those with a special interest in the environment, fitness or international topics."
College Freshman,4,"Wesleyan offers all major sports, but academics are the priority and thus the culture follows that commitment. Multiple sports and intramural sports provide opportunities for everyone to socialize and get out of the classroom. It is also helpful in establishing a sense of belonging to be on a team and developing friendships at a time in everyone's life when it is really needed."
College Freshman,4,"It is a small university and they promise to provide more one-on-one mentoring and opportunities such as working an internship, doing research or job shadowing. Other students are similar to me - dedicated and passionate about succeeding in life. I plan to spend one semester in Washington D.C. conducting research at the National Health Institute or working at the White House, and living in a Wesleyan apartment on Capitol Hill."
College Sophomore,4,"I really love it, it is a very good community and environment."
College Sophomore,4,I have learned a whole lot this last year and I feel that I have grown a lot in my career path.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe, however, I do not party very often and I also don't drink. I have had over five friends that were sexually assaulted on or around campus in my first year there."
College Freshman,4,"With the police down the road, I feel pretty safe. But honestly nothing bad really happens."
College Freshman,4,I have not been in there much but they help you look for job or internship. I mean going to this school is just a plus for getting a job.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes aren't that big but there are many different courses are offered for many majors and minors. But other than that its fine.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are all about the same for age or grade level. The people you live with or next to, you usually become close and have a close great bond. The only bad thing about housing is the cost. It's so pricey. But other than that finding a place on campus isn't too hard."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is pretty exciting here. We try to get everyone involved even if they are not in a fraternity or sorority by creating events for everyone to go to. Greeks are no different from non-Greeks. We are all treated equally and fair which is awesome about the school. We are all cool with each other being Greek or non-Greek, we joke around about how we are in one but try to get we know to join. Cause it's fun. And meeting new people is great."
College Freshman,4,My favorite experience is meeting new people and being involved in the school. I would choose this school if I started all over because I know it will help me go places in the near future. I wouldn't choose this school is because..of course I'd choose this school. It's awesome.
College Junior,4,"The career center send emails often detailing employment opportunities as well as internship possibilities. The school has a good reputation, and I feel this will help when looking for employment after graduation."
College Junior,4,"I generally attend classes in the evening with most classes getting out at 10 p.m., I feel safe walking on campus alone during this time. The campus is well lit, and there is a security guard present on campus."
College Junior,4,"This school offers classes in the evening, this has made it possible for me to be a full-time student. The class sizes are small, this allows the professors ample time to assist each student. I feel as though my professors have taken a genuine interest in my education and me as an individual."
College Freshman,4,The workload is reasonable for students. Professors are very good in my experience so far.
College Freshman,4,"Safety services on campus are great, and precautions for personal safety are even better."
College Freshman,4,"There is a wide variety of classes offered, and the class sizes are ideal for me."
College Freshman,4,The career center services on campus are great. They give you great information about internships and possible job opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"Centennial Hall is the worse option, but everything else is a great place to live."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is an important aspect of Wesleyan's campus atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"Wesleyan is a great school, and it fits me well."
College Freshman,4,"Nebraska Wesleyan has great sports facilities. The Weary Center's indoor track is arguably the best in the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Success in sports performance varies from sport to sport. However, every coach and athlete is always encourages to work as hard as possible as a student athlete. The ""student"" part of student athlete is very important at NWU. We rank 10th out of ALL colleges/universities in NCAA and NAIA in Academic All Americans. Being a Nebraska Wesleyan Prairie Wolf means supporting your school wether they win or loose and playing for the love of the game while always giving 100% both on and off the field."
Senior,2,"NWU as a whole is a great college, however, if you're planning on coming here for BSN, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS GOODNESS RECONSIDER!!!!!!!!!!!! The traditional BSN program is an absolute mess! There is very little communication between administration and the students. There have been 3 different directors in my 4 years here. Some of the professors are amazing and I've learned a lot from them, but other professors don't teach at all and I've had to teach myself entire courses before. Please, if you're serious about nursing, go somewhere where the nursing program is established and the NCLEX pass rate is near 100%!"
College Junior,2,"So annoying. I am not in greek life, nor did I ever have any interest. I have heard so many girls say that they want to quit their sororities, but they ""might as well just stay"". I think that it is a waste of time and money. You will be fine, sweetheart. Make friends on your own."
College Junior,2,I have never lived on campus but the dorms are cold
College Freshman,2,Hot and sweaty to cold and freezing; Nebraska living
College Freshman,2,I applied but did not receive any financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"Can use bikes and rent a car on campus.  Campus is small, so there is not need for transportation on campus."
College Student,2,"Not allowed unless you are 21 BEFORE the first day of the semester, though there are uncountable options in the surrounding area."
College Senior,2,Jails obtain better dinning then we do. There is no other option on campus for dining for the most part.
College Senior,2,Its a small campus that does not require much transportation but the transportation they do provide is what is called Wesleyan Wheels. This picks up people that need a ride from the local bars and various other places within the city. It is not readily available and requires a phone call. There is really only one driver so it may be waited on for awhile.
College Freshman,2,"We have a very limited selection. I am a small woman, and a picky eater. It seems like what I eat the most is pizza, because the other options either don't look trustworthy or aren't there for the day. They do, however, have excellent deserts. I just wish some of the portions were bigger - and this is coming from a 5'2"" 115lb woman - and that there was more variety.
They do offer grab 'n gos, which is a handy sack lunch you can get if you're in a hurry. Those seem healthy and handy, but I also wish there was a little more."
College Sophomore,2,"What Sports??? The athletic facilities are nice, but the same cannot be said for the school spirit. There are a few core fans, but most of the people that attend games are parents."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything Revolves Around Alcohol – A typical student looks from the Midwest, but there are no outstanding looking people probably due to the lack of sports scholarships. The weekends and sometimes weekdays involve parties with alcohol because that seems to be the only thing that most students seem to do."
College Freshman,2,"Barely Bearable – The dining options at Nebraska Wesleyan are edible, but just barely so.  There aren't many options that are not fried foods or pasta of some kind.  Vegetarian options are few and far between, but they are making an effort to increase options.  The dining hall's hours are also a problem.  As a theatre major, I can never really get meal at the dining hall because of class/rehearsal schedules."
College Freshman,2,"Luckily, my permit came with admission to the school.  Parking is difficult ESPECIALLY near the freshman dorms and suites (north side).  The south side parking usually has open spots but it's not worth parking that far from your dorm.  I sometimes have to park off campus and I have tried to get away with parking in staff parking.  I got a $15 ticket which isn't SO bad but not fun."
College Freshman,1,"Besides the u-haul car share there is not other way to get around, the school is small enough that you could walk every where on campus but the nearest store is almost a mile or two away not the best ideology to walk there."
College Sophomore,1,"Who Knows What's Going on? Honestly, I've never been to any of the games. Not interested, it doesn't seem like a focal point in my university."
College Student,1,"Tread carefully.  My personal experience was dreadful and drawn out.  While there are some awesome greeks here, there is also a major case of power-hungry within the greek leadership, whom elevate themselves onto a mighty pedestal.  
Many greeks take themselves way too seriously, often not considering whether they need to be so uptight.  The greek houses are great with philanthropies, though unfortunately the events usually go to Relay for Life (one of the most non-philanthropic philanthropy organizations in existence.)  
If you're insecure about making new friends, check out some rush events - but keep an open mind.  There are many other ways to do so.  If you are a free spirit, this is one of the best ways to tie yourself down."
College Student,1,"There is very little diversity at NWU. A few issues involving intolerance via graffiti and Facebook have come up in the past couple years.  Almost all of the students are from the Midwest, Caucasian, and Christian - most being from small Neb. towns.  While the faculty is quite open and accepting, it is very difficult to be surrounded by these students if you vary from the typical NWU student.  What keeps NWU from receiving an F for diversity is the great study abroad program.  That said, many ""normal"" NWU students are obviously uncomfortable around the exchange students as well."
College Sophomore,1,"So Much for an Open Community – Most students are from small towns in Nebraska whose communitites were probably 99.9% white. Being a minority, I've encountered many instances of racism and complete and utter ignorance from people who call themselves ""adults."" Those people preach acceptance, so there must be a lot of hypocrites on campus"

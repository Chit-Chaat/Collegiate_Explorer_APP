Sophomore,5,Avila University is a great school. I am personally in the RadSci program and I love it. Avila has some of the absolute best schooling around.
Sophomore,5,I took one online class online my first semester and then all online my second semester because of COVID-19. Enjoyed all of my online classes but I learn better in person.
Alum,5,"I loved Avila for its small class rooms and family oriented community. I also loved the fact that I didn't feel like just a ""number"". I knew I really mattered."
Senior,5,"My experience at Avila University has been very beneficial to me as a person, an athlete and for my future. I grew so much during my time at Avila. The professors and staff are all extremely helpful and personable, and the environment at Avila really feels like a family. Everyone involved with Avila University is willing to go the extra mile for one another. Avila has helped me be prepared for my future after graduation and is so welcoming to those who are looking at Avila, currently go to Avila and are Alum of Avila."
Senior,5,"I had some of my classes in person and others online, then due to the COVID-19 all of my classes moved to online. The professors work very closely with online students to make sure we are understanding the material as well as possible, and to give us all the same benefits as those who have in person class. The professors at Avila University stay in great contact with the students and work very well with us, even going as far as to have zoom/ phone calls with us if we do not understand something, having open office hours, and willing to extend deadlines if we hare having any trouble. Avila University's online learning is very comparable to in person class, and just as educational!"
Sophomore,5,"Avila has been great so far! Teachers actually care about you and your attendance, would not go anywhere else."
Senior,5,"The school is really great, with wonderful opportunities for the students. You are guaranteed a to enter the work force with an internship in the field of your degree. The class sizes are small and the teachers are there for you as a student."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful and small classes. Class sizes are about 10-25. Free tutoring services and a lot of school events with free food. Good sports team and theater.
Freshman,5,"At Avila University, the education and the quality of people is unparalleled. With the small class sizes and the interpersonal relationship, there is a connection that cannot be replicated in larger colleges. Most graduates leave with a clear path and a wide variety of skills that will carry them into their future."
Sophomore,5,"it has been a very great experience to be a part of Avila University, academically it has also been a very great experience"
Freshman,5,They are very inviting with smiles always on their face and a helpful hand to guide you into starting your new classes. The campus is lively/kind and all round willing to assist generously.
Freshman,5,"The classes are very small which allows more one on one time with professors. The over all university is well kept, with friendly staff and students."
Freshman,5,"I have yet to begin my college experience however, the application process was very simple.  I was put in contact with a counselor who took time to reach out to me on many occasions to make sure I had everything I needed. When I got accepted to the college my counselor made an appointment with me and my parents to help cover any questions we had.  Being the first child to go to college my parents had lots of questions.  Everyone I have met has made me feel like I am already a student. I can't wait to start in the fall."
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student.  The Admission and Financial Aid Dept have been kind and patient.  The Basketball Coach is down to earth and makes you feel that he is investing in your future.   The students have been welcoming and the size of the campus is perfect.
Sophomore,5,"With me still currently attending Avila University I still have a lot that I need to learn about the school but overall the living environment is great, and the nice friendly environment that surrounds the school is very excellent."
Sophomore,5,I've had a wonder experience attending Avila University. I am an older adult returning to college to obtain a Bachelors degree. Its been a struggle financially because its difficult to work full time while going to college full time. I am determined to succeed. The staff and administrators are very supportive. Great College. I like it a lot.
Sophomore,5,Love that the ratio in classroom size to teacher is smaller. So more one on one learning with the professors.
Junior,5,I transferred to Avila because it was a smaller campus with smaller classes. Ever since I have transferred my grades are way better than they were before and the teachers are welling to help you with no problem. I honestly do not regret applying to this school. It has done me more good than the school I have been to before.
Junior,5,Everyone is very kind and helpful! I felt very at home here. The students are passionate about their studies and the class sizes are perfect for receiving quality attention. All of the professors seem to care about their students and what they teach.
Niche User,5,"Avila is such a great community, great professors and a wonderful education. The campus itâ€™s self is filled with so much diversity, along with friendliness. Small campus but a lot of opportunities, very clean but also very home like."
Freshman,5,I have loved Avila University since my first visit. I knew the second getting into the car that this is where I wanted to go. I absolutely love the small class sizes and every single teacher I have talked to has truly cared about my success.
Niche User,5,"The class sizes are small and students have a chance for one on one with professors.  Avila's student advisors are excellent and have much experience with healthcare fields and have a good knowledge of what it takes to excel after life at the university.  I would highly recommend anyone interested in the science field to check out Avila, you wont be disappointed.  The students are interactive and everyone has a generally decent outlook on school and are willing to participate.  It is easy to get along with everyone, which helps to feel comfortable.  I have enjoyed my time here so far very much."
Freshman,5,"I like that Avila is a small campus, it's very easy to get around to places. With the small campus comes small class sizes and that's easier for teachers to get to know you and you to get to know your teachers better."
Junior,5,"I love AVILA University! 

This is my second week and it has been such a joy and blessing to find a school that is a very friendly environment and the teachers and administrative team really loves on their students! 

Can't wait to graduate with nursing class of 2019!"
Junior,5,Great University in the heart of the metro! They offer face to face courses and online. It's a small community that is setup much like a community college.
Freshman,5,"Going into college, I did not know what to expect. When I came to Avila, I felt at home. All of the professors, students, and staff at Avila are extremely welcoming and helpful. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone who is interested."
College Freshman,5,Campus life is very safe. The professors are all trained as Responsible Employees and we have a few who are even Confidential Employees.  The campus safety provided us with a variety of ways we can report someone who is a victim of abuse in any way or form.
Recent Alumnus,5,"This university is excellent. I'm majoring in Sports Communication. We have a large variety of classes, and our classes rarely have more than 15-20 students. This allows for the professors to get on a personal level with their students. It allows students to have more time with their professors, and receive one-on-one feedback. It's sort of like a family there. Students in the same major tend to follow each other from class to class so you get very familiar with your peers. The professors are passionate and knowledgeable about their subjects and they're extremely passionate about their students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"In my entirety at Avila University I have never heard of any campus crime. I have always felt extremely safe on campus. The faculty make it very known that campus security is available 24/7. I know that if I felt as though I was in danger I could call my peers, faculty, and campus security."
Recent Alumnus,5,"When I first toured Avila University I was skeptical. It was an extremely small university and I had always had dreams of attending a large university. Two years later and I can't imagine being anywhere else. I love the faculty, the classes, and the students. It's rare that you find a college student that enjoys going to school. I can't stress enough how much I love this place. I don't have any complaints. We have a very diverse student body and I have enjoyed meeting so many different people from so many different walks of life."
College Senior,5,Avila a firm believer in you study hard you get what you deserve.
College Senior,5,"This is the best year I had on campus.  The classroom size were small, the teaching styles were great, and the courses offered were applicable."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe. There are a lot of safety measures that are implemented in order to make all students feel this way.
College Freshman,5,"Overall, I have loved every minute of being at Avila. There is not much more to say that has not already been said, but I could not have picked a better school for myself."
College Freshman,5,I have loved being at Avila. The small size of the school makes it feel like home. The staff and other students are very welcoming and make the transition from high school to college seamless.
College Freshman,5,I can say Avila is one of the only few schools that has a great security system. There has not been any problems where a student is sexually assaulted that I know of. I also feel very secure to and from campus and while I am on campus.
College Sophomore,5,They are an unique liberal art school that offers one on one help the students need to succeed. The smaller class sizes has held up an exquisite reputation for itself. This allows employers to wanting to hire those with an Avila education.
College Senior,5,There are plenty of things to do in Kansas City.
College Senior,5,"Guidelines are usually provided regarding personal safety, especially in the library and walking alone. 

If one wants to go to library at night, then the student can call one of the campus security people to walk with him/her."
College Junior,5,"great school, great people, and great student life"
College Junior,5,degrees from this school are very much valued
College Senior,5,Workload are only for those who strive to do their best.  It is not a place for wimps.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe and comfortable while walking on Avila University's campus. There is always a campus safety worker on duty even throughout the night and there are emergency buttons to press throughout the parking lots. The dorms are all key coded so that only the people residing in building can enter and for the most part every one knows each other so I feel as if every person I pass is a friend. It is definitely a close knit community and I have always felt safe around the students, staff, and on the campus."
College Junior,5,"Overall I love the school, instructors and the program but I do wish I had more online class options"
College Junior,5,I've loved every instructor I have ever had and my adviser is the best
College Freshman,5,I enjoy the experience of on-line and on-campus courses. Instructors are very hands-on with students. The curriculum pushes me to study and work hard (I love a challenge). Assignment workloads are manageable and there are always job opportunites available.
College Junior,5,"My experience has been great. I don't live on campus or hang out there much, but as far as my classes I have had a wonderful experience."
College Junior,5,Right in the heart of Kansas City so there is everything you could ever want.
College Junior,5,I have had great experience with scholarships and financial aid. I don't receive anything but transfer scholarships and it was convenient to get it all figured out.
College Freshman,5,"The academics here at Avila are top notch. The school only hires the best of the best in each field requiring the highest obtained mastery for each subject. Not only that, the teachers they hire are amazing. They teach in a way that is easily understandable, and they are always available to you, which is hard to come by. I recall just last week I was in need of help with one of my papers I was struggling with in my Literature and Culture class. I emailed my teacher and we met up for lunch at a local bakery down the street discussing my paper over coffee. Teachers like the ones they hire here are hard to come by. As far as the difficulty level for classes goes, Avila is very challenging. The classes require a lot of outside class discussions and study groups, but with teachers and dedicated students like we have here at Avila, it really is not too bad."
College Sophomore,5,I feel like Im safe while walking from class to class because the security is always riding around campus
College Sophomore,5,Everyone accepts each other. There are always people who don't like each other but as a whole it is a very nice place to be. 
College Sophomore,5,There is usually a computer open in library. Finals week is the only time they could be all taken but you are able to check out a lab top if needed. 
College Sophomore,5,The campus is well kept and up to date
College Junior,5,"Around campus, there's plenty to do and a variety of places to eat. The restaurants are ones you won't see around every corner with the same service quality as expected at sit-down restaurants. I love to eat at the sushi bar near or college! My friends and I treat ourselves to it and it's a nice place to chill and eat great food."
College Sophomore,5,"I was very shocked the first year studying at Avila, because everyone knew everyone else and they all liked each other! I was used to a very cliquey high school, and seeing pretty much everyone being friends just made me happy to be there even more."
College Senior,5,"Avila University has some of the most amazing teachers I have ever met. I feel if you are willing to learn from them you will walk away with some valuable knowledge. Sometimes the workload seems excessive, but there is always a justifiable reason for it. I love Avila."
College Sophomore,5,I came to Avila University because it offered me the challenge to work hard and study.  Skills that will not only be in asset in the classroom but also in the real world.
College Sophomore,5,"You put in what you get out. I am in the Buisness Management Program, and I""ve been satisfied thus far.  I meet with my professors on a regular basis to develop that connection I feel that every student should involve themselves inorder to succeed in their endeavors."
College Junior,5,We have a ton of International Students. One of the missions of Avila is to be accepting of everyone.
Alum,4,My learning experience was good. I had the opportunity to reach out and learn what I wanted to learn. The professors really take the time to make sure you understand your work.
Alum,4,Loved the overall experience I had at this school. I do feel as if there should be more education provided for things such as college costs and student loans but that also goes for all colleges. Bit I feel that Avila gave me the best experience I could ask for when it came to student-teacher relationships and overall campus life.
Senior,4,I love the diverse campus and how small classes are. The people around campus are down to earth and easy to communicate with. Campus is pretty small to be places in a timely manner. I love how things are financially worked out for us relating to books in our tuition.
Senior,4,Avila is a good school all in all like the fact that it is a small college so you can get more help from your professor. I also know everybody here because its a small school
Junior,4,Avila University has a good learning environment. Staff and faculties care about students success. The school makes learning resources available to students to succeed.
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help if you needed. You get great one on one with teachers.
Alum,4,"My experience at Avila University was overall very good. The university is private and so that makes it smaller than most universities, which was something I really liked. Professors on this campus are more likely to be involved with their students needs in their class and also be able to to recognize that because of the smaller class sizes. That also makes it easier for students to receive the help and attention they need in classes. However, one thing I hope to change at Avila is the maintenance for the dorms. The dorms are nice enough but if maintenance kept up with them a little more than I think it would be better for the students living on campus."
Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small so you get more one on one action with your professor! Everyone is very friendly and the teachers actually care and want you to excel and have success.
Freshman,4,A small college that is suited for those who may not be able to succeed in the enormous lecture halls of major universities. They care about their students suceeding and do what they can to help. however it is very expensive thus causing for scholarships or loans unless you're an athlete
Freshman,4,I like the size of the university because it allows for a greater interaction between students and professors. It allows the professors to have a genuine interest in the success of their students.
Freshman,4,"Avila University is a small, yet diverse school. They care about your well-being and academics. All of the 4 year and Minor programs are great."
Sophomore,4,"I had a really hard time making friends here at Avila, everybody is nice, but I just don't feel like I fit in. What I do like, is all the international students. It's great to see how many students are from other countries studying here. I also really like how small the school is. It makes it to where you usually know of most people on campus or have mutual friends, and you also have a small class which makes the subject more focused and the teacher has more free time in the office to talk t students that need help."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the classroom size. I always feel safe on campus. My teachers do help us with what we need help on too.
Freshman,4,"Avila is a very great place to be! There's people here from all over the world. It is a smaller university, though. This is beneficial because it gives you more undecided attention and help with or from your instructors, counselors, and mentors. It's also beneficial because it is a way of getting to know your peers better. Also, Avila is a great athlete school so if you're interested in any sport and would like to receive scholarships, it's a perfect fit! Like I stated before, there's people from all over the world here, and most are athletes!"
College Freshman,4,I have not yet been to the campus directory where they give us help finding employment during and after college even but I'm confident that it has the capabilities to help me.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are fantastic.  My professors all enjoy teaching.  There is only one professor I have any problem with and that is actually because of the lack of course work we have assigned.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are very spacious and you can't hear what other people are doing in their rooms.  The lobby area is nice and the kitchen is helpful.  The only downsides are that there's communal bathrooms and that one of the dryers is broken.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the closeness of the campus and the availability of my professors.  Everyone is very approachable and I am able to have fun at college while pursuing my degree successfully.
College Freshman,4,i love it my program offers so much
College Freshman,4,it's a great place and I don't think I'd ever be in major danger
College Freshman,4,I like the ways the rooms are and now even if you don't live on campus you can be assigned a floor that you're able to participate in activities with
College Freshman,4,I don't know much but what's available for the public is so cool! they have a private section just for athletes and the other section is for all students.
College Freshman,4,it's super welcoming and is already challenging me to do my absolute best.
Recent Alumnus,4,Avila is very hands on with helping you get jobs and internships. We even have a scheduled day where companies come in to interview the students. Students are able to showcase their resumes and their work in hopes of meeting potential employers. The alumni is also a huge part of helping out the current students. The career center is a very useful tool.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have never lived on campus so this doesn't really apply to me. However, housing is extremely close to the classes and the longest walk residents make would be around five minutes. The location is excellent."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm not an athlete at Avila University. However, student involvement in Avila athletics is extremely high. A large majority of students at Avila are student athletes. The school spirit is consistently high. The athletic facilities are pristine."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love all of my professors and feel that, overall, I've obtained a great education. Like all students, however, I'm concerned about life after college and finding a job."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've never had a problem with crime or assault on campus, nor has anyone else I know. I'm even friends with some of our Campus Safety team members. Avila is an extremely safe campus, probably due in part to its size."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Since our school is so small, and most everyone knows each other, school spirit and student involvement is high. Athletes support each other and different sports, and those of us who are not athletes support our friends who are, either by managing the teams, attending games, or participating in fundraisers."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I thoroughly enjoy attending Avila, and am pleased I decided to enroll there. It is small, which cuts down on networking though education. However, the professors make up for this lack of networking. They are invested in our well-being and make time to help us, both with our in-school education and our outside internships/job searches."
College Senior,4,"One is not given a degree from Avila, they have to earn their degree.  Avila is very serious about you studying and applying yourself. They know the students like myself who want to be there from those who do not."
College Junior,4,Class sizes and professors are great! The small class sizes allow students to be more engaged and get to know the professors. The professors seem to really care about their students.
College Junior,4,Students are constantly receiving emails about job or internship opportunities.
College Junior,4,"I love the fact that it's a small school. The fact that we have small class sizes makes it easier to be engaged and to ask questions. Overall, I love my school. The only complaint I have is that the school is making many changes but I know these changes are being made to help us."
College Senior,4,My overall experience at Avila has been great so far but due to a few setbacks I still prevail that Avila University is the best school of choice.
College Senior,4,Although I do not attend any of the games.
College Junior,4,Pretty solid athletic facilities. Weight room is lacking in size and equipment though and the shared field is in good shape cosmetically but sharing it isn't ideal.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe at school.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great. There is a lot of activity in all of the dorms at all times during the day. The rooms are spacious and accommodations are good as well. I find that the cleaning crew decides to skip out on doing their jobs for weeks at a time, mainly causing the bathrooms to be empty of necessities with an overflow of trash. Other than that, the dorms are a great and friendly environment. It makes living on campus a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"I have not spent much time at any athletic events due to studying and work, but from what I have seen the facilities are great. There are some aspects that could be improved but otherwise very accommodating and useful."
Senior,2,"I chose Avila because they offered my major and also would get to play the sport I was recruited into.  They stressed academics before athletics but failed to follow through with that, seem to think they are a D1 college instead of NAIA.  The coaching staff is very lacking, it's more like being back in club/high school instead of college, you can buy your way into playing time instead of hard work.  Academic advising is also lacking, will be graduating with my degree and have received no guidance for the next step in either graduate studies or starting my career."
College Freshman,2,"i am terrified to take a shower because the bathrooms are 80 degrees, smelly, the showers (which were once white) are turning a darker shade of brown... i showed a picture to my mother and she gagged."
College Freshman,2,The price goes up dramatically for absolutely no reason. Most of the professors are really nice but some refuse to teach and just assign reading and homework even on Saturdays and Sundays. And the housekeeping for the kitchen and bathrooms is terrible. I should not be terrified to take a shower. There is food and dirt all over the floors. The curtains in the showers were once white but are now turning brown. The floor is white tile but is turning brown. I will be transferring after this semester.
College Sophomore,2,The athletics are trying to dominate the campus life but the teams are not that great so it doesn't make any sense.
College Freshman,2,I rarely know when a game is going on. I feel like the other students do not really support the teams.
College Senior,2,"The food is your average run-of-the-mill sustainability plan. Although the campus dining hall workers make a great effort, unfortunately most of the food is highly processed and preserved. The prices are pretty high and outrageous even if you buy a meal pass especially for the quality; but after all, college food is about quantity not quality."
College Senior,2,If you do not get to campus early or show up in the afternoon parking is hard to find
College Freshman,2,"Often times here in Kansas City it rains a lot, its always cold, or snowing, Weather changes constantly."
College Senior,2,"I haven't use the computer labs, but the WiFi is spotty at best. The system tends to go down more time than I would like."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough parking for anyone. Especially commutors, but also those who live on campus. When you can find a spot to park, it's not bad, but you 're not gauranteed a spot when you need one."
College Sophomore,2,The food here isn't to die for. I mean if your hungry you'll eat it but nothing spectacular.
College Sophomore,2,Its a small school so its not like you get to meet alot of people everyday. But its also fun because it isnt hard to know and get along with every. Its also no fun going to the games and not alot of people showing up because the school is so small. I'm from Texas where football means everything so we have wuite a few people there at all the games so coming to this school was a big change.
College Junior,2,The area is more of a suburb which makes the rent extremely high.
College Freshman,2,"Avila is a hands on school, it is also a religious school and a dry campus so there is no nightlife like D1 schools"
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is located in Kansas City, Missouri so if you don't like snow and ice this isn't the campus for you. In Missouri the weather changes often. It will be hot then the next day it's snowing. The weather in the summer, spring ang fall is okay. I hate winter weather, especially when I have to go to class. Even if it snowed and ice is on the rodes class won't be cancelled. I drove to school on the icy rodes and didn't slide. But once I got on campus i slide about 3 times and almost got into an accident with another car. The parking lots were very slick. The only upside to having class in the winter at Avila is that thereare some tunes so that you can alk to your classes without walking outside."
College Junior,2,They are average to slightly bad and everything is kind of old
College Junior,2,"My parents won't let me drive in college, and everything remotely ""close"" to Avila is 15-20 minute drive. There are next to no food options near campus except for fast food."
College Sophomore,2,The police are really strict but you can get away with things.
College Sophomore,2,"No Man's Land â€“ nothing super-close, and only one place on campus. have to drive to get to anything."
College Senior,2,"Program Shouldn't Be Discontinued â€“ The current Pre-Law Studies program is being discontinued but Avila is offering me personal plan. Although this personal plan is not very flexible. Classes are only offered one time during the semester, if even offered that semester. Workload is okay and the teachers are great!"
Recent Alumnus,1,I can't answer this question because at Avila we don't have greek life.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I selected ""it's the worst"" only because we don't have Greek Life. It probably would be nice to have Sororities and Fraternities, even though I myself would not care to be a part of either."
College Senior,1,School is too small so you never meet any fresh faces. Most students have a herd mentality. This school is honestly like high school all over again. Academics are OK but could be better.
College Freshman,1,"Unfortunately, the school does not offer sororities or fraternities."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is the worst part of my day! It is horrendous!!! I commute everyday about 30 miles and it is rediculous when I arrive on campus. One day it was pouring down rain and I had to park two neighborhoods away! So the next time this happened, I parked where others were on campus that were not necessarily parking spots and got a ticket."
College Freshman,1,The only transportation is for players to games other than that there really isnt any you have to rely on cars
College Junior,1,Middle of nowhere and everything is accessible only by car
College Junior,1,HORRIBLE. The cafeteria food is ridiculously bad and the only other options are Subway and fast food.
College Freshman,1,DONT EAT IT â€“ save your money and eat off campus or cook yourself because the cafe is a mystery every day
College Junior,1,"Awful, but in the Process of Improving â€“ The cafeteria food is rarely appealing for most students.  However, we have a points system that allows a certain amount of Subway or pizza purchases, which can be convenient when your schedule gets rough.  The cafeteria was recently redesigned, but the food is still lacking."

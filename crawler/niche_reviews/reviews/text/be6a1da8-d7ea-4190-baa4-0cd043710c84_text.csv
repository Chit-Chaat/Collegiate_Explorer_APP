It is a somewhat small, Christian college with a work study program that allows you to work on campus in order to pay for your tuition.

There is nothing I disliked about the college!"
Niche User,5,I don't have an experience with college of the Ozarks other than the NAIA. This is a basjetball tournament they host every year. They also have fireworks around the 4th of July. Students can earn their tuition by working in the field they are going to school for right at the school. It's a little college but kind of nice in the beautiful ozarks

Freshman,5,"The students and faculty are people you will find nowhere else. They are welcoming before you even hit the ground of the campus. The security is phenomenal and I feel so safe when I'm at the school. I feel that my education is top notch because they pride themselves on making students work for the grade they want, and they still take the time to help you succeed. I have gotten very involved in my first semester at the college and don't look to stop anytime soon."

Alum,5,"I graduated in 1997 with a degree in Criminal Justice and Psychology.  I have had a long and distinguished career in Law Enforcement.  I attribute my success to my education at C of O.  My on campus job in construction has given me the skills to maintain, repair and upgrade my own home.   My work ethic was strong before attending and even stronger after.  I truly is Hard work U."

Niche User,5,College of the Ozarks is a great place. The students and faculty are very friendly and informal. I like that students can work for their tuition.
Senior,5,"My experience I was very pleased with how easy the process was, it did not take me very long to begin to like the college. This college was very interesting and I like the ability that you can work your tuition off because where I come from not very man people have money in this small down. With not everybody having a lot of money not a lot is expected from us, but if I was given a chance then I would make the most of it. I really enjoy playing sports and I seen they have many options for intramural sports or co-ed. "
College Sophomore,5,College of the Ozarks is a great school and I am lucky to attend it. Getting the opportunity to work for my tuition so I can graduate debt-free is amazing.

College Junior,5,I feel extremely safe on this campus. We have our own security department as well as security gates at our entrance.
College Junior,5,"Getting a job after graduating C of O is easy! Employers love the aspect of a ""work for tuition"" college. They know that you have a hard work ethic instilled in you. They value the faith and morals as well."
College Junior,5,"The professors are great! Sometimes I feel I could be challenged a little more, but mostly I agree with the level of education they are teaching students."
College Junior,5,The student involvement at College of the Ozarks is amazing. There are weekly events throughout each semester that students have the opportunity to be a part of.

Our school also provides buses for students to travel on to games far away.
College Freshman,5,This college has huge turnouts for boys basketball games and show tons of school spirit.
College Freshman,5,"What makes C of O unique is the work education program. A student must work 15 hours a week to pay for tuition on top of schooling and homework. it is difficult, but it can be done."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school. It has a great atmosphere and environment, and everyone is really friendly. The teachers are top notch and helpful."
College Sophomore,5,Parties are usually campus sponsored events that don't include anything illegal yet we are still having fun. These parties give us a break from studying and a chance to have fun with no alcohol or drugs involved. There are events all the time happening around campus.
College Sophomore,5,They give us strict rules and enforce them so that we gain great values at college that help us in the future.
College Sophomore,5,Enforced rules are great for us to learn how to be responsible adults.
College Freshman,5,They pay your tuition and still offer food and R&B scholarships!
College Freshman,5,"It is free, tons of fun and there is no alcohol involved, that means no stupid fights, passing out or sleazy drunkards hitting on you!  plush, there's often free food, good music and good friends."

College Junior,5,"Southern Missouri is usually always on the warmer side for Missouri. My college is located in the Ozarks- which has been rated one of the most beautiful places in the United States of America. The weather is absolutely beautiful and it allows the grass, trees, bushes, and flowers to be healthy and bright. It also allows endless hours on the lake whether you are on speedboats, canoes, docks, swimming, or just walking around the many shopping centers and parks."
College Junior,5,All the professors in this college genuinely care about the students and go out of their way to help them.
College Junior,5,The college is almost completely student run. the criminal justice majors are the security on campus under a hired manager.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love how the professors are there to assist us, not just to talk at us."
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because of the student life on campus. We do all sorts of fun stuff like Mudfest, Sadie Hawkins and others that you wouldn't find at other schools."
College Junior,5,"I love all of my professors in my department! I have not come across one class that I do not enjoy. Every class is difficult, and pushes you to expand your worldview."
College Junior,5,Everything is completely paid for through scholarships at C of O!
College Freshman,5,Branson is a wonderful family friendly place. It is very safe and very supportive. Living in Branson is almost like living in a retirement home though.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid office is very helpful with all needs! The financial aid office is basically the main go to office on campus considering 90% of accepted students need financial aid!
College Junior,5,"being a cj major rocks, not a lot of homework and its really hands on once you get up in the higher level classes. two days ago i took my midterm and i got to pull over people and shoot at ""criminals"" with an air soft gun."
College Sophomore,5,We have so many international students and missionary kids. The diversity here is great and helps us to learn about other cultures and backgrounds.
College Junior,5,"Human biology, great program! They are willing to help you and advice  you for anything. So many opportunities around here."
College Freshman,5,"There is a zero tolerance policy on drugs that is strictly in forced.

College Junior,5,"Sports at College of the ozarks are huge. Many students get involved, for fan support and school spirit. In our campus we have a great training and work out facility."
College Junior,5,The professors are very helpful. They care about their students and will go above and beyond their duties to help every student. The workload is moderate and challenging. Students learn a lot!
Sophomore,4,During the Covid-19 pandemic the college has enforced some very illogical rules such as forcing students to stay on campus throughout the week and not allowing off-campus work. But when there wasn't a pandemic the college was very good overall.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the opportunity to work for my education.  I think that some of the policies could be relaxed, but I understand why they are in place.  Overall I really  get to experience a lot and achieve a rich education in a Christ-centered environment, and I am grateful for that."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the community of the college, as well as the work study program that allows students to graduate debt free!! I gained so many useful skills from my on campus work experiences! Something I would like to see change is the level of grace offered to students."
Freshman,4,It is a great college to go to and it allows you to graduate with little to no debt. Working and classes keeps students busy.
Freshman,4,It was an easy transition and the professors adapted well to the online learning. There was also a grade safety net system to help students with any problems caused by the change.
Senior,4,"The school is not designed for everyone. One of the biggest challenges for students is learning time management between school and working on campus. Once a student learns how to manage their time, it opens up a multitude of opportunities for the student to growth in their personal and professional life."
Sophomore,4,This school has a wonderful team of staff and teachers that are devoted to Christ and encourage all their students to pursue God and to do their best! They focus on hard work and good work ethics in order to set us up for society.
Sophomore,4,College of the Ozarks is a good college however it is extremely conservative. Finding your place when you don’t necessarily agree with the schools views on certain issues can be difficult but it’s definitely worth graduating debt free!!
Freshman,4,"As a freshman about to enter orientation, I have so far been pleased with my experience at this college. The only problem I've had was a minor miscommunication regarding my immunizations, but it was cleared up by a kind nurse. I have so far found the campus to be beautiful and functional, and the people to be helpful and friendly."
Freshman,4,The college was very good at establish a community and providing help to succeed. I would like to see them be more clear on rules.
Senior,4,amazing work college. no tuition to pay for but room and board are high. very Christian and patriotic school.
Sophomore,4,"Would highly recommend the College of the Ozarks to any student seeking to make connections throughout their college career. CofO brings in highly distinguished speakers and visitors often, and leaves open opportunity for students to engage with them. The biggest thing I would like to see changed here is the student meal plans: not every body needs to pay for three meals a day they likely don't have the time for. We are too busy working! #hardworkU"
Sophomore,4,"College of the Ozarks provides education with free tuition.   To ""pay"" for your tuition you work 15 hours a week along with classes.  The opportunities for work, paid trips, etc at College of the Ozark are extremely wide and varied.  The efforts to help students graduate debt free are amazing.   This college certainly requires a good work ethic and attitude to thrive.  I didn't think the rules were very strict, but I heard a lot of kids complaining about them.  So you have to come in knowing you are getting a good deal.  Make the most out of the opportunities you are given!"
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at College of the Ozarks thus far. The food is average to any other campus. The cafeteria has a wide range of food to choose from. However just like anything, it can become repetitive and burnt out. Another area that I rank average is the dorms and housings. They are not the most spacious, however I believe they are good size. One area that I ranked highly is campus. The reason for this is because the campus is always clean and well maintained. The reasoning for this is because of the students who work fifteen hours a week. Lastly, I ranked the safety of the school high because we have a good amount of guards on campus who do a great job."
Sophomore,4,"I am honored to be apart of the College of the Ozarks community. Does C of O have its downsides? of course! However, it is an awesome college to attend while offering so many amazing opportunities for its students."
Alum,4,"Loved the professors, loved the work study aspect, terrible and corrupt administration. It's religious and extremely conservative; I grew up in a conservative home and a lot of times even I had to ""fake it"" and just go along with what was happening. Be prepared that a lot of people get kicked out, even for small things like walking on the grass. But hey, it's free so they expect you to keep your mouth shut."
Freshman,4,"College of the Ozarks is a 4-year private Christian college that allows students to work on-campus to cover all of their tuition fees. As a student, I am truly grateful for the program in this college and I believe it accomplishes to aid many students in financial need. However, I believe certain rules and regulations this college set is holding students back. The college needs to better prepare students for the ""real world"" after college by exposing students to more diversity. College of the Ozarks needs to better serve their students from all regions of the world and in all aspects of college life."
Sophomore,4,"College of the Ozarks is an unique opportunity for those who are unable to pay for their college education. You have a chance to work for your education, and will graduate with little to no debt. Of course you still must pay for books and your room and board, but they have a summer work program for those who are unable to afford room and board payments. It is a challenging school, but well worth the hard work."
Sophomore,4,"This is currently my third semester at College of the Ozarks. Compared to other achools, it is very unique.  You are required to have an on campus job which pays for your tuition.  You only pay for room and board.  College of the ozarks allows you to graduate from college debt free."
Freshman,4,"I love the community at College of the Ozarks. This is a great place to grow in Christ and become a hardworking, patriotic citizen of America. There are a lot of opportunities to travel and a lot of events on campus. "
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman at College of the Ozarks year wise, but regarding credits, I'm three credits away from being a sophomore. It is a work college. The jobs varying from working in the admissions office to working in the laundromat. My job is in the kitchen at the Keeter Center. There have already been many students that I know personally that have dropped out, are going to drop out, or are going to transfer. It is hard, but I have learned so much about myself and life just the short three months that I've been here. Classes are hard, and professors ACTUALLY expect you to learn. It's not all work and no play here. There are ways to get involved. Something is going on every single night, whether it's a volleyball game or a convocation, there's always something to stay alive. They have these events so the work and academics don't suffocate us as students. I recommend C of O for anyone looking for a Christian education but wants to WORK for it. "
College Junior,4,There are no parties at our school
College Junior,4,"At night the campus usually dies out because the students have a curfew at 1 am, and we are not allowed to be out."
College Junior,4,"There are many opportunities for students, but there is a heavy workload."
College Junior,4,The campus makes sure the students feel safe by security. The College closes the gates at 1 AM so that no one can get in or out of the college.
College Junior,4,Most of the professors care about the students and do their best to help students.
College Senior,4,I feel safe and I am never worried about being assaulted while out on campus late at night.
College Sophomore,4,I thoroughly enjoy most of my classes and believe the quality of these courses and my professors are very high.
College Sophomore,4,There have been many different employers wanting to recruit students from College of the Ozarks mainly based on our scholarship system. All students that attend work for their tuition (15 hours per week during the semester). This leads to shaping students to becoming hard and good workers.
College Sophomore,4,"There is little to no campus crime. I feel very safe in my dorm as the RAs make sure to lock all entry doors after curfew. I have also noticed our security patrols campus all throughout the day, which makes me feel safe as well."
College Sophomore,4,The dorm I'm in has adequate space and provides the amenities I need.
College Sophomore,4,A good majority of the students always come out to support our Bobcats/Ladycats when they have home games. Our Student Council (Called Student Union) always make sure to invite students to games and always attend the games themselves fully decked out in school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,The rooms are great very spacious and comfortable with double occupancy it can be a little tight but other than that there's a good sense of community in the dorms and we're all a big family.
College Sophomore,4,Very good basketball team and the baseball field is extremely well kept student support at games is amazing as well as hosting the NAIA tournament brings a lot of people to campus and let's us show our hospitality to people from all over the country.
College Sophomore,4,Campus security is always around.
College Sophomore,4,There is a job fair every semester.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small so you get more personal attention from the professors.
College Sophomore,4,"On campus housing gets better as you become an upper class man and can move into the nicer, more spacious dorms."
College Sophomore,4,This is a great school if you don't mind rules and hard work.
College Junior,4,Great facilities and athletic programs.
College Junior,4,Continuing to grow my work ethic and gain academically as I progress in college.
College Junior,4,"The room and board fees are quite expensive. However, students do have the opportunity to work on campus throughout the summer to pay those off. I do not live on campus so I do not know much about the resident lifestyle."
College Junior,4,"College of the Ozarks is a wonderful school! I am able to get a Bachelor's Degree by working for it. Otherwise, I would have had to go to a Junior College. My professors truly care. The work load we have at our school is an adequate amount, but we still have plenty of time for our studies. Working at both C of O and my off campus job makes me aim to have efficient time management. Our supervisors here are great as well. They demonstrate Christ-like character, and our professors do as well. I know for a fact that if I needed any kind of help at my school I would have several people lending their hand to me. That is the best feeling to have at a college."
College Freshman,4,"While it is most definitely a difficult school to attend, I find it to be worth the hardship that one must endure to attend it."
College Sophomore,4,"The cost is a little overwhelming, but Financial aid workers are always willing to listen and work out a payment plan if needed."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel as if our door could be compared to parking spaces. Dorm rooms are hard to live in with two people. Dorms are very well kept. I feel as if RA's could do a better job on connecting with all residents, but I understand that they are busy. Room and Board is pricy, but I cannot complain I am receiving a free education, and deeming my relationship with God. I love it here!"
College Sophomore,4,It's great for students who are married or just live right near campus.
College Sophomore,4,Basically there are a lot of shopping areas outside of campus that include a variety of food options. I usually only go to a fast food place like Chick-Fil-A when I am offered a ride there since I currently do not have a car on campus.
College Sophomore,4,We also house the Keeter center which students can get a discount at. I don't always eat at the caf due to being pretty busy so I keep meals in my dorm.
College Sophomore,4,"There a lot of fast food places including McDonalds and Taco Bell right down the street and if you turn instead of going strait there is a Subway, Sonic, and a grocery store. The strip, which has a ton of restaurants is fifteen minutes away and then there is the landing which also has some places and at one we get 50% off."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a ton of available scholarships but getting them is difficult sometimes, a lot of the times actually. Although tuition is paid for so can't complain and if you work during the summer then your room and board are also paid for and usually once you get accepted you will continue to get accepted."
College Freshman,4,"during tourist season, it can be hard to get to good spots, but Springfield is just up the road and is also full of good food options."
College Freshman,4,"It's a strict school, you know that when you sign up.  But you're safe here and you can always find someone if you need help."
College Freshman,4,"Yes, underclassmen rooms are small and you must share with another, but our dorms are very nice considering, very close to classes and wonderful social gatherings."
College Freshman,4,"I don't use the athletic facilities very much, but they are very nice and adequate for the demands of our school."
College Freshman,4,"Since I am a freshman, I am not in the Education program, but I know that there are tests you have to pass to be accepted to the Education program. It is a very good program."
College Freshman,4,"I did not go to college for parties, and my school fits what I wanted very well. We have school sponsored events, but no ""parties""."
College Junior,4,The financial aid that I have been qualified for has come in a decent time and has been easy to manage. The only downfall that I have had is the A+ program from my high school. I have 5 years to use this A+ scholarship or I lose it. The unfortunate part of it is that this scholarship requires all other scholarships and grants to pay first. They only pay for what is left over.
College Junior,4,"I am a double major, and the curriculum fits my desired degree."
College Junior,4,We have a great gym to utilize!
Alum,2,Below average in many areas.  There are only a few athletics opportunities available.  Many jobs will work you beyond the 15 mandated hours and you will never be reimbursed for these hours.  There is a good party scene if you know where to go.  Diversity is lacking.  Diversity of opinion in many classes is discouraged.
Sophomore,2,"I encountered many things that I did not know, in going there, despite much research. I had toxic black mold in my dorm room, and became severely ill. Administration did not want to address the problem. Eventually I moved dorm rooms, but still months later I am suffering from the health damages that were done to me. The college has 15 hour a week work requirement, but are not flexible or understanding with the schedules, and I often only get 4 hours of sleep a night as I have to close and open my facility on back to back to back days. This college is basically like a glorified high school. If you loved high school and want an environment most of your day is planned out for you, with limited free time, and lots of micromanaging, then this is the place for you! But it you are like me and you like you independence, do not come here. What I thought would be a wonderful experience for me has been a terrible one."
Alum,2,"The college had its ups and downs. Working for tuition was great, graduating debt free was amazing. The teachers were all astounding, there were very few who were not just amazing teachers. Campus life was mediocre, offering some athletic prowess, and offering lots of groups, which not very many people had the time for, due to school and work. The politics of the college was the worst. The administration failed to make college enjoyable through policies that only satisfied the ones who donated to the college. Liabilities, such as a girl with fish allergies, are treated poorly. That girl was sent to work directly with fish at the Keeter Center, and became ill. That girl was later dismissed from college because she was a ""liability."" C of O also discourages marriage by not investing in married housing, diminishing commuters, and flat-out telling students that they should not get married until they graduate."
College Junior,2,There are no sororities at College of the Ozarks
College Senior,2,It's old and Janky until you become an upperclassmen and then move to Barrett
College Sophomore,2,"They suck a lot of fun away while in dorms since the opposite sex cant come into your dorm except once per semester when open house is going on however, they host a lot of campus events that can be fun and while they are strict with alcohol and drugs not being allowed you wont need them to have fun."
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are VERY small, very old, and not very clean. Dorm life is not optional. Many social events are offered through the dorm. A new dorm is being built, and it is believed to be nicer."
College Senior,2,I live with my parents so my cost of living is less then others. commuters are being systematically weeded out. you can now only live off campus if you are married
College Sophomore,2,"if it rains, no lounges are open, there for you just go to sleep."
College Sophomore,2,"Near Branson, Mo.  nothing but boring, same old, shows.  Few things to do.  Nothing on campus, nothing off campus.  Springfield, Mo is usually where we end up"
College Junior,2,the school will take a van to walmart once a week and thats it
College Freshman,2,"The dorms for males are wonderful, they are spacious, and fairly new. The dorms for females vary in quality depending on what year you are. Most freshman girls are piled two at a time in a room originally built for 1 male to live in, but senior girls can live in the most spacious room on campus with a suit style restroom. Though the senior dorm is the oldest on campus, and doesn't seem in best quality, the size and the age of the dorms for females is not good, but males have great dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"the food is subpar, but free if you work the summer work program. there is only the café on campus and it gets old quickly."
College Junior,2,"Can Be Quite Lonely – coffee house night helps connect the kids along with the bible studies, but there's no central place to hang out. kids can feel very lonely if they aren't naturally social"
College Freshman,2,"Most Are Not Allowed to Live Off Campus – You can find housing off campus for a decent price, but you have to be married or living with family to be allowed to live off campus."
College Junior,2,Its Strict – There is a curfew at 1 any given time of the week. Fresmen are nto allowed to have thier cars except on the weekends. Only certain parking is allowed for commuters and dorm residents. Cant live off campus unless married or living with parents.
College Sophomore,2,"No Choice in WHERE to Go. Good food, considering the circumstances. There is only one student cafeteria. No choices after 6:30..."
College Senior,2,"Free COLLEGE! Yes we do work for our tuition and some their room and board. But sometimes I wonder if it is really worth it because of all their strict rules and policies. You can't even dye your hair whatever color you want. It has to look natural. And i'm talking it has to all be ONE color, and it better be a normal color or they WILL make you change it. They kick people out for expressing their homosexuality; WRONG."
Alum,1,There are very few online classes at this college which has its pros and cons. Plan on being present in every class.
Niche User,1,"I went to school here for 2 years and in my time I learned what this place truly is... a Cult. The administration and staff do not care about their students. The dorms are infested with roaches and black mold is a huge problem based off their medieval A/C methods. The classrooms have no A/C and they are extremely outdated desks and rooms. The cafeteria serves garbage food and is not safe to consume because the students who work there don’t follow proper health and safety procedures. The administration will not help you, they will only call you into their office to condemn you call you “Not a good christian”. They also are extremely cruel and have zero tolerance for almost anything so they kick high amounts of people. EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER RATE! This is not a christian college it is a fake cult that wishes it could be something one day. Anyone who leaves a good review about this place is so blatantly and obviously lying and are apart of the cult themselves."
Freshman,1,"The review from May 2017 basically outlined everything I thought about the school. I would never encourage anyone to attend College of the Ozarks in the manner of which they now practice.
The professors are wonderful, but unfortunately there are no other positive things I can say about this school."
College Freshman,1,Fraternities and Sororities do not exist at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"Only place to eat is the Caf, and it is terrible.  most unhealthy food for you and taste terrible.  When there is some good food, all the food is good, but when it's bad, it is all very bad."
College Sophomore,1,"terrible wireless, always disconnecting, slow internet.  WiFi is only on a few select places on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"We are no longer allowed to live off campus, unless we are married, or live with parents!"
College Sophomore,1,anything fun is against the rules and you will be kicked out.  Night life here is watching a G-rated movie in a lounge.  No opposite genders in rooms/dorms.
College Junior,1,"The school policies are very strict. They exclude you from partying at all. No drinking is allowed at all.  If it makes the school look bad, they kick you out. They have a strict dress code. as well as no more than two piercings, no tatoos, etc. Usually we have to be careful on who we talk to because some people could turn you in. You have to be careful. Overall its very strict."
College Freshman,1,The nightlife at CofO consists of religious groups or sports games
College Sophomore,1,"Commuting to CofO is difficult, as students accepted can currently not live off campus unless they live with parents or are married."
College Junior,1,"There Is None – you may walk, ride a bike or drive your own car but there's no public transportation"
College Sophomore,1,There is no way to get anywhere unless you drive yourself around campus or walk.
College Senior,1,"None Existent – There are no parties, bar scenes, etc because this school is way TOOO conservative and VERY STRICT."
College Sophomore,1,"Dining Center – Our dining center needs to offer more choices than it does. Mainly, I feel that there needs to be more healthy options. Our school acts like it is all about being in good physical shape but the cafeteria offers very unhealthy options. All the food is soaked in Phase, which is a buttery oil substance. So I am left with the option of a salad or a sandwich. There aren't many options for the sandwhich either as far as the bread and meats. And our cereals are always the same. They never get changed so there isn't any variety. The room and board here is fairly expensive. And unlike many schools, we don't have the option of adjusting our meal plan to how many meals we actually eat at the dining center."
College Freshman,1,"No Greeks to Speak of – There is no Greek housing at College of the Ozarks. There are a few honor societies such as Sigma Zeta, but that's about it."
College Freshman,1,"This school is a wonderful place to meet all different kinds of people. There are many international students, and so C of O is pretty diverse. However, C of O is a private Christian college, and so there are certain rules pertaining to sexual orientation. Basically: If anyone is found to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or anything but straight, there is a good chance of negative reactions, and not necessarily from fellow students, but the administration as well."
College Freshman,1,Just Awe-Full – I had the hardest time trying to get the only financial aid that I could. The college goes over your FAFSA and picks out every little mistake the THINK you made. After many office appointments and copies I finally got it done but it was an extreme hassle. My advice is to start as early as humanly possible so that you have time to make any corrections.

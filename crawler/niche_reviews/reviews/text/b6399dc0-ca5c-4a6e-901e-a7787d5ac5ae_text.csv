Sophomore,5,"I recently took Zoom classes from CMC and like everyone, it was a difficult transition. Luckily, the faculty all genuinely cared and wanted to connect with their students. Even though there were random wi-fi shutdown and what not (by no mean are these factors controllable) I think it is safe to say all the professors managed to work hard and help make the online experience enjoyable."
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising sophomore at CMC and I can genuinely say I have enjoyed my experience so far. In my first year, I have learned and experienced a variety of academic and personal things about myself. There are a lot of points I would love to touch upon that 1000 characters simply cannot express, whether it be the caring faculty or the culture surrounding the Claremont Colleges (particularly CMC). However, for anyone who is curious as to what kind of a school CMC is, It can only best be described by its close-knit community. The student body is unique in the sense that you only have about 300 students from a diverse set of backgrounds per class, which will either be good or bad depending on the kind of experience you want. If you would like to be a random number and disappear, this would NOT be the school for you. In contrast, if you would like to create change at a school that progresses and challenges the world in various aspects, I recommend you to absolutely join CMC."
Niche User,5,Its student body is incredible along with the gorgeous campus. The University looks out for its students and their families no matter the financial background. The community is strong between the students with each other as well as parents with the school.
Freshman,5,"First off, there is such a welcoming, tight-knit community on campus. At first, I was a bit worried about how small the school is, but I've grown to love it. I'm always making new friends and forming special bonds with classmates that I wouldn't have had at a larger school. Yes, there is a party scene here, but there's no pressure to conform. The students are very respectful, understanding, and caring here. We just have a work hard, play hard mentality and a generally outgoing student body. Also, the school truly does an amazing job at preparing its students for their future careers by challenging them to emerge as leaders and critical thinkers. The students that come to CMC are passionate, hard-working, and driven, and being surrounded by such people is incredibly inspirational. Coming to CMC was one of the best choices I've made. It really is a home away from home."
Niche User,5,"Great academics, athletics, research opportunities, and parties. Highly recommend this institution for those interested in economics."
Sophomore,5,"Claremont Mckenna College is an amazing academic institution. Every student here is so passionate and loves to learn. Claremont has an incredible, close knit-community that is incredibly supportive. My professors all are so kind and involved. I love CMC! Sko nas!"
Freshman,5,"I visited the school and I loved it so much, down to the programs offered and the academics. I can't wait to attend this school!"
Niche User,5,I liked the drive that students had both in academics but also in sports and career exploration.  The opportunities that CMC offers both through the Atheneum and sponsored scholarships are unparalleled.
Alum,5,"Claremont McKenna was a great place to go to school. The people are very friendly, and the small size allows for getting to know many different people as well as participating in small class discussions."
Freshman,5,"I love this place more than words can describe. CMCers are unique. Everyone shares the same drive for success and achievement, and everyone truly finds their niche on campus. Whether it's in a sport, in student government, in the Rose institute, in event planning, in KLI, there is something for everyone to get involved and active. The school is everything I want and more. The small classes makes learning so much more interesting; trust me, sitting around a table with 15 other people and talking about government or philosophy is super enjoyable. Socially, it is so ridiculously easy to make friends. Everyone is so friendly and outgoing, you really have to try to not make any. The party scene is fantastic. What other school has a drinking policy like this or would give the student government hundreds of thousands of dollars to plan parties. It's kind of ridiculous, but CMC is ridiculous, and I love it so much."
Niche User,5,This is a great place for motivated curious problem solvers who are also nice and well spoken.  Student are hyper involved constantly perfecting the “90-second” elevator speech and seemingly always ready to tell you their position on the latest thing. Kids like to relax too and everyone is well known at this small liberal arts college feeler with students who said no to the Ivies to come here.
Niche User,5,"Claremont is a wonderful place to learn, I am so lucky to have the opportunity to study there. Comparable to the top schools in the country"
Alum,5,"Really great professors and campus life. As a student who chose not to drink, I never felt left out or pressured. CMC has a very inclusive social scene. There are a lot of ways to get involved on campus, and it truly feels like a close-knit community."
Junior,5,"CMC is located 35 miles east of Los Angeles in the city of Claremont. Famous for its tree-lined streets and world-renowned colleges, Claremont offers unique warmth, engaged charm, and community spirit. Claremont Village has a wide array of restaurants and shops as well as a movie theater and art museum. You can explore further by attending one of the many college-sponsored trips to cultural and entertainment destinations in Los Angeles as well as various outdoor excursions in the local mountains, desert, and beaches."
Niche User,5,Claremont McKenna College was an amazing environment! The small amount of students attending helps the students have a chance to get to know everyone
Freshman,5,Claremont McKenna College is one of the premier colleges on the West Coast in my opinion. Its focus on academics and its success at placing graduates at jobs in their fields are its most stellar achievements.
Freshman,5,"Where do I begin, I have so much to say about how much I love this school. When I first came to Claremont McKenna, I feared that it would be difficult to make friends as it is such a small school. However, the first day shocked me completely. Everyone was so freaking nice, like unbelievably nice. In the last 3 months of being here, I know about 250/360 kids in my class, and of course a lot of upperclassmen. The party scene here is exactly what I want from a school ,inclusivity, but everyone definitely shares a work hard, play hard mentality. We know how to party, but we also know how to be the scholarly students we got in here for being. The party scene truly is spectacular. The dining hall food is amazing. Sports teams are great as 1/3 of the student body participates in sports There are pretty much a million ways to get involved on campus. I want to continue rambling about how much I love it here, but I also have an econ quiz tomorrow, but I hope that helps. S'GO STAGTHENAS!"
Niche User,5,"I loved taking the summer course called High School Leadership and Communication. It made me more interested in going to this school, and I love how well-organized the program was. I love their philosophy on leadership. It really encourages others to become leaders in their community. Go CMC!"
Junior,5,CMC is an amazing school that offers you learning experiences and resources that other schools do not. It is incredibly rigorous and you will work very hard but you will be very hirable when you graduate.
Freshman,5,"Social life is incredible, everyone here has a unique story to tell and are not only genuinely interesting but genuinely interested in your background and story. We are a very open community and we love to party. The professors are outstanding and the opportunities are endless, especially with the resources of all the Claremont colleges. Overall the experience is as big or small as you want to make it, but no matter every bit of work is so worth the value of the education and the experience is truly life changing."
College Junior,5,"CMC, while not as well known as Stanford, Harvard or Amherst, carries the same reputation with those who've heard of it. Graduating from this school is nearly a guaranteed job somewhere. The alumni network is relatively active-- but the best resource is the career services department on campus. They work very hard to find students great jobs that are the right fit."
College Freshman,5,There is no Greek Life
College Freshman,5,Too much money was put in to the new facility though.
College Senior,5,"Campus is incredibly safe. Every once in a while a bike gets stolen if you leave it unlocked, though it's usually fine. Sexual assault is as much a problem as at any other college, although students here are very aware of it and active on issues of sexual assault. As a man, I can't speak much more on this, although I know some survivors haven't felt very supported by the administration."
College Senior,5,"Dorms are excellent. Like others have said, North Quad (motel suite style) is more for partiers and bros. South Quad (tower suite style) is fairly quiet and many people don't drink, especially in Stark, the substance-free dorm. I am a huge fan of Mid Quad, which has the most recently renovated dorms and a great residential culture because of the more traditional hall-style dorms. It's somewhere in between NQ and SQ in terms of noise and how much people party.

On campus housing is expensive, but almost no one lives off campus. There are not many options, and you miss out on a lot of the community when you live off campus."
College Freshman,5,"Claremont McKenna has already opened so many doors for pursuing my interests in and out of the classroom. I have met some of the most interesting people in my life during my time here and have experienced a diversity of views and backgrounds. The school does a fantastic job of orienting students to campus life through a stellar orientation program and continues to offer unmatched resources especially in the Career Services Center. While CMC is a phenomenal institution that adequately prepares its students for the professional world, its multitude of activities and clubs create a positive residential campus community, which is conducive to academic success as well as student happiness. Finally, CMC is part of the Claremont Consortium, which offers CMCers access to dining halls, classes, and social events across the 5 colleges and 2 graduate schools. I could not picture myself loving any other school as much as I love CMC."
College Freshman,5,Very engaging professors with very engaging classes. Most are discussion based. Appropriate amount of work. Great class selection and prof selection
College Freshman,5,"Crown hall is by far the nicest dorm on campus. But regardless, all the dorms are very nice, spacious, and clean. We have dorm janitors that come every day and clean the halls. They also clean our rooms every week"
College Freshman,5,"CMC is the best school I could have asked for. The small class sizes are amazing. In large classes, it is hard to stay focused, and there is not a big incentive to attend class. With classes of under 20, you really get to know everybody - including your professors - really well. 

All the parties are inclusive. Nobody is denied from them, really emphasizing the sense of community on campus.

There are 3 different quads to live in. North is where the social action is, mid is pretty typical run-of-the-mill - not too many parties, but pretty social. South quad is a lot quieter, but still very social. I wanted to live in mid, but I was placed in the south. This turned out to be great because I am best friends with the kids on my floor, and I have a quite place to go after the party. In the north quad, the party seems to never end.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied."
College Freshman,5,I love it.  Everyone is so supportive!
College Sophomore,5,"People call it Camp Claremont because it literally is like a camp. You will have the best time of your life here. You get the state school party scene (seriously, we love to party :D) with the prestige and academics of one of the best liberal arts schools in the nation."
College Freshman,5,"Compared to other colleges, the food on campus is absolutely amazing. Each dining hall offers several different types of meals and a salad bar with soup and a sandwich bar. The best part is definitely the ability to eat at any of the 5 campuses, as each campus has its own specialties and the menus are always changing."
College Junior,5,VERY easy going and you can do whatever you want
College Junior,5,Living on campus is the most fun part of the social scene. North Quad's the place to be in you want to go out. South Quad's much calmer
College Junior,5,People tend to go into investment banking and consulting. people are paid very well after graduation if they choose to go in that specific path
College Junior,5,"Solid options, but people don't tend to go off campus that often. Maybe once or twice a month if you have birthday dinners or something. Town is walking discount which is great and Eureka Burger and 21 choices are musts."
College Junior,5,"CMC's party scene is inclusive and wild. The school practically provides alcohol for it's students -- although that's been causing lots of administrative drama as of late. The best aspects of CMC's social scene is that it's safe, welcoming, and all on campus. That being said, if you don't want to go out drinking at night, there's little else to do."
College Junior,5,One of the reasons I chose CMC was because their aid offer was the most generous.  I am very appreciative of the smooth process as well as their need-blind policy.
College Junior,5,"We have some of the country's best professors in the field, many of whom have had incredible extensive experience in their areas of expertise, whether that is government policy or microbiology.  Curriculum depends on the professor, but the school holds them to a very high standard.  The registration process is as good as any taking place at a small liberal arts school would be.  We also have the unique option of taking any major from the surrounding schools and make it our own, which expands our horizons only further."
College Junior,5,"As a consortium, we have 6 dining halls to choose from.  And each offers delicious and usually pretty healthy options.  CMC also offers a late night snack every weeknight."
College Junior,5,It is a wet campus. I feel very safe and still have fun. Everyone is usually outside in north quad or green beach which is where the best parties take place
College Junior,5,No greek life but CMC is like one big frat. We are a big family.
College Junior,5,"We are really spoiled at the 5Cs, the food is generally very good. There are 7 dining halls to chose from. Watch out for the freshman 15!"
College Junior,5,"This is a top Liberal Arts college, so naturally the classes are going to be very rigorous and demanding yet extremely rewarding. Small classes with attentive professors that really care about helping their students. Don't skip class, your professor is most likely going to notice and its going to hurt your grade."
College Junior,5,They are very helpful with switching majors. Many students will remain undecided until the end of their Sophomore year. I thought I was certainly going to major in International Relations but found my passion in Psychology my Sophomore year.
College Junior,5,"It is a very laid-back campus. Alcohol policies are very lenient, just be safe, don't be stupid and CALL AN RA IF YOU OR A FRIEND NEEDS HELP. The RAs are there to help, not to get you in trouble."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a total of seven dining halls across the Claremont Consortium, so there is a very wide variety of food available to students. Not to sound biased, but I do believe that it is also at a higher standard than dining hall food found at other institutions. Menus are different every day, and there are certain days of the week in certain dining halls that have a specific theme or dish that tends to attract students from all 5C's."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is focused on their future and constantly looking for internships and jobs.
College Freshman,5,CMC is in the process of renovating all of their dorms. The already renovated dorms look great!
College Freshman,5,The food in the village is all upscale and very good
College Freshman,5,The weather is mostly in the 50-60's for the daytime most of the year. In the night it get down to the high 30's or low 40's.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is not very strict. Things are getting stricter for underaged drinking however. They are doing their best to make parties worse and worse as years go by.
College Sophomore,5,The tech department gives free printing (even in color). There are student tech assistants in every dorm.
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are, on average, fantastic. Classes are hard."
College Freshman,5,"The academics at CMC are amazing students here, as our unoffical motto says, Work hard, Play hard. The proffesors are brilliant as are the students and everybody puts in the effort. Great study areas and class rooms. registration is frustrating as a freshman, but gets much better as you move up. "
College Freshman,5,"Some of the Best Professors anywhere. I would imagine the workload is more than most schools, but the opportunities, and the class options here are amazing. "
College Freshman,5,"Small village where people can go to dinner, movies, or get Jamba Juice. The other 5 colleges do make a sort of 5 campus bubble that usually has everything you would ever want or need on a given night. "
College Freshman,5,"If you want to party, there is a party tuesday, thursday, friday, saturday. and one can usually find a party on one of the other 5c campuses on wednesday. Most people party on Thursday Friday and Sat though. "
College Freshman,5,"sunny and beautiful almost all the time. gets chilly after the sun sets but not too much so, just enough to wear some of the fall themed clothes you brought to campus. "
College Freshman,5,"Internships are everywhere. CMC will even pay for unpaid internships over the summer, so you can do what you are interested in...not just something that pays. "
Alum,4,"Beautiful campus with a fun social environment and great educational resources (e.g., relationships with professors, classes offered, extracurricular learning opportunities)"
Sophomore,4,"Claremont McKenna is great because of its small size. Students are able to interact with professors on a more personal level and are able to participate in active research on campus. As a freshman, I was able to work three jobs, conduct research with my chemistry professor, and interact with incredibly intelligent students. It is an experience I could not find at any other school."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year. Adjusting to a new school is never easy, but I've enjoyed my experience so far. My professors are supportive and often available, I have access to six dining halls on my campus and the other campuses in the consortium, and when I had dorm problems, Dean of Students office was quick to respond.  I chose this school because of the consortium and because they gave me the most financial aid, although I still struggle financially to pay for college. The hardest part is finding a community I fit in at school. The dominant community is what you'd expect at a predominantly white institution: predominantly white wealthy students, individualistic tendencies, inability to say excuse me, and more. However, there are good people - gems, I call them - and they lighten my day when I interact with them. I hope to meet more of those."
College Sophomore,4,Have not felt unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Facilities are not as clean as they make it seem during orientation. The walls are very thin in mid-quad, you can practically hear everything your neighbor is saying through the wall when you're in your room. RAs are relatively laid back, they won't fine you for alcohol or drug use."
College Junior,4,"The campus is very secure. Every once in a while townies will come on campus and cause problems, but it's very rare. 

The CMC ""bros"", however, can be a bit problematic when drunk (i.e. not super concerned about asking for consent). The campus security is active, but more needs to be done by the students to prevent sexual assault."
College Junior,4,"I've had a solid experience with the vast majority of my professors and with the courses I've taken. Classes here are typically difficult, but professors are mostly helpful. The variety of courses offered here is pretty weak until the upper division; GEs are very rigid and are very boring- and don't offer any foray into anything other than Government, Econ, Philosophy and History (basically the big 4 majors here). The addition of an Arts requirement would perhaps bring the students out of their boxes a bit more."
College Junior,4,"Having played a varsity sport at CMC, I can say that the facilities are some of the best in the country. There is sometimes a disconnect between sports and academics- given that it's a very academic school- which makes doing both difficult at times."
College Junior,4,"The school is great- there are fantastic professors, and smart/engaging students. There are a lot of boring people on campus, though, and the school could use a bit of intellectual diversity (more artists/musicians/creatives)."
College Freshman,4,The Career Services people are very helpful and friendly.
College Freshman,4,There are pretty interesting courses in small class sizes!
College Freshman,4,Only some building are great (probably 1/3)
College Freshman,4,The school has been pretty good. There are so many opportunities to join different clubs and meet many other students from the other four colleges in the Consortium.
College Senior,4,"Academics are very good. Many professors are fantastic, and almost all professors really care about students and will go out of their ways to help you. All classes are taught by professors rather than by TAs. Our Philosophy department is particularly fantastic, and I believe it's the best department at CMC. Our government and economics departments are good, but overrated. There's not a lot of diversity in either department (mostly older conservative white men, many of whom are not great teachers), though they are getting better. That said, many individual professors in those departments and others are fantastic.

About half of students study abroad (or go to programs in Silicon Valley or DC), though it feels like more, and I would recommend doing this.

I would not come here to study science or engineering unless I'm also majoring in the humanities or social sciences, since our joint science department (shared with Scripps and Pitzer) is overcrowded and underfunded. There are no performing or visual arts programs to speak of, although you can take classes at the other schools, especially Pomona and Scripps. In general, being able to take classes at the other schools is a great thing. Many CMCers take introductory computer science at Harvey Mudd, one of the best engineering schools in the country."
College Senior,4,"Some people drink too much freshman and sophomore year, though you generally learn how to handle yourself by the time you're an upperclassman. I see this as a good thing, because my friends at CMC are now a lot more responsible with alcohol than many of my friends from home who go to schools with more restrictive policies. A lot of people smoke weed, though it's not really an issue (some people don't like the smell, I guess). Some people do harder drugs, though I've never actually seen it, so it's avoidable unless you go out of your way to find it."
College Senior,4,"Student career prospects are quite good, although the lack of name recognition can make it harder to get your foot in the door than if you go to, say, Stanford. In some ways I think that can be a good thing, because it forces us to be more intentional about what we want. Consulting, accounting, and investment banking firms recruit heavily on campus, and many people work in those industries after graduating. If you want to, you probably can.

Technology companies are getting more interested, and a lot of people go to San Francisco/Silicon Valley to work in semi-technical or non-technical positions these days. It can be very tough to land good government and political jobs, I think because of the lack of name recognition. Career services is OK. The alumni network is not very large, but incredibly active, and alumni will go out of their way to help you way more than is the norm at other (larger) colleges."
College Senior,4,"Many professors are very good, although some are quite mediocre, especially in the government and economics departments (a lot of old white guys who have been around forever). They're making some progress on hiring younger, more diverse (read: women) faculty, including a few in the government department who are fantastic.

I've taken some great classes. Philosophy is our best department, and I would recommend that anyone who comes to CMC take a philosophy class. Most classes are a combination of lecture and discussion, and classes are fairly small (usually under 20 people, though some have around 30). Course variety is not very good, though the ability to take classes at the other colleges helps in this regard (and I recommend everyone should do it). The government department is very theory/political philosophy-focused. I would not come here if I wanted to major in science or engineering alone, although I might if I wanted to dual major or take a lot of classes in the humanities or social sciences alongside that. I also would not come here looking to major in the visual or performing arts, because you can't really do that."
College Senior,4,"I've had some great classes and experiences at CMC, and a few that weren't so great. Anyone coming to CMC should be aware that the social scene is pretty centered on alcohol and partying (though there is a substance free dorm with a strong culture, and a surprisingly high number of people who don't drink/go out). Thankfully, the parties are on campus, hosted by the student government, and open to everyone. There isn't a whole lot of the sketchiness or exclusivity that usually comes with frat parties at larger schools, since parties are open to everyone. I see this as a huge benefit of the school, though I no longer regularly attend parties.

It's really easy to get involved in things you're interested in, whether that's student government, a club, or research. Research opportunities are probably more available for Econ majors than others, and in the sciences/engineering you won't have the same kind of research experiences you would at a school that has real researchers.

We have some great professors here. Philosophy is by far the best, and there are some excellent professors in probably all of our other departments as well. In my opinion as someone majoring in both, our government and economics departments aren't deserving of the reputations they have. I wouldn't come here looking to study science, engineering, or pre-med, unless I'm also really interested in studying the humanities/social sciences. Classwork is generally reasonable, though challenging. People are motivated, but not super competitive with each other or stressed out, which is great.

Many CMC students are smart, motivated, and interested in their academic subjects. Others are more interested in partying. Many are a mix of both. People are not particularly artsy or creative; if you are, you might feel that side of yourself slipping away over your four years here (though we're getting better and now have a dedicated music space on campus). It can feel small after 4 years, but overall great!"
College Freshman,4,"The RA's are super chill. You can rip a bong in North and no one will do anything about it. Be wary of leaving paraphernalia out all of your dorm, because the building attendants will sometimes report these possessions to the administration while cleaning rooms. If you're not completely reckless, dorm life at CMC is a great time, no matter which quad you live in. I will say, North and Mid are much more social than South, but there is definitely an option for every taste of noise-level, party abundance, and proximity to various other campus buildings."
College Freshman,4,"I always feel safe on campus, whether I'm walking around with friends in the middle of the day or alone from the library at 2 am."
College Freshman,4,"About one-third of students here are varsity athletes. It is fun to be on a team, but since CMC is an academic institution above all, the emphasis is placed on grades rather than sports. We support out teams, but sporting games aren't the largest attraction.

We have Robert's Pavillion soon to be completed, a $50 million athletic center, which will be the nicest D3 athletic center in the country"
College Sophomore,4,Overall it's good. But the campus is not as diverse as you think. There's a big difference between North quad and South quad.
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, the administration here is very lenient, but at the moment they are reevaluating this. Some students are getting upset about new rules, but if you think about it, this school is unbelievably chill with things most other schools would not be. We're quite lucky. But there are a number of administration issues, that's almost inevitable."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great. Most people live on campus for all 4 years because of the quality. The RA's are there to help you, not get you in trouble, which I think is the best use of an RA. There are dorm competitions and dorm parties and the best part is that they're all pretty close to each other, no more than a 10 minute walk. And they're pretty close to the dining hall, which is very important."
College Freshman,4,"There are plenty of great restaurants in the village that are perfect for a night out or for when parents are visiting. They are all within walking distance and prices vary from affordable to high-end. They vary from burger joints to thai food to sushi. No fast-food places are within walking distance, but McDonald's and In-N-Out are a 5 minute drive at most. Best place to check out is definitely Eureka Burger and Bardot."
College Freshman,4,"Not many people on campus have cars, but the campus is pretty small so anywhere you park is at max only 5 mins from wherever you want to go"
College Freshman,4,"So far I haven't had any interaction with tech services, but Wifi is accessible everywhere on campus and there are plenty of computer labs available at all times. Best part is free printing (with automatic stapling!) with no quotas."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus, which most of the people do, is absolutely amazing. Mid-Quad residences were just renovated (with a brand new kitchen!) and are absolutely fabulous. North Quad, though old, is the most fun even if it is a more hostel-like type of dorm."
College Freshman,4,"Living in Green gives us pretty much immunity to anything that happens because it's known for the partying. North Quad dorms are mostly the party dorms, Mid-quad is quieter and South Quad is a loner town (but it's getting a little louder down there too)."
College Freshman,4,They listen to you and really try to make it an easy and smooth transition.
College Junior,4,"Everyone at CMC is in shape and active, but the athletics are not the most important aspect of the college at all"
College Junior,4,I haven't heard any complaints
College Freshman,4,"People party and it is noisy

Other than that, quite good

I love my RA"
College Junior,4,"IF I WAS A PARTY PERSON, I would say that there are always options to go out, especially on the weekends.  For those of us who choose to take part in other activities, it can be discouraging because all our resources go towards parties."
College Junior,4,"We have a small town down the road.  It's not the typical college town, but it's an inviting extension to our own supply of cafes and study spots."
College Junior,4,"Each department has an amazing group of faculty supporting it.  For the Literature department, there are alot of classes to choose from, usually out of British or American authors.  There is alot of reading and writing, although this prepares students to be excellent analyzers and critical thinkers.  We have a career services office that hooks us up with almost any internship or career path we are interested in.  The support of faculty, in whatever major you have, is overwhelming and I'm very thankful for it."
College Junior,4,"CMC is known as the ""bro's"" school.  With that in mind, it is usually a male-heavy environment.  Nonetheless, there are some brilliant and ambitious women that have done amazing things while still in school.  Both guys and girls, even if they're not from California, usually adopt the Cali surfer look with t-shirts and sandals.  All the students here are very driven and have high ideals for their own personal development as well as where they see themselves in the world.  It's a school full of passionate, well-rounded, and multi-faceted people."
College Junior,4,"I just recently declared myself a Literature major, which at my school is a bit like a guild of unicorns, in that there are not many of us.  The Lit department, however, is the best and I couldn't ask for a better advisor or supporting faculty."
College Junior,4,"I think that with each year and each new class they admit, the office of admissions have certain types of students they want to bring into their school.  My academic and cultural background and the key contributions I could bring to this school happened to be just that."
College Junior,4,I love going to eat in the village. I go to dinner with my parents in the village after every home softball game. Great atmospher and small town feel
College Junior,4,"You learn that diversity is more than just where you are from or where your parents are from. People here have diverse ideas and mentalities, I have met some of the most interesting people at CMC. People come from many different backgrounds and walks of life."
College Junior,4,CMS is pretty cool. School spirit is great and the basketball matches are fun to attend.
College Sophomore,4,"CMC has an endowment of more than 600,000,000 dollars for 1200 students. If you need financial aid, you are gonna get it unless you are an international student, in which case only a few will get merit scholarships so you have to be ready to shell out 60,000 dollars a year out of pocket."
College Sophomore,4,The food at CMC is great. Lobster and steak for Christmas and custom Asian wok a few nights per week.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, CMC has nice facilities, as would be expected from a school that costs 60k a year to attend."
College Sophomore,4,"As a division 3 school, in which 40 percent of students participate in varsity sports, CMC is a great place for jocks. Unfortunately, CMC's team is shared with Mudd and Scripps, which I think in some ways detracts from school spirit. It's easy to get involved in intramural sports or dorm competitions. The new gymnasium that is still under construction is going to be beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,"The closest and most convenient off-campus dining options are found in the Claremont Village, which hosts numerous restaurants and to-go places of multiple cuisines (Chinese, Italian, American, Thai, Mexican, etc.). Most are decently priced, and the restaurants that are of a higher price are of a higher quality as well. There are a lot of restaurants that offer student discounts as well, since Claremont is essentially a college town."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at this school is incredibly friendly and approachable. It's very easy to meet someone new and develop a lasting relationship from there. The small campus size helps in facilitating these friendships as well, since you see the same people each day!"
College Sophomore,4,"There are campus security officers around campus for the majority of the day. On the most part, I feel very safe on my campus, even if I'm walking back to my room at three in the morning. I probably wouldn't feel the same way if I had ended up going to a larger university with different resources and safety measures in place."
College Sophomore,4,good financial aid. trust me you'll need it
College Freshman,4,Many people at CMC are involved in sports
College Freshman,4,It's great if you're into those things
College Freshman,4,Very lenient on drinking and on dorm visiting.
College Sophomore,4,"CMC is a great school with good food, good academics, good students, and a pretty lenient alcohol and weed policy. The small school atmosphere is boring however."
College Sophomore,4,"A liberal arts college but definitely focused on economics and finance. Those classes are great, philosophy department is great."
College Sophomore,4,Parking spots are right next to dorms and classrooms
College Sophomore,4,"The Robert Day School of Economics and Finance has a great scholarship and mentorship program that prepares admitted students for job interviews, networking, leadership, and work. They also give out $15k in scholarship money for students in their senior year"
College Freshman,4,Many students at Claremont McKenna feel that the administration is becoming too strict and not allowing students to make their own adult decisions regarding alcohol and parties. Our administration has begun reaching out to students more and taking steps to hear students' opinions on the best solutions to keep everyone both safe and happy at CMC.
College Freshman,4,"There is a vibrant social scene at the Claremont Colleges; if there isn't a party going on at one of the 5Cs (and there usually is), the Claremont Village is a good place to go and spend a low-key night with friends.  It's only about a 10 minute walk from campus and there are plenty of cute boutiques and stores, restaurants, a movie theater, and places to satisfy your sweet tooth... I highly recommend 21 Choices frozen yogurt! Many of these places even offer discounts for college students. It isn't the exciting hustle and bustle of a big city, but the village does provide a break from being on campus every once in a while, and it has a nice community and family-oriented atmosphere. "
College Freshman,4,"We are an extremely athletic campus, and so many people play sports or do clubs. Tennis and Gold team have been #1 nationally for d3 and are consistently a national contender. Games arent always that well attended, except for when CMS plays Pomona-Pitzer. Then its a frenzy in the stands. "
Senior,2,"Most classes are uninspiring, and good profs are hard to get. Unless you major in Econ and CS, job opportunities are virtually nonexistent. You need family connections, or else people think you go to community college. ""Research"" here is a joke. Dorms suck unless you love the smell of weed and the sight of people throwing up. Despite low acceptance rate (misleading because E/D rate is 30%), a lot of people here are dumb and overconfident. Avoid if you seek intellectual stimulation. Come if you love the sound of your own voice."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a lot of emphasis on athletic success at CMC. There are varsity sports, but players don't receive a lot of benefits for being a student athlete, unlike D1 schools. There is a new gym facility that was recently opened, it's huge and amazing."
College Freshman,2,The campus does not provide shuttle services to anywhere in LA or to the airport or anywhere you want to go. If you do want to venture off campus (with school-provided transportation) you have to sign up for special events that fill up quickly. Not many options are offered.
College Freshman,2,"Not many students live off campus

You need permission to live off campus"
College Freshman,2,Not many places to go if you don't have a car
College Sophomore,2,"The college has a no BS policy in terms of academic integrity, but outside of coursework plenty of shenanigans go on. I would say a high percentage of the freshman class drinks underage, even during dry week. Loads of people smoke weed regularly in their dorms and I know a few who even mess around with acid and cocaine. Campus security doesn't do much about this unless they are very stupid and try lighting up at a fenced party or outside, or seriously overdose. The majority of drug use occurs in the dorms, and R.A.'s don't even really seem to care just as long as no one o.d.'s. If you don't drink, you will be in the minority. The majority of these people live in the little enclave of Stark. Most students act like it's the end of the world whenever there is any initiative to tighten up on alcohol consumption rules, as they feel like this would absolutely destroy the culture of the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, with loads of alcohol consumption, the line between consent and rape is often blurred significantly and sexual assault happens."
College Sophomore,2,The guys at CMC are typical frat bros and the girls are often typical sorority girls. They are smart and generally very into their appearance. The dating scene at CMC is nonexistent in comparison to the hookup culture. Lots of students are the type that want to get rich quick and will probably either start companies or get jobs on Wall-Street.
College Sophomore,2,"My dorm was loud into the late hours of the night, often had neighbor's pot fumes coming in through the A/C system, and my stoned neighbor stumbling into my room late at night. The lounge was often trashed from parties, and sticky from beer bong. There was minimal sound barriers between rooms, the hallways, and floors."
College Freshman,2,"There is no diversity for people of color. I am a Hispanic from Los Angeles and there is currently no other. Also, there is no gay culture at CMC. Being gay myself, I usually resort to places such as Pomona and Pitzer. There needs to be more gay people"
College Sophomore,2,Almost no one lives off of campus. Everything goes on right on campus and thus no one wants to be far from that. It's also quite expensive off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Some dorms are beautiful, most are horrible, tiny, and old."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone loves basketball. No one goes to any other sporting events. Our football team is horrible. Most other sports are really really good.
College Sophomore,2,"The school has a very liberal alcohol policy. They have been steadily changing that however. With the new policy changes, parties are getting very stale, boring, lame, whatever you might call them but anything but fun."
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife is solely on campus and there really isn't much of a selection of parties. There is Thursday Night Club, occasional saturday parties and Tuesday Night beer pong but it gets really old after first semester freshman year. It's very repetitive and it's the same people 2-3x a week on campus."
College Senior,2,"A Lot of Pretentiousness on the School's Part – They try and punish kids when they get too drunk and get alcohol poisoning (which is legal if you are of age, just stupid) but they ignore kids that do drugs because it looks bad on them if they recognize there is a drug problem, which there is. Lots of weed, some cocaine underground, and ecstacy is gaining ground at Scripps College. If you wish to avoid it, there is no pressure whatsover. Walk away."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lots and Lots of Drinking. Drugs Aren't So Visible – The administration has the most liberal policies toward drinking that I've ever seen, which is both good and bad. You can have party without anyone breathing down your neck, but on the other hand, binge drinking and alcoholism are increasing problems that aren't being adequately addressed."
College Senior,2,"Not Very Diverse – CMC has slowly become more diverse but it is still dominantly white. Politically, it is largely conservative (or maybe their just more vocal) and there is still a large population of closeted gay people on campus. That may not be because they are afraid of their peers' judgement but because they come from conservative families."
College Senior,2,Too Many Cars – Everyone on campus seems to have a car creating a lack of parking space. The new construction has also severely limited our parking. New regulations do not allow freshmen to have cars in order to create more room.
College Freshman,2,You Need A Car – Good luck getting anywhere without a car.
Sophomore,1,"One of the biggest regrets of my life has been attending Claremont McKenna College. If you want to go to an insular, close-minded place where affluent WASPs are drunk 24/7, this is the place for you. I've certainly enjoyed moments of it, and had a few really good professors. As an African-American male, I have experienced multiple racist incidents, and have often felt like I don't belong here. If you're an upper-class white athlete from SoCal, I say go for it. But for everyone else, if you want to be academically challenged in a real liberal arts college (which isn't entirely focused on economics), to see a return on your financial investment, and to have actual name-recognition outside of southern California, I recommend going somewhere else."
Niche User,1,"If the only thing you care about in life is getting rich and becoming powerful, then CMC will be a great place for you and will help you achieve that (and will call it ""leadership"" to boot). If, on the other hand, you care about making the world a better place or about finding meaning in life beyond money, you should most definitely stay away."
College Sophomore,1,"You can pretty much do whatever you want. Drink on campus, smoke weed in your dorm room."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus security won't let you bring drinks into school registered parties like Thursday Night Club and there are always fences around the area. Other than that, you can pretty much find alcohol anywhere on campus except Stark and there is an open cup policy where if you have a red solo cup the college will assume it's water. So basically, CMC does not have much of a policy about alcohol on campus, although they're trying to enforce stricter policies about this."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dominated by preppy ""bros"" who like to walk around shirtless and otherwise dress in head-to-toe Abercrombie. If that's your thing and you don't mind that most of them are really full of themselves and have disgusting attitudes toward women, then more (or less) power to you. Otherwise, get used to looking to the other 3Cs or off campus for your dating pool."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A Frat House Atmosphere Without Actual Frats – North Quad is one continuous kegger party that gets more and more out of hand every year. It has just about swallowed Mid Quad too, and even South Quad is overrun by it sometimes. The binge drinking, party scene totally dominates campus social life and anyone who's not into that will end up living on the fringes and hanging out off campus a lot. To be fair, the students work really hard (when they're not drunk)."

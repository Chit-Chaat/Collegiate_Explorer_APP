Niche User,5,"The counselors have been very open and available to any questions I have had in the past, and the school itself is just gorgeous and has an amazing community."
Sophomore,5,"This school is in a small town and is full of helpful hands whether that be other students, businesses, or even the community. I came to this school from Alabama and had no one there. The friends that I made there soon became my family. I love this town even if there isn't much to do here. The people in this town help us out in every way they possibly can whether it is by supporting sports teams or any other college-related event or buying merchandise from teams to help support their long travels across the country. I was not for sure what to expect once I got to school here, but in my own personal opinion, I don't think there was a better college for me to go to."
Sophomore,5,The professors and other staff members at the University of Jamestown have always been very helpful. The campus has a great atmosphere and feels very welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at UJ and its been the best year of my life. I love the campus, the small feel, and all the friends I've made."
Sophomore,5,"University of Jamestown is worth every penny you will pay. Yes, it seems expensive, but this school is worth the investment of your future. This campus is the perfect size. The fact that this campus is so small allows you to personally get to know other students and to form life-long relationships with friends and professors. People know your name. You are not an ID number, you are a person that matters. One night as I was eating in the cafeteria with my friends, one of my professors sat down and ate supper with my friends and me. Not only does the size of this campus allow you to form life-long relationships, it also offers many different opportunities for you to become involved in activities and organizations . Whether you are into sports, music, art, or gaming, there is truly something for everyone. From the moment you visit the University of Jamestown for the first time, you will realize that there is truly something special about this place."
College Junior,5,I love being a student at the University of Jamestown! The journey is amazing!
College Junior,5,Jamestown offers many sports and scholarships. The community as a whole supports the University sports.
College Senior,5,"University of Jamestown is a unique college with absolutely amazing and smart staff that will teach you and give you all you need for your journey to success! My major was computer science and I have only positive feedback to leave in here. Professors are helpful and smart, athletics are wonderful. I played soccer in here and we had almost all international students in my soccer team, from all around the world including Russia, Germany, England, Australia, D.R. Congo, Mexico, Brazil and etc... Housing is the best with big variety of choices."
College Senior,5,THERE IS MORE SPACE IT IS GREAT THOUGH
College Senior,5,IT IS THE BEST EVER IN STUDIES
College Freshman,5,My class size is very small so we get lots of individualized attention. 
College Junior,5,"Most people carpool, so having a car is not necessary. You can usually find a ride to wherever you need. Having a car is really useful though in case you can't find a ride, since we have a very limited bus system. "
College Junior,5,"Our program is quite rigorous, but it is an excellent program. We only have one person on the faculty for this particular major, so the student to teacher relationship is superb, which makes up for the difficulties of the program. You will leave fully prepared for your next step in life.  "
College Junior,5,"We actually have a really diverse campus. We have students from around the country and the world. The majority tend to be Christians from North Dakota, but not all. We also have many LGBT students on campus. Everyone is very accepting of everyone's differences. "
College Junior,5,"We don't have visitation hours. Girl and guys can be in each others dorms 24/7 as long as you don't ""stay the night."" Drinking if found on campus is a small fine and a class, even if you are underage. Drugs will get you kicked off campus at the very least or expelled. "
College Junior,5,There are several computers in every building. You will always have access to wifi or a computer if you need one.
College Junior,5,"You can be in as little or as much as you want. We're a pretty involved campus, however. The education is top-notch and the professors genuinely care about you, whether you are in their department or not. Our student activities department rocks. There's always an event going on. If there isn't an SAC event going on, then there is usually some kind of sporting event you can go to. "
College Sophomore,5,"Small town, involved community. Worlds largest buffalo."
College Junior,5,Jamestown College does its best on letting the student body be aware of any dangers that may come up over e-mail. The campus security does a fine job at making sure buildings are locked up at certain times at the end of the day. The fact that students that reside in the dorms are the only ones that can get in with their keys help insure that not anyone can just walk into the dorms whenever they feel like it. Walking on campus at night I feel safe because the buildings are never more than a five minute walk.
College Junior,5,"Very Safe – The campus is extremely safe and the town is almost the same. I, as a small woman, have no qualms about walking across campus at midnight. The college has its own campus security that patrols every night and they even will walk students to and from their destination if a student desires it. All they have to do is call a number that is posted inside almost every door and a security guard will be there in usually under 10 minutes."
Sophomore,4,"University of Jamestown is a great fit for me! Its small campus makes me feel like a part of the community, and I love that people know my name. The nursing program is a well-oiled machine that definitely prepares me well for the real world."
Junior,4,I love this Campus and the only thing that I would change is the outdoor maintenance staff during the winter. I love this beautiful campus and how it is slowly expanding.
Alum,4,"I thoroughly loved going to school at UJ. The small campus and close-knit community made for the best college experience. The relationships you make will last forever because when you’re around people who want to be successful empowers you to want to be successful too. I am still very close with those I met from UJ and know it’s a relationship for life. UJ was a big chapter in the career I have now and that I will forever be grateful for. Your professors strongly encourage you to better yourself in all aspects of your life: mentally, physically, and spiritually. You’re cared for and supported by everyone which allows you to take risks and grow. That’s part of the Jamestown and Midwest culture which I absolutely love and miss. Luckily, I was adopted by 3 families because I couldn’t go home for the holidays. They took me in whenever I needed a home. UJ will forever hold a special place in my heart! Go Jimmies!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors really care about your experience and education while you are here. Because of the smaller size, you get to know more people and even if you do not know them well, you will at least recognize them enough to say hello."
College Freshman,4,A majority of the students at the University of Jamestown are involved in athletics. The teams don't always win but they have a lot of support from fellow students.
College Freshman,4,The University of Jamestown is an amazing university for everyone. It is a small campus with friendly students and faculty.
College Freshman,4,Pretty good experiences with classes and professors with a  good class size.
College Freshman,4,The dorms I live in have a great amount of space and I am unaware of the other dorm's situations. My main problem with the dorms are that we can hear almost everything our neighbors are saying and doing.
College Freshman,4,"Certain sports draw a large number of students and others don't as much, but there are always people at the games. Many people participate in intramural sports on campus."
College Freshman,4,You are able to get to know a lot of people on campus because it is fairly small. The people and professors are nice and very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"I have received a few scholarships, an academic and an athletic one. They have helped tremendously."
College Freshman,4,I found it very welcoming. The staff was excellent and my hall mates were easy to get to know. I didn't have any issues with any of my hall mates or my RA. The entire residence hall was very close and it was wonderful to meet all the new people.
College Freshman,4,The community is very proud of the school and is welcoming of University students.
College Freshman,4,Sports are a good way to have students be involved with things.
College Freshman,4,It's nice. Just really small.
College Freshman,4,I only had one problem with my scholarships and it had nothing to with the University
College Freshman,4,"Apply for it! And keep in touch with your admissions counselor, asking what scholarships you are eligible for."
College Freshman,4,The people here are great and the living space is perfectly adequate. 
College Junior,4,The town of Jamestown itself has a lot of different options if you want to move off campus. Most of the apartments are close to campus. Actual houses are further away. 
College Junior,4,"We don't have a health center because there is a walk in clinic less than a block from campus. Our security is very minimal,but can be called if needed. The police department is here quickly if there is a more pressing emergency. "
College Junior,4,"Some of the buildings are pretty old and historic. The freshman halls are not that great at all, but the upperclassmen dorms are fantastic and relatively new."
College Junior,4,"Since it is North Dakota, we have a lot of bars in town. You can walk to any of them if you really want to or get a DD if you really need it. "
College Junior,4,Athletics is a major part of campus. Quite a few of our students come to UJ for athletics. 
College Junior,4,"The people are great and extremely friendly. There's a group for everyone whether you like theatre or partying, or both. You tend to know almost everyone since it is a small campus, but it's big enough that you don't have to hang out with them. "
College Sophomore,4,Although I have a computer of my own it would not be necessary to have one. There are many computers available to work to be completed in both the buildings around campus and dorm rooms.
College Sophomore,4,When on campus I never feel unsafe even when it is early in the morning or late at night. I do keep my dorm room door locked whenever I leave but for the most part would probably feel safe if it was accidently left open. Due to the fact that the campus is relatively small everyone is fairly trust worthy.
College Sophomore,4,I've never seen so many cops in a small town before. The college is also a dry campus.
College Freshman,4,"There is pretty much parking wherever you need it. You do not need a parking permit, and there are no fines/tickets except when you are in a handicap spot. A need for a car isn't necessary since you will know a lot of people on campus with a car that will head to the same places as you, such as Applebee's or Walmart."
College Freshman,4,All the dorms are very close to the classrooms. The weather is generally very nice. When it does bad students are excused if they cannot get to class safely.
College Freshman,4,Sports at Jamestowns are very big. We always have sporting events at out school.
College Freshman,4,"The process of getting into the Exercise Science program was fairly easy. After a simple and straight forward application process accompanied by a few letters of recommendation I was admitted into the program. However, all programs at Jamestown College are slightly more prestigious than many other schools."
College Freshman,4,Jamestown College is a very safe campus. We have campus security and the police are called when a problems arises. I have never felt unsafe on this campus.
College Freshman,4,there are computers everywhere. new and good computers. I don't have any problems
College Freshman,4,Jamestown college's nursing program is rated one of the best in the area.
College Freshman,4,I was awarded both academic and athletic scholarships. I felt Jamestown college was very generous. I did not apply for financial aid.
College Junior,4,Sometimes students that don't live on campus park in the dorm parking lots and it can be annoying from time to time.
College Freshman,4,"Since Jamestown is a private school they offer nice acedemic scholarships and athletic scholarships. With those scholarships, dependingon how much you get, it will be like paying state school tuition. The financial aid office is also a big help getting your money in order."
College Sophomore,4,Dorms Are Perfect Location – Jamestown College has an intimate campus. You are within walking distance of all the buildings. There is a variety of old and newer dorms. There is something for everyone.
College Junior,4,"Generals Offered. Jamestown College has enough variety in its general courses offered, that I don't feel stuck as a freshman. I can choose which history class I want to take, and there are plenty of literature classes ranging from Shakespeare to American Short Stories. I have a lot of fun reading the summaries of the courses and choosing what I specifically want to learn about. Same with physical education credits, I could learn the technique behind weight lifting, golf, or ballroom dancing."
College Junior,4,"I'm in a Good Position – My major is Biology and Secondary Education. Jamestown is known for having a great science department and my education teachers love that I'm going to be a high school science teacher since there is a demand for that job. There aren't many students in my specific major though, which is sometimes tough feeling alone. The science classes are hard, but it's a nice balance with education classes that are slower paced."
Sophomore,2,"When you walk into the University of Jamestown, it's like a wonderful fairy tale. Green grass, pretty trees, and beautiful buildings older then your grandparents but then the bills come in. Noe collage is expensive yes and for 10,000 for tuition Jamestown isn't horrid. However, the school is constantly complaining about a budget but still buy new arenas, new unregulated turf fields, and force students to stay on campus longer in fear for their scholarships to try and pay for it.  The clubs are getting budget cuts and still the school decide to spend millions of dollars to try and be a big named school. It's horrible, I stay only for my boyfriend and my professors, oh and a little thing where Jamestown doesn't take any other schools credits barely and so no school takes theirs. When you jump into this school you are stuck because if you move you could easily be a semester or two behind at any other institution. Don't get stuck in Jamestown."
College Freshman,2,"The campus doesn't really provide any transportation, but everyone is allowed to have a car. If you don't have a car, it's easy to find someone who does."
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion the school policy is very strict, but for an obvious and good reason: for the success of the students.  They are very strict about drinking in particular and the harsh consequences are enough to deter anyone who may be tempted."
College Junior,2,"There are taxis in Jamestown, but no buses. There isn't a lot that Jamestown College offers for public transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus housing are nice, really like the set up however it is a ways away from the college itself. So you would defiantly want to rent a bike from the school or purchase your own."
Senior,1,"The college needs better professors. Most of the programs doesn't have accreditation. If you decide to leave midway between the program, no other universities will transfer your grades. I would recommend to stay away."
Junior,1,"School widely and proudly supports student-athletes over the arts or even education. Most athletes here are only here for sports and this reflects in the apathetic and disengaged attitude of the student body. Most professors are not good teachers and the administration makes choices for the school which do not meet the needs of the actual students. The dorms are not updated and you must live on campus for three years or they will take away half of your scholarship. Unfortunately, the bad overshadows the good at this school."
College Freshman,1,I don't really no what this is since its not part of our campus.
College Junior,1,"Our dining service is absolutely awful, but there are not many other options other than off campus dining. The java hut is pretty good though and provides what you need. "
College Freshman,1,Extremely cold. Number one reason for wanted to transfer to Southern California. Snow is cleared and classes are easy to get to.
College Freshman,1,college is small no transportation needed between dorms & classrooms or football fields.  there is no transportation within the city.  If you do not have a car would need to rely on friends for transportation
College Sophomore,1,"Having a Car Is Best – I don't really hear much about public transportation. Campus is enclosed and easy to walk around, but if you want to go to a restaurant or to a department store, having a car or knowing someone with a car is extremely useful! The closest train station is Fargo, which is an hour and a half away. It's a pain."
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Nonexistent – At Jamestown College, Greek life is nonexistent. There aren't any sororities or frats that girls and guys have to worry about getting inducted into. There are parties, but I can't say that someone attending Jamestown College will ever step foot into a frat house."

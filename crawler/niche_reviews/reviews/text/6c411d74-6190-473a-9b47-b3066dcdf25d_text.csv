Freshman,5,It was ver my helpful to me an I loved it. Thank to everyone it was wonderful I love the school the teacher an Counsling an helpful things online was amazing an at your own pace.
Freshman,5,It was a 10 above average  on my scale an I think it’s a great school an any one should because the teachers are great an it’s just so amazing I love everything about it.
Sophomore,5,AIC is a very good school. The majority of the students are athletes and we all go along very well. The counselors are very helpful and professors are very good.
Freshman,5,The school is great. The online classroom works great.  I have never had technical issues.  It seems to run without issues.
Sophomore,5,"This is my first semester as a transfer student in the RN-BSN program. I am a commuter and a sophomore.The Health Science building is brand new with comfy chairs and desks . I love that there is a Starbucks on Campus and my professors are very involved in my academic journey of becoming a Registered Nurse. There is a Student Nurse Association on campus which is great to meet new people, community service, and an extracurricular activity available for Nursing students to get involved."
Graduate Student,5,Great experience. You really have to make your time at AIC worth living for and to get  a great education.
Freshman,5,"First and foremost, I'm a first time online student. Since being here at American Intercontinental University, I've experienced nothing but the best from staff. The entire faculty is willing to help you in any area you may need it. You learn based off your personal way of learning. So pretty much it is up to you how you learn the information. They also allow us to go back in and revise our grades. Not only to get some extra practice, but also to improve our grade. Everyone that I've met so far is friendly and very timely. I truly enjoy being a student here at American Intercontinental University. And I would truly recommend it to those whom are unsure where to attend college. This is a wonderful place to be."
Sophomore,5,They are friendly  and very helpful. The staff works with you through out your college life. They do not treat you like a number. They want to make sure that you are you understand all you course work.
Sophomore,5,"A BSN is one of the hardest bachelor degrees to achieve. I  can definitely agreed to that, but it is also the most rewarding. I transferred from HCC with an Associates in Liberal Arts to get prerequisites out of the way, currently I am a sophomore at AIC in their Nursing Program, and it is tough! Trust me, it is all to prepare you for the NCLEX exam, if it didn't push it's students to be their best, there is no way their NCLEX passing rate would be so high. It is a great program and I am lucky to be in it."
Sophomore,5,"American International College is a very good university in which teachers are excellent and help you understand everything, the best thing about AIC is the connection you can have with teachers if you have questions or need help in the class."
Senior,5,"I started my collage search in 2015, and had no idea that was going to actually choose a school, and I definitely did not imagine my self signing up to school, in speaking with one of AIU's recruiters, I got the courage to finally sign up, with four young kids, pretty much though it would be imposible ,but with the help of my advisers, dedication I'm now about to graduate , and it"
Freshman,5,"I love AIC. This school loves to connect with it's students. They are always hosting events and things to do for their students, staff, and families. Most of the professors are great. They help you when you ask but they also do not baby their students. Obviously college is way different from high school and you have to be more mature and that is how the professors treat you. This college will be a breeze as long as you get your work done and in on time because these professors fo not play when it comes to deadlines."
Sophomore,5,I love going to AIU it is a great school to study for any major it has a lot of options and allows you to go to school on campus and online.
Sophomore,5,i love the diversity! the classes are not over barring for the students such as myself that do not like the pressure of learning in big crowds and feeling less intelligent than others. i love that when your on campus you feel at home because everyone around you is super nice and open and full of information. plus the food is great! they have so many student activities to join and events to participate in.
Freshman,5,I really love the way intellipathis set up! I like all the professional staff! All the instructors are amazing! It's been an amazing experience!
Graduate Student,5,"I think this place is great! The staff is great, they are very friendly and helpful, dinning common is well equipped, everything is very clean and spacious, there is so much going around here. I really like it :)"
Junior,5,My time at AIC so far has been unforgettable in all the best ways. The professors are amazing and are always there to help when needed. The classes are very well taught and organized in a way that everyone can be accommodated for. I am very honored to be apart of the college.
Niche User,5,"Smaller classrooms and great one on one communication. My experience from other Colleges, is that the classrooms are so big and overwhelming. AIC has a friendly atmosphere and that is why I have choosen this College as my number one."
Niche User,5,i like the atmosphere and the admissions staff is very friendly and make the process very easy. they just take a while to receive and process stuff.
Sophomore,5,"The Nursing program has phenomenal, educated, knowledgeable professors. It is preparing me to become a well versed and safe nurse. I cannot wait to graduate."
Sophomore,5,The school has great courses and professors. Wonderful programs and many tools offered to you to help you succeed such as tutoring & writing center.
Alum,5,The professors are very helpful in preparing their students with the knowledge and skills to be succesful professionally an socially. The psychology department involves a working team of professionals who collaborate to enhance indepenence and confidence.
Freshman,5,"I Love The Fact That AIU Truly Cares For Their Students. They Know That Most Students Have Full Time Jobs, Children & Personal Lives. They Make It Manageable For Students To Achieve Academic Success While Having To Tend To Their Personal Lives. The Instructors Truly Help You With What You Don't Understand & Give You Easier Ways To Understand & Complete Assignments."
Alum,5,Very friendly admissions will walk you through the whole process and they have app to use as well as software if you do not have it for free. Easy to get help if needed
Junior,5,"Everyone is friendly and it is a well educated environment. Professors are very intellectual, and helpful. Advisors are always there with you to help. So many opportunities to do fun things."
College Sophomore,5,no drugs or peer pressure
College Freshman,5,I love my professors. They are hard working and really know their material. The tests are hard and fair. I feel that I am getting an excellent education.
College Freshman,5,I like the varied and challenging courses. I work very hard and receive high grades. I boast about the up to date real life mannequins that are available for training. I can go online and get my grades within 24 hours of taking the exams.
College Freshman,5,Classrooms are well kept and do their job. The professors focus on our success and care a lot about our education.
College Senior,5,"The student career center has been there for me side by side even after hour, lunch breaks, and first thing in the mornings. Love the support this school provides for successful outcomes."
College Senior,5,Alcohol is the cause for the majority of most rapes on all campuses around the world. So to answer that question specifically to AIC would have been directing.
College Senior,5,They we've your application fee!
College Senior,5,"The review created for American International College was very racist and inaccurate to say the least. Nevertheless I have to say that with ""a school that sit in the middle of a predominantly African American neighborhood"", ""well we po folk sho do appreciate how you jus mozied on down her and insulted us jus so""... I would have whom ever had the responsibility of writing this review has created a grossly false depiction of a wonderful, small, private, modern, classic college neselled in the comforts of an historic community that's not only protective but welcoming. With wonderful professors, wonderful dining commons, beautiful fire place study cove in the winter and a beach blast in the spring. A president who plays catch daily with every student and faculty member that walks by whether they want to or not just to put a smile on someone's face. Smiling Springfield City police officers employed in campus for everyone's saftey daily 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Constant physical activities and destressor quad celebrations just to help students prepare or debrief. 

American International College as many other colleges has its imperfections, however to put a school doe because of the area in which it's in and to judge the area and the people in that area by the color of their skin is quite out dated and as my statistics show, have no effect on our Interpersonal Race Relations and How They Effect the Community.

Sincerely,

Disappointed"
College Senior,5,"Considering that the school is located in the middle of an predominately African American neighborhood, those of that ethnicity are accepted whole heartedly. When something happens to someone in the school or within other schools in the area or the country, then we all make a statement as one."
College Senior,5,"In my city American International College is very well known and a prestigious college. So if graduate from it, this school will get you very far in life. Or so I've heard. Still, I am confident that I will find a job in my major after I graduate."
College Student,5,Our financial aid office is beyond helpful and everyone gets some sort of scholarship from us.
College Freshman,5,i work in the financial aid office. The counselors are very nice
College Sophomore,5,"I'm not part of any greeks, but i hear a lot about them and they sound fun. I would love to join one, one day."
College Senior,5,They were able to grant me financial aid without issue.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a marketing major, the teachers are great and the class size are small"
College Sophomore,5,The majors offered are great
College Student,5,Because it is an international school the diversity is incredible.
College Student,5,There are several personnel willing to help.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone at AIC is very excepting and there is a lots of diversity
College Junior,5,It's amazing! I feel so important and being in the program allows me to do exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life.
College Student,5,"Out of all the schools I applied to, I received the best financial aid here and they really worked to get me what I needed. "
College Junior,5,The workload can be stressful at times and I need to be extremely self motivated to be successful as it is all online.  The classes have been great even had some that i thought I would hate but really enjoyed
College Junior,5,The whole process of enrolling was a little painful but not anymore than any other school.  They also provide tutoring if needed at no additional cost.
College Junior,5,My university has been outstanding for me.  I can go at my own pace and the instructors are knowledgeable and pleasant to learn from.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone to attend here.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with the major I chose due to I am ready to move on from the job tat I have.
College Sophomore,5,I am a marketing student i have not had an internship yet but my teachers are very helpful and  do everything in their power to help students succeed. Whether if you need a job or trying to figure out what you want to do once you earn your degree.
College Sophomore,5,The weather is pretty normal. We have all four seasons that's about it.
Recent Alumnus,5,My major of choice is Communications. The program at A.I.C. is very tight nit. It is extremely accessible to interact with professors and other students who share similar interests to yourself.
College Senior,5,"My process of getting into my program was easy. I applied on line and in a short period of time an Advisor called. He asked a few question, set me up to take a questionaire, and help my hand up until my first class session. Quincy Giles was the best he made follow up calls and emails to make sure I doing ok and if I needed to change classes he would expalin how that would work also. So my over all admission was great!"
College Freshman,5,i just talked with the advisor and he got me into the program it was all very easy and convenient since i work full time as well.
College Freshman,5,who i have dealt with so far has been amazing and incredibly knowledgeable.
College Freshman,5,you don't really see any interaction with anyone for drugs.
College Freshman,5,even though we have four season the college makes sure our student is safe before anything.
College Freshman,5,"plenty of things to do on campus,  they just renovated a lounge area in the Schwartz Campus center, they have leather sofas, and a fire place, in the warm months their are huge windows that open up to the patio area, we have a cool game room and plenty to do!"
College Senior,5,The weather is the weather. Usually there are no worries it rains sometimes.
Alum,4,I loved the fact that it was a small school with intimate classroom sizes. I think the campus could have invested more in building strong employer relationships.
Junior,4,"I'd like to see better improvement on the dorms, they are rather bland brick buildings that are hot or cold depending on the time of the year."
Sophomore,4,"I love that the campus is small and the teachers are very attentive to their students. One thing I would change would be to increase the number of teachers per class, not every student can learn with the same teacher."
Freshman,4,I love the school so far. The environment and aura while living on campus is great. The students always show positive energy and there’s usually always an event to go to if students have nowhere to go on a day off.
Freshman,4,"So far, I have learned lots of interesting information in all my classes, and they've rekindled my love for learning. I feel as though I will be ready to enter the workforce as soon as I graduate and I will be able to make a solid living."
Sophomore,4,"American International College has been great to me. The experience in engaging with students, gathering different cultures and ethnicity and bringing them together is awesome! They care about the students. They reach out throughout the semester. The offer many resources to help every student."
Freshman,4,"I think this school is an excellent choice and has high standards for its students. I do think campus, however, could be a little bigger. Parking is very hard as well, because the lots are very small. The school isn't in a very good area, but it's nice to always see security walking around and checking things. Although, we definitely need more blue safety lights around campus."
Freshman,4,"Overall I love this school, the student life always has me doing something. Whether it be going to sports games or events or studying I always have something to do."
Freshman,4,"I liked the application process and was helped when I called.
The staff was very nice, even though I was applying quite late."
Freshman,4,"I think the school is very good! The location could be better but there are so many events held for students like trivia nights, and viewing parties for sports events. I have had the best time there aside from a few minor things that aren't controlled by the college itself. They really like to try their best to make the experience there a good time!"
Freshman,4,"It is a very small college, which makes it very good for those who want to focus on academics. However, the small size does contribute to much more strain on the social lives of many students, especially of those who live on campus."
Graduate Student,4,I have done my undergraduate schooling at AIC and am currently finishing up a graduate program. I have loved the past six years of living here and learning at this school. I have had the pleasure of meeting many different individuals as well as learn from many great professors. AIC has helped me grow into the person I am today and helped me also grow into a confident individual.
Freshman,4,American International College is a small but very diverse school. The student teacher ratio in a classroom is about 14:1 in an average class which is very beneficial. The environment  is very loving and even the staff treats the students as if they were family. Overall American International College is a great school to attend.
Freshman,4,"I like how diverse AIC is. There are so many people here from all over the world my school has recruited. There are so many majors and minors my school has to offer, especially in the medical field which is what I am interested in."
Freshman,4,"My experience at the American International College was pretty good. I felt like I had 101 help with my professors and they were very helpful.If you're looking for a university that has small classes, then AIC is the right place for you. What I also liked about the school is the diversity because you're meeting people that are from different parts of the world"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at American International College. My experience so far has been good. The education here is very good especially for my major which is accounting.
Freshman,4,I like how it is a small school. Professors learn your name quickly which creates a bond within the professor and student. The classes are small so that students can receive attention and guidance from the professor. Everyone knows everyone here since it is a small campus.
Junior,4,The experience at the college is fantastic. The teachers take the time to get to know the students and help them when need be. The college also has a lot of extra curricular programs that students can create themselves which help students get involved on campus.
Alum,4,"I believe the academic offerings and the price of education are very good.  The diversity is excellent and the care for the student's success is paramount in both personal and academic areas.

The administration is dedicated to the student inside and out of the classroom and school activity.  The school cares about you and the students care about each other.   You don't buy success at AIC, you earn it and learn to give back to others.  You mature quickly in this environment and you become a leader just as quickly.

This type of school is so needed in our world today for a significant part of our population.

This is a great school for the person whom you believe has the abilities to add so much more to their life and is willing to be the best they can be.

Surprising, a high percent of leaders come from this school."
Junior,4,"I love the professors, the atmosphere and the diversity however I don't like how expensive it is. The party scene is great. It's located right in downtown Springfield. I feel safe on campus and I think the food is pretty good."
Senior,4,I love how close the AIC community is. At AIC. We are like a family. There are so many different opportunities for students as well.
Alum,4,"It's been almost two years since I graduated now and I don't regret going to AIC. Sure, it was located in a terrible location (so many shootings in nearby neighborhoods my senior year) but don't let that stop you. As a Communication student, I was at home with my department and became very involved with not only Comm activities but student life as well. During my time at AIC, I maintained a 3.7 GPA while being involved in the newspaper and student government and working as an RA and library assistant. If you're looking to be involved in school and will stay committed to your studies, AIC is the place for you."
Senior,4,"The school is obviously not located in the greatest area, but do not let that fool you. American International has wonderful professors and staff. The college is a great place to study. It's student population is small, yet diverse as well."
College Sophomore,4,I like my program and most of my professors
College Sophomore,4,more conservative but not judgemental
College Freshman,4,I am very excited to start at AIC and am glad to be done with SFSU which only deserves 3 stars.
College Freshman,4,"I hope my professors at AIC will be like the upper level physio and bio professors at SFSU, and not like the other lower division professors who did not seem to care as much or were boring."
College Student,4,"There are a few stations on campus that one can run to and ""press a button"" to call campus police, if they feel unsafe. Campus police officers are constantly around campus. I feel safe on campus, but I don't feel safe off campus (Springfield is a very dangerous."
College Student,4,"According to students I have met that are alumni, they are very happy with their new jobs as a Doctorate of Physical Therapy. I have been told the internships are very time-consuming, but they are well worth it."
College Freshman,4,"This school has an excellent reputation and will be able to help me find internships, clinicals and a nursing job after I graduate."
College Freshman,4,The school spirit is great. I have too much studying to do or I would go to more games. The Yellow Jackets mascot is every where.
College Freshman,4,I have yet to have any safety or health concerns at AIC.
College Freshman,4,"The housing is roomy and the dorms are kept very clean, at least in Pouch Hall."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus I don't think sexual assault is a huge issue on this campus but still taken seriously
College Sophomore,4,While being located in not one of the best areas that image does not reflect on the college itself. The college is a safe environment where students can feel free to walk around. While there has been a lot of crime around the school it does not include the school. This helps students to take a little more precautions of campus which isn't a bad thing. It reminds students to be smart about the decisions they make off campus as well as on to stay safe. While I am on campus I feel extremely safe. The only thing I feel unsafe about is being a commuter and walking to my care there have been some crime affiliations which makes me a little uncomfortable when I have late classes and it is dark out.
College Sophomore,4,At this school my experience with professors has been great. They are willing to give you the time of day to help you succeed in your academic career. The courses are well developed and helped me learn. Being a smaller school there are smaller class sizes which is a benefit to everyone. It helps kids stay more focused and helps them feel not just another student in the class like larger colleges where the professors do not know a quarter of the students names.
College Sophomore,4,Working the the career center/services for my work study it is a very helpful facility that all students should stop by once to get a kick on their careers. The career center helps students find work study jobs and internships to help them get an understanding of what the real world would be like.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a commuter but I still spend a plethora of time in the dorms with my friends. The cost of living on campus almost doubled my pay which is the main reason why I am a commuter. Yet, the quality of the dorms are good and are pretty large which is a plus."
College Sophomore,4,Being a part of the soccer team at my college I feel that there is a great support system for all of them teams. We are a division 2 school and have some division 1 teams such as hockey and rugby. Throughout homecoming week the stands are flooded with students wearing black and yellow to support our Yellow Jackets football team. No matter a win or loss everyone is excited just to be representing their school spirit. Being a Division 2 school we are accompanied by a flourishing athletic facility. Our plethora of space and different fields makes it easier for teams to practice. We also have our main turf field that is surrounded by lights which allows teams to practice later if they choose.
College Sophomore,4,Transferring to American International College has been a fairly good expirence so far. All of the professors whom I had were diligent and eager to help students do well and understand the course material. Playing for the Soccer team at my school also made my experience more enjoyable because I not only am focused in the classroom but outside as well. Everyone is friendly had willing to help students out which I feel is a key aspect to attending a college. It is a small college which helps students gain more of a relationship with their teachers and coaches than being at a larger college.
College Freshman,4,The professors are helpful and aim to get students to succeed. They even help if you are not in their class. The registration process is a bit difficult but the advisor I have is very helpful. If you take a full course load then you need to be prepared to spend the time to do the work. I don't particularly find the workload excessive but I do need to make sure I have a study plan and set adequate time aside.
College Freshman,4,When transferring to this college I noticed the multitude of career choices available and the availability of being able to major and minor in different things. The staff are ready to help in whatever aspect they can and if they don't have answers they do their best to find someone who does. I have not been to the career center to be able to comment on it. I have noticed bulletin boards that provide information on internships and how to give a good job interview.
College Freshman,4,The courses offered are all geared toward the degrees offered and there is a great selection for gen ed courses that are needed. So far I have found all my professors that I have had are knowledgeable and eager to teach their subjects and have a desire to see all students to succeed.
College Senior,4,Would recommend this school to all my friends
College Senior,4,Every one has proven to be the best in all that they do
College Freshman,4,I was seen as an individual from the start. The staff was readily available during admission and I was greeted with a smile as I went from department to department. At the start of classes all professors were clear and concise about the expectations of all students. The instructors I had were excited about their subject matter and taught in a way that made me want to learn and excel.
College Senior,4,"My experience here at American International College has been up and down. When I began, I began as an excited OT (occupational therapy) student with such excitement and dreams that had already been shattered10 years ago. Nevertheless, I was ready to take that step head on full force and after being out of school (college that was at the time) fifteen years already, there were many things I had to catch up to without help getting there and that was a difficult experience. But then realising that the college itself was split into two different entities, a medical school and a college of psychology, sociology, business, and criminal justice that were a part aof and entire different "" school"". That I didn't like at all, because the med program, even though I did very well academically until my spirit began to be broken, behind the differences in the care and welfare some professors on that side of campus take in the quality of care the students received as the professors do where I am now graduatin from I would have had a better start and would have never dropped my GPA behind foolishness of those still lost in a century of hate. Overall now that I'm graduating in May and have completed my course load as Psychology major with a minor in Sociology, I love American International College so much that I will be returning in the fall for myMasters/ Doctorates in Clinical Psychology with an interest in Forensics."
College Senior,4,Nicely and newly remodeled comfortably livable and you don't have to have a roommate.
College Senior,4,AIC is an International College.
College Senior,4,"If you aren't used to city life, it will be really hard for you to adjust to the urban setting. People from around the neighborhood walk through campus but no one really has a problem. All you have to do is just use good judgement."
College Senior,4,"I love all my professors that I have had so far. I just really wish that my school was more friendly to commuters. The communication factor because of that is really bad. No one tells us what is going on, on campus and when they do, the events are all held on the weekends of at night when most of us are doing something else like a job or taking care of other responsibilities. We have other options, such as a mandatory break between classes on Tuesday's and Thursday's, but nothing really happens then.

Oh and if you want to start a club, it is very hard to do so. It is almost as if they do not want any more clubs. The SGA take their sweet time when you put in an application."
College Freshman,4,"I have learned a lot in the few months that I've been here, the professors really work hard to get you to understand the work the present. The school also offers a wonderful tutoring program that helps students one on one to help get a better understanding of any subject they're having trouble with free of charge. At AIC people genuinely care about one another and work together to achieve and succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"AIU is great, I can do work when I can, work is due on Wednesdays and Sundays"
College Sophomore,4,"AIC is a very big school on sports. If there is ever a game you will see the bleachers crowded. Even though its a D2 school, there are D1 sports such as rugby and ice hockey. but other than that the school is great and they are installing a new dinning commons which has multiple food choices to pick from"
College Sophomore,4,There are many students who play sports at AIC. The teams and their members have loyal support from their classmates.
College Sophomore,4,"There was an on campus protest organized last semester that was allowed as long as people followed the guidelines. The protestors voices were heard but everything remained calm. This semester there have been reports of shots fired in the neighborhoods around the campus. New cameras and extra security patrols were the result, in addition to the local police response."
College Student,4,"The campus isn't too strict, but if you have a problem, they'll definitely address it for you. Our president is amazing and is always looking out for the student body."
College Student,4,"They're in the process of rebuilding our dining commons and I have very high hopes for it. The floor plans look great and the variety and quality of the food is supposed to sky rocket next year so I'm excited for that. We have dining dollars that can be used at the Hive which has Mondos (a subway like place), Pollo (a wrap/sandwich/chicken/etc. place), Sono (latin food), YoBowl (oriental food), Starbucks, and other options."
College Sophomore,4,In the middle of the city there is every type of food close by and even more that will deliver.
College Sophomore,4,"It is good if you know the right people and the right location, College is what you make it."
Freshman,2,I came to American International College to play field hockey. I chose this school because I thought it was diverse and full of culture and I would find lots of friends. But I did not have the experience I was hoping for. I felt like this school is very segmented and divided.
Freshman,2,"The clubs here are very underdeveloped. There are little to no interesting on campus activities. The sports teams aren't that good. Many athletes do not receive their promised financial assistance. Poor dormitories. Very bad area, little security."
College Freshman,2,"Very small space, very old kitchen and washing machine appliances, thin walls so you can hear everything outside your room"
College Senior,2,"No one uses it in public, but in the dorms it is very previlent. People smoke weed all the time and the RA's do not do a thing about it."
College Senior,2,"There are really no places to study, unless you want to go to the library, which can get a little creepy at times as it is old, or find an empty classroom. Or if you live on campus, your dorm room. Once there was a quiet area of the campus, but then it was converted to the campus game room, so there is no place to find peace.

Other than that, everything is fine, the professors, the workload, the registration process, all fine."
College Senior,2,"There is no Greek housing that I know of. At my school Greek life is very low key. The only time anyone knows about them is when they do community outreach programs, which aren't often."
College Sophomore,2,The shuttle driver likes to go grab food instead of actually going to it's stops and the other security refuses to walk you over to the athletic field and other dorms because of safety
College Sophomore,2,"The RA's are horrible, and never resolve any issues!"
College Freshman,2,This school is located in a not-so-great area of Springfield.  The college is buying up lots of surrounding buildings to make it more of a safer community. I would not venture out of school grounds at night at all
College Freshman,2,Lots of car accidents. You can walk alone at night.
College Sophomore,2,Some of the dorms are not bad but they are all way too old. I like to live on campus because it is easy to get to classes during the day. The quality of the dorm is not good though. There are not enough housing options either.
College Sophomore,2,The athletic facilities are poor. The sports are important to the school but the complex is not up to date. Student involvement in athletics is good.
College Sophomore,2,Some of the academic programs are good. The facilities are not so great. Everything is falling apart and the athletic facilities are poor with no parking. The campus definitely needs improvements.
College Sophomore,2,There's no parties on campus at all
College Sophomore,2,"The shuttle is only good for getting students to one side of the campus to the other. I wouldn't say we are isolated because there are things around and a lot of them are just down the street, but by feet it will take awhile to get to. so there are buses that run often but who wants to take the bus just to go to cvs or mcdonalds or your actual bank? not me and not a lot of students. so that's wen a car is good."
College Student,2,The dorms need to be updated with air conditioning and the bathrooms need to be revamped.
College Student,2,"It's a small school there are no bars, therefore no parties."
College Student,2,"the school is located in a very rough neighbourhood, and if you dont hear sirens in the neighbourhood on every friday and saturday night, something 'big' is going on, it is in the middle of 'gang' territory,.. so safety is a huge concern, esp off-campus"
College Student,2,"The surrounding area isn't all that safe, but it's a great school and they provide you with things to do on campus. "
College Freshman,2,good grades are a answer to lifes destination.
College Sophomore,2,"Have seen very few Greek functions on campus only seen pictures of them doing charity work, perhaps due to the fact that my school is only 3500 students we could just have a small Greek population."
College Sophomore,2,Night life is ok if your welling to travel as Springfield is not some place you would want to go outside at night due to violence and gang interactions.
College Sophomore,2,Need major updates and security features in all areas of campus.
College Sophomore,2,There's not that much off campus housing unless you're living with your parents. And if there is it is not in a good neighborhood.
College Sophomore,2,The food is often very repetitive and not always very good
College Sophomore,2,"Most girls are nice, but a lot are very immature and are only there because their grades gave them a lack of choice when it came to colleges. The rare good looking girls are either taken or stuck up. I can't judge the guys because I am not gay, but as a friend aspect, most of them are pretty chill and you won't see too many tools walking around campus."
College Sophomore,2,"there are very few things to to in Springfield and the area is not so great, but the people on campus are what make the college worth attending."
College Freshman,2,The food is okay. It is very general but they try to hear what the students want and cater to it. They have been making improvements. There is always the good days and bad days. I wouldnt say its exceptional but it beats cooking for yourself every meal.
College Sophomore,2,The campus isn't in the best part of town. Finding an apartment isn't too hard but if you want to be safe you have to be further away from school
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do unless you have a car.and the parties aren't usually that fun
College Freshman,2,"The security on campus needs to be upgraded, but improvement is happening. I do not particularly feel comfortable on campus by myself, but this is because of the off-campus surroundings, not due to the campus or the people/students on campus. I feel safe with students at the school, but the gangs around the area do not make me feel safe."
College Freshman,2,There are some parties but many students return home for the weekends.
College Freshman,2,Its not safe to walk around at night at all. you should always stick with a buddy pat like 7 o clock. an theres nothing to do her no activites really. and the parties arent that fun
College Sophomore,2,"The food store on campus are great. The Dining hall has a lot of the same foods everyday. Sometimes the food not tasteful or a bitter taste. I really like that I am able to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday. I hope that one day they lower the price of the meal plans."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many great looking people, has gotten better but still lacks in the female category"
College Sophomore,2,"Dangerous Surroundings, nothing to do unless your 21+"
Recent Alumnus,2,Kind of Hard Getting There – When a student does not have a car it can be difficult to get to school. Sometimes it may be something that happens when you catch the bus or hitch a ride from a fellow student. The cost is very coslty whether you have a car or take the bus. Prices are very high and the constant back and fourth costs.I believe this campus needs to come up with something to make it easier to get there. whetehr it be passing out bus passes or giving students a gas card through a gas card drawing!
College Freshman,2,Some students have a difficult time with parking often. Most students get tickets when there are no parking spots available and get very upset. It is sometimes unfair to the student due to the school's unavailable parking spots.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much – I would say on a academic basis the Help and programs available are great, for students who want to better themselves. Campus life is Okay parties on campus are fun but become repetitive quikly."
College Sophomore,2,"Poor Options – AIC has Antonios and markets, but we have a system called hive dollars(yellowjackets) and we can not use it in any store or pizza place. They also charge way to much Dominoes makes a fortune off of us because the food on campus sucks."
Alum,1,"I did not take any classes online, I was mostly on campus. I believe that it would be very beneficial for the school to invest in more undergraduate online classes."
Niche User,1,"Noise and banging long into the night.  Be assaulted and campus police does nothing, ended up in hospital about once a month,  got robbed,  outcasted.  Lies told and I was blamed.  Any bad thing happen I was blamed.  Students to much power in student jobs can feel like they can fire you for anything.  Ra never around.  No one believes you."
College Sophomore,1,They have security but don't do anything and even when an issue is brought to their attention of done by an athlete they just overlook it
College Sophomore,1,"They never actually do anything until you get pissed off with them, took over a month just to get a transcript, so unless your on campus to demand something that moment nothing gets done!"
College Sophomore,1,"Same stuff and barely any healthy options, they basically force you to get fat for living on campus"
College Freshman,1,Located right in the middle of Springfield;very dangorus area especially after 5pm.
College Sophomore,1,There are only 2 computer labs and they are not available all day. The wireless network is horrible and is not reliable at all. The technology at the school is also poor and the network is always slow.
College Sophomore,1,The cost for parking is not expensive but there is nowhere to park. Most people are forced to park on the street.
College Sophomore,1,The local atmosphere is not safe at all. The city is not safe to walk around in or take public transportation. There are places to shop in the city but the locals attitudes towards students is poor.
College Sophomore,1,"American International College is a really good school, academically and sport wise. And they have a lot of money but just put it towards dumb things or give it to the athletes or the people who don't really want to be there. Which isn't really fair for the students who want to e there but can't because they can't afford it and are forced to leave until they come up with the money. like me!"
College Student,1,"When it snows, so cold. However, beautiful when the seasons change."
College Junior,1,It is much easier for you to find a place by yourself through craiglist or renting a room.
College Junior,1,Campus food is horrible. The only good thing is there is a subway on campus.
College Senior,1,"Springfield, MA is developing. I seek it's opportunity"
College Freshman,1,Each fraternity or sorority has like 5 people or less on campus.greek life pretty much is non existent. They throw partiest sometimes but they arent all that great
College Freshman,1,"The shuttle doesn't really have a schedule and is hard to track, especially when the drivers decide when to go on break without notice."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do almost ever. and when there are parties no one ever goes because its usually whack.
College Freshman,1,There is just one Greek group on campus But I can say that the group does make good efforts on campus..
College Junior,1,The college is located on a main road in a downtown area called State street. The area has been known for violence and crime but the college does take precautions. at night there is a security guard at the entrance of the college and there are panic buttons in a few areas. Although I have attended for the last year and have not heard of anything negative related to crime or violence.
College Freshman,1,I am a commuter and the parking is absolutely terrible. More lots and better quality are needed! There are so many people parking on the streets when we PAY to park at school.

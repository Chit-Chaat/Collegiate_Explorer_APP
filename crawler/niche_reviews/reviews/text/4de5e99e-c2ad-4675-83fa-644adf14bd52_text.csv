Freshman,5,"Studying online because of the pandemic that hit us hasn't been easy. However, my FIU professors understand that and do their best teaching online using different online resources. Some examples are how my teachers always share their screen showing the process of how to solve a problem which allows me as a visual learner to actually learn. These and other methods are being done as a way to adapt to the circumstances (pandemic) and still make their students succeed in the class."
Freshman,5,"As a current freshman from the 2020 class, I am enjoying FIU. Although it's online because COVID the school has done its best to promote school activities and offer different services to pass these hard times."
Junior,5,This university is a breeding ground for opportunity. A place to challenge yourself and grow surrounded by enormous diversity. I feel so lucky to have gained so much from this place
Junior,5,Everything online learning should be from accessibility to measuring up to the classroom environment. FIU knows how to do it right.
Alum,5,I loved my school. I lived on campus. It was a very vibrant and diverse community that had wonderful professors that were invested in student success.
Alum,5,"I took majority of my classes in person. The learning experience was excellent, the professors were invested in the students success and engagement."
Sophomore,5,"Florida International University is an incredibly diverse campus with an abundance of after school activities, clubs, opportunities, and great professors. 

With a campus as big as it is, there is always an adventure to be had. 

I have had many opportunities and events at my disposal to attend, with advisors to assist me in properly and effectively applying for internships. 

The professors here have been nothing  but helpful and understanding of outside conflicts and allow a lot of lead  way and growth to happen, they genuinely care about their students. 

In my opinion, Attending Florida International University was the best decision of my life. I'm getting unique experiences whilst having multiple opportunities. 

Student life cannot get better than life at Florida International University"
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at FIU taking all of my classes remote. While there are a lot of aspects that I'm not sure about due to not being on campus, I really feel like I made a good decision with his school. The faculty and staff are nice, welcoming and efficient and the people seems really nice! I've communicated with many professors one on one and they seem to really care about their students. So far, it's been a good experience."
Alum,5,"As an alumni of Florida International University and a returning student, I could not be more proud of my FIU. While it may sound cliche at first, FIU really is worlds ahead. Walking around the beautiful campus, you'll immediately fall in love. Not to mention the return on investment for your education at FIU, where the connections and opportunities you come across are unparalleled."
Alum,5,"I would recommended FIU university to everyone that I know, matter of fact I started doing that. The campus was a breath of fresh air for me. I felt welcomed the very first time I step foot on the soil of the campus, everything is well organized, the students were very friendly, the campus have a police department, it has many police officers patrolling the area so therefore as a students you feel safe."
Alum,5,"The online courses were very easy for me personally because all the assignment were already uploaded on canvas for the students to do, and the professors were very adamant about the the students getting their homework done, as well as giving us feedback of our assignment."
Niche User,5,it's really good they do their best to keep us updated with everything and I believe the classes are easier online
Niche User,5,I loved it they have really lovely people and they are really diverse  I won't change anything I love how they treat everyone its amazing
Niche User,5,"I liked the university, the campuses that I attended were very beautiful and the staff were always friendly and helpful."
Alum,5,Uses easy programs that make learning easy!!! Also if you got stuck the professor would give you extensions to resolve any technical issues.
Alum,5,I loved my experience from my first degree and how the professors taught. I am going back to get my nursing BSN!!!
Freshman,5,I feel much more comfortable at home with FIU. It's difficult to wake up early and take such a long drive to campus for in-person classes.
Niche User,5,Excellent University has many things for you to do and the people friendly and diverse. Its one of the best in the state.
Niche User,5,I loved it and would recommend it to others. It's well worth it and it would not be a waste of money and etc.
Alum,5,I am currently taking classes online and I love it. I appreciate the extra steps that my instructors take to ensure their students are getting just as much quality education as it would have been on campus.
Alum,5,I am currently taking classes online and I love it. I appreciate the extra steps that my instructors take to ensure their students are getting just as much quality education as it would have been on campus.
Freshman,5,Florida International University adapted well to the current situation. They added good support systems for the students' safety and online learning. There have been zero problems with their online system.
Freshman,5,"I love FIU! I am in the honors college and I love the small class size and personal connection with professors. If you meet the qualifications I highly recommend applying to the honors college at FIU. Not only do I have small class sizes, I have scholarships dedicated to honors student and other benefits I wouldn't have if I was apart of the general population. 10/10 recommend!"
Freshman,5,I have taken 2 fully online courses at FIU and they were great. I had great communication with my professors and they were very understanding.
Junior,5,"Since the outbreak of the rather well-known Corona Virus, life has changed abruptly for the majority of us.  A lot of us have begun school online, a confusing- but if patient, rewarding journey. Getting used to online classes has been challenging but I've learned a lot about discipline and teamwork along the way."
Junior,5,"Honestly, a great school. After going to community college, entering FIU was an exhilarating experience, it felt like everyone there had a purpose. It was then that I learned; we Are the young future of America. We will be the change one day."
Niche User,5,This campus is beautiful! And has so much activity on campus where you can always find something to do.
Graduate Student,5,Amazing school with plenty of opportunities! Great campuses and faculty. They are invested in you personally!!
Graduate Student,5,Seamless and many ways to get help if needed. Mobile app could use a little work but overall it is a great experience.
Sophomore,5,"This is the best school to ever exist. Amazing professors, beautiful campus! They always have activities, really good games."
Sophomore,5,"Good online experince! Professors really care about your learning. Itâ€™s easy to navigate in the website, making your life easier."
Senior,5,I enjoy the online program. It is simple to use and easy to communicate with professors. Plus there is also a variety of resources for students online as well.
Senior,5,I enjoy this college! It is a fun and diverse school. I like that there is a variety of things to do around the school as well. Nice places to study too.
Sophomore,5,Really nice. I'm an international student and I really like it here so far. By far I do not regret choosing this school :)
Freshman,5,I really enjoy being able to go to school here. the school offers a lot of challenging classes that I find enjoyable and the professors that I had were very kind and caring.
Freshman,5,"The online experience was fun, the courses i took online were very informative and enjoyable. Taking the classes online are a bit more time consuming than in-person classes bc of having to allocate your own time for it."
Freshman,5,The good part of being part of the Panther Family is that I get the help from lots of facilitators that are more than happy to be able to help me in any way possible...
Freshman,5,"Whenever you need some kind of information or help, it only takes one phone call to get ANY problem fixed, the efficiency is 100%!"
Senior,5,I love it at FIU. Most of the professors are understanding and helpful. The Engineering campus is my home away from home.
Sophomore,5,A very welcoming school full of nice people and the engineering program is full of hands on experience that will help you in the future.
Freshman,5,"Apart from loving its beautiful campus, I really like how the nice staff such as professors, advisors, etc. really want you to succeed ad are always there for anything you may need."
Freshman,5,"All of my professors I had for the summer b semester managed to make each of my classes engaging and fun even though it was through zoom, therefore I felt happy and confident with my classes and as a result of that I finished my first semester with all A's."
Freshman,5,I took some classes online and it was amazing! I love the campus energy and everything it has to offer.
Freshman,5,I love the university and its professors. Most professors are very inclusive and love FIU. I enjoy how close FIU is to the city.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus life and the diversity. I love the learning opportunities and their academic level is very high. The environment is ver uplifting and soothing.
Freshman,5,"I had no problems with online learning, it was easy to manage and I advanced a lot thanks to their bachelor programs."
Sophomore,5,"Florida International University is an above exceptional institution. Other than education, FIU is amazing in terms of diversity. Though many good reviews can be given about the school, one change that can be made is access to parking lots for students. FIU has a huge student body and it canâ€™t sometimes be tricky to find a parking spot."
Sophomore,5,Taking online classes with FIU is a good choice and highly recommended. The online platforms used by the institution and teachers helps to engage students in learning and helps them to process the necessary information. One helpful resource with online classes are that teachers do have online office hours and are also available for other methods of communication. The course materials can also be found in an online format so there would be no need to find paper copies. FIU has a great system to facilitate online learning.
Senior,5,I really enjoyed my online classes as I was able to further my degree on my own time and from the comfort of my home.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school overall! Being from Miami I wanted to go out of state and if that wasn't a choice I would automatically go to community college. I was convinced by my high school counselor to attend FIU, I attended the summer right after graduating high school and it was the best experience to learn my way around the campus since there weren't a lot of students in the summer. FIU for people that live in Miami might be under estimated a bit since its the university of our home state but it will prove you wrong! its a whole different place once you experience it."
Sophomore,5,My online experience has been perfect I have other friends from different colleges that always complain about their online classes and the system but I can't relateFIU canvas is easy to manage and the teachers explain everything and are available whenever you need them. Also if you ever have technical difficulties you can call support system and they are very helpful.
Niche User,5,I took Dual Enrollment through Canvas at FIU and I loved the professors as well as the students within the class.
Niche User,5,I participate with the Children's Trust- Youth Advisory Committee and we meet at FIU once a month. They're very kind and assist with directions for classrooms.
Junior,5,"Florida International University is Florida's school. It is the embodiment of the environment, nature, athletics, and academics. I've seen FIU form so many of their Alumni into who they are today and I see myself grow everyday. I can't wait to see where I'll end up because the amazing care I've been given by FIU and I recommend it to any soon to be college student or parent I see."
Junior,5,"I'm not the biggest fan of online classes, but professors made the move from in-person to remote learning seamless. The Florida International University professors did what they had to do to comfortably transition us into remote learning and make it seem like nothing changed. I was taught what I had to learn and I feel safe moving on to my next couple online classes."
Junior,5,"Online classes are very convenient, especially if you work a full time job. Everything is planned out and you just have to follow course."
Junior,5,"FIU, is a very diverse school, you will see people from all over, all with different backgrounds, cultures and languages, the school is amazing, a lot of space and friendly people in general."
Freshman,5,"I have never taken any online classes for Florida International University, but I have friends who do and they always comment to me about how fun and simple it is to do online learning with FIU."
Graduate Student,5,My undergraduate experience was amazing. It prepared me for the world that was to come and even led to my current employment.
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity throughout the whole campus. Tons of options on classes and great staff. Looking forward to my next three years at this awesome university.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning has been an interesting but easy transition.

While it is sad we are unable to attend campus and study in the library. The professors have taken a great deal of time in making the online learning experience engaging and fun 

Studying has become much easier among my peers. we have a verity of communication methods to properly group study and active communication with our professor. 

Classes tend to be very straightforward. Power points and lectures tend to come across clearly and their tends to be very little hassle when it comes to completing assignments. 

The school itself has not let up with its abundance of events. They continue to actively encourage students to participate in events and concerts through zoom.  While not as thrilling as the real thing, they really tend to outdo themselves and make it fun for everyone. 

Opportunities have not slowed down either, i continue to receive many despite the current circumstances. 

I would say things are going amazing."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes this semester have been remote and while it's a bit discouraging, I do feel like professors are trying to make up for it."
Graduate Student,4,"It has been tough. With Athletic training, you have to have hands on experience. FIU professors has designed the program well enough to have some online learning experiences."
Graduate Student,4,"It has been one heck of a ride! COVID-19 did not make my transition to Florida easy, but FIU definitely helped me. FIU has great resources for new students in both undergraduate and graduate programs. I am using resources myself! The professors for the Masters of Athletic Training Program have been amazing. They are always there to help and be by your side through this whole process."
Alum,4,"During my undergrad career, I took some of my classes online in order to facilitate the coordination of my schedule. I opted to take only electives online and no core classes or sciences. Overall, I believe that the quality was good, but would definitely choose in person classes for core or STEM courses."
Niche User,4,"I have taken three dual enrollment classes so far, one of them entirely online, and all the teachers have done an excellent job in making sure that we are on online class meetings for not too long, but long enough to gain essential instruction, and leaving us time to work independently.  They also all responded in a timely and professional manner to any concerns that I sent them via FIU email."
Alum,4,FIU is a great place to learn and work. FIU is a school on the rise with cutting edge academics and deeply rooted connections to the surrounding communities.
Alum,4,"Young school, but they've done a nice job of maintaining charm and family atmosphere. Though campus is small in overall size, and walkable from one corner to another, it still feels very much like a college campus."
Freshman,4,"My classes are great and I can say I've successfully learned a few things. However, I've had financial issues that I would have rather avoided."
Freshman,4,"Florida International University is full of opportunities and memorable people. The teachers are friendly, warm, inviting, and helpful. The students are dedicated and provide a good environment for a motivated student."
Junior,4,"Since COVID-19, everything has been moved to online learning. I still have to see how it all works out. But the professor has all be very kind and amicable, they are also very lenient due to the current state everyone is in."
Junior,4,"I would for Florida International University to provide undocumented students funds so they, too, have the chance to succeed through their education. I belive that if they do this, the school will be open to new possibilities."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed my experience. It was easy to log into classes and professors did a great job with communicating everything.
Senior,4,"I joined FIU in 2017 in fall semester. I was originally doing a BA in graphic design but i recently switched to the BFA program (bachelor of fine arts) and added a minor in art history too. What I love the most about FIU is the diversity of students in the environment. College can be a little intimidating at first, but i met great people at my orientation and throughtout my classes. Teachers are very comitted to your success in class and out. I also like to rely a lot on my counselor to get the best advice i can for my future career and receive my diplomas."
Sophomore,4,It is very good. Prepared for the transition into remote learning. Teachers are trained to know how to use the platforms to avoid any issues.
Alum,4,I did not take many online classes while I was attending. The few online classes I did take were very organized and ran fluidly. Professors make themselves available if necessary.
Alum,4,Florida International University is a great local university that is very affordable and provides a great quality of education.
Senior,4,"In general I liked FIU although I have to say it is not your typical college campus. The ""college life"" or "" student life"" rather isn't that big. It is possible this is because the majority of students that attend are from around the area but I can't say for sure. Also, I would like to see the student's money invested into something important like more parking spaces instead of more palm trees."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience has been positive at Florida International University. The campus is beautiful on both the outside and inside, the students are lively and focused on their studies, the staff is friendly and helpful along with the teachers. The only negative I have is the parking/traffic. Not sure if it's only because of the location of the campus (Miami is a nightmare to drive through), or if it's just that there is not enough parking/driving space. Regardless, the combination of the two really makes it hard to find any parking spaces."
Graduate Student,4,"Although I much prefer in person classes, the professors who facilitated online classes were very efficient and resourceful."
Sophomore,4,"When coming across a global pandemic I was terrified by the thought of learning online, but turns out I was totally wrong. FIU was quick and effective on turning every class remotely and wasted no time on doing so. Loved the communication professors had with students."
Alum,4,Florida International University has granted so many opportunities that opened doors for my life that would have never been opened.
Graduate Student,4,Teachers were very responsive and the online canvas application is very easy to use. The course TA's are also very easy to communicate through online canvas platforms.
Junior,4,"I have taken a couple of online classes in my three years at FIU. Not only do I feel that they are very equipped to teach online and remotely but they do so very well. Especially today, with the corona virus situation going on, I feel the staff and directors have done an amazing job in transitioning. It is clear they ave had experience with online/remote learning. All professors are educated and give you all the resources you need."
Junior,4,"Florida International university is an amazing school. They offer many opportunities for all sorts of students. The professors and the staff are extremely welcoming and make you feel like you're not alone. I absolutely love it here and I am so glad this is the school I chose to start my university experience. Like all the other schools they are not perfect. It is difficult to deal with the thousands of students that attend. However, in my opinion, your not just a number here. Your opinion and your voice counts and FIU does an outstanding job in making sure we all know it!"
Junior,4,The school is very good but it can improve on some of the professors. I gave a 4 because most of my professors were absolutely amazing while the others were not very educated and made the semester very stressful.
Freshman,4,Zoom classes are very fun and they are very easy to do! professors will set a recurring meeting and you can get on 5 minutes early sometimes depending on your professor and they will talk to you and answer any questions you have before class starts.
Freshman,4,"I love the environment at the campus, you can feel that everyone loves being there and is a whole family. The food places on campus are the best and the professors are very understanding, you will make great friends in class. The only downside is that since it is very populated it is very hard to find parking."
Sophomore,4,"Great university, but could do much better with scholarship and financial aid options. Professors are very accommodating and campus is gorgeous!"
Graduate Student,4,"Main campus is beautiful and huge, sometimes it takes really a while to walk from one building to another. Variety of study areas, food, bars, and activities to do. There are many parking garages, but still always a hassle to get a parking spot, definitely need to come half hour earlier to find one. The student portal is pretty outdated and not easiest to navigate. Overall loved the school and academics."
Graduate Student,4,"I took as many online courses as possible, because most of the on campus classes didn't fit my schedule. You need to sign up for online classes as soon as they are available, because they get filled out very fast! Also, many test answers could be found online and some tests are not monitored."
Junior,4,"My online classes have been okay, though with COVID-19 it has been extremely difficult. My online classes then, were tolerable but in-person classes were so much better."
Freshman,4,"I attend the Biscayne Bay Campus and that campus is significantly smaller than the Modesto Campus. This affects the classes, student resources, shops, and more. While I would prefer attending the Modesto Campus, it is far in comparison because of the location of my house. The dorms are nice, however, and are conveniently close to all the classes. Most professors on campus are kind and helpful individuals, and that also goes for academic advisors. The food in the food court could be better, but there is a Starbucks on Campus that makes up for it. There is also a TGI Fridays and Chipotle in walking distance. Personally, I really enjoy the academic part of this university. The system is very simple to use, there are a variety of classes to choose from, and the professors are always there to help as long as the work is put in."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy in person classes and hybrid classes much more than online classes or remote classes. However, the biggest advantage of online classes is the amount of flexibility they give you. You are able to go at your own pace and as long as the assignments, quizzes, and exams are completed by the deadline, there is little chance of doing bad in the class. Online classes are definitely meant for people who are independent learners and don't require interaction with peers or professors to help with their education. The professors and students are there if you need help, but expect to struggle with emails and responses. Miscommunication is possible through email, so expect to go back and forth with a professor for at least a week if you have a question. Overall, the online classes are nice if you like online classes and if you don't then its an average experience."
Sophomore,4,"Florida International University is very diverse, you will meet people from all over the world. I have enjoyed the professors I've had. However, there should be more sports teams and opportunities to participate in adventurous activities."
Sophomore,4,"Love the school! Great campus, great atmosphere! This school is very inclusive and has a large Hispanic population. There is diversity though and the Professors are mostly good too. I believe the best part about FIU is the Honors College."
Junior,4,"My online experience with FIU has been good for the circumstance we are in. My previous classes online have been hit or miss. I had one art class that was amazing and very interesting, but I also took a nutrition class and had a bad experience. It seemed like it was not structured for a summer online class because the workload was very excessive. On the other hand, my classes that have gone online due to COVID have been doing very well. It is not ideal for certain labs and classes, but the teachers I have had have been doing a good job at trying to figure out the best plan."
Junior,4,"I love the environment, the campus, and the teachers. So far I have had a great experience at FIU. The campus makes me feel like I am at a resort. The teachers I have had are all very supportive and eager to help their students succeed."
Alum,4,"FIU is a very diverse campus that gives you an amazing education. All the students that go here are hard working and dedicated to building a better future for themselves. FIU also has an endless amount of food options on campus, more than I have seen in any other university. FIU is a great place to start and end your college journey."
Sophomore,4,The online experience at FIU is really good. its not to difficult and some teachers spread out the workload more online than in person. Its easier to be online the easier to access.
Alum,4,"FIU is a huge university, but don't let that turn you away. There are so many subgroups and it is easy to (no pun intended) find your niche. There are so many opportunities and things to do on campus, countless clubs and organizations, and so many classes offered that I never had to take one before noon. Overall FIU is a very well rounded school with strong programs in many different areas. Campus life is awesome, something to do any day of the week. People are super friendly and as a new freshman people will take you in as one of their own. Amazing experience!"
Sophomore,4,"Honestly considering how this pandemic compelled all us of to change everything in our everyday lives, I haven't found my classes to be lacking in any of the essential components of our learning. We use zoom, still have the opportunities for one-on-one learning through our professor's office hours, video recorded lectures, weekly quizzes, among others. Of course, I love in person classes. Nothing can come close to replacing that kind of social interaction, but this has come pretty close (considering the circumstances). Many things could be better, but I'm a glass half full kind of gal. So, all in all, it hasn't been bad."
Senior,4,Overall FIU is a great school. I love the campus and class choices. The advisor are the worst part to be honest. They are okay but not wow. The upper division professors are fantastic!
Freshman,4,"In the beginning the online platform was a bit difficult for most people to handle, but in the end we all continue our education as a normal class schedule. Still fighting on achieving our goal to graduating."
Freshman,4,"Florida International University is a great school with amazing diversity, allowing others to come in contact with all types of cultures and customs. The staff is very helpful and there are always opportunities for scholarships and improvement."
Alum,4,This is a great institution but the advising was not the best and led to extra classes being taken and/or wrong classes being scheduled delaying my entry into grad school
Sophomore,4,"Currently, I am mechanical engineering student in my sophomore year at FIU. I love the professors I have taken my classes with, but with the professors it's make or break how comfortable they are going to make the class in terms of difficulty. I'm apart of a few clubs and I'm part of the Honors College, but I still think that student life is a bit lacking, with such a big student population, students aren't much engaged with staying on campus after classes are finished"
Senior,4,"Florida International University is an educational center that fits those that wish to continue their careers that some community colleges may not offer. The university commits to the educational purposes as it should; however, its the matter of how well fellow students are accustomed to large populated centers. Great experience so far as a student and would love to see more students empowered to further better themselves within their education."
Freshman,4,"My experience at FIU has been very pleasant. There is a friendly, warm and comfortable energy that is welcoming. There are a lot of features and opportunities that the school offers; there are always fun and interactive activities going on at campus."
Freshman,4,"Online program for Spanish is pretty good. Classes have been easy so far, and it's really nice to be able to do it online. Good price too, it's a lot cheaper than going to classes in person and living on campus. Professors have been nice and understanding."
Alum,4,FIU is a very good school and a cost effective option. The education is very high quality and I loved every moment!
Freshman,4,Florida International University has a great campus with a diverse demographic of students and teachers. All in all a great school in many ways.
Sophomore,4,"Florida International University seems to be average to those that are local. In reality, the university has impressive programs such as Business, Marketing, Psychology, Communication, and Journalism. Depending on what exactly you want to study, FIU would be a great place to achieve that. The city itself is beautiful and the campus is very modern and lively. Overall, it is a great choice of a university it just seems to be played down if you are originally from the area."
Senior,4,A degree from FIU is the same as a degree from FSU. The difference is that FIU students are considered less prestigious which results in us working harder in our careers and FSU is a prestigious florida school so employers forgo talent and experience for a person that when to a school that someone from Idaho would recognize.
Niche User,4,I am currently enrolled in the Dual Enrollment program with FIU and the experience has been great. The great benefits of being enrolled in college helps me understand the college life well.
Junior,4,"FIU is a great school. Even though it is a commuter school, you will get a full college experience if you are involved on campus, and there are many opportunities to do so. Biggest advice would be to join greek life and other clubs."
Alum,4,"I had a remarkable experience with my undergraduate degree at FIU. I give 4 stars for the admissions office and some of the administrative mixups I've had as well as some of the poor teaching experiences. However, overall FIU had all kinds of resources from recreational to professional. I enjoyed my studies here and I would go back again. I also got an entry-level job upon graduating thanks to FIU's on-campus recruiting."
Alum,4,"My undergraduate degree was in Biological Sciences, so what was important to me may be different for others. The most valuable part of my FIU experience was the opportunity to volunteer in research labs. This helped me get some experience under my belt before graduating. Apart from my volunteer experience, I didn't exactly feel prepared for securing a job after I graduated. My takeaway is: in order to feel prepared when you graduate from a large school like FIU, create relationships with your professors/TA's, volunteer for them, and ask them for advice regarding resources/internships/jobs.  

I took a few engineering courses at FIU as well. Their campus is separate from FIU main, and much smaller. The student life there is AMAZING. Classes are smaller, the students all know and help each other, and the professors seem easier to reach."
Junior,4,"I think living and studying in this school is a very good experience.I like the environment of this school.Being able to get along with different people, the atmosphere of study in our dormitory is also good.The management of the school is good.The teacher is very responsible and every time I have a question, I can get the answer from the professor."
Alum,4,"While attending Florida international University, I can honestly say that I had the best college experience. Not only did I feel safe on campus I also have the best academic experience while meeting many people in my field."
Alum,2,"I wouldn't recommend FIU to anyone looking for 'the college experience'. 
Academics are a joke, the student life is terrible (the city of sweetwater is dangerous and awful), athletics are bad, and lack of real advising prevents students from graduating on time. I felt like this place was an accident waiting to happen, then a bridge collapsed. Make a better choice, go somewhere else."
Alum,2,"Some of my professors were mostly unreachable after the switch to online. One in particular didn't respond to emails at all after the transition. I realize many of them have families. This isn't fair for anyone. But I failed a class for the first time this semester, and I don't think that would've happened if that professor had responded to me."
Senior,2,Most online classes are  pretty annoying and i don't tend to learn as much but its good for extra curricular
Senior,2,Honestly FIU has been the worst experience of my life. These advisors set you up for failure and every second they charge you late fee after late fee when these late fees aren't your fault. They don't care about your success they only care about their retention rate which is clearly shown throughout the campus. I've never been the same and they are the ones that have caused me so much issues.
Senior,2,"The professors are not very involved if you are a fully online student. If you are struggling and out of state - there is no chance that you will be able to be helped. Also, if you need help with basic needs like getting your record submitted, it could take weeks for someone to help you. Other than that, the academics seem to be pretty good and the student body is involved."
College Senior,2,"Our athelicts do not get much support from the general student population. Most students complain that our teams ""suck"" so they do not waste their time going to games."
College Junior,2,Yes there will be times where some students get sexually assaulted and that is not okay. there should be emergency call boxes visable in areas where student will be able to use them.
College Sophomore,2,Not many people attend sporting events but you will meet the occasional student who goes to games and plays in intramural and varsity sports.
College Sophomore,2,"If are football team has all the support of there school behind them they just have to win for the love of God. People are proud to be panthers but it hard to show it when you lose all the time. 

P.S. I'm just talking about football"
College Freshman,2,"The overall quality is great, but the prices are ridiculously high"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't live on campus but Ive heard the current housing situation on this campus is pretty limited and the buildings are old. 

They are currently building more housing options but it wouldn't be something I would ever consider due to the high prices. Id rather drive the hour to get to school."
College Sophomore,2,"There is basically no Greek housing available. Since chapters are allowed to be so large at FIU, many people are Greek and if you're not, it's hard to feel a sense of community at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want a true college experience, I would not recommend FIU. Since it is such a commuter campus, many people attend class and then go home. At night and on the weekends, campus is dead. If you join Greek Life, FIU isn't terrible, but if Greek Life isn't for you, good luck."
College Student,2,Greek is very hard to understand and I do not prefer it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Once they become a D1 school I think FIU will be a top competitor in the nation. Until then, its very mediocre."
College Freshman,2,theyre awful people and they do awful things to other people at parties
College Junior,2,Need to lower costs of thd women center check up
College Junior,2,A big workload without a big payout in learning
College Junior,2,"Professors in my field of study, pass students based on there personal relationships with students. If they like a student, they pass. Even if there work is inadequate! If they do not like a student, there grade takes a dive. Even if there work is good"
College Junior,2,The varsity level of play and facilities are very sub-par. The school for being a D1 program is way below the expectations
Recent Alumnus,2,Fiu staff is not adequately prepared to help students like they should. A lot of attn on money & endowments and none for students. Obstacle course to graduate. Not enough attn to what really matters
College Junior,2,"Professors either don't care, are ignorant of their crazy workload or how unsubstantive their lectures are."
College Junior,2,Every math and English class is the same. Some teachers have an insane workload yet teach you nothing. Others are reasonable but because they phone in their job.
College Junior,2,Mold and no Biscayne Campus housing
College Junior,2,Biscayne Campus has zero Greek life.
College Junior,2,Learned more in general ed than dismal English department. They teach so little. It's like high school English with less effort put inti lesson plans.
College Freshman,2,"As an international student, I think greek life is ridiculous and snobby. Also, we have only two frat houses, and no sorority houses."
College Sophomore,2,There is really no school spirit among the students. Football and basketball games have relatively low attendance. Many students come out for the tailgates but leave before the games start. The football team has little support and they don't really do well in games. The soccer team has a huge fan base and they are a top team in the nation. The student facilities are average compared to other schools but they are expanding the rec center in the coming year.
College Sophomore,2,"I went to a school in Alabama and was not fond of the experience out of state. The school was small and did not challenge my knowledge. I then transfered to a local university, and I love the experience so far."
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any loan or grant yet from financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,I applied for scholarships but have yet to win one
College Sophomore,2,The party scene on campus is pretty nonexistent.
College Sophomore,2,It takes too long to get anything done.
College Junior,2,The university is pretty affordable considering the location. What ruins their rating is the people who work in the financial aid department. Most are ill informed and just not willing to help you with your financial aid claims and questions. Better off asking other students about the financial aid options.
College Junior,2,The campus food is not bad due to the quality but instead the prices we have to pay. College is expensive as it is. The school cant expect all of us to spend so much money on campus food everyday we are on campus.
College Sophomore,2,there are very few scholarships available to apply for after March 1st deadline. For students who depend of financial aid such as myself its hard to take out loans because money has to be found to pay the loans back.
College Sophomore,2,Greeks are annoying and douchey. They break apart friendships.
College Junior,2,"Naming the cafeteria Fresh is ironic because the food does not taste fresh at all. It closes really early due to the fact that it serves college students who stay up late, it should be open later. Most of the other restaurants close early or are not even open on the weekends which stinks."
Recent Alumnus,2,"FIU makes it hard to have that in the campus, but its in Miami. There are parties everywhere in the city, just got to have a car and FIU has little spot for you to park it."
Recent Alumnus,2,I was never made aware if I had any available to me at all.
College Junior,2,"It's hit and miss, some people have problems."
College Senior,2,they are pretty strict about things that would bring in money ect: parking tickets.
College Senior,2,only thing offered on campus are greek life parties.
College Freshman,2,They are extremely irresponsible with the way they use the university's money and are very messy.
College Freshman,2,"It's been a nightmare.  While dealing with this, my parents had to figure out how to keep me in school by spending money they did not have to fund my classes this year."
College Student,2,"NO student discounts as if there is not a major university nearby!!!! No one caters to our population, they are expensive, places close early, and I believe these businesses do not care to make more money by catering to us. We should have more availability to the point where SW 8 Street is owned by the school like USF."
College Freshman,2,When it comes to off-campus housing there's actually just one building available which actually opened last semester. It's great for people who want to live close to campus but want the freedom of not having to deal with dorms or life on campus. I'm personally not a fan. The 109 Towers don't even have parking so students have to park at the university and walk all the way to the apartments which is actually really dangerous. Last week someone got robbed downstairs which clearly shows how dangerous it is not having parking and having to walk all by yourself at night.
College Freshman,2,"At FIU there's not much of a party scene from what I have experienced. Since life on campus isn't so big, I guess that plays a part on how much partying actually goes on on campus. With Miami being big on nightlife, a lot of people resort to just going downtown rather than staying at a party on campus."
College Senior,2,"There are barely any food options in the shopping strips that are nearby, save for Wendy's and a froyo place. There are no actual restaurants within a 5 minute drive from here. You have to drive to the nearby shopping mall, Dolphin to get to a nice restaurant, and even then they are fancy ones like Texas de Brazil and PF Changs; not necessarily suitable for a college student's budget"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Too many students, to many requirements to have an opportunity. Curriculum.. a lot of useless classes. Workload, more busy work than anything."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They really don't help you out, but have new building almost every year. Had to take out loans every semester. They always tell you there no money."
College Freshman,2,I don't think people have parties in school?
College Sophomore,2,"I applied for an internship through the Honors College, got hired for the internship, and then the manager transferred to Texas and left me out of a job for the summer the week I was supposed to start. It was a terrible experience and very frustrating."
College Senior,2,"Will take forever to get to campus because of traffic even if you live 5 minutes away, parking is limited, and the cost of even a studio apartment is absolutely ridiculous, but its not as bad if you find roommates to split the rent of a two or three bedroom with."
College Senior,2,Not so great and definitely over priced.
College Senior,2,"Traffic here is terrible! Hardly anyone speaks English, so it would be a good thing to learn some Spanish before coming here."
College Junior,2,"I have not has an internship, I would hope I could find one in my field but I find it difficult to apply to certain things at the school if you aren't fully involved in it. As someone that commutes it is difficult to be social with the school. However, I have found ( on my own) positions that will help me with my career. Some concerns I can display about finding an internship would be if any background in the field is need or if even a degree is needed."
College Junior,2,"I consider that it is too expensive however, it is close to the school and there are some perks but it is STILL too much money in addition to tuition."
College Freshman,2,"At BBC, there's only 3 places to eat."
College Senior,2,"Dining near my school constitutes fast food OR going to Publix. I would prefer more vegetarian restaurants and options. With that said, I am really not a fan of Off-campus dining. I've never dined off campus, because of limited/undesirable choices."
Sophomore,1,"If attempting a career in the communication, arts, or any creative field, stay far away. I decided to attend FIU as it was my safety choice but I am happily transferring as all the teachers in the journalism program are terrible. They all have 1 star ratings for a reason. FIU is awful at offering a wide variety of classes that fit your schedule and are very limited. FIU administrations funds every other program than the arts and its evident when my art class was on the isolate part of campus, near the highway with absolutely no AC for 3 hours! There are no art clubs and one poorly funded photography club. Although affordable, I had an awful experience."
Sophomore,1,Professors expect a self taught lesson for a class you paid for. Some are incredibly understanding but for the most part they won extend deadlines even with a pandemic and civil rights movement going on.
Freshman,1,"PLEASE READ BEFORE APPLYING!!!!!!
FIU is a good university especially if you have lived in Miami/Florida your entire life. if your an international or out of state student you might not fit in as well. the university is mostly Hispanic students, so you need to learn Spanish or be familiar with Spanish music to fit in. its also a large commuter school so campus life is kinda dead, also the location of the campus SUCKS. its the worse thing about FIU, it's an isolated campus that's really far away from south beach or downtown. youMUST HAVE A CAR if u want to have any social life. sometimes you feel isolated because of the massive student body. SO TO CONCLUDE IM TRANSFERING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE because it's not near a city WHATSOEVER, you feel really isolated and alone, AND ITS A BIG COMMUTER SCHOOL!!! if your fine with all of that I totally recommend coming because academics are good especially for the price."
Freshman,1,"The frats and sororities are jokes. There's only one house on campus and its for a weird frat. People don't talk to each other, the only way to actually meet people is if you live in the dorms. The frats throw occasional parties but all the ones I have been to have not been that good. The funnest thing is probably the tailgates. Other than the parties, theres hardly anything to do unless your loaded and can afford a table at a club. Sandbar is popular on Thursdays and Mokai is popular like every weekend. USE RATE MY PROFESSOR, it is a life saver. FIU is a very good school faculty and campus wise. If your coming from somewhere different, don't expect the Miami Beach social life scene, you won't get it at all. If your a girl, take advantage of UM's frat parties and tailgates."
College Junior,1,"Greek life on campus is seen as a waste of time. Those who join are often asked why they do in the first place. Most of the time all you hear from those affiliated is about their personal drama, and not what they are doing for their community. Greek life at FIU is just a scam in Non-Greek's eyes."
College Junior,1,They all use their brothers and sisters to cheat for exams....
College Freshman,1,"I think they are all stuck-up, ""better than you"" air heads, who only care about how they look and what people think of them, and the guys are disrespectful and only care about getting with girls, and who looks ""bigger"""
College Sophomore,1,"There is no school spirit. The stadium for football games is empty, and the basketball arena is even more empty. Many people chose FIU as their safety school out of convenience, so many people feel bitter to be attending."
College Student,1,if your not with the in crowd then your a loser so I don't really care for the greeks
Recent Alumnus,1,Ill prepared staffers and unhelpful to students who are financially displaced and burdened
Recent Alumnus,1,"I see a lot of generally positive reviews, mainly from freshmen and sophomores. I'll give you a take from a recent graduate who started in 2011. 

Now this school has many decent programs, like marine sciences, architecture, philosophy and culinary arts/hotel management at BBC and the business school is pretty good too, but otherwise this school is complete garbage. Diverse? No. Hispanic? Yes. 66%+. Student population who lives on campus? Barely passes 3,000. It's a very quiet and monotonous campus past certain hours on weekdays and weekends no one is around and everything is generally closed. Student life is awful, and the type of people are miami people: narcissistic, snobby, holier-than-thou, rude, individualistic miscreants. Sunny place, shady people. Negative auras all around, more than plenty of opportunities to surround oneself with bad influences. It lacks empathy and humanity. Perhaps it's because I'm from up north where we don't treat others like part of the wall, but it's certainly not friendly. That being said, you can obviously meet great people there and I met some truly great people that I'm still close and in touch with, and thankful to have met them. 

Whoever gave FIU dining options an A rating obviously hasn't eaten in fresh foods, probably the most oxymoronic name you can give it, the library closes--especially during finals week! Who does that..Oh right, if like a high GPA, forget coming here. We're ranked in the top 5 in academic rigor. 

Look, if you do decide to come here, do your A.A somewhere else to get the general courses out of the way, because this school WILL GO OUT OF ITS WAY TO RAIL YOU FROM BEHIND--especially in math. Their department couldn't be worse. I lived on campus for four years--the first two years were the biggest waste of money. $20 grand just for housing, and not too decent either.  Come in as an upperclassman and do University towers or parkview housing.  Otherwise I wouldn't go near this school with a 50-foot pole."
College Freshman,1,"This school is TERRIBLE for providing and helping with financial aid, especially for out of state students."
College Junior,1,Off campus housing is the worst if you dont live with family. The prices are outrageous and dont have sufficient parking spots for the tenants.
Recent Alumnus,1,Places don't look very appealing
College Student,1,"Only Golf, Swimming & Diving and maybe Rugby excel here. All other sports here SUCK. You would barely be able to distinguish an athlete versus a non-athlete if not for gear."
Recent Alumnus,1,no one cares about you
College Freshman,1,I've received no financial aid! I really can't afford to attend next semester and the financial aid office has been no help.
College Freshman,1,"Although housing is fairly close, you have to cross 8th street to get to campus(which can feel like the frogger game at times). Cost is ridiculously high, and many students cause a lot of issues for store owners in the area. Although there are officers around most of the time to make sure there are no parking/speeding violations, that doesn't  ensure student safety when crossing the notorious 8th street. My advice: just get housing ON campus, its easier and in my opinion safer."
College Senior,1,Everything cost money. I pay a transportation fee every semester and still get charged $3.00 everytime I want to use the bus. That's $6.00 round trip! That's lunch! C'mon FIU!
College Senior,1,"It's great if you have money, and the worst when you don't. I seriously can't afford to go out as much as I would like to (since I am in Miami afterall) and pay rent at the end of the month. Personally, I like saving money. I like having something to fall back on. Miami steals all of that from me the second I step out the door."
College Senior,1,"Miami has one of the worst housing situations that I've ever had to deal with. The houses are expensive, they're small and there's always a good chance you're getting scammed. FIU housing is also extremely costly, almost impossible to afford without substantial loans. If I didn't have family living nearby I don't know what I would do."
College Sophomore,1,"It really is the worst, especially if you live on campus AND have a car, a lot of the time after 7-9 pm you are practically guaranteed to not find a spot unless you want to drive around for 20+ minutes and wait until someone leaves. It's terrible."
College Senior,1,"There is some areas that you are able to walk to without getting wet when it is raining, but others are not covered and there are huge puddles everywhere."
Recent Alumnus,1,miami's hot and muggy weather is terrible especially on the days when it rains heavily.
College Senior,1,It's either extremely hot or raining.
College Senior,1,Don't get enough financial aid
College Junior,1,The only way to get to campus is driving and the traffic and parking situation is chaotic at best.
College Freshman,1,My enrollment is on the process of being cancelled because of non-payments. I'm very displeased but I can't really blame the school since i am the one who suppose to pay. It looks like i'm going to drop out for now and return when i get more money.
College Freshman,1,I don't even own a car and still have to pay almost 100 dollars every semester for parking when I don't even use it. And even when I'm with a friend trying to park it takes around half an hour to find a space.
College Freshman,1,There is drugs everywhere in the dorms. 
College Freshman,1,There is nothing sanitary in the school. The university of Miami has a better health services and sanitation than fiu.
College Freshman,1,"Fiu fraternities are always coming out on the news. Its horrible, there is a lot of hazzing being done at the sorority and fraternity houses. It's just a huge mess "
College Freshman,1,Parking is always my least favorite part of every day.
College Sophomore,1,"Applying for financial aid isn't that hard, but faxing and having to turn in hard copy's is a headache. The faxes seem to never go through and somehow your paper work always seems to get lost. "
College Sophomore,1,Our university is mostly defined by how much the parking is terrible... And it's no joke.
College Sophomore,1,"Off campus housing is expensive. There are only condos and apartments that are around campus, and the closest you are to campus the more expensive it is. The farther your away from campus, depending on which direction you go is also very expensive. Even though the median is somewhat ok, it is also expensive. Housing prices on and off campus are ridiculous. Nothing comfortably affordable for college students."
College Freshman,1,We did not recieve our money until mid way through the semester. Financial Aid office is a hot mess.
College Freshman,1,TERRIBLE! I'm forced to have a meal plan because of the building I live in...but i never go. It's the worst food with the worst staff. Waste of 1300 dollars
College Freshman,1,"FIU Parking has a reputation, and it isn't a good one."
College Freshman,1,"This is mostly a commuting school, so people are always driving in and out. Tough luck if you have a car, because once you find a parking spot you'll never wanna move your car. "
College Freshman,1,You have to be here two hours prior to class.
College Senior,1,The football program needs more funding and needs to be entirely redone. It's sad the low-attendance at our games.
College Senior,1,"The parking fee is OUTRAGEOUS. With the price we pay, you'd think we're getting our cars valet parked. Yet there is never any open spots."
College Junior,1,"Financial aid is the worst, I'm not eligible for any of the scholarships that I should be and as a result I cannot pay for school and have to either skip a semester or take only 2-3 classes. "
College Junior,1,parking is the worst no matter where you go
College Sophomore,1,The parking sucks! I have to walk like 2 miles to get anywhere!
College Junior,1,Parking at my school is the number one problem. It is always extremely difficult to find a spot and one close to your classes.
College Junior,1,"Dining could be a lot more diverse,healthy and affordable at FIU.  Changes are needed."
College Junior,1,"Unfortunately,  healthy options are not available.  Mostly fast food and chain restaurants.  There is only one place where you could eat healthier but it's quite expensive."
College Junior,1,"The school is supposed to be a smoke free campus, but there are often students and professors smoking in the open area by the library. The police close parts of the university road system for no reason causing traffic congestion. Overall there are choices that the administration and faculty make that negatively effect the way the school runs."
College Sophomore,1,"On-campus parking is horrible, the parking lots are always filled. You can get a decal to park in one of the garages however it is sort of expensive. There is free parking, its just far from your dorm room and classes."
College Junior,1,"I am enrolled in BSN/MSN for foreign physician and I applied for FAFSA on time, however most of my classmates received this year a Grant ($ 5000) but not me, when I asked to financial aid office why I did not receive the Grant they explained to me that the money is given to the students that apply first to the FAFSA without taking into consideration  the financial need of the students. I think that is a very unfair process."
College Senior,1,"It is the absolute worst. For the first 2 months of each semester, you must reach by 9:30 A

Public transportation in Miami is terrible so almost everyone has a car yet no place to park them on campus."
College Junior,1,"I've been very disappointed with my program. After my Major Professor left the University, the Department has not been supportive or encouraging of me completing the Ph.D. program. I was not appointed a competent new advisor, my progress was not followed up,and I was discouraged from moving forward even though I was so close to graduating. That was four years ago; I have since been maintaining my student status, registering every semester and seeking out numerous avenues, on my own, to complete my degree. The Departmen,t nor the University, seem to have vested interest in seeing their students successfully graduate. I have watched the quality of this program deteriorate before my eyes. It is rather unfortunate, given the location and close proximity to companies in the area. I have been struggling, but have finally found a path to complete my degree. I am starting my research from scratch, however, am confident that the project I am working on and the advisor I am now working with, will lead me to a successful Ph.D. in a rather novel field."
College Junior,1,"If you did not know already weather in South Florida alone is hell
It's super hot and it rains a lot in the summer
and it's summer 99% of the year, so good luck with that"
College Junior,1,Parking at FIU is terrible. The university is trying to make more availability but it's still not enough for a commuter campus. I need to leave my house extra early if I want to get to class on time.
College Freshman,1,"There is a shuttle between the north campus and the south campus. However, to get to campus YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A CAR. You need to get early because the parking lot is always full. And paying for gas is always expensive."
College Sophomore,1,I do not own a car but my friends complain about how horrible it is.
College Junior,1,Parking can be difficult. If you get there early that's when you get the greatest spaces; but late morning and afternoon can become really hard. At that time many people are looking for parking.
College Senior,1,"They can get pretty out of hand with how strict their anti smoking policies are these days. They've banned cigarettes on the entire campus, including the dorms. I don't even smoke and I think this is unfair. If you get caught there's a $200 fee, but honestly, what they're really targeting is weed. My freshman year we had 'fire alarm drills' almost every other week the second semester, and a lot, A LOT, of people got arrested for what they found in their rooms when they went to go search. Being discrete isn't enough, you have to be paranoid to not get caught."

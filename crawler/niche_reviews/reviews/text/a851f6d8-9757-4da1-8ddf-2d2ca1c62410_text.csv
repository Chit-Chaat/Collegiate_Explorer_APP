Niche User,5,its a great community to be around. the staff is really nice. i love how they have several larger companies associated with them to help out the students.
Freshman,5,My experience attending Ranken Technical College so far has been excellent. The staff is very helpful when you need help with something and the same goes for the students. There is not anything that I see needing to change at the college since it is already great.
Graduate Student,5,"Oh yah, this is a great college. Easy 5 stars, the instructors are soo smart and soo good at teaching. It was definitely what I would call a dream college. Got my associates in IT. I got 5 certifications. That's crazy. If you want good equipment to work with then the answer in Ranken Technical College. I went to the location in Wentzville, MO. It was so awesome and soo fun learning the cool information about Network Engineering. And they would even let me come in early and free lab so I got so many opportunities to learn new technology and execute what I learned. The learning materials were exactly perfect. I got good grades there cause at Ranken they are really really good at teaching and helping you understand the most difficult of concepts and practices. This is a college that will actually change my life and make it soo much greater."
Freshman,5,My experience at Ranken College is was very pleasant . I really enjoy going to my classes. The professors are very helpful and they really care about everyone. They make sure you understand what they are teaching. I look forward going to school every day. They let you know if your grades are slipping so you can get the help you need to keep your grads up.
Freshman,5,"Ranken is a great Technical College. One of the best in the country actually. The hire rate for graduation is extremely high, but this is not without a cost. The grading system is unbelievably high, and because of this, the graduation rate is quite low. It's sort of a ""weed out the weak"" sort of deal. The students who graduate are extremely successful and please the employers very much. They promote professionalism to an extremely high degree and enforce good moral practices."
Sophomore,5,Ranken has gone above and beyond to make sure I succeed. My Professors also help us find jobs in our field they believe would be a good fit for us.
Junior,5,"I am a non-traditional student returning to college to obtain my Bachelor's degree. I graduated from Ranken in 1997 with my Associates degree. the school is great and the online courses are amazing. However, the administration is a bit challenging. You can talk to 5 people and get 5 different answers. The enrollment process was challenging and it definitely felt like they were just trying to get my money."
Sophomore,5,I have had a very good experience at Ranken Technical College. This college is able to provide the training I want so I can be successful. I am currently taking two different programs. The Ford ASSET program (associates) and BSAM (applied management - bachelor). The school has great teachers with ample experience in the industry. Great school.

College Junior,5,"Haven't taken any academic studies at Ranken yet. I've just finished their Basic Refigeration and Electrical course ,which I cannot apply to my assiociates degree. I must attend full time day classes next spring semister in order to get anywhere. I was hoping that I would qualify for a scholarship from what ever program available out there. Open house is on the 19 of October and I'll register for spring classes then."
College Junior,5,Honestly I've not taken any academic courses at Ranken yet but they have so many resourses for every student that is going into their respectful study of trade.
College Junior,5,I love taking online courses. I like to just do my work and go on without having to travel down to the campus and stay for any longer than necessary because of my job.

Sophomore,4,"It gives the ability to grow and learn and they will work with you when it comes to academics, finances, home life, etc"
Graduate Student,4,Ranken Tech was a very good school. My experiencing there truly was hands on from day one all the way until I graduated. And to top it off I did get a job one month fresh out of college.
College Senior,4,"Great job leads, placement, etc.."
College Senior,4,"Automotive Technology- Training on inspecting, maintaining, and repairing vehicles."
College Senior,4,"agriculture, carpentry, automotive, major appliance, precision machining...etc"
College Senior,4,Academics are a little difficult. But we do have tutors that are willing to help any time.
College Senior,4,"The class sizes are small , so the professor is always not taking to long to answer your question."
College Senior,4,My overall experience is going good at Ranken right now.
College Senior,4,It has been good so far. I still have a year to go .
College Senior,4,"I havent had a online course recently but , when I did it was great."
College Senior,4,"My major courses for IT have been challenging and have given me confidence that i will be successful in the industry.  More than half of my third semester class failed, so if you choose the IT program at Ranken, be sure you are ready to focus and put in some real effort if you want to succeed.  The one downside of Ranken is the gen ed courses.  Thank God I only had to take three of them in my 4 semesters at Ranken, because those classes are all just a waste off you time."
College Junior,4,"Ranken Has Been an Exceptional Choice – I enjoy the smaller classes.  Once enrolled in a specific program, the classes are set for the next four years.  There is no ""needing a class"" and not being able to get enrolled.  The instructors care about students and their success."
College Senior,4,They are helpful if you are willing to help yourself. They are not going to do everything for you.
College Senior,4,"Our computer labs, printers, and wireless connections are very good."
Recent Alumnus,4,High Performance – The reason i chose Ranken is highly due to their high performance program they offer. I am hugely interested in high performance and believe that their program will offer me the most education in that area.
Alum,2,"I originally went to Ranken after coming off of active duty in 2009. I was an evening school student the first time and had a good experience in my classes and learned alot. 10 years later in the fall of 2019 I started going as a day school full-time student. This time around has been a pretty horrible experience. I have had many issues with the program and the instructors and much more. Actually went and filed a complaint against one of the instructors and all that happened is that they made me sit in a room with 2 instructors... him being one of them and tell him why I filed a complaint on him and he just sat there and denied all of it and lied straight to my face. I am suppose to have 2 more semesters left in this program, but after this semester ends in May 2020 I will not return. Not exactly sure what changed so drastically in the 10 yrs I left there, but they definitely haven't been making improvements."
Sophomore,2,"I cant learn anything at this school. if you show any sign of not knowing exactly what you should be doing you will be constantly mocked by peers and told I'm not allowed to do tasks in groups because I'm too dumb to be trusted to do them. I haven't learned anything new since I got here because of the other students. I've gone to the teachers and administration numerous times and still, I'm singled out. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL IN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING."
Freshman,2,"HI, I am a high performance racing student at Ranken technical college. I was very excited to do my first semester at Ranken. the balance between class time and shop time is nice. my main complaint is the teacher I had fpr the first semester which I wont name because as of now he is being reviewed and might possibly get fired. he had a three month backlog in grades that he didn't put in until two weeks from the end of the semester. this took many classmates by supprise because many of us didn't know we needed accedemic help until it was too late. its not a bad school but be careful of the auto programs"
Recent Alumnus,1,"what campus resources? a small library with a few computers upstairs. oh and a store where you can buy more ranken stuff at outrageous prices. i'm giving an F here because when i went to sign up at a union hall _ the union sent me back to ranken to take a test. guess what - the exact same test i took to get into ranken in the first place. that i had already taken, and passed, only now - after ranken already had 25 grand out of me - they wanted ANOTHER 50 DOLLARS...just so i could take this test again...so i could apply for a job. amazing."
Recent Alumnus,1,student body....let's see....mostly spoiled brat little teens full of angst and know it all attitudes 18/19 yrs old fresh out of high school and sent off to ranken by mommy and daddy. teachers pretty much let them act like a zoo in the shops as well. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"sure i learned a little while going to ranken. a very little. the basics of things. we would have a one hour class in our major every day, and then like 3.5 hours of ""shop time"" - where we were SUPPOSED to get alot of ""hands on training working on equipment and gaining experience. this did not happen. at all. only one of the 4 teachers in our major had ANYTHING AT ALL to do with his shop classes. the others spent most of that time sitting in thier offices away from everyone while all the immature 18/19 yr old kids in the class just pretty much goofed off and left hours early EVERY DAY. i think that's what they wanted actually. they didn't really want people to actually do anything - because then some equipment might get tore up and the school would have to spend a few dollars to replace it. heaven forbid. the only thing i ever saw either teacher in the second year get excited about in the shop was making sure it was absolutely spotless and we all left early the day a ""tour"" came through of prospective future students. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"i really have no idea why the tuition is SO HIGH!!! there are several other places in the st louis area that offer the same kind of education at a fraction of the cost. my guess is that it's inflated because ranken used to be a decent trade school - decades ago. now it's riding on it's reputation catering to spoiled teenagers sent off to day laborer school by thier mom's and dad's hoping they can just ""get a job"" who just pay for it all for them. IF YOU HAVE TO BORROW MONEY TO GO TO RANKEN OR IF YOU ARE OVER 25 YEARS OLD IT IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST CHOICE FOR YOU - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
Recent Alumnus,1,"the only thing this career services office has ever told me is to ""go look on the internet"". i walked into their office once before graduating and the lady just kind of snapped at me. didn't even bother looking up from her desk. ""go look on the internet!"" i've been out of ranken for over two years now and may as well not even exist to them. after all - they've got all the money they're going to get from me. i've applied to over 2000 jobs in my field and have yet to have one single job offer. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"what a waste of time and money – ranken is WAY overpriced!!! i graduated in 2010, and HAVE NOT RECIEVED ANY HELP FROM RANKEN AT ALL in finding employment. they basically told me to go away at the ""career services"" office. 
our teachers could have cared less if we learned anything or not. they would just sit in their offices during our ""shop"" times on their lazy butts and do nothing every single day. horrible - HORRIBLE waste of my time and money (which i'll be paying back for probably 15 or 20 years now). i just can't type how much i regret going to ranken. seriously."

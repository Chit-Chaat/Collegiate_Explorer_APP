Freshman,5,I love Aultman College. I started there as a CCP student. I was welcomed and fit in just like the other college students. The class sizes were perfect and the professors were amazing.
Freshman,5,"I am proud to attend Aultman College. I am a recent transfer student and did not know what to expect upon admission. The learning environment is professional and the class work is rigorous; however, I feel like I have learned so much in the past semester than I have in the past couple of years as a student while attending another college. The learning environment is encouraging. If I am ever in need of help there is always someone willing to help whether they be a student or professor. I enjoy being a student there and I look forward to receiving my nursing degree from Aultman. I am confident that I will be well prepared to have a successful career as a registered nurse because of the values emphasized; health care and collaboration."
College Sophomore,5,Teachers want you to excel and the curriculum will get you a nursing degree without taking a lot of unnecessary classes
College Junior,5,Because we are so small the teachers and students all know each other.  Many of the students hang out together studying and have become very close friends.  It is a very friendly atmosphere.
College Junior,5,I love it!  I get lots of hands on experience with real patients.  The teachers are all very educated and good at what they do.  I would choose my school over any every time and would recommend it to all prospective nursing students
College Junior,5,"We have a wireless network, it is always running and the IT Department is easy to contact if we have questions."
College Junior,5,"We offer a teaching hospital attached to the college.  This gives our students the ability to participate in surgeries and on site clinicals.  Many of the doctors, surgeons, and nursing staff love the opportunity to teach."
College Junior,5,"Nursing classes must be passes with a 77%.  If you receive a 76.99% you fail.  There are no bonuses or extra credit, you either know the material or you don't.  The curriculum is very hard, but Aultman wants to produce the best critical thinking nurses.  I am glad I am held to these high standards."
College Sophomore,5,"Tuition is kept to a minimum, and financial aid is great to work with."
College Junior,5,there is a very diverse group of students in the school.  most of them also work or have families to take care of.  so they understand what everyone else is going through.
College Senior,5,"The college does not have a book store so you order all your books online. The college does have a very nice Logo store with clothing and a large supply of snacks and drinks, also the store supplys blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, along with other medical supplies and other useful things (paper, notebooks, pencils,  study guides...etc.) If the store does not carry something that I student needs, than there is a suggestion jar and the product is usually in by the following week."
College Sophomore,5,less students make it easier to work with teachers one on one.
College Sophomore,5,I can always find a class in the times i have alotted.
College Sophomore,5,i have not yet taken an online course at aultman but i have elsewhere.
College Sophomore,5,"Worth the Cost – The tuition is high, but among the best in edu you can receive in Ohio."
College Sophomore,5,"Student Services Entry to Exit from Aultman College of Nursing and Health Sciences – This is one of the most comprehensive programs around the stark county area.  One of the best programs there are to experience.  They make sure they provide the best in trainning as well as assistance in any area of need that a student may have in regards to education, employment and future career goals."
College Sophomore,5,"Transfer Success – Upon entering into the Aultman College of Nursing and Health Sciences school of nursing; I had no problems with my credits being accepted from the degree of bachelor's in psychology that I had just earned.  The process was smooth, the office staff were warm, understanding and inviting to questions and concerns that I had about my enterance."
Sophomore,4,"I am very pleased with Autlman. It is connected to the Hospital, so all clinicals are right there. The only thing I would change is the amount of classes they offer. It is a smaller school, there are not many times the classes are offered. So you have to rearrange you life to accommodate the time they offer."
College Junior,4,Received credit for all classes transfered
College Junior,4,There are support services for job prospects
College Junior,4,"Associated with a hospital, hires 30% of graduates"
College Junior,4,"Small school, focused on student success"
College Junior,4,Supportive staff and students. VERY expensive
College Senior,4,"I was very disapointed that they did not except all the english and math that I had taken, so I had to retake some classes."
College Senior,4,I am not that versed on the career center
College Senior,4,I feel that they will hire their grads before they will look elswhere.
College Senior,4,most of the professors care about the student and are willing to help if you ask for help. I do not like the amount of hybred classes that they are making us take.
College Senior,4,"They offer the ability to go at a part time rate so you can still work, but when you get to the nursing classes do not plan to work full time."
College Senior,4,"I chose Aultman because of the small class size, but this makes it hard to sometimes get into the class time you want or works best for you."
College Sophomore,4,I havent started yet. I dont start until January the 11th 2016.
College Junior,4,Our campus is very clean and modern.  Our library is open 24 hours a day to accommodate all schedules.
College Junior,4,"I am a current employee of the hospital and as a graduate I will have the opportunity to transfer my time to a new unit and position, in which I will utilize my degree."
College Junior,4,"Financial aid is never a problem. We are able to receive the maximum amounts, we offer work study programs, and employee tuition reductions."
College Junior,4,"Scheduling is online for upperclassmen, which is really nice, but because we are a small school the availability of classes is limited and causes some frustration."
College Junior,4,"Our professors are all MSN's or have their doctorates in order to teach.  Aultman holds it's teachers to the highest standards and it's students.  My school offers tutoring for all subjects, face to face and online.  We have dedicated learning resource rooms and a library that is open almost continuously.  Student services helps us organize community services and we volunteer in our community.  The school offers clubs and lots of activities to join."
College Junior,4,"I like to be able to work at my own pace.  I am a working single mom of three that attends nursing school full time, the online classes give me the flexibility to work ahead if I know I have a busy week. It's a very useful time management option.  The only drawback to online classes is they always seem to be filled with busy work."
College Sophomore,4,There are many organizations for diverse groups throughout the school.
Sophomore,2,My first year was just like any other Freshman year off college. Not many credits transfer to Aultman from other schools which set me behind from the beginning. Summer classes became very difficult mainly because only part-time professors teach only summer semesters.
Sophomore,2,This college is way too expensive for the majority of the classes to be online. Academic advisors do not know what they are doing.
College Senior,2,"There is not much flexibility offered for classes, with only a few time slots to pick from, no evening classes offered making it difficult to work full time and attend classes."

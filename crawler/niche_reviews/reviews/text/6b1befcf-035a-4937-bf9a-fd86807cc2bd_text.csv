Alum,5,I did not take any classes online as there were not many offered when I attended. This does not apply to me.
Alum,5,I loved my experience. I enjoyed the small classroom setting and accessibility to professors. I also enjoyed the student life and was very active on campus.
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience has been amazing! The environment that the University creates for us students is amazing, even with dealing with COVID precautions. The school provides amazing opportunities for students with clubs, classes, and enrichment activities. The campus is gorgeous and they keep it that way. I love the military style of the college and the friendliness of every staff member I come in contact with. My freshman year is going great!"
Freshman,5,"While online classes are more difficult to understand for me because I am a visual learner, the experience is still enjoyable. All of my professors are trying their very best to make this experience as helpful and do-able for each individual student. They still provide an in- person aspect as well as many online resources to come in contact with them if we have any questions. They make it as easy for us as they can while still academically challenging us."
Freshman,5,"The campus is small, which makes it easy to get around. The mountains are gorgeous, and the town area looks really cool and fun to visit. The students here are friendly and open to conversation, even if you've never met them before. I think the dining hall could use some improvement. Maybe branching out with different foods and having a better variety would make it a lot better."
Freshman,5,"My online professors were mostly super helpful and encouraging, letting me know they’re there for me and willing to help in any way they can. There’s also a huge emphasis on tutoring/additional help and to never be afraid to get it if you need it. It definitely made me feel more comfortable about accepting that I may need extra help with certain subjects and to not be ashamed to get it."
Freshman,5,"The community here is so nice and welcoming, with answers to every question you have. It’s a great environment to be around and so encouraging."
Sophomore,5,The faculty at UNG is very interactive with the students and their activities. The campus is beautifully maintained and there are many club/sport/academic opportunities for students.
Sophomore,5,Pretty good and responsive. I’m not the online class type person but the online classes i had were great and it was easy.
Sophomore,5,"Overall the school is great, I’m a art student and they have all the classes that I need and the professors are great. I honestly always feel welcome in there."
Junior,5,The online classes were the best classes I took while at this college. Online professors were engaged and provided good assignments.
Junior,5,"The University of North Georgia is a growing university which excels in its competitiveness against other STEM program universities in Georgia. Compared to other universities, UNG offers unique courses for its undergraduate students. Many students drive to the university or are military, so there isn’t much of a party scene presence. However, that makes this campus very safe. You can be on campus in the middle of the night and not have to worry. So, for those of you who are busy during the days, evening classes are just as safe and as wonderful as their day classes. Aside from the safety of the school, UNG has many wonderful professors on staff. Each department has at least two amazing professors which you can look to for information, which of the two is up for you to find out."
Sophomore,5,"University of North Georgia offers an excellent education, regardless of major and has plenty of extra activities, clubs and sports to participate in so you get that college experience. Being that it is a university on the smaller side, there is a stronger sense of community and people get along well with one another. The dorms are a decent size and the food is good as well, with other restaurant choices to choose from too. This is honestly better than I would have imagined. Not a lot of people have heard of North Georgia but it sure deserves more spotlight."
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school! They offer a lot of helpful resources, the staff is knowledgeable, the students are respectful, the campus is situated in the beautiful north Georgia mountains. It's right in downtown Dahlonega, which has quite a few family owned shops and restaurants. The college campus is located very close to a lot of beautiful hikes. What more could you want!"
Freshman,5,The scenery is breathtaking and everyone is so welcoming. Wouldn't want to spend my four years anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"UNG is popular because it's a small town atmosphere that transfers into classes. Each class is small, the campus is extremely safe at any point of day or night, it's highly rated and it's extremely inexpensive."
Junior,5,"GREAT UNIVERSITY! WHAT IN LOVE THE MOST IS THE CLASSROOM SIZES, PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO BE IN A SMALLER CLASSROOM."
Freshman,5,"When I went to go visit University of North Georgia, I had an amazing experience. Everyone was so friendly and it was a great atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at this college is extremely friendly as well as helpful! I am a very sheltered child, so when my parents found out that their only child would be moving an hour and a half away from home they were certainly skeptical. However, the visitation to the campus put them at ease very quickly. I have never toured a safer campus or college town for that matter. I am extremely excited to begin my new life in the town of Dahlonega; GO NIGHTHAWKS!!"
Freshman,5,"People on campus are always very polite if you are having trouble with anything.UNG has ramps and elevators if you are handicap-able.Professor’s are very caring/willing to meet outside of class if you are struggling.Financial Aid can email you scholarship opportunities if Student loans aren’t for you.Counselors are friendly/non judgemental if you’re not sure what you want to major in.They suggest a test that can help lead you to ideas that might interest you.Student activities are posted around school/through emails so you are always informed about, a free movie, job opportunities, clubs, & performances.The library is a great place to study/work on group projects because if you are easily distracted they have “study rooms”. These rooms are quiet, have a white board and a computer.Downtown Dahlonega is walking distance from campus so everything is close by.But if you need transportation due to health restrictions or your just tired from walking, UNG does offer a busing system."
Alum,5,The school is great with helping individuals find jobs in their career path straight out of school. They have huge amounts of diversity on every campus. Professors helps as much as possible with online and phone help.
Freshman,5,"I like the campus and the atmosphere overall. Every time I've been on campus, others are very nice and always willing to help if you ever get lost."
Freshman,5,I can't think of a better school to attend. It is truly amazing and I am awed at the atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone searching for a small town yet invigorating campus! Go Nighthawks!
Freshman,5,"The University of North Georgia has amazing professors who cares about their students and their education. The professors are always willing to take the time to explain a subject until every student understands. Not only does the University of North Georgia provides extra credit opportunities to improve your overall grade, but also provides an ample of resources  where no student should  fear falling behind. I love attending a large diverse family oriented university who cares about the success of students.  Since attending college, I am convinced that the University of North Georgia provides a good quality education that is a doorway to our future."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the University of North Georgia. Not only is the location and campus beautiful, but the staff and faculty are all caring and striving to help students succeed however possible. There are a ton of ways to get involved with various clubs and organizations, and this comes in handy when you want to make new friends and relax from academics. Classes are rigorous but professors are always more than willing to help students understand class topics. Additionally, there are plenty of resources to get academic help through departments and libraries. Lastly, the University of North Georgia is one of the safest campuses in the country which is definitely appreciated when you have a class that ends late."
Niche User,5,"I had a great time at this school! The staff is very kind and welcoming, students are very friendly and very happy to help me adjust to the school. Can't say anything bad about UNG"
Freshman,5,"I am currently in my second semester here at University of North Georgia. Overall i have had an enjoyable experience and the education here is so worth it. I'm pursuing digital arts and I have grown my portfolio so much over the 2 semesters I have been here. Also student life is fantastic. I'm involved on campus so I have plenty of opportunities to meet new people and enjoy taking a break from the books every once in a while. If you make the effort to go out, there are people all around to help you succeed."
Niche User,5,I Dual Enroll at the University of north Georgia and it is an incredible experience. I have met my best friends here and am on track to receive my associates degree at a very minimal cost to myself and my family.
Niche User,5,"On my visit to UNG, any questions that I asked was answered quickly and clearly. I got so see a multitude of that are available for students from the different styles of dorm rooms to the rich history of the campus."
Alum,5,"UNG was my home away from home. Entering each new semester gave me the same uncertain excitement I had as a kid. New school clothes and pencil pouches- just as ready to make new friends. The professors felt like family, and bestowed their knowledge on us like we were their equals most days. I often miss it and long for the same UNG relationships in my work environments. I miss the mentors and the the overall atmosphere of learning about the world within the safety of UNG walls. To be honest, my favorite place will always be the weeping willow in front of the library at the Dahlonega campus. Not much since has compared to studying beneath that tree during the fall. The University of North Georgia will always be a warm invitation to those who visit, and an old friend to those who decide to stay. I’m glad to be an old friend to UNG."
Freshman,5,"This is only my first semester here, but I love the campus, the activities, the professors, and all of the assistance that they offer in every aspect."
Freshman,5,I'm a senior in high school. I've been looking for colleges in my major and I was happy to see that the University of North Georgia had my major.
Sophomore,5,UNG is an absolute amazing college. It is a hidden gym in the North Georgia mountains with deep history and traditiins. The faculty and staff are extremely helpful and also not to mention I have so much financial aid... I am getting paid to go to school! I am a cadet and can proudly say I am hands-down in the best military program in the nation. Many opportunities to get involved and have fun on campus. Only con is that the campus is struggling supporting such a large student body. There is no place I'd rather be!
Sophomore,5,University of North Georgia is a great welcoming environment! Each student and member of faculty is always inclined to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed going to University of North Georgia because it has a beautiful location up in Dahlonega. There are multiple hiking sites, and outdoor actives for people who like to connect to the nature. The student life is amazing there are always events going on. Something I would like to change is the diversity of this school. There aren't a lot of different ethnicity within our school."
Sophomore,5,"UNG is the most conservative school in Georgia, which I really love. If you are not a ""ever weekend party person"" this is the school for you! This is a very small school, and a very safe city. I 10/10 recommend UNG with its great professors, great food, and wonderful student life!"
Freshman,5,It is an amazing place to live and learn. I enjoyed the cultural diversity and learned about different religions. The language program is wonderful.
Sophomore,5,"The University of North Georgia is my home. The town, the campus, the students, everything here is unique. I've told seniors trying to pick their school to take into consideration when choosing. Coming from a small high school, I didn't want to jump head first into a school with lecture halls the size of my gym back home. UNG is perfect because it's big enough to meet someone new and get involved with something new everyday, but small enough to feel like you're not just another student. I've met my life long friends here, got involved in many extra circulars, and had and amazing freshmen experience in the  classroom while doing so."
Sophomore,5,"I love the college! I'm a sophomore now and I am extremely happy here. The professors are friendly, I've made many friends, and I would never transfer."
Freshman,5,university of north Georgia is a very beautiful and safe campus. I love how it has 5 campuses around north Georgia. UNG is a good college and it is close to my home.
Freshman,5,I love UNG. The campus is beautiful. The staff is amazing and I couldn't wish for a better college experience.
Sophomore,5,"My experience here at UNG has been all I could've ever imagined. The people here are so welcoming and wonderful, and I feel accepted. Everyone is willing to help with anything and everything, and that's the best part of Dahlonega."
Junior,5,"I liked how everyone on campus is really friendly, and I like being at a military college. The party scene isn't that big, but UNG is located at the foothills of the Appalachian mountains, so there is a lot of hiking trails and rock climbing routes nearby."
Senior,5,UNG is an academically competitive school with a beautiful campus and is more affordable than most colleges.
Freshman,5,North Georgia is in very beautiful Dahlonga and the scene is typical of a great college. The workers are nice and very helpful and the opportunities presented by the campus is fabulous.
Freshman,5,I am a Freshman currently in my second semester. I am also a Cadet in the Corps of Cadets. I have truly enjoyed my time so far at the Dahlonega campus. It is absolutely beautiful in the mountains. There are plenty of places of great places to study. The professors and advisors that I have had so far have been invested in my learning and helped me decide what I want to do with my future. I could not see myself at any other University.
Sophomore,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at this university for the past two years. My peers, college students enjoy all of the traditions and are striving to achieve a higher education. I am proud to say that i will graduate from the University of North Georgia with a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice."
Freshman,5,"The campus is a very nice and comfortable area with mountains all around. Being in a small town in the mountains the gives the campus multiple options for off campus activities, whether it be for college or personal recreation. The food at on the campus is also delicious, and they even have an area where the cooks can make a special plate for you if you desire. All the students and surrounding residents are extremely friendly, and rarely are unfriendly. The professors are also very helpful and know what they are doing. I went to the campus for a short time and had a few classes. I loved both my biology and Russian teachers as they were both a great help in my learning experience."
Niche User,5,UNG is a great pace to work with a great learning environment and will be a very beneficial place to get hands on experience while studying in school and achieving your degree.
Niche User,5,"The campus is very welcoming and neat. The students are all very nice and will help you if you're lost. It is in a cute mountain town with restaurants and shops throughout. It is safe and comfortable. Also, it is fairly cheap to attend but had outstanding educators. Go Nighthawks!!"
Sophomore,5,I love the mountains surrounding the campus! I play baseball and the family I have created with the team has helped me to feel like UNG is now my home. The campus isn't spread out so it's easy to get to class. There's plenty of activities to do around campus and if you like to exercise there's plenty of ways to keep in shape up here!
Sophomore,5,"The staff here is like family! Everyone is so nice and helpful, and I would not have wanted to spend these past couple years anywhere else!"
Niche User,5,"I attended the Oconee campus, and it was a wonderful, work friendly, environment. The community life was great, and although it was small, that was far from a deterrent. In fact, the small campus made it easy to meet new people, especially since everyone seemed very friendly."
Freshman,5,The College is great! Great location and the campus is beautiful. The teachers  are good and the classes aren't packed with students. Which means that you can get to know your teacher.
Freshman,5,I love how friendly and nice the staff is. Classes are not to difficult but still challenging. Most of the students are welcoming and will talk to anyone.
Alum,5,"I loved going here.  It is definitely a ""small"" college town, but it is growing up quickly.  When I went here, it was North GA College and State University (NGCSU).  I loved how close it was to home, how easy it was to make friends, and how friendly everyone was.  While I was here, there was no football team - and I don't think that has changed, but Spring and Fall Jam as well as the basketball games were always a huge hit.  With it being a military college, I always felt safe    With regard to the party scene, it's a small school in North Georgia - but if you know the right people, there is always a good time to be had."
Sophomore,5,SMALL CAMPUS WITH A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE IN TUTORING AND ADVISING. TEACHERS CARE AND ARE ACCESIBLE TO REACH DURING OFFICE HOURS. CLASS SIZES ARE SMALL AND NOT OVERWHELMING.
Freshman,5,Wonderful campus full of helpful people! They will accommodate almost any need!  They are a relatively affordable school and they offer many classes for almost any student to get the degree they desire. I'm grateful to be able to attend the University of North Georgia.
Niche User,5,I went on a college trip out there and I really enjoyed it . It was really easy and everyone out there liked me and I didn't feel like I was out cast. I feel I could go to this school and have a great time even though it's so fair from home. I would love to work here it's just a easy going school and you can always have a good time. This school is pretty good and really easy going you don't have any hard time finding friends. The campus is really small compared to all the other schools I been looking at. Though I feel I could only have a couple of friends do to how many people go to this school .
Sophomore,5,I love the beautiful campus in the mountains. The campus is not too big and not too small. It is a pretty conservative school; I am not into the big party scene but there are active sororities and clubs on campus and intramural sports.
Freshman,4,"I really like the community at North Georgia, and that everyone you meet is pretty nice and welcoming. The restaurants and coffee options on campus are good, but the dining hall is quite the opposite. You never really get tired of the beautiful mountainous scenery, and the city of Dahlonega is super cute."
Freshman,4,"I like the area and it's very diverse, there's a lot of new people to meet and the campus life is great."
Freshman,4,Online experience has been pretty good. The professors really try their best to work with you and make the transition as easy as possible.
Freshman,4,"It has been smooth however there are a few issues with learning quality. Overall, it is good despite the pandemic."
Freshman,4,"The staff is very willing to help you reach your goals. However, there is a lot of miscommunication and slip-ups that occur causing confusion."
Sophomore,4,I really like that the teachers are there to help and that they will almost go out of their way for the students. The reason a four and not five star is because of the many unneeded classes that have to be taken.
Junior,4,"The school itself has a beautiful campus! There is not much to do in Dahlonega specifically and also provides a workout walking around campus due to the hills. I have not had many professors that I did not like! Overall, great school!"
Senior,4,The campus is a pretty good size so it's not a hassle to walk around. The teachers seem to enjoy their job and the campus is very nice.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are more independent than in-person classes, so you have to be able to set a schedule for yourself on when you'll complete tasks for the class. Professors do a great job at responding to questions in a timely manner."
Junior,4,"Most of the classes that are offered at UNG also have an online portion, usually on D2L or eCore. It depends on what classes you are taking, be sure to look on banner before you register if you have a merged class. Overall, D2L is used by most professors or they are on “shared class files”. D2L is one of the most helpful tools if one’s professor does choose to use it. Overall, online learning at the university is a generally positive experience for most students."
Niche User,4,I will be taking online classes for healthcare informatics and so fare the admissions process has all been online. I have enjoyed it so far.
Niche User,4,Im a returning Adult student and they made the application process very easy and accepted transfer credits from 10 years ago.
Sophomore,4,"Going online was definitely an adjustment for both students and staff, but the professors do care and work hard to make sure all information was given-at least for my professors in general. The president of the University emailed frequently with updates and kept everyone in track too."
Sophomore,4,I like that the classes are smaller and you can get to know your professors as well as the other students in your classes and around campus.
Alum,4,I had a wonderful experience in the ELE/SPED program. It gave me years of experience within the schools and made me feel very prepared for my future career!
Sophomore,4,"Very personal education experience, not good at handling pandemics. Professors are great educators and are well versed in their fields."
Junior,4,UNG is a wonderful smaller university. Their nursing program is fantastic and the atmosphere of the college itself is unmatched. The student body genuinely cares for one another and are actively involved in their university. Their greek life is unlike any other and filled with motivated young people that have nothing but good intent.
Niche User,4,It is a very friendly school. The professors are really good. They have a lot of opportunities for the students.
Freshman,4,"Pretty new to the area but the school has amazing programs that help students do as much as they are willing by giving them endless opportunities. Obviously not the same as bigger universities but alike to give you the same result if actually done right. Great school, interested to see what it has in store for me."
Junior,4,"The community of clubs and activities is so much more than from my high school. Most professors are very nice and wiling to teach,grow, and help students. Campus is amazingly beautiful."
Senior,4,"The campus of the University of North Georgia is what was the biggest initial draw for me. The beautiful scenery coupled with a nice size was a big plus, and when I realized the attention and care that the university had I was sold. The professors are engaging and intentional, and the system as a whole is designed to help students succeed."
Freshman,4,I have had very caring and good teachers so far. I love the town and the atmosphere and everything about it.
Niche User,4,University of North Georgia is an excellent college for a college education or for dual enrollment. It is a very welcoming community.
Sophomore,4,I like how UNG is a smaller school so the class size is smaller which allows for more one on one time with the professors.  The one thing that I hear students would like to change about the school the most is the dining hall and the quality of the food that they serve
Sophomore,4,"Decent enough college. More of a relaxing college, purely because of scenery, but work can get stressful. Staff is nice."
Sophomore,4,The best thing about UNG is the small class sizes. The professors know your name and are willing to help in their convenient office hours.
Sophomore,4,The music professors at the Gainesville campus are very splendid. They provide you with assistance and people are welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"The University of North Georgia has a great community of professors, students and faculty. The Dahlonega campus is the best campus. While the other campuses offer many things most of the action at UNG takes place in Dahlonega."
Sophomore,4,Becoming a new student at UNG has been easy. The staff and faculty are very helpful. There are so many great tools online to help me get started right.
Junior,4,"I have loved every bit of my time at UNG! The Dahlonega campus is beautiful and rewarding in itself! The professors are loving, tending, but tough, and very encouraging. I love the small town life and beauty of the town. This school has been so impactful on my academic growth and growth as an adult. I feel the quality of my education and the love I have for this school is so much more than I ever expected when choosing an undergraduate program. The Biology department is composed of a well organized and knowledgable team of professors that truly care about student's learning."
Junior,4,The University of North Georgia has been my number one option for schooling in GA once I weighed their pricing against similar programs in the state.
Sophomore,4,"I love it at UNG. I love the small town feel and the beautiful scenery, it's honestly the perfect home away from home. I have had good experiences with most of the professors and the advisers have been so kind and patient with me when I'm a wreck because I changed my major for the third time. Although I'm transferring to a different school to pursue a major that UNG doesn't offer, I'm very thankful for the guidance I've been given to really find out what I'm passionate about. Wish I didn't have to go!"
Niche User,4,"The campus of North Georgia is a very beautiful campus, the dorms  were nice and clean as well.  the cafeteria had a wide variety of food, along with a great view."
Freshman,4,"The professors I've met there are not all kind, but are strict and really care about their students and will give them the tools to pass the class, all they have to do is use them. There's also many activities and clubs to be a part of with thousands of students to meet and interact with. The only change I would like to see are the scholarship opportunities they present to students coming into their college be extended so that more will have a chance to apply to them. Besides that, an opportunity to take extra classes or work during a break or vacation to lessen the load during the regular school year would be amazing."
Freshman,4,The University of North Georgia is a beautiful and truly respectful campus. The faculty and staff are more than happy to help their students or prospective students in any possible way they can. This college has an amazing campus cafeteria and gym facilities.
Sophomore,4,"The university of North Georgia at Dahlonega is one of the most gorgeous campuses I have ever seen. Weather you are a book worm that stays in or a social butterfly looking for new friends, Dahlonega has plenty to offer any and all students. The small city of Dahlonega makes students feel safe and at home. Along with the tight knit community the city of Dahlonega respects and cares for the students that are there regardless of time of year."
Freshman,4,"The university of North Georgia has been an incredible school, in my experience. It's small enough to not be overwhelming, but still big enough to allow for a very diverse group of students. Plus, there are so many resources available, that I never had any excuse to do anything but succeed. Need some extra help with one of your classes? UNG has study labs for all of the core subjects. Having trouble budgeting? There's a money management center on campus that can help you figure out the most efficient way for you to budget for your lifestyle. Need a place to sit and relax, maybe study a bit, but find sitting in the lunchroom or library to be uncomfortable? The multicultural student affairs department has a safe room in the student center that's a great place to take a load off where you can feel completely at ease. And of course, I should note that it's very affordable. It really is a wonderful college, and I'm very proud to be a student there!"
Sophomore,4,"I am so happy that I chose the University of North Georgia! As a freshman, I was randomly matched with 3 roommates - no one believes me when I say that we are all now best friends! I have had positive experiences with everyone I met on campus, including professors, and my classes are engaging. If we could improve in one area, it would be diversity. However, with the growing numbers, I think this won't be an issue soon!"
Sophomore,4,great campus! The teachers are great and housing is amazing. friendly people with an even friendlier little town close by. the military culture is weird for some people but it never gets in the way of anything and the cadets are mostly friendly.
Freshman,4,"The University of North Georgia has a beautiful campus and a wonderful military program. There are countless offices established for the sole purpose of helping students. There is a wide variety of Residence Halls to stay in, each different from the last. 
Though this is great, it would be fantastic if the dorms were not quite so cramped."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled in he Army ROTC program and just completely my first year. Overall the ROTC itself is a tough program but really does build character and self discipline, which can also be applied academically. It helps one really have the need to manage time between training, academics, and one's free time. The University of North Georgia Senior Military College enables those, who want to potentially be an Army Officer, to reach their goals. Such as, graduating and entering the U.S Army as a second lieutenant. All the training and summer camps really prepare for those who strive for the Military life. Academically, I can say that the University of North Georgia really helps and guides  each individual into the career path they are striving for."
Sophomore,4,"UNG is a beautiful campus with very good academics at a very good price. There is not much around, but it is still beautiful."
Freshman,4,"Some professors are fantastic, but others clearly do not understand college students. I had a calculus professor with ridiculous expectations, simply because they could not understand that college students taking calculus for the first time simply could not go at the pace that they could and consequently struggled greatly in that class. Others clearly do not know how to handle a class, giving hardly any grades and then getting upset when nobody did the weekly reading that had absolutely no impact on their grade."
Sophomore,4,"I love UNG. The teachers are helpful, the campus is beautiful, the dorms are nice. It’s surrounded by mountains, with great hiking super close. There’s lots of clubs and student activities to get involved in. The weekends can be boring because there isn’t much to do if you stay on campus, but downtown dahlonega has lots of good restaurants and shops."
Freshman,4,I am currently at the Oconee campus of the University of North Georgia. I enjoy the smaller classrooms that come with being at a small campus but the student presence is lacking. There is little cohesion between students and faculty.
Niche User,4,It was a very good experience coming in as a dual enrollment student. Being able to take harder courses that count for college credit my senior year of high school was amazing.
Freshman,4,"The University of North Georgia is an amazing school! I am so proud to be apart of it. The school is extremely safe. The school is also one of the most beautiful schools to attend. Everyone here makes you feel at home it does not make you feel like your less than anyone else which is great. It is a challenging school but the professors help as much as they possibly can. Overall, I am truly grateful to be apart of a community that is also my college."
Junior,4,The teachers are great. The facilities are amazing and the campus is gorgeous. The Intramurals are very competitive and diverse.
Freshman,4,"So far with my experience at North Georgia, I love the school and campus. I love the town of Dahlonega. It is my home now, and I couldn't have chosen a better home. As far as professors go, I've already had my share of good and bad ones. I've had professors rated 2 stars who could care less, they are just there for the paycheck. I've also had great professors that have done all they could to help and give advice, and actually care. The great professors is what makes it worth dealing with not good ones every so often."
Junior,4,"Overall, UNG is a great school with an unlimited about of options. UNG offers unique majors, influential clubs, and much more. UNG has a handful of campuses, but Dahlonega has to be the best. The views are phenomenal, the students and professors are amazing, and it is overall a very well rounded college."
Junior,4,"It just depends on what ti e of school you are wanting to go to. This is a smaller school in my opinion, but I loved my Professors and classmates."
Freshman,4,"I think the campus and area around it are absolutely beautiful. Full of mountains, trees, and waterfalls. Would highly recommend to people who enjoy nature."
Junior,4,"I attended North Georgia from 2013-2014 and from 2016 until now. The professors are my favorite thing about this school, and just after them comes the beautiful campus. It seems like most of the professors who are older have actually worked in their field in other places and have in their age decided to move to  quiet Dahlonega to teach. They are so knowledgeable! I also like the military school idea and the traditions that come with that that are held onto. The campus has a drill field in the middle and a tower covered in Dahlonega-sourced gold. My only complaint is the type of people who attend. It seems like there are snobby people, cadets, and estranged people with not much in between."
Freshman,4,This University has been a great experience for me! I love the soze of the campus and the location! Easy to make friends!
Freshman,4,"Currently a 2nd semester Freshman at UNG. The campus life is pretty good with lots of student events and clubs. Dining hall has been improving and recently added new options for those with restricted diets. Some departments, such as Financial Aid, aren’t very helpful so you have to figure stuff out yourself. Website needs to be updated as a lot of information is outdated or hard to find. Teachers are great and seem to enjoy their jobs. Older buildings are kept in good shape and there are many new modern buildings and classrooms."
Niche User,4,"I chose to Dual Enroll my senior year, and it was the best decision. I have taken 2-3 classes a semester to allow myself to ease into the college experience. The campus is gorgeous and the school is very good. It is easy to find classes and make friends."
Sophomore,4,"University of North Georgia is an excellent college, even if you only go there for general education courses. Located in Dahlonega, mostly everything is in walking distance from campus. The professors are really nice and work with you on office hours. One thing I was not fond of was the firing of the cannon, even though it is tradition on the campus."
Junior,4,"This university offers a small town feel with adventure and big city life just around the corner. This small mountain town offers a close sense of community and connection. The professors want to help you learn and succeed. The other staff wants the best for you as well, no question is a dumb question for them. The people that sit around you in the classroom or on the bench or in an auditorium are kind and genuine. This is like an other University."
Junior,4,"I love the Georgia mountains, so when I was accepted to the University of North Georgia I was happy. The campus is great, but there needs to be improvement in food services.  Overall, I love my college"
Junior,4,"The school has a weird but great culture. It is a combination of a senior Military college with a large civilian population that is not found anywhere else in the State or the country. This creates a unique dynamic of learning to live and communicating with people of different interest, beliefs, and ways of life, as well as an awesome way to gain valuable Leadership experience that you will not find anywhere else."
Freshman,2,"All of my professors have been great, but there is little to no student life and i haven’t met anyone on campus yet."
Sophomore,2,It was decent until the Covid-19 issues. It has not been the same since. Advisors and professors do not seem to care much to help.
Sophomore,2,My online learning experience was poor. Most of my professors online were unable to communicate with me.
Junior,2,Professors are really nice but the whole campus is so unorganized its ridiculous. None of the departments talk with each. The people at financial aid are so rude and laughed at me right to my face when they refused to help me with a system glitch that created a hold on my account that no one would help me with. The people at the bookstore are completely clueless and won't answer any questions you have. They also almost sold me the wrong book that they had selected for me based off my class list.
Niche User,2,"I liked that the class sizes were small and I felt that I got the chance to get more one on one help from my professors. I feel that they could definitely offer more degrees at the Oconee campus  though. Also the financial aid department could really use some work. Multiple semesters they would say that I was on academic probation, even though I was't. They would take away my grants, scholarships, and my option to take out loans. They would tell me only a few weeks before classes started that I still owed tuition and that I would be dropped from my classes. I would try to tell them that I should not be on academic probation and they would tell me that I needed to file an appeal and that they would refund my money in a few months. I ended up paying my tuition out of pocket three semesters in a row."
Sophomore,2,"The art program was criminal. They stole money from students claiming they would give you credit for AP art classes, but when you show up to the school, already enrolled, the President of the art department says, ""Sorry, we are in the process of transitioning to not giving credit for those courses. So you have to throw away all the hard work you did in high school and take the same basic art courses as everyone else.""

This school is not good for artists who truly want to pursue a career in the arts world. Some of the professors were great, and I will truly remember them. However, a lot of the professors were unqualified for their jobs. I am only speaking for the art department, I do not know about other majors at this school. Hopefully they are better than the art department.

I will say that UNG saved me a lot of money as I now plan on attending a more qualified, yet costly, school to finish my degree. I am very grateful for that."
Sophomore,2,"The academics at UNG are better than what I expected, and I have loved most of my professors. The most important thing you need to know about UNG is that it is a commuter school. 2/3 of my friends either commute every day or go home on the weekends. Do not go here if you plan on staying on campus most weekends, because there is NOTHING to do."
College Junior,2,"Greek housing is not available, so I believe that hinders people from wanting to join. Other than that, there are almost always Greek activities going on around campus."
College Senior,2,Sports are not really big and you hardly hear about them.
College Senior,2,Not really a fan. See it as buying your friends.
College Freshman,2,There's only one bar in the town and there's no way you could get in underage. Campus is a little too strict about this stuff. They never look the other way. Many people head to Athens for the weekends.
College Freshman,2,There are barely any parties. Most are quickly shut down.
College Freshman,2,"I was originally drawn to this school because of the mountains and I enjoy hiking/being in nature. There are tons of outdoor activities and the sunset is gorgeous each night. This school is great if you learn best when your core ideals aren't challenged. It's definitely the school to go to if you're uncomfortable with diversity because there are hardly any non-white people on campus. When I pictured college, I saw a place full of diversity where new ideas/progressiveness was encouraged. No one seems up-to-date with politics, the arts, or the world at large. Students are living in privileged bubbles. It seems like no one is here to learn. In class, many students are on their phones for the entire hour. I do really like the professors here and their lessons are interesting and engaging. Most classes are easy A's if you study."
College Freshman,2,Takes a lot of work and time to even get in to talk to anyone about financial aid.
College Student,2,There are new apartments being built now. All other town homes and apartments are owned by one lady and her business partner.
College Student,2,"DO. IT. WAY. EARLY. If you need help with, the financial aid office takes FOREVER and you probably won't get the help you need in time... even if you start ""on time""."
College Sophomore,2,Some employees are rude and prices are outrageous.
College Sophomore,2,The university is not your average fun universities. We have parties but they're mostly with sororities and frats and they aren't too prevalent or wildly fun. This is UNG.
College Sophomore,2,WAY TOO STRICT if you ask me. But this is a more conservative school so it's pretty boring. You need a balance between fun and strictness. If you drink off campus you can't return unless no you're completely sober. Also when attendance is mandatory it makes it seem more like high school. College should be more lenient. We are adults we should be able to make our own decisions responsibly. But if we are restricted and coddled with rules...
College Sophomore,2,Chow is just bad. Rarely do they have any decent food. Sometimes they water down the juice and sodas. Pizza and salad and PBJ are your best options most of the time. Also for the amount of money you pay... let's just say $15 a meal is not reasonable in the least. You can use your dining dollars to eat at other eateries around UNG. So thank goodness for that. But you'll run out pretty fast.
College Freshman,2,There really is not much nightlife here. You have to make your own fun and try hard to find plans
College Freshman,2,I wish there was more scholarships available. Its difficult to find any that apply to me and my situation.
College Sophomore,2,Takes forever to hear anything back from any of the financial aid people. And it's always busy in the office because they are poorly staffed.
College Sophomore,2,"The only reason I'm rating the food as ""bad"" instead of ""the worst"" is because of the food they serve in Hoag. Hoag is a pretty decent place to eat, but you still have to use your dining dollars, which sucks because you don't really get a lot of them.

Also, I haaaate Chow. After going to UMass and seeing how fantastic their dining program is, it's really hard to have any sort of respect for Chow."
College Sophomore,2,"It's very difficult to get housing, and the regular dorms are old. The beds were all made in the 50s. They're very small. Donovan had a mold problem. The Suites are nice, but Lewis/Donovan are pretty low-quality."
College Freshman,2,"Getting some scholarships are easy but, when trying to receive the Pell grant it is a headache. I was told that I am able to receive the grant, so we put in the paperwork which was a hassle because they kept giving me the wrong information. Then I find out that I can't get the grant because they didn't see a part of the grant."
College Sophomore,2,Not a big party school.
College Junior,2,One family owns most of the rental property.  It's limited and not the best.  I feel safe living off campus b/c it's all college kids.
College Junior,2,"1 freakin lady owns 90% of it....lookin at you Roberta Green... and she couldnt care less about the condition of her apartments or the tenents. Luckily i found a place with one of the few non roberta places. 

Its ok, BUT the school accepts TOO DANG MANY students and so there are very few places availiable and there is NEVER any parking."
College Junior,2,"There were a handful of restaurants close by, but they were variations of the same thing. Prices might not be bad if it weren't for the college budget"
College Junior,2,"There are no greek organizations at the Oconee branch of North Georgia, but can be found instead at the Dahlonega Campus."
College Sophomore,2,The school is so cheap. Youonly get approved for loans unless you are dirt poor.
College Freshman,2,Greek students are generally more snobbish toward those that don't participate in Greek life.
College Senior,2,"Parking services is ridiculously annoying. As previously mentioned, I should not be punished for not finding parking spots that I paid for!"
College Senior,2,Only thing they have is lame a** Johnny B's and some tavern.
College Junior,2,When it is windy and cold you feel like you are going to die. lol
College Junior,2,You have to drive elsewhere if you want to party. Atlanta and Athens however are pretty close so you can always travel a bit and party.
College Freshman,2,"I like living on campus because I am close to the amenities and my classes. The dorms themselves are filthy, old, and very small; like living in a closet. Above I rated the strictness as very poor because it is WAY too strict. I am in college now, yet I feel like I'm living with my parents. Visitng hours is completely unreasonable and the gender restrictions are extremely tedious."
College Freshman,2,"It's easy to get into; however, it is known as EASY for another reason. The girls are either promiscuous or very socially awkward. The greek life isn't as popular here as it is at more ivy league colleges."
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do unless you want to drive 20 miles to go somewhere. Students without cars have it the worst cause they are stuck in the dorms.
College Student,2,"Snow will cause entire weeks of no school because it is impossible for commuters to get to campus, since campus is located on a mountain."
College Student,2,Most people are the same and international students tend not to mingle too much with other students making for very little diversity within the student body.
College Student,2,"If you are not involved in Greek activities, there is almost no nightlife. Every now and then the school will organize fun things but even then, the events are not very popular. If you are not on the in, you won't hear about private parties either. Most people leave campus on the weekend too."
College Student,2,"It's necessary to have a car because there is no public transportation whatsoever. Even though on campus everything is walking distance and many restaurants are too, one can't get to a grocery store or Walmart without a car."
College Senior,2,We have very little campus police presence except for parking.
College Senior,2,Not much around for a night life.
College Junior,2,We are North so we get lots of snow delays in Jan.
College Junior,2,It's a commuter school so not many sports go on.
College Freshman,2,There's really not much to do off campus without money as Dahlonega is a small and remote area.
College Sophomore,2,The school is very difficult to work with. They expect you to know how to do everything without giving you any information. There are ridiculous amounts of doctors' notes needed for the disability services. The honors program has starting having a good bit of outside requirements.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few restaurants within a few minutes of campus.
College Sophomore,2,"If you commute, you will want to make sure you get here early, because it may take you some time to find a space, depending on when and where you are trying to park."
College Freshman,2,It's really cold. Most of the housing is just close enough to the classrooms to make driving unnecessary so you usually walk to classes. If you have a problem with walking or riding a bike in the cold I don't advise it.
College Freshman,2,"They keep building new dorms and not fixing the bad classrooms (Dunlap Hall, anyone?)"
College Freshman,2,"It's cold starting in November and rains a lot. The spring and summer are nice, though."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't one, even though they charge us for it in our fees. "
College Student,2,Ehh. Pretty much out in the country with alot of old people. So.. definitely not UGA.
College Student,2,"Solely in terms of internships and what not, for now its pretty dismal like I said. But that is okay for now."
College Student,2,Its mainly a military academy. No one has time for that stupid s***.
College Junior,2,"Its bad, but is slowly getting better! I have learned to just come to school earlier!"
Sophomore,1,I took all of mine online this past semester due to covid and my summer classes. There is no instruction at all for my summer classes. I have to teach myself and the professors do not really seem to care.
Sophomore,1,"This school is a joke. When I went to orientation everyone there preached about how they had all these things to help you. Then when you actually get in they could care less. The faculty is so disorganised and doesn’t care. Especially if you need any kind of financial aid. Every semester I have at least one problem from them, and they would rather insult you than actually help. As a student having to pay every little cost for myself it is infuriating at their lack of empathy. Scholarships are not easy to get for this college either. If you need aid be prepared to deal with a lot of headache."
Senior,1,"This university does not care whatsoever for its students. The advisors don’t know anything about required classes. I have been misled by them on several occasions, from taking classes I didn’t even need to not knowing I needed certain classes to graduate. I sent in my plan of study to get signed off by the registrars office (which went through three different departments by the way). They signed it saying I was good to graduate and then I get an email from them saying that they over looked it and I lacked one credit hour from being able to graduate. The faculty is extremely unhelpful and afloof. And I feel like I have not benefited the slightest from nearly six years of college education."
Alum,1,"Before applying to the Physical Therapy program, I would advise that you get a lawyer! This program has collapsed since the leave of 6 professors in the time frame of only 2 years. This is a reflection on the poor leadership skills of the department as a whole! This program no longer practices the core values of the profession, especially empathy. Their only motivation is to target students to weed out. If you are considered a minority, forget even applying here because you will be weeded out. Again, if you chose to still apply and attend this program, get a lawyer!!! You will need it! If you're a good ass kisser and don't question any authority, then you shouldn't even be choosing this profession, but you'll do well in the program."
College Freshman,1,"If you're white, Christian, and conservative and you don't want to have your beliefs challenged, this is the school for you. Insane majority of students here are white, those that aren't are mostly exchange students. Campus is very conservative. Spoken to some students who don't believe interracial marriage is natural. Most students are relatively accepting of gay people, but mostly only in theory."
College Student,1,"Rare. Not many bars, not a ""downtown scene"""
College Sophomore,1,Only one landlord owns off campus housing..BAD.
College Junior,1,This is an incredibly strict campus with some ludicrously invasive policies (i.e. freshman curfew). Get off campus ASAP.
College Junior,1,"I came to school to learn, not party. I have never and will never go to a ""party""."
College Junior,1,"Dont like or care about the athletics. I came to school to learn, not play ball games."
College Junior,1,"ABSOLUTELY HATE THE GREEK FACTION. they are the majority in SGA and make decisions based off of what appeals to greek life rather than to the populace. MANY MANY MANY MANY non-greeks are still EXTREMELY upset at the 2 fields in front of the library. no matter what we said or did about the situation though, they FLAT OUT SAID that it was happening whether or not we wanted it. so our opinion did not matter at all. they post their propoganda in every hangout location and post themselves in front of HOAG cat calling everyone to come buy whatever it is their selling. They get the good bids for community services, such as gold rush, and are generally unpleasant to be around in class or out of class."
College Junior,1,There is no campus housing available.
College Junior,1,"Our school will usually send out emails about any promotions going on with student leasing nearby. Again, the remoteness of the campus is nice but also slightly frustrating since majority of housing is located in the next county (Athens). Also, some new developments are offering shuttle service to the campus- which is nice. But more options would make living closer (accessibility) tremendously easier."
College Junior,1,"I applied for aid, but I did not receive any help. My family then struggled to pay for my education."
College Freshman,1,"This campus has the worst restrictions I've ever seen, even worse then living at home! Nothing is allowed, and for this reason alone I would transfer schools."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely no form on any type of transportation except for what the students bring with them. I for one have no car, and cannot get out of my dorm room unless I want to walk to the old antique shops just down the street (no)."
College Freshman,1,"Dining is really expensive and it is disgusting. Not worth a penny. ""Healthy"" is objective -- their idea of ""healthy"" is week-old iceberg lettuce and some canned salad sides."
College Junior,1,"There is no campus housing, though there are  a lot of affordable apartments close by!"
College Junior,1,"I kind of gave up! I wish i could do it inpendently, due to the fact that my parents info is unavaliable! I pay tuition by credit cards and tip money from my job! "
College Freshman,1,There is only one scholarship available for freshmen to apply for.
College Junior,1,"At the moment, the only nightlife we have is a two local bars. A plus is that they are walking distance if you live on campus!"
College Freshman,1,"Dahlonega is a small town and as a result there is not a lot of diversity. You do have people of different race, religion, and sexual orientation, but it is a white dominated school. The schol as a whole is very tolerant and I have never run into anyone who is offensive or vulgar."
College Sophomore,1,Not alot of diversity at all. I am one of the few handful of African Americans here and this school really does need to work on it's ethnic/racial diversity.
College Junior,1,The food in chow hall is sub-par at best and usually is very hard to stomach. There are limited choices on the food court and you do not get a lot of dining dollars with your relatively expensive meal plan to use at them. Honestly if you can afford to buy your own food you should just do that.
College Student,1,"The spots fill quickly even with a new parking deck. There are many faculty and staff spots that aren't often used, but they wont convert them to student parking."
College Junior,1,Chow hall itself is very crowded and not very good. Few options and cheaply made food for such an expensive dinning plan.
College Junior,1,Worst in State Probabaly – [Financial Aid] can't get anything right and there's always a problem on there part. I dread going there every time
College Senior,1,"Our school has been adding more dorms, but not any more parking. It is hard for the students to find appropriate spots that are close to where they need to be. Our professors also have a hard time finding parking spots. I personally don't have a car here, but if I did, it would be a nightmare."
College Freshman,1,"No Alcohol Allowed – This is a military college which does not allow alcohol on its campus. It is a dry campus. If you want to drink you can go to the local bar, but dont get caught leaving the bar as an underage drinker."
College Senior,1,"The people in the financial aid office are either rude or unhelpful. The school itself offers very little aid, and most of the time the ladies in the office only tell you that you can take out federal loans unless you are eligible for PELL. For those people that are middle class or just a little bit of trouble paying for school, the financial aid office is the biggest waste of time. Don't bother, find scholarships online or do your own research. Deal with this office as little as possible."
College Senior,1,"Diversity? Ha! I'm sure people would be willing to accept diversity if it existed here, well minus any left leaning politics or practices. There are a few number of minorities, almost to the point that you can be shocked to see them."
College Senior,1,Parking is terrible.  There are only a few parking lots with just about the same amount of faculty spots as student spots.  Parking deck is always full.
College Sophomore,1,"White Students Everywhere – The majority of the population at NGCSU are white middle class students from within a 50 mile radius of the school. The southern bible belt, white country pro-NRA influence that prevails gives the school a very conservative air, encouraged further by the military presence on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Run Down – The dorms are pretty run down, and generally smell horrible. They're priced ridiculously high for what they offer. The laundry facilities are always broken and far too small for how many students that they have crammed in the dorms."
College Sophomore,1,"Do You Want Overpriced or Papa Johns? There are two basic options of places to eat. On one hand, there's places like Papa Johns and Subway, and on the other, you have overpriced, mom and pop diners on the square that are very low on quality. It's a good idea to just make your food at home or at your dorm."
College Sophomore,1,"Well, at Least the Gym's Nice – North Georgia has a very nice, new athletic center... that is about the only good facility it has. The library is nice, but it doesn't have much in the way of variety. Campus activities are hardly publicized until the day of, if at all. No one makes use of the mass email system we have. The student center is run down, small and crowded. No one wants to hang out in it as there is nowhere to hang out in."
College Sophomore,1,"Bland Food in a Bland Town – The food is beyond horrible. I purchased a dining plan, and, two weeks later, I cancelled it. Greasy, bland, disgusting and monotonous are good words to describe all of the dining on campus. It's expensive, and, the sad thing is, you can get better, cheaper food at a Waffle House down the street. That is simply pathetic in my book."
College Sophomore,1,"The North Georgia Experience – I currently attend North Georgia College, and it is remote in the most complete sense of the word. The local attraction that the students can enjoy? The Wal-Mart across the street. Sure, there's the town square close by, but the stores close soon after classes let out. The college tries to make itself look like it's nestled in a small college town, but the residents of the town don't want it to become a college town. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my time here. The professors are average; the social experiences are almost nil. It's simply a bland place."
College Student,1,"The Nightlife in North Georgia College and State is non-existant. There is one bar and you can only get to it if you have a car. There is no underage nightlife either. Parties are far and few in between also, which makes it not as fun as I would like."
College Sophomore,1,"No Football Team – There is no football team. Do not let the Corp trick you into joining by saying that there is one (it has happened).  They cut the cross country and track team due to budget cuts which I think is total s***. Basketball is the big sport on campus, and both boys and girls are pretty good. Soccer is good and always fun to watch. GIRLS SOFTBALL IS THE BEST. I believe they won state champs in their 2010 season? I'm not sure, but they basically kick butt. Cheerleading, the girls only stay on for about one year, I hear the coach is horrible.  Baseball is pretty big, and the boys are very nice to look at. Not much of the school is athletic, which is nice because there are no douchey footall players. They are sadly replaced by the Corp of Cadets."

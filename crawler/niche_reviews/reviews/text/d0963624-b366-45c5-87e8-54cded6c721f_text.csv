Graduate Student,5,"My online experience with Goucher College has been optimal. I am a new graduate student of the Special Education Teaching Program. The counselors, billing and academic office has been very accommodating."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience has been very positive. The counselors, academic advisors, recruitment and financial aid office is efficient, timely, and very focused on making sure that I am fully set up for academic success. I have approximately 2 years to finish and am very grateful for the opportunity that has been presented at this present time to go to school. The staff has made sure that my process for registering for classes has been optimal."
Alum,5,"Goucher did not offer undergraduate online courses while I was a student there (class of 2009), as we did not have the need to resort to online learning."
Sophomore,5,"I love Goucher College! It is a very intimate school and the professors and staff genuinely want you to succeed. The classes are really small which, in my opinion, is the best way to get an education. The facilities are so nice! The dining hall is the best dining hall I have seen at any college and there is meal options for every dietary preference or restriction. I really have nothing bad to say about it!"
Sophomore,5,"Goucher College is a welcoming college which supports all students and their personal education goals. I was supported from the moment I was accepted to Goucher, through mentors and upperclassmen. While it is a small campus, you can be as involved as you want, and get to know as many people as you prefer. Goucher has been excellent for me and my transition to higher education and planning for my future."
Freshman,5,I really love goucher the environment is very welcoming. Food is amazing. The first year dorms are rlly up to date and homey. The professor go above and below for the students. If you want to have a well rounded education with a nice welcoming community this is the place you want to be at
Alum,5,"Goucher is a warm place with dedicated professors who love their work and aspire to inspire their students.  Unlike at many colleges, any research or writing the professors do is secondary to their role as teachers.

My dearest friends today are those I learned to know at Goucher.  My felllow students were hard working, interesting, intelligent people.

I am very grateful and proud to call Goucher my alma mater."
Senior,5,I like the fiversity at Goucher. The people here are really nice.They really and truly want you to succed at Goucher.
Freshman,5,Over the past few years Goucher has revitalized itself. The campus has new dorms and a new dinning hall. The culture has improved as well being more diverse in people and opinions. The clubs and extra curricular are truly spectacular and the best part of the college.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at Goucher, is very pleasing and successful. Dorms and campus scenery is amazing. Very safe campus. The staff there is incredible! Great school."
Graduate Student,5,I was recently accepted and have not attended yet but I have been impress d with the focus on diversity at Goucher as well as how attentive faculty and staff are!
Freshman,5,"I love the the Campus, it's beautiful.  I also love the fact the it has woods on one side and the mall on the other side. The campus is small so you know where everything is. You can connect more with your teachers since classes are also small."
Freshman,5,"Everyone in the admissions office was very kind and helpful. I attended a tour there and I got to see classrooms, students and meet a couple of professors. Besides getting a tour of the classrooms, I was also able to see the dorms for myself. within the dorms I was able to speak to current students and ask them questions about Goucher College."
Senior,5,"I love Goucher! The people are super nice and friendly. I love all the teachers. I live of campus and thus I have little to say about the for,s."
Sophomore,5,"I am originally from Rwanda. I came to the United States for secondary and post- secondary education. For the past year and half, my daily experience at Goucher (in terms of Academics and social life) has been proof of how worth it was to leave home (my family and my culture) for the sake of knowledge. I am much more eloquent, critical, and knowledgable regarding various subject matters-- For instance  the condition of the global economy (as an economics major) and the vitality of efficient political institutions ( as an International Relations minor). I am immensely grateful to have been chosen to be part of  such an intellectual community.  Another thing I like about Goucher-- in addition to its remarkable academic programs  is its diversity rate-- people like me are welcomed and easily integrated into the community.  "
College Junior,5,"Every teacher I have had has been attentive, organized, and committed to whatever they are teaching. I am a Dance major but I have taken Biology, History, Computer Science, Environmental Studies, Spanish, Sociology, Business, and English classes so I believe I can make that statement with confidence. 

What I love is that the teacher reviews are really looked at and when multiple students have a problem with a particular teacher, the college takes action and makes sure that the students needs are met. 

Another thing I like is the responsiveness of most teachers. A lot of communication is done through email but there are also teachers that give out their personal number."
Recent Alumnus,5,So far my experience with my school has been absolutely amazing. The administration is the best I've ever encountered and everyone genuinely cares about helping you out with whatever you need.
College Freshman,5,Professors are wonderful. You don't have to declare a major until the end of sophomore year. Study Abroad is required.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love goucher. The teachers are understanding, the people are friendly, the campus is beautiful and there are countless opportunities to do things you love."
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are absolutely amazing, nice and small. Professors generally care and go above and beyond for their students. There are a lot of class options, but there could always be more."
College Sophomore,5,"Goucher is an incredibly special place that exudes friendliness. I transferred from a huge public university where I didn't feel like I fit anywhere, and the second I set foot on Goucher's campus, I felt at home. It sounds super cliche, but it's true. The attention and care that the vast majority of professors give to each individual is astounding and shows their passion. I love the fact that there are so many clubs and organizations on campus that are really specific to one topic or activity and everyone involved is actually actively involved. I live in the language house and it's so much fun to live with other people who share my passion for learning languages and different cultures. Not only that, but we have so many fun activities like foreign language karaoke (my favorite!), cooking ethic meals, and many many others. Everyone at Goucher has something that they're openly passionate about and love to discuss which makes for a really cool and interesting environment."
College Sophomore,5,"I really like my school because there is plenty to do. I am in a lot of extracurricular activities, and I am help run a lot of them next semester. I also like that they have my majors. I am a double major in Spanish and Secondary Education with a minor in Business Management."
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities are amazing for everyone.
College Freshman,5,Food is good on and off campus- lots of options
College Freshman,5,There is no Greek life and its GREAT
College Junior,5,Declaring my major was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I talked to the people I asked to be my advisers and the head of the department to fill out the paperwork and was done.
College Sophomore,5,"I work at the Career Development Office at Goucher, which is the office that assists students with all things career. The office is grossly under used. Students complain that the school doesn't assist them in finding a job/internship searches, but the don't seek out the help the office provides. Goucher isn't a huge school, we don't have the biggest alumni network, but it's there if you look for it."
College Sophomore,5,I love the food at Goucher! There is lots of variety and healthy options.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I live at The Quarters at Towson opposite of campus, and walking to class is a 10-minute affair. While rent and bills may be a bit pricey, the amenities and benefits are a lot better and more affordable compared to living on campus. Also, management in this building is a lot more responsive to the needs of its residents compared to Public Safety on campus. Public Safety will take an hour to respond to noise disturbance complaints, or not at all. Management will ensure that problems are resolved permanently."
College Senior,5,It quite difficult to describe the student demographic and lifestyle at Goucher.  The diversity at Goucher is immense when one pays attention to what's going on.  No one student looks the same.  Everyone seems to be friendly with each other even one may not be a part of that specific circle of friends.  No one is really discriminated upon one's social status or the way one dresses.  It is very easy to make friends at Goucher.  You just have to be nice and always have a smile.
College Senior,5,"The academics offered at Goucher College is vast and diverse, so there is always something a student can look forwards to when it come to new experiences.  The professors are great, when one schedules meetings with one.  The professors are very resourceful and are always there to help the students, yet getting one-on-one interactions can be difficult depending on the professor's schedule.  The curriculum and registration process is simple and straight to the point.  No real complications involved there.  A student's workload varies depending on the courses and number of courses one is taking.  One can complete their workload at offered study areas on campus, which happens to be very high.  Popular study areas include private rooms offered at the Athenaeum, the school's library.  The whole campus can be considered a great study area.  One downside to studying outside is that the wireless internet connection can be weak at certain areas on campus, making it an inconvenience at points in time.  Overall, the academics are the best."
College Freshman,5,"Even though I have yet to start my freshman year at Goucher, I can already confirm that Goucher is a very diverse college. They have clubs for everyone and everything, and no one cares about the others viewpoints on sexuality or politics or religion."
College Sophomore,5,Some hallways can smell like weed and there is a visible use of alcohol.
College Sophomore,5,There are many computer labs with windows and apple products. But the tech department needs more attention.
College Sophomore,5,Goucher is a very accepting place for all kinds of people. We make it our priority to build a peaceful environment.
College Sophomore,5,I was given a lot of money and choose to come here because of that and I ended up liking it and have gotten good things out of my buck.
College Sophomore,5,My advisors challenge me to pursue and widen my possibilities.
Recent Alumnus,5,The Peace Studies program is absolutely amazing and I would not choose a different program if I could do it all over again. I plan on entering graduate study for human rights which is something I never considered before taking a Peace Studies class. It's difficult to get a job in the human rights field and in non profits in general but I think the program adequately prepared me for a range of potential jobs.
College Freshman,5,"I love the public safety officers at Goucher. They all are really helpful and I always feel safe because I know they are patrolling around the campus. Although I always know they are there, they are definitely not in my business all the time either, which is cool. When I need to walk across campus to my car in the middle of the night alone, I feel safe. There are plenty of emergency phones if I ever needed one. 

Recently there have been some robberies and such off-campus but close, but that is not really normal I don't think."
College Freshman,5,"I love the Peace Studies department so far. All of the professors are so wise and they treat us like equals and that feels very good. Peace Studies at Goucher is known for being very challenging and rigorous, but I also know it will be worth it. Peace Studies is very popular at Goucher."
College Junior,5,The surrounding areas around Goucher College have excellent dining options and a ton of different types of foods. 
College Sophomore,5,"I personally love the facilities on campus. The Ath is a beautiful building, and one of my favorite places to hang out on campus. The quiet floors there are also really nice when you need to get some work done. We have a quad, but it gets cold pretty quickly here in MD, so people really stop hanging out on it after September ends."
College Freshman,5,"Lots of majors to choose from and combine. Build your own, and many opportunities that go along with it."
College Freshman,5,"The campus isn't very strict; although safety is a priority, pretty much the only priority. There is a no chase policy on campus, if you have no open containers they can't prove you're drinking and thus cannot chase you. The public safety also checks all the floors of all halls and grounds during the weekends."
College Sophomore,5,"Goucher College is not strict at all! That is, unless you get caught cheating, up to three times, then baby YOU'RE OUT.
Also, Public Safety has a ""no chase"" policy, so you can always run away. Basically if you don't do anything too dumb, you're fine."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of great, cheap places to eat surrounding the school. The mall has a diverse food court that you can eat at, but there area also places elsewhere that are fun. My favorite has to be either Panera or Corner Bakery, which are about 20 minutes walking from campus. They are kind of expensive, but it's a good treat once a month or so."
College Freshman,5,"Towson offers a lot of off-campus dining options. In the mall across the street, there is a food court that includes a Panda Express, Subway, and Burger King amongst other options. There is also a Cheesecake Factory in the mall that students like to go to and a TGIF. Plenty of places deliver (Dominoes trucks and Chinese delivery cars frequent the campus on the weekends). There are some higher-end restaurants in Towson and Baltimore, but those are mostly out of the students' price ranges."
College Freshman,5,"Nothing but good things to say about the technology situation at Goucher! There is a full-sized computer lab in the library filled with state of the art Apple computers. Goucher provides free wifi and offers free tech support. I remember my second month here, my computer totally crashed and didn't work. I took it to the IT people and they had it up and running in a week, with all of my memory restored. Occasionally, the printers in the library break, but that's to be expected at most schools."
College Freshman,5,"I don't have a lot of experience with the health people here at Goucher. I know that there are doctors and counselors on campus, and that people I know who've seen them have nothing bad to say about them.

Public Safety patrols the campus 24/7, and I've never felt unsafe on campus. Off-campus though, it's always good to bring along a friend. Within the first month of my getting here, there were two shootings in nearby areas. Some parts of Baltimore are especially rough, so use the buddy system especially when traveling into B-More!"
College Freshman,5,"Goucher College is located in the town of Towson, Maryland. Towson is a small suburb, but is a cool little town in its own right. There's a hookah bar that a lot of students go to at least once in their time here, there's a really big shopping mall right across the street from the school, complete with a Chesecake Factory and a TGIF at which some students like to dine off-campus occasionally.

Beyond Towson, of course, is Baltimore, just a 20-minute free bus ride away. Baltimore is a very diverse, up-and-coming East Coast city. Students here love to visit the Inner Harbor,  Hampden, and Charles North. There's plenty to see and do off-campus, and public transportation helps students get around easily."
College Freshman,5,"Goucher is the only college or university that requires students to travel abroad at least once. We are a very globally focused, connected, and minded school and if our students are to make a difference in the world, they need to know how other parts of the world work. Study abroad is essential in learning about how we ourselves work in the world, and it is important to see multiple view points."
College Sophomore,5,"There is great food in the dining halls, a tennis court, volleyball, art, cafes, and plenty of events for students to make use of on campus. There are also the trails for jogging and biking, a pool, gym, and outdoor gear rental. There are also many opportunities to attend lectures and to get involved in internships, volunteer work, and community engagement projects."
College Sophomore,5,"I was impressed that there was so much to do on campus, in town of Townsend, and in nearby Baltimore, and Washington D. C. There are shops, restaurants, parks, museums, theaters, and plenty of other things to do."
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid department was very helpful. I was able to get help when on campus and when calling from Alaska. I was able to get my financial aid balance quickly by mail.
College Freshman,5,There are lots of very new Mac desk tops in the library and they all work very well.
College Sophomore,5,"Goucher has a very diverse population. Not only a varied ethnic background, but in the kind of people that attend the college. We have everyone from hipsters, jocks, artists, nerds, doofuses, poor kids, rich kids, party kids, hippies, politically active kids, devoted students, geniuses...you get the drift. I've never been constantly surrounded by such different people all at the same time -- all getting along! Sounds cliche, but everyone at Goucher would agree that we have a very diverse student body. The people-watching a t Goucher is fantastic."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Macs & Pcs – Goucher recently built a new library. They have lots of Macs and an entire PC section as well. Even on the Macs they incorporated the Windows operating system. Goucher's tech team really works hard and the equipment is beautiful. I will say that almost all students have their own laptops, but if not, it is very easy to rent a laptop for the semester from Goucher. PC or Mac."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There have been random occasions when non-student individuals wander onto campus, but campus security locates them quickly and escorts them off campus. Goucher is beautiful. We do get a lot of jogger traffic, but that makes me feel more at home and safe than unsafe. I do hear about things being stolen from dorm rooms, but I never experienced that."
College Junior,5,"The weather changes every ten minutes. However, we experience all seasons and it is great."
College Junior,5,"The facilities are beautiful and most are new. Everything you could ask for is here on campus. We have one of the best riding teams with a stable on campus, a brand new library that has received numerous awards for being environmentally friendly and they are in the process of building new dorms."
Sophomore,4,"Goucher typically doesn't offer an online classes however when we switched to online due to COVID-19, I feel like the professors did the best they could given the circumstances. It definitely wasn't the best learning experience but the professors did their absolute best to accommodate everyone and checkin with the students as much as they could."
Sophomore,4,the online learning was not bad it was just a little difficult to adjust to. the professors for the most part were available and very accommodating to the given circumstances.
Sophomore,4,Goucher is what you make it. I had a blast living on campus and being around great people. the party scene is great if you know the right people and enjoy being in a club from time to Time
Sophomore,4,"Many of my professors were understanding, and gave grace to students who were struggling with online learning. However, a few professors were overwhelmed themselves, which made it impossible to adequately provide for their students - I believe this to be a fault of the pandemic and not the institution."
Sophomore,4,Goucher College is  a liberal arts college that has 100% of study abroad. Most of the students at Goucher have a scholarship and is a very inclusive university.
Sophomore,4,"The best thing about Goucher is that professors care about the students. They provide all of the materials that are necessary for students to succeed in life. Most of my professors love teaching. The summer after my first year, I was already working in a research lab with my professor. Class sizes tend to be small. Most professors have an ""open door"" policy where if their office door is open, you can walk in and ask questions even if it isn't during their office hours. 
As a commuter, it is hard to get involved in clubs and extracurriculars since most of them are in the evening. 
The Atheneum is an open space that students can use for many different things. The Writing Center, QR Center, Bio/Chem Help Center, Commuter Lounge, and Alice's are in the Ath. There are also quiet space and rooms for group sessions. Students can reserve rooms to hold club meetings."
Sophomore,4,"Goucher is a very open and welcoming community, the professors are always happy to be there and help out.  It's a place that I love to be and I've never felt unwelcome."
Junior,4,"I feel that Goucher has a lot going for it and a lot of unrealized potential. It is in the midst of trying to stay afloat in the decline of the liberal arts institute and budget cuts. It is odd to see a new culture being created. But I am trying to have faith. I love a lot about this school; the grounds, its animal-friendly, mental health conscious, healthy living conscious, social activist culture, so on. Go go Gouch"
Freshman,4,"My professors at Goucher college were by far the best part about attending. The location offers the best of both worlds, close to DC and Baltimore, while also a quiet campus. Nearly all of my experiences on campus were extremely welcoming, inclusive, and simultaneously intellectually stimulating."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I enjoy attending this college, yet I have had some struggles. The only problem that I can truly say that I've had is that I failed my Gen chem 2 class purely because she didn't teach. She left the school so I know that other students that attend the college after me won't have the same problem, however it is something that affected me."
Sophomore,4,"Goucher College offers uniquely small class sizes that allow students to have the opportunity to connect deeply with their professors and peers. Specifically, the science department gives students the ability to work in introductory labs with only 25 students per section with two professors and two teaching assistants. Thus maximizing the hands-on time that students receive, and giving students countless time to ask, and have their questions answered individually in the fundamental stages of undergraduate lab work. Additionally, although Goucher is not known for their athletic programs, the athletic department truly has formed a tight-knit community for students across sports and genders. Finally, the campus is surrounded by beautiful wooded area and green grass while being located within the city of Towson, Maryland, just 20 minutes away from the Inner Harbor of Baltimore."
Freshman,4,"Goucher College is a very welcoming environment, as I have seen time and time again that the faculty genuinely cares for the wellbeing of the students that attend this school. Academics are good too, as the classes here are very insightful. However, if you're looking for a party scene, this isn't the school for you. Some students host or attend parties, but they're difficult to find. Goucher is in college town though, so it's possible to go to other schools in the area for parties. This institution is also a PWI, so diversity is average. We do have a steady increase in the amount of POCs and have clubs for POCs to find each other and connect. 

Overall, Goucher is a good school and I recommend it."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere on Gouchers campus. I have made life long friends and have some seriously amazing professors.
Freshman,4,I love everything about Goucher College since the first minute I walked in I knew that was the place where I wanted to be for the next four years of my life.
Sophomore,4,Very diverse community with a wide range of academic curriculum with specific concentration in the liberal arts.
Niche User,4,Goucher is an extremely academic sound school with fantastic individuals. The college campus is beautiful and people are willing to go the extra mile for their grades.
Sophomore,4,"Goucher has great faculty, friendly atmosphere, unique courses, great study aboard opportunities and a swell Russian department."
Sophomore,4,"Goucher is a perfect fit for me. I was looking for a small, liberal arts college that would give me some freedom in terms of my education, but would not have so much restriction that I would feel boxed in. Goucher is perfect for that. In my almost two full years here, I have made friends and met professors that have made my 12 years of suffering worth it. The whole climate is much more mature than high school, but contrary to what your teachers told you, you're not thrown into the wind to fend for yourself. There is plenty of support in every area you can think of - sexuality, gender, spirituality, academics, athletics, etc. The class sizes are small enough that there are plenty of professors that I was able to connect with and ask for guidance. The higher-ups do exaggerate the school's diversity, but the students, professors, and administrators do truly have a commitment to making Goucher as diverse, progressive, and safe for all identities as possible."
Sophomore,4,"Goucher is a place very few can thrive, especially with the ridiculous tuition and costs associated with an education from here. In terms of the education you receive, I have not yet discovered its value. Some classes will be painfully easy and cater towards students who are clearly not prepared for college level academics. Others will challenge you and make you question everything around you."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman here at Goucher, I'm currently in love with the campus! The students here at Goucher are very artsy and open-minded, which makes the campus stimulating. The on-campus housing is very nice, and the new freshman dorm is incredible! My only current bother is the food since I am gluten free and have several food sensitivities. I would greatly recommend a campus visit!"
Alum,4,"I loved my time there, but Goucher's a very hit or miss school. If it's right for you, you'll love the small class sizes and unique educators, but what works for some doesn't work for others. You get out what you put in."
Senior,4,"Strong liberal arts college. Wonderful faculty/staff, and  a great campus. Currently (2017) undergoing a lot of construction, but that will make the campus much more modern and will dramatically improve the facilities. Food is incredible, and admin is approachable if you make the effort. Students are often disinterested in engagement as a whole, but there are some very active students that you will get to know at some point in your tenure here."
College Sophomore,4,Goucher is great! There are a lot of unique people (students and professors). Classes are small with interesting and engaged professors.
College Junior,4,"I have personally never had an issue so I do not feel like I can give an accurate opinion about the safety on campus, but I can say that I feel very safe and no one I know personally has had any problems with campus security/ safety either."
College Junior,4,"I plan to dance professionally after I leave Goucher and go onto medical school after I am done, which is why I chose to minor in public health as well. Even though I am not a major I do get notifications from the Biology department on campus whenever a speaker comes to talk or even when there is any info sessions about the medical field in general. I am not sure about the reputation Goucher has in the medical world, but one of my friends who applied to medical school just got accepted so they must be doing something right."
College Junior,4,"I chose my school because it was one of the few colleges that I was accepted into. Although it wasn't my first choice, the deciding factor for me was the great dance program, financial aid package and study abroad options. I am in my third year now and, unfortunately, the things I thought I was going to be able to didn't end up being a possibility in the end, but I can't say that it has made me regret my decision. I like the amount of opportunities students get to become involved on campus. I am  the treasurer of both the Bikram Yoga Club and Dancer's of Color Coalition, and I'm a member of the Student Health advisory.  

As a student I do feel taken care of. Some days during the year we'll get surprised with something sweet like free cupcakes on the walkway on the way to the academic classes, or a free outdoor movie screening. During finals week there is a ton of free food around campus and free acupuncture. 

The only reason why I couldn't give a five star rating was because my study abroad program was cancelled the summer before the semester I was supposed to go, I didn't get support to find a comparable program, and I felt that it shouldn't have been that difficult since it was not my fault and it is a graduation requirement, but if I knew then what I do now, I would pick Goucher again every time. 

I really do feel like the campus environment is enjoyable, there are tons of involvement options and the academics are strong."
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletics are great and school spirit is very high. Athletic facilities are some of the best I've ever seen!
College Freshman,4,Easy to avoid as needed.
College Freshman,4,"New freshman housing is incredible, but a lot of upperclassmen are forced to live in the old freshman dorms. Off-campus housing is a huge hassle."
College Freshman,4,"Students have a lot of power here, and professors are on our side. It's small, but in a great location. Everyone has a place. Academics aren't always terribly challenging, but that gives students room to explore interests inside and outside of the classroom."
College Freshman,4,"There are people that complain, but I have not had a problem. The rooms are decently sized, the common rooms are good, and the bathrooms are fairly clean."
College Freshman,4,I've never been to the gym but it's allegedly wonderful. They also have equipment in the Ath and offer horseback riding.
College Freshman,4,"blue lights everywhere.

If anything happens on or around campus, an email letting everyone know goes out"
College Sophomore,4,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, especially compared to where I was before. There really isn't a lot of crime and in general, there aren't big safety issues."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience thus far with housing has been really great and easy. However, I know that many people do not have that same experience. Stimson is really run down, so it's good that it will soon be rebuilt! I'm glad I haven't had to live there. I really love living in the language house. It has a really great location and the suites are awesome!"
College Freshman,4,after you graduate you get a degree in which you can use to get a variety amount of jobs
College Sophomore,4,Public safety is always available to help in case you need then
College Sophomore,4,Because of the class sizes all professors are there in case you need to see them and all the classes are very open
College Sophomore,4,The degree that I graduate with will help me get a job right out of college. I am confident in this
College Sophomore,4,There is little emphasis on sports because Goucher is such a big arts school but the athletic buildings are up to date and good for the entire student body
College Sophomore,4,It's a school that has so many opportunities for growth. I love that it is a requirement to study abroad it give you the experience to travel and learn in different environments.
College Sophomore,4,"I have only ever used to the cardio and workout rooms and only do so every so often as I am not that big into fitness.  However the school has great athletic facilities including several sports fields, a full track and indoor pool.  The gym could get quite crowded during peak practice hours for student-athletes (around 3-5)."
College Sophomore,4,"My current experience at Goucher is a very interesting one.  On this campus I'm never bored--the students who go here are some of the most open-minded, kind hearted, weird, and fun individuals I have ever met.  In terms of the academics, the professors I find generally to be really great and the courses interesting, however the work load is definitely not easy.  The community is a small, but great one and diverse enough for anyone to find their own niche.  At times, I fear that the tuition is too high for me to continue if I don't receive enough financial aid."
College Junior,4,"The professors are extremely kind and helpful, and the atmosphere is great. However, some professors are very adament in their ways and don't like change. There are a lot of places within 20 minutes drive of the school. However, transportation to other places is kinda difficult depending on the place you want to go."
College Sophomore,4,I like how my school includes a study abroad requirement to develop a fuller sense of self by living in a different country for a semester.
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love my school. It is the perfect fit for me. Goucher offers so many incredible opportunities, including the amazing Study Abroad requirement. I love that the classes are small and you have the ability to really get to know your professor and often your classmates. Overall, Goucher has been a great experience for me."
College Sophomore,4,"There's a good variety of affordable ethnic restaurants. Fresh market/Trader Joes is good for grocery shopping, the mall has all the chains you can imagine, and there are some great ethnic restaurants around Towson circle."
College Sophomore,4,The food at Goucher is good because it has a lot of options for vegetarians/vegans. It's just expensive and can get monotonous.
College Freshman,4,"Compared to other colleges the food is very good, but there were times when it was not the best. Sometimes the combinations were just weird or things just did not taste right. In general, the food was tasty and great for vegetarian options."
College Sophomore,4,"I initially didn't get the financial aid package I wanted, but I appealed and they were very helpful. I eventually got something that suited my financial needs."
College Sophomore,4,"Obviously it can get boring, but it is grade A in comparison to other schools and their options."
College Sophomore,4,"They are currently starting to build two new residential buildings which will replace the older, less nice ones! Otherwise, the residential halls are nice."
College Sophomore,4,"Good variety. Good hours--at least one hall open from 9:00 AM to 2:00 AM every weekday. Bon Appétit is a good provider with consistently updated menus, website, sustainable and ethical initiatives, events, and promotion. Dining halls could be cleaner. Staff could be friendlier. Dining plan should be more flexible and allow rollovers. Food is definitely pricey, though more often than not worth its value."
College Freshman,4,"To live off campus, the best advice is to own a car."
College Freshman,4,A lot of the restaurants are within walking distance.
College Freshman,4,There is a nice balance of strictness and leniency.
College Freshman,4,"Goucher College gave me a lot of financial aid. But with the new raise in tuition, there should be more scholarship opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"Goucher is not a big party school. If you like small get togethers and intimate parties than this is the college for you. In order to get bigger parties, its all off campus."
College Freshman,4,"I believe each dining hall has something special to offer. If you want breakfast, go to Pearlstone. If you want lunch, go to Heubeck. If you want dinner, go to Stimson. Alice's is great for in between classes or late night snacks."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy living in Stimson. Although it is at an opposite end of the campus, it is convenient because the dining hall is within the building as well. I was lucky enough to have two wonderful roommates. Also, my floor mates are all respectable and I have no problems with them. Overall, I feel safe in my housing."
Junior,2,"I havent had one good  experience here yet. trying to register for classes is a hassle and they make it extra hard for you to get the classes you need for your major. professors are rude and would purposely ignore emails until you get higher ups involved. a lot of the student body is also terrible, nobody respects one another. opportunities have been taken away. athletics are terrible as well, it is mostly the coaches who are terrible and dont respect students academics"
Niche User,2,"I went here for one semester. Firstly, please do your RESEARCH! I found this college annoying, boring. and overpriced! The campus culture was terrible and there was NOTHING to do on campus! There was a bus that came to the school that took you to Baltimore and other colleges but just a huge waste of time and money. The academics are subpar and confusing and the school is only known for the liberal arts. Do not go here if you want a career."
Sophomore,2,"I’m a current student at Goucher desperately hoping to leave. The utterly bizarre culture here just negates any positives. People here are politically ignorant while pretending to be woke. Assume anyone who isn’t a border-line Marxist are neo-Nazis, they uplift one racial group by putting down others, etc. It’s completely toxic, and anyone who doesn’t conform to it receives social sanctions. Everyone here thinks and acts the same. They reject mainstream culture while embracing mainstream counter-culture. They’re not unique, they’re not interesting—I’m embarrassed to go here."
Alum,2,"Goucher has really upped it's game in the past few years.  They've come into the 21st century (there wasn't campus Wifi until President Bowen got there in 2014, seriously) with the recent addition of new dorms and amazing dining hall to make it more appealing to (potential) students.  The campus culture is really weird. If you don't like to make eye contact with other people or dressed like Winnie the Poo every day then this is your school.  It's so crazy liberal and the weird students and faculty hate athletes and everything you do or say is a slight, considered racist, or something. The older alums are stuck in 1960 and you'll hear about ""when I was here"" all of them time.  The world has changed and it isn't 1960 anymore. It's no longer an elite girls school.  When I came to Goucher, it was because of Prez Bowen and I was really thankful he was president when I was there. Now, he's gone who knows what will happen."
Sophomore,2,"Goucher is an interesting place, I came here because of the scholarships they offered me. Most people here are on scholarship because tuition is so incredibly expensive. The thing is they have no interest in helping you graduate and with constantly changing general requirements if you do not come in knowing exactly what you want to do, chances are you will not finish in four years and have to pay the 60,000 without aid from the school. I will say that there are a few people in certain offices and some professors that are fantastic. Also, the title ix office is horrendous and always sides with the accused."
Sophomore,2,"Not a bad experience if you're interested in Women and gender, psych, or dance. For the rest of us, it is not worth the investment especially with the recent major and study abroad cuts (funny since it's a requirement). The college's only saving grace are the many fabulous profs I have met in my time here, but a lot of them end up leaving. Overall, not bad but I will be transferring because of the lack of available programs and the wasteful management of money (new freshmen dorms my ass)."
Sophomore,2,"This college is terrible on most fronts, it’s only saving grace is the wonderful professors. The food is terrible and very repetitive. The academics is pretty average and less than spectacular. The diversity just come visit and that will answer any questions on diversity. However, I will say the groups such as GWOC( Goucher’s Women of Color) and the CREI center do offer a variety of fun and diverse activities and events. The location is not very convenient if you want some fun local activity but it is good for a walk or a hike. If you came to Maryland for the central downtown metropolitan city then you should go to Johns Hopkins ( not to mention it’s a better school altogether). Well if you want subpar food, annoying classmates, and terrible dorms then Goucher is the perfect place for you!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"Sports houses have parties but you have to drive and they are hit-or-miss. Towson and JHU have good parties but again if you don't have a car, the shuttle stops running around midnight. Ubers are expensive."
College Freshman,2,"There are fairly frequent sports team parties, but they are off campus and can sometimes be difficult to get to or from if you do not want to pay for a cab or an uber. Usually, people just hang out and drink in someone's room."
College Freshman,2,difficult for students that don't have rich parents
College Freshman,2,"The administration has a lot to work on as far as priorities for discipline, but on other matters they're alright.

There may be drug busts pretty regularly, but nothing is being done as far as safety for students as far as disciplining offenders for sexual harassment and assault. That is unacceptable."
College Freshman,2,"I don't pay much attention to any athletic teams and such. School spirit is pretty bad, but I hardly care about that either. It certainly puts very little focus on sporting events and team support."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The demographic of Goucher can be described as Jewish-until-proven-otherwise, the pinnacle of economic privilege and being open-minded as long as you don't challenge their left-wing preconceptions.

I used to consider myself a liberal until I was exposed to the ugly ways rabid liberals can behave, and I did not wish to be a part of that. Radical feminism is widespread and there is a growing sentiment among some women that the college should remove all male students and revert it to a women's college."
College Sophomore,2,"Great if you are awarded financial aid, but if you need more money than that amount you're pretty much out of luck. The aid department isn't the best to deal with and they refer you to all different departments in the same building a cubicle away just so you can tell the same story over and over instead of them personally referring you. Then you are literally referred back to the same person you started with. Its really a struggle."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a party school. Very small place, therefore, limiting."
Recent Alumnus,2,Dorm parties are usually broken up pretty quickly by campus security. It's better to go to a different school like Johns Hopkins for parties.
College Sophomore,2,"Lacrosse is the biggest sport on campus, not that anyone likes it."
College Sophomore,2,"Goucher is located in the suburban area of Towson, not downtown Baltimore."
College Freshman,2,I feel like all they care about if walking through dorms listening for loud music. And parking tickets. They LOVE giving those out.
College Freshman,2,"I'm having a terrible time receiving the aid I need. Goucher is super expensive and my family does not have a lot of money and still, I'm barely receiving any help."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much of a nightlife unless you meet the right people and make an effort to go to parties. Otherwise, you just have to have your own fun/parties with your friends."
College Junior,2,It is almost impossible to live off campus if you do not have a car because there is no good public transportation or affordable housing near campus. 
College Senior,2,"With the exception of horse back riding, sports aren't very important at Goucher. Anyone who wants to participate can, though. So that's good."
College Junior,2,"Public safety isn't very helpful when you need them the most. They'll tell a loud party to shut up and then go away and that's it. They're pretty lax. The school has also had issues with sexual misconduct, which it treated very passively."
College Junior,2,"There's not much nightlife at Goucher, so if you're looking for a party school, this isn't it. Parties are casual and in dorm rooms, and it's not a big deal. Off campus parties tend to be hard to get to."
College Freshman,2,"Nobody cares, for the most part. We have a D-III athletic program, and that's about all I know about it for the most part. If you want to go to a big rah-rah school that has televised games, and all that, maybe look elsewhere.

However, its worth mentioning that while Goucher does not have Frats, the sports teams often act as ersatz fraternities. You really won't find a decent on-campus party that isn't populated by the lacrosse or soccer team."
College Sophomore,2,"The security at the gate is stupid, there either isn't someone there or they will let anyone in unless it is after midnight.  The scanners to enter building are nice, but usually one is broken and anyone can just open the door and walk right in.  Other than that, you see the security all over the place they just don't seem to be of just use."
College Freshman,2,"When you visit the school it seems like a very open place where people are friendly and generally friends with everyone. But once you get here you see that people aren't that friendly, most of the people are stuck up and rude. Its very hard to get to know people here."
College Sophomore,2,"Pub Safe Is a Joke – It's kind of funny how people get away with things at Goucher. Things just fly under the radar. Pub Safe even has a ""no chase"" policy, meaning they won't run after you if you run away from them...yeah. It's pretty ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a TON of school spirit and people get excited when things do happen, but the games are typically non-existent and no one really knows what's going on in terms of teams, athletics, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Good for Local, Not So Good for Long Distance – There's a great shuttle that runs between the campuses in Baltimore and it's free so it's very easy for students to get to the city and other campuses.  All students are allowed to have cars so that's another way students get around (and it's only $50 per year to park!). But getting to the airport/train station without having someone drive you can be tricky.  They do offer shuttles for the major breaks but if you're trying to go somewhere mid-semester it takes a bit more planning."
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't a ton of diversity in terms of race or socio-economics.  It's grown a lot since I was a freshman 4+ years ago but it's still not somewhere that's super diverse.  However I believe there's a fair amount of diversity among students thoughts and ways of behaving.
College Sophomore,2,"Goucher does not have a very active nightlife. Students do not party that often there and public safety cracks down hard on students who do party. They say they are open and flexible about experimentation, but they have very strict policies. There are some fun Goucher planned events on weekends. I do find myself in the library most nights, even some weekend nights."
College Freshman,2,"Make your own fun at Goucher. It's not impossible, but you have to put some effort in.

My chief complaint about Goucher is regarding the administration. Nearly everyone who goes here has to deal with some sort of registration screw-up at some point. Hopefully it doesn't effect you too badly when it happens, but be ready because it will happen. 

I am currently taking a course that I won't be getting any credit for, at least not this semester. My department head failed to clear my independent study with the registration, and now the academic dean is telling me it's too late to add it to my schedule because it will look bad in terms of academic integrity... So let it be known, academic integrity is questionable in some cases."
College Freshman,2,"They hardly do anything. There is one ""drug free"" dorm building on campus, but if you don't live there, theres really no escaping it. I complained multiple times, and nothing was ever done. If you're like me and don't like to be around drugs/alcohol, you won't enjoy yourself much. "
College Freshman,2,"Not the best.. As far as safety, you can always see security guards all over campus. But I wouldn't say I actually felt safe. Someone broke into my room and stole one of our laptops while my roommates and I were sleeping. And I got back to my room once to see someone trying to pick my lock. 
The health office can handle minor things, but there was one incident where my roommate fell and broke her arm and when I went to the health office for help, they simply told me to call an ambulance because they didn't have an x-ray machine. In my opinion, they should have sent someone over at least to make sure she was okay."
College Freshman,2,"Very Relaxed, Yet Still a Safe Environment – I tend to find the campus very relaxed and not terribly strict.  Restrictions have increased in the past couple years, but for the most part the policies aren't terribly overwhelming.  That being said, I still think that the campus is very safe."
College Freshman,2,"There Are Laptop Thieves About – Not even a month into school there was a day when five laptops, including my own, were stolen. Not only that, but mine was stole while i was in my room sleeping. I woke up and saw them but wasn't wearing glasses and assumed it was my roommate coming back from the library. creepy."
College Senior,2,"You Will Get Busted for Stupid Minor S*** – You will most likely get busted by Robo-cop at somepoint during your stay here, either for loudness, or too many people, or because you were drinking a glass of wine in the presence of you almost 21 year old roommate. Vandalism goes on your bill, and the person responsible usually goes free."
College Senior,2,"There is not a lot of diversity overall on campus, as far as I can tell the majority of the students are middle class, white and liberal. However, most of the students seem very accepting of others who are different from themselves."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs Around but Avoidable – There are plenty of drugs and alcohol around and there isn't much enforcement. If you want to avoid it though, you can and there isn't much peer pressure."
College Senior,2,"Not So Much – While Goucher is a very accepting and open community of people, there is really not much diversity. Mostly liberal white Jewish kids."
College Senior,2,"First and foremost Goucher doesn't have student activities. The only oppurtunity are dorm room parties which tend to be mediocre and get busted for underage drinking VERY VERY OFTEN. I enjoy the nightlife around Towson and Baltimore now that I'm 21, but before that the nightlife was very depressing at Goucher and I had to leave campus often to feel involved with the outside world."
College Senior,2,"Judging by the fact that they make it very difficult for you to live off campus if you go to Goucher, I would say that it's kind of a four year you live on campus kind of school. You can move but they apartments in the area are pretty expensive so most people end up living in the city near JHU. Our dorms are nice enough though therefore it doesn't make sense to live off campus."
College Junior,2,"Dance and Horsebackriding – Sports at Goucher are pretty terrible... Good for the people who want to concentrate on a tough major and still get to play their sport on a college level, but really sometimes I think that there should be a division 4 just for Goucher. The horseback riding team does very well in their competitive division however and our dance program is one of the top non-conservatory programs in the country. Sometimes students only go to sporting events to watch dance team perform at halftime. We don't even have a football team."
College Sophomore,2,"Lots O' Weed – Huge visibility of drugs and alcohol on campus, especially during the weekend. TONS of smoking, heavy bong use. Little peer pressure but those living in the substance free housing do receive negative comments."
College Sophomore,2,"Ranges from Really Bad to Really Nice. When it rains for days on end, it's really depressing. It does this a couple times a month, but sometimes it can get really beautiful outside. I like when the fall weather is really nice out and you can have a T-shirt day instead of having to wear long sleeves starting in late September. I love it when it snows because it causes chaos. People around here don't know how to drive in the snow."
College Freshman,2,"Weed Okay, Alcohol Not – If you smoke weed your fine. However, if you have a party with alcohol expect it to be broken up immediatly."
College Freshman,2,"Some Good, Some Bad – Only went to the health center once, and they were friendly and helpful. Public safety is a nightmare if you are an athlete. They actively stake out dorms and apartments where athletes are known to congregate, and than love to bust them on mostly trumped up charges. Public safety will crack down on a party within an hour of it starting, but if you smoke weed openly  you are fine."
College Freshman,2,"Slim Pickings – Goucher is mostly female. Guys are either taken or just strange. Most people are hipsters, hippies, and pretty artsy. Very quirky, often just weird. people claim that Goucher is so open-minded, but there are also a lot of elitist hipsters"
College Freshman,2,"I've had some really great professors who were passionate about their subjects and loved to teach. On the other hand, I've also had some dreadful teachers who seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Over all, I've had a pretty mediocre academic experience and I often wish that I was more challenged."
College Junior,2,"Go Gophers? Coming from a very athletic high school, Goucher's sports kind of bum me out. The only people who care about student athletes are student athletes. The games are usually under-attended and even then we win, no one seems to notice. Last year, the Men's Lacrosse team won their conference for the first time in the schools history. The game that decided that was the most exciting athletic event Goucher has ever hosted. The stands were packed and for once it felt like I was at an actual school. Besides that, the facilities themselves are great. Large cardio room that is open until Midnight and a brand new weight room too."
College Sophomore,2,"Or Lack Thereof – I don't party at all, so I have no idea. I've heard that we're pretty lacking when it comes to partying; most people go off campus. We have a lot of Programming Board-sponsored events."
College Freshman,2,"Be Careful – I would recommend that anyone that is considering Goucher do an overnight visit. You can get a taste for the student life and decide if it is really a good fit for you. It is not a campus that provides everything in a college experience for you, so you have to create it yourself. Looking back, I probably would not have chosen to come here again. It's too isolated and not a very exciting place to be. I am not challenged here at all and everyone seems very much the same."
College Freshman,2,the weather is pretty sh---y. the west coast is better. it rains too much or is too humid. it it either too hot or too cold and there is a lot of wind.
College Sophomore,2,"Better Than Most – Aside from the disgusting smell that gets into your hair and clothes after just being in a dining hall for 30 seconds, the food tastes pretty good.  A lot of it is spicy, and just an hour after you've eaten you will feel bloated and be in the bathroom the rest of the night."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Enough Study Room – The Athenaeum does not have a good amount of private study rooms.  If you want to get one for a few hours, you have to put your study stuff in there way ahead of time so one single person doesn't take the study room."
College Freshman,2,Not Real Diverse – People are different than a lot of real world people but they are all the same and very strange. Most are into drugs and smoke cigarettes. A large white population and a lot of jewish people.
College Freshman,2,Not enough parties – There are not enough GOOD parties. There are plenty of parties but when people want to party the music either sucks or people keep changing the song and can't decide what they want. It gets really frustrating and causes people to leave and call it a night early. It is nice to talk with your friends though
College Freshman,2,"Not enough guys – There are not many guys and there aren't many good looking ones. Although this is good if you are in a relationship with a guy, he won't have to worry"
Alum,1,"I hope this place goes under, and I am not the only graduate who thinks that. I was treated terribly by the administration for no reason at all. They threatened that if I returned home to attend a different private liberal arts college they would pull their networking strings and say negative things about me so that I wouldn't get in anywhere. They really pushed their authority where they really had none. They think more highly of themselves than what they actually are. Some students go on to the top universities, while others will make you cringe. I've heard of students writing papers while they were drunk the night before it was due and getting an A (communications majors)."
Junior,1,Nobody knew what they were doing. it seemed very chaotic. also the professors gave an overload of work that almost seemed never ending. very hard to get the help that was needed
College Junior,1,Not a lot of parties.
College Junior,1,"There is no diversity on this campus. Just because there might be 15 Asians and 30 Black people at a small college campus does not make you diverse. Also, people have to understand that newspaper journalists have reported horrible racist and discriminatory incidents against people of color on this campus. The college has used many techniques to silence students and cover up their recent and past issues. Do not come here if you are of a different ethnicity even if you fit in one the large religious groups on campus, which is Christianity and Judaism. Outside of the general stereotypes of being diverse, there is no other type of ethnic groups here. It's rare to find Hispanics, Middle Easterners, and other types of groups. If you're of a different ethnicity, you will face a lot of hell. I promise you all, it is not the campus that what I thought it would be. Go somewhere else, it will give you a better experience and education as a whole."
College Junior,1,It's ridicolous the amount of people who excessively drink alcohol and partake in illegal drugs.
College Junior,1,"There's not that much diverse array of courses to choose from and the types of things you want to study are limited. The class dicussions are horrible and students do not participate in class. The students are not well-rounded and have no sense of the global world so for courses that require knowledge of things like that, it makes it extremely boring and annoying. Again, this college is a scam with how they have marketed themselves."
College Junior,1,I had a employer director at a federal government agency after I transferred tell me that they worked with Goucher grads before and they did not think highly of them. Goucher as a college is truly not liked within the DMV area.
College Junior,1,"The campus and administration is extremely racist. There have been severe cases of racist incidents on this campus and every time it happens, the administration tries to cover it up by putting a facade up. Also, the whole ""global"" and ""inclusive"" thing is a total sham and lie. I dropped a huge merit scholarship and left this college because of what a lie and horrible investment it was to go to this college. Do not believe what they say."
College Freshman,1,"Goucher makes it annoyingly difficult to live off-campus. I understand for freshman and maybe sophomores as far as forming social bonds, but afterwards its just unnecessary. It seems a huge a nuisance to have to argue your case with administration."
College Freshman,1,"Sexual assault is note dealt with well at all. Victims are not made priority, and offenders get little to no disciplinary action."
College Sophomore,1,"As a (vegetarian) student from New York City, I am used to a different restaurant with each step and in Towson and the general Baltimore area fast food and chains are the main choices. Greasy, poor-quality and poorer variety, and overall crappy choices for food in the area. I recommend learning how to shop properly at grocery stores and buying your own food and cook your own food."
College Freshman,1,Athletics good for a D3 school
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek life. So everything above is non applicable.
College Freshman,1,the studio art classes are pretty awful.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I honestly wouldn't mind all the campus security(they're kind of paranoid) but people snark on each other. Honestly, the campus in general discourages partying on campus, it's just not that kind of place! And if you do try to have a hangout of more than five people, someone will call pubsafe(campus security) and everyone gets written down(one person had to do community service because it was their room one time). The regulations are pretty strict concerning alcohol and drug use, but half of what the 'campus strictness' is concerned with is people 'being loud,' which sucks, but it also means that you can drink pretty liberally as long as you're quiet about it!"
College Freshman,1,"Goucher is a small liberal arts school, so there will be drugs here, as there are at most small liberal arts schools. Alcohol and marijuana are far and away the most popular drugs on campus. On Saturday nights, you can go for a stroll on Van Meter and watch people who've had a few too many drunkenly parade back to their dorms. It's also not uncommon for certain parts of campus to smell strongly of pot. Hallucinogens such as shrooms or lsd are used by some students, but are markedly less popular. Harder drugs like cocaine and heroin are used by a very very small percentage of students, but they are around if you know the right (or wrong) people.

That said, there's very little pressure to try drugs for students who don't want to. In fact, there's a very large and adamant substance-free community at Goucher. For students interested in healthier living, Sondheim, the substance-free dorm, is far and away the nicest place to live on campus, so that's something to consider."
College Freshman,1,"There are people of many different race at Goucher but there is only a few. Most people here are white and jewish, but they are very friendly and open to new cultures. Goucher is also making an effort to be more diverse."
College Freshman,1,"Don't Get Sick or Injured. Health Services at Goucher does their job, but barely. When I was sick earlier in the semester I had to wait 3 days to get an appointment. A lot of good that did me... And then all I received was a bag of throat lozenges and some ibuprofen. 

I didn't expect much from Health Services here, but after injuring my ankle to the extent that I couldn't walk on it, I thought I'd at least be able to get a splint or a ride to the hospital. I got neither. I was able to purchase an Ace wrap from them for $7 though."
College Freshman,1,"Not Very Diverse – In comparison to my high school, this is a completely white campus! Yes, there are some black people and a few Asian people, but the whites are the vast majority. There are times when it seems like 90% of the students are Jewish, too, which might not be too far off. People here are pretty accepting, except for the people who do the Jewish Hillel group. They'll give you weird looks if you try to eat in their dining hall. I guess it's only for Jewish people. Almost everyone on campus is liberal. As such a liberal school, students and professors are very accepting of different sexual orientations."
College Senior,1,"Watch Out for Robo Cop – This isn't a dry campus so there is definitely drinking here. If you are 21, you can drink in your room as long as your roommates or anyone else there are the time is also 21. There are definitely drugs on campus if you go looking for them but they're not everywhere. Public Safety is in their office 24/7. If you have an underage party that gets too loud, they will probably come bust it."

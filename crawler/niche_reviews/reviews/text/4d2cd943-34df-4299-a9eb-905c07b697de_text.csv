Niche User,5,The online experience was good. The professors and the counselors are always on time and prepared to answer any of your questions. I am very satisfied!
Sophomore,5,"Generally, Hollins Professors and Staff did a great job of moving the campus to an online format. Professors came up with new and exciting ways to teach exploring different mediums of education that being online allows. The staff did a great job creating extracurricular actives available online, like BINGO night. While some classes were difficult to teach online professors did the best they could."
Sophomore,5,"Hollins is a wonderful place to complete an undergraduate education! Not only is the education top-notch, with professional, caring professors, but so is the atmosphere. Students here are truly passionate about what they do, whether it be in academics or extracurricular activities. If you're looking to be surrounded by an awesome group of people while taking fascinating classes, Hollins is the place for you."
Freshman,5,"Attending Hollins University has been a great experience thus far. Throughout the application process, the admission staff were attentive and kind. I ending up choosing to attend Hollins over a ""more prestigious"" institution because of their generous scholarships and care for students as individuals. Hollins' campus rivals those of top schools and the surrounding city of Roanoke has an aquarium, symphony, modern art museum, produce market, and cute boutiques for students to enjoy. Professors, particularly those in the political science department, have gone above and beyond to make my freshman experience worthwhile, even in spite of recent circumstances. 
For the student with her eyes on grad school, looking for a private liberal arts education on the East Coast that won't break the bank, I highly recommend checking out Hollins <3"
Works Here,5,"The campus is very beautiful and just like being at home. Close to nature trails and a reservoir for those who like to hike. Athletics is improving a lot. Hollins has a new track & field team, first in school history. Things are looking up for Hollins overall. There is a new, exciting spirit on campus. Anxious to meet the new President Hinton and see how Hollins will continue to flourish in the future. Very high quality college that prepares you well for the future."
Sophomore,5,"Hollins is the best thing ever happened to me. I love the way it engages its students through diversity and inclusion. Everyone including faculty, students, mentors and employers are so friendly and understanding. I receive a lot encouragement from everyone at Hollins for small things i do and that’s is very important to me. I found a family that is always ready ti stand by."
Sophomore,5,"Hollins is such an amazing university and I am glad to be part of their community. Hollins has taught me a lot since the first time I came. It has so many opportunities that allow me to grow academically, mentally, personally and professionally. The professor and faculty are extremely helpful, they try their best to make every student feel comfortable and at home. The best thing about Hollins is that it has such a close and connected community and is it easy to stay in contact or create networks."
Junior,5,"This is an awesome place! It feels like one huge family. Professors actually take the time to get to know their students and support them wherever they can. I had many great professors who helped me find internships, write applications, etc. I never feel lost here because I always know there is someone who can give me advice or knows someone else who can help me."
Senior,5,"Hollins has been a home for me for four years now, and I truly believe that I belong here, among these people. I hope that wherever I end up after graduation, I find people as honest, creative, and insightful as my peers here."
Freshman,5,"Hollins is such a wonderful place! Since coming to Hollins, I've grown so much. I've had opportunities to try things I never would have imagined myself doing, like climbing a mountain or taking a leadership class. I've also met so many amazing people and formed so many lifelong friendships. My professors have been excellent, they are so knowledgeable and it is clear that they really care that their students are learning and growing, both as students and as people. Hollins has really broadened my world and given me opportunities I never could have imagined before."
Junior,5,"I love Hollins so much and I am so glad that I chose to attend. The people I have met, from friends to professors to staff members, have all been so incredible and have changed my life for the better. I have learned and grown so much over the past three years at Hollins and I wouldn't give it up for anything. It really has been the perfect fit for me."
Freshman,5,"With a breathtaking campus complete with a mountain view, professors who know you personally, and opportunities galore, Hollins University has it all. Coming to this school was the best decision I could've made, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The people here care so much about my well-being and education and I never once feel alone or confused with all of the caring assistance provided to students. I have had the opportunity to expand my horizons by so much in just one semester, with things like piano lessons (at no extra cost to me), joining the tennis team, and participating in a variety of eye opening clubs and activities. Next year I'm even planning to study abroad, which is included in my tuition. Despite all this, the best part is the people. I've made the best friends I've ever had here, and even the professors and advisers care so much about me. I love being a part of the Hollins community because it is my home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"What do students do at Hollins? Amazing things! Outstanding  study abroad opportunities and internships galore. With determination, you can really make your own way at here. The BLI leadership program has made me feel so well prepared to intern and eventually enter grad school. Most students complete multiple internships and many double major. Visiting is the best way to get a feel for the campus to see if the school is a good fit. I am very happy with my choice to attend Hollins!"
Sophomore,5,"This school has created so many opportunities for me that I wouldn't get at another school. I had an internship my first year, plan on studying abroad, and have connected with alumnae that can help me with my career. Even in my day to day studies, I have already learned so much. This school is definitely worth the price. Not only is it a great academic school, but it's a beautiful campus. I have also created relationships and memories here that I will treasure for a long time."
Senior,5,"Attending Hollins University has been the best decision I have ever made. Not only are the academics superb, but I have made lifelong friends and memories. I have had the opportunity to complete internships that are relevant to my career path and along the way have made lasting connections in the field. My professors are incredibly supportive and push me to do my best. As a student looking to enter the STEM field, having the opportunity to conduct undergraduate research has been crucial. So thankful for my found family and all of the opportunities I've been given at this wonderful school."
Niche User,5,"Everyone that I've met that attends Hollins is very kind and friendly! The educational opportunities that would be available to me should I attend would be amazing. I love everything about the academics at Hollins, and the scenery is beautiful."
Freshman,5,I absolutely adore Hollins! The school has the best vibe to be inspired in and all of my teachers were so eager to help and actually teach me.
Alum,5,Excellent school-I made a lot of great connections and learned a lot. Especially love the riding program and team!
Freshman,5,"The best thing about Hollins university is their International Students Orientation Program(ISOP) which is a program exclusively for international students. In this program, they make sure all the international students are connected to the other senior international students so they can feel more comfortable in the college environment. They also have family dinners with their mentors and the dean every week where they discuss their insecurities and strengths which also helps them to blend into the new environment. There's always a sense of security with ISOP."
Freshman,5,"Such a close-knit and supportive community! I'm a first-year and I've already found a great friend group. My classes are challenging and professors are always willing and excited to answer questions or solve problems. The campus is gorgeous and pretty small, so walking between classes rarely takes longer than ten minutes."
Sophomore,5,"Hollins has allowed me the space to build my confidence and to become a comfortable leader. I know that no matter what I choose to do, I will be well equipped because of Hollins."
Freshman,5,"I love the peaceful and nature environment, eating with professors who are always willing to help or answer questions, and being a part of the amazing Hollins University family."
Sophomore,5,The amount of growth I have experienced at Hollins is unbelievable. I have learnt so much about myself and the world that I don’t think I could have learnt anywhere else. Hollins has given me a home and I do believe this is one of the safest places on earth. Everyone wants to see you succeed and that makes the work much more enjoyable. There is no place like Hollins.
Freshman,5,"Hollins quickly became a second home for me soon after I moved in. The small class sizes really allow for good relationships with your professors and fellow classmates. There is an emphasis on well-being, in addition to a variety of great academic opportunities. There are also so many opportunities to get involved with a wide range of organizations and, despite the relatively small number of students, there is always something happening on campus. I have met so many incredible friends and mentors here and, because of Hollins, I know I still have the opportunity to make so many more connections and good memories."
Senior,5,"Attending Hollins University has truly been one of the best decisions I have ever made. As a theater major Hollins has been able to provide my with ample opportunity to showcase my talent and be part of a wonderful and cohesive theatre department! Because of Hollins I have been able to Study abroad in London, have several prestigious internships, and network and meet with so many amazing professionals that i'm sure will help me in my post-grad job search. Additionally, the friendships I've made here are going to last a lifetime, I've met so many strong and amazing people that I would honestly do anything for! I cannot be more thankful for my experience at this school, it truly has been the best 4 years of my life!"
Senior,5,"The lifelong connections I have made at Hollins will guarantee me an amazing future, and I am forever grateful."
Freshman,5,Hollins I wonderful! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Hollins has a very strong support program for international students!
Senior,5,"Hollins University has singlehandedly been the driving force for me to become the strong and independent woman I am today. Without my academic research experiences or my ability to study abroad multiple times, I would be entirely different. I have found my second home and true family here at Hollins."
Senior,5,"I found my second home at Hollins University. I met amazing friends from all around the U.S and around the world as well. Hollins has given me the opportunity to travel abroad to Jamaica and Rome, Italy. It has given me the skills and knowledge necessary for my future career through its rigorous academic environment and leadership studies courses with the Batten Leadership Institute. I love that it is a small campus with small classes. I love that I practically know everyone that is part of the Hollins community. Hollins is located in Roanoke where there are lots of natural beauty that can be appreciated through hiking adventures to Carvin's Cove, Cascades Falls, McAfee Knob, Sharp Top Trail and more. Hollins has a lot to offer and I'm glad I chose to attend this beautiful school!"
Niche User,5,"Very great school! I really love it when I and my daughter came to campus. School's faculty and staff are super friendly and supportive. I am so proud that my daughter is accepted to be here with great people, where she will definitely grow strong and bright."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and atmosphere of Hollins and I couldn't imagine myself being anywhere else. I wish the school kept on more of their talented professors, and with the school being so small it can feel a little tight sometimes. But, I wouldn't trade my experience for another."
Senior,5,"Hollins was the perfect fit for me because of how small and academically focused the school is. Hollins is also very accommodating, especially in situations that are completely out of your control. I really feel Hollins has helped me become a better version of myself!"
Graduate Student,5,"Hollins University is an environment that encourages you to discover your true potential. It is where you can self actualize, develop your own artistic voice, and articulate profound ideas."
Freshman,5,This school is amazing. The experience here is so unique and so fun. Academics aren't overly stressful and the professors want you to succeed! I'm so glad I decided to come here.
College Freshman,5,No two people have the same political or religious views and that's okay. We are taught to encourage the diversity and tolerance of others.
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are very small, which is great for me because I don't feel drowned out by people. Professors are passionate people, that are exceedingly friendly. As for courses, there's no excuse to not have classes that interest the student because there are hundreds of classes available."
College Freshman,5,"The community is very supportive, and alumni are active in aiding with internships/job opportunities."
College Freshman,5,This is the only place I feel safe walking out in the middle of the night to play Pokemon Go.
College Freshman,5,"A great variety of places to live, enough to space to move around, and have your own area."
College Freshman,5,"This is a place, that can be called home and an amazing place to branch off into your future career."
College Freshman,5,"Sports are big at Hollins, we try hard to win."
College Sophomore,5,The school is like a family to me and the traditions are my absolute favorite part. Hollins is such an open environment with so much room to change and grow.
College Freshman,5,"Our school has 24/7 security as well as CASA volunteers in case sexual assault ever does happen. I have never heard of a case happening on campus, which has been a huge relief to me. Teachers and administration is also very aware of sexual assault and how some students have been victims. They try to make sure those students feel safe as well."
College Freshman,5,"The quality of the alumni work is amazing. Being a Hollins student allows you access to specialized interships during Short term and we have a Career conference to help bring alum and students even closer together. This year started the first Homecoming event, where alum were invited to come back to campus as well. I'm at Hollins because one of my teachers is an alum."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here at Hollins. I'm glad that I ended up choosing to come here. It was a great way to transition from high school into college.
College Freshman,5,I have felt extremely safe on campus. It's perfectly safe to walk around on campus at night. There are red phones around campus that a student can call security if they are feeling unsafe at any time. There is a sexual assault community on campus that help victims and students alike deal with the issue.
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Hollins University has been amazing! My classes are all extremely interesting and the professors are all extremely helpful and engaging with their students. Everyone at Hollins has been welcoming and friendly; of course, there is the usual drama that a person encounters at school, but this has not affected my experience at all. I love my education that I'm getting here."
College Freshman,5,My overall experience at Hollins has been absolutely amazing.
College Senior,5,I love this school. I get to play two sports while attending classes. I found friends for life at this school!
College Junior,5,"As a senior in high school, eager to pursue the next phase in my academic future, I searched for a university that valued individualized experiences. I wanted to be a part of a community that facilitated student dialogue and personalized relationships between students, faculty, and staff. As a junior at Hollins University, a private women's liberal arts school, I have found that supportive community that fosters individual growth at an accelerated level through leadership and professional opportunities. I have passionately become involved with the Student Government Association and am now President! Attending Hollins is like winning the lottery. Be bold. Be different. Be revolutionary. At Hollins, it's encouraged."
College Junior,5,"The financial aid office is very good at making sure each student gets as much aid as possible based on her needs, and are always helpful when you have questions about things like work study opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms on campus are wonderful. The first-year dorm building has air conditioning and heating units with a thermostt that students can adjust in their own rooms. The mattresses in all of the buildings are actual quality mattresses -- some of the dorm buildings even have box springs with the mattresses. The price tag from the mattresses in the first year dorm  say they cost about $430 (it's a really nice quality mattress). The dorms are huge as well, at least twice the size of most public college dorms. Dorms also come with a nice closet and dresser with mirrors. The housing process is pretty simple since the university is so willing to work with people, but since it is a private school, the housing cost is a bit higher than a public institution (though financial aid is readily available for that)."
College Freshman,5,I've meet so many people from different places.
College Freshman,5,Super diverse and friendly people here! I love it!
College Freshman,5,There is so much diversity on campus and everyone at Hollins is really accepting.
College Freshman,5,"The people are fantastic, and there's a lot of dancing and fun going along, and I love it!"
College Freshman,5,The entire science department is great. The professors are all very invested in the students success.
College Freshman,5,All the science professors are great and super helpful.
College Freshman,5,There is no notice of any drugs
College Freshman,5,The financial aid office here is the best! I honestly would not be here if it weren't for them and their help!
Niche User,4,"Hollins university is a really small college in the city of Roanoke. The counselors and professors are helpful, they quickly answer you. They have many majors to choose from and also an interesting variety of languages that you can learn. 
Unfortunately, they have not been clear about their scholarships and loans offer. All in all is a valid option for college."
Sophomore,4,"It was difficult switching to online classes, but the teachers were very good about answering questions and helping their students."
Sophomore,4,It is a very nice tight knit community and you really get to know all of your teachers and fellow students.  The faculty are very engaging and I love all of my professors.
Freshman,4,Hollins has a good program for someone looking for a small intimate experience.  It is a beautiful campus and the diversity is wonderful for a small college.  I was having a great time and an enriching learning experience befroe Covid-19
Senior,4,Hollins offers a small campus feel with opportunity to know everyone. The vast majority of the professors really do care about their students and want to see them succeed. Hollins has had a good amount of trouble with choosing a good president which has been a struggle and caused much turmoil over my past four years here which is the only reason why I don’t give Hollins 5 stars. I’m an English major and Hollins is known best for its English program. I can say that it was exactly the kind of English experience I wanted and needed to be ready to go into the work force. Hollins’s career center and alumni network are also second to none. They’ve done a fantastic job preparing and easing me into the real world and life after college.
Sophomore,4,"I love how everyone is so supportive and ready to help each other. Being an international student, I never felt like I don't belong here. There's so many opportunities if you look for it!"
Freshman,4,Best school for inspired young women who want to bring change to the world! The small class sizes allows students to get individualized attention from their professors and strengthens interactions among peers.
Freshman,4,There is a really positive atmosphere. In the short time I’ve been there I’ve seen a lot of the traditions thus far and it’s a very inclusive community where you’re able to be yourself. It feels very safe too.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman and so far I am having a great time. The students are amazing and I have connected with almost all of my professors so well. I am delighted to be here.
Junior,4,"I love it here at Hollins, it's my home away from home. The campus is so pretty at all times of the year.  You never know what you might find and may end up befriending one of the many squirrels that hang out all over campus. 

 The small class sizes are really great, because you get to know your professors really well and they truly can become a mentor. The professors are super understanding too and they try to make themselves as accessible to you as they can.

I never imagined what being on a team at Hollins would mean. I never imagined myself to be with some the most supportive and amazing group of girls.  Our coach is great too, he gives us so much and support and really strives to make the swim team the best it can be. He is only our biggest supporter in and out of the pool. 

I don't think I could be where I am and have the experiences I have had, if I had not came to Hollins."
Senior,4,"Hollins is one of the closest-knit communities I've been a part of. This has made my college experience very enjoyable as I know almost all students, I am close with my professors and also the staff. The professors, especially, care very much about the students because classes are small and they know us personally. This also ensures that if anything comes up in our personal lives, the university is very accommodating towards our needs. Everyone is cheerful all the time and super easy to talk to. The environment is not intimidating as a result and you can easily find your people."
Junior,4,"There's plenty wrong with Hollins: the awful food, the limited scheduling availability, the everyone-knows-everyone atmosphere. But there's also some pretty amazing things about Hollins: the one-on-one you get with your professors, the ability to get help from counselors, the ability to talk straight to the dean and president, how easy it is to get our voices heard and be a part of the change. The connections you make, with friends and careers, is not comparable on any level."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I’ve liked the school minus the social unrest of the people in it. The teachers are polite and helpful when it’s needed and the student on campus are mostly friendly and open to new people"
Junior,4,"I like going to Hollins a lot, especially as an English major. I feel that I have gotten a lot of encouragement and fantastic feedback that has helped me as a writer; the faculty is wonderful at working with you one-on-one, especially since the class sizes are so small. The campus environment is so lovely. You will meet some of the kindest and most brilliant women in the world here, and the overall vibe of Hollins is so welcoming and fun. It's a beautiful campus, and so quiet which I personally love. However, there is something to be desired with how the university itself handles diversity. While this has not affected me personally, I have seen marginalized students struggle to have their voices be heard. In addition, it can be hard to feel challenged to some degree because the work is mostly holistic (I am in a lot of creative classes). Besides that, I feel that I have learned a lot and been challenged as a free-thinking individual."
Junior,4,"I like Hollins because the classes are good and the tight community is nice. However, when it comes to student needs (especially financial issues), administration is not so helpful or willing to provide assistance."
Alum,4,"Hollins is a great place to grow. The professors are absolutely excellent and as a student you will have plenty of opportunities to get to know them. Being able to really get to know your professors (and have them get to know you!) is a huge educational advantage. My friends who went to bigger schools often ran into problems in their large classes because they could only ask the TAs for help, couldn't get a recommendation early in college, and didn't have very much advising early on. At Hollins, professors are your champions. They go to great lengths to make sure you can succeed. As an alum, I have friendships with my professors that have lasted for years. 

At Hollins, you'll experience a sisterhood. The campus and traditions are some of the oldest in the nation. It feels really special to be part of a history of women's education.  You'll really miss the environment when you graduate, even if sometimes it can feel a little small when you are there."
Junior,4,I honestly love Hollins. The professors are amazing and really have a passion for the subjects being taught. The campus is really homey and everyone is really supportive.
Junior,4,"My favorite part of the campus is the campus itself and the professors. Settled right by the mountains, the small campus is so beautiful that it itself was enough reason to apply. In my time here I've gotten the chance to meet many wonderful professors and the small class sizes really help."
Freshman,4,"Hollins is a wonderful environment to live and learn in! There is a real sense of community; the history and quirkiness of the school only add to the charm. While the faculty and staff are incredibly caring and attentive. There are also a ton of opportunities on and off campus. Roanoke is a great location in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains which provides endless hiking trails and outdoor areas to explore, and downtown is just a quick drive from campus as well, there really is something for everyone.  The number of clubs, organizations, and activities on campus is incredible considering the schools size.  Academically the student to teacher ratio is awesome, I love knowing all my Professors personally and having them know me. Professors really seem to care about your thoughts and want you to be involved in class. They will really go out of their way in order to insure you have the best experience possible."
Junior,4,"Hollins is a very small university and I think that it is better in some majors than others. For instance, their creative writing, dance and theater programs are amazinggg. But they are slacking in other areas such as business. Because the school is so small and does not offer much on campus, they do really well with making sure students get really good internships and give them places to stay oo which is amazing. I did an internship in NYC and I stayed on 34th St in Manhattan for no extra cost. They also have AMAZING study abroad program. I studied in London for a semester and it was NO extra cost. They make sure you have a place to stay and can provide you with an internship there too. These are the small things that I think really make Hollins a great university because these opportunities are not readily available at many other colleges."
Junior,4,"The academics at this institution are stellar. I feel I have grown not only as a scholar, but as a person. Everyone wants to see you succeed and are willing to do whatever necessary to help you on your way."
Freshman,4,"The average class size is about 10 students, so it is easy to discuss in a class and communicate with professors."
Junior,4,"I think it’s a good space for learning. I love the campus, the atmosphere is truly beautiful. I am glad that I made my choice to attend here. It is located in Roanoke/ Hollins area that is close enough to the mall area and being secluded in the blue ridge mountains."
Junior,4,"I love Hollins because it serves as a safe space for its students and faculty. It's more like a community rather than an average university of passing strangers. There are some great people at Hollins, but as an institution of capitalism, it's just another college looking out for itself."
Sophomore,4,"Hollins have small campus, so even if you get up 10 minutes before your class, if you move fast enough, you can actually get to class before it starts. Also since it's a small college, you get to know people quickly. Food is average, 100% better than high school meals.( for the most of the times, they do give out Mexican food.) Generally roanoke is a small town, there is really nothing see other than hiking tinker Mt."
Sophomore,4,"Wonderful small liberal arts school, supportive professors, beautiful campus. The career center in particular is an invaluable resource."
Sophomore,4,"It has a very welcoming community and for the most part the teachers are great, the food isn't too bad, but the health center is definitely lacking. Sports are great though!"
Senior,4,I love the area. Beautiful campus and great professors that are interested and care about your education and your future. The food is amazing and they have a great variety.
Freshman,4,"I love the education and opportunities I am receiving at Hollins. Each professor is personable and helpful. Overall, I don't want to be anywhere else."
Freshman,4,A very open and supportive community that helps students find their voice as well as the platform to express their ideas/opinions. I enjoy the beautiful campus atmosphere and opportunities on and around campus.
Niche User,4,"I loved the aesthetic of the campus! It's a beautiful area to go to school in, and the class sizes are small. However, the classes still feel like they are on high-school level thinking rather than as complex as a seminar at a college typically is. This may be good or bad depending on how you prefer to learn. Great scholarship opportunities! Air conditioning is out in some buildings."
College Freshman,4,Not a sports person but school spirit for winning a game is very high. If that makes any sense.
College Freshman,4,I love one on one time with professors. They really seem to care about each person individually.
College Freshman,4,"Generally okay, but things can slip though."
College Freshman,4,"Small classes, good courses, and fun people."
College Sophomore,4,"My professors surprised me with not only their passion but their involvement in helping their students succeed. All of the professors that I have had so far, have been very supportive with all of their students and try their best to help us pass their classes. My professors were also very, very understanding about my pregnancies and how that could have affected my attendance or their no phones policy, but I was never absent more than 3 times in any class and neither did I allow my phone to interrupt class even after my son was born."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe, personally, that I am extremely safe on this campus. I have come home at 11pm and later from work and have never felt threatened; keeping in mind that I was a petite, 4 feet 10 in tall pregnant woman. Security guards roam the campus 24 hours a day, even those late hours after work. The only time I have ever felt a need to need extra protection was in the aftermath of a swastika painted over our welcoming rock, and that wasn't fear of other students but outsiders. In which students from our campus responded with in the most caring way by offering to be walk buddies for anyone who needed one."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is very intimate and loving from the professors, students, to the staff members. I was the only pregnant freshman in my class, and even though I felt like I was going to ostracized for being not only being young and pregnant, but Black; I was not. Hollins loves their students and does their best to resolve the issues that we stumble upon."
College Student,4,I have not attended a sports game at school yet.
College Student,4,I haven't started school yet but I love it so far!
College Sophomore,4,"The room sizes very for upperclassmen. The first-year's though have really spacious rooms. It just depends on how lucky you get sometimes, but even the small ones are still pretty roomy. I just like to appreciate whichever room I live in."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not very into the sports teams on campus, but a lot of people are involved and there are a lot of supporters. Even when Hollins doesn't win a game, we still move forward and support each other. It's not the end of the world when a team loses."
College Freshman,4,Security is very accessible and helpful on campus.
College Freshman,4,I really love everything about Hollins. Classes are kept to small sizes and that really helps with the quality of learning.
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is amazing, and there are plenty of opportunities to get in contact with them."
College Freshman,4,I love being a part of Hollins Athletics. I am a captain of the swim team and the team helped me integrate into college life and really helped me immerse into the Hollins atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,I absolutely love it at Hollins and I couldn't have picked a better school. There is such a strong community here and lots of opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus because everything is only a couple minute walk. I leave my dorm and I'm right next to one of the buildings I have class in, and the Main Office is only a couple yards farther than that. I see my peers and my professors every day during lunch, which allows for us to grow as a community. The housing activities also allow for that community building. I'm friends with most of the people I live with, and if we aren't friends, we get along."
College Freshman,4,"Hollins is an amazing all women's college. The environment is friendly and the teachers know everyone by name. The classes are super interesting and there are so many opportunities to get internships, work study and study abroad. So many Hollins Alum have become successful in their fields, and even come back to Hollins for a Career Conference to meet with current students and make connections. The English program is one of the best in the country, and the theatre department is in the top 20 in the country according to the Princton review. It's just a great liberal arts school."
College Freshman,4,"I live in the freshman dorm, and my area has been great. I live right by the exit door, so I have to deal with noise sometimes, but it is manageable. The dorm is at the back of campus, but it is literally a five minute walk to classes. The RA's are very friendly and sociable, and some dorm halls are better than others people-wise, but the facility is good."
College Freshman,4,"We don't have any fraternities or sororities on campus. We are honestly one, big, sisterhood and it's the best!"
College Freshman,4,"I am not part of any sports, but everyone here has had team spirit from what I've seen. Hollins has won numerous awards in all sport areas from what I've seen, and the teams all support each other. Some girls in one team are on another team, so the sports are for anyone who wants to do them. The athletic facilities are great and I enjoy going to the gym everyday."
College Freshman,4,"The school itself is good. The teachers and staff, the ones I have encountered anyway, are wonderful and really care about the students. The teachers want the students to succeed, and they try their best to help the students who are struggling but they are also fair and if the student is not making a real effort they leave the student to make their own way, even if that way is do academic probation. I love all the opportunities that are offered here, including the study abroad and internships. I feel safe on campus, but not always comfortable. The fact that the school is all girls is good for most, but not for me. I feel it does not offer enough of a world view and that the all girl factor can cause problems. Academically this school is top notch, offering lots of interesting courses. If this school was coed it would be perfect."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of different types of sexual orientation on campus and Hollins is good about accepting everyone.
College Freshman,4,"The academics are great. The professors care about their students, for the most part and they work hard to make sure that you understand what they're going over in class. You really feel a part of everything here."
College Freshman,4,"Here at Hollins, I feel the safest that I ever have. It's a warm and open campus that encourages the promotion of safety and safe places."
College Freshman,4,I have not had much involvement with the Athletic department but what I have seen of it is really great. We may not be the best team out there but we sure make up for it in school spirit and cooperation.
College Sophomore,4,Great community. Very supportive people. Almost all identity groups are represented though by strictly numbers there are not a lot of large percentages of minority groups excepting women and LGBT. Very small college and a gorgeous campus. Hollins is definitely a university for those aiming to go somewhere.
College Junior,4,"Hollins University is the school where woman graduate and leave as strong, passionate leaders and very-well educated decision makers. Hollins is a unique place where hundreds of woman with different backgrounds come together as friends, a community, and as a family. No one is left to struggle on their own; whether it be a personal problem or an educational problem; there is always a person(s) that will reach out and help with anything. The closeness with everyone on campus; students, faculty, and staff; is amazing. The faculty and staff are more interactive than any other college I have been too. And that is from the time interest is shown until way after one graduates. Not to mention the crazy traditions Hollins, talk about unique. The most favorable and memorable is Tinker Day. The date is only known to the President and on one random morning in October, classes are cancelled, and calls are made to commuters, dorms and apartments are raided. Everyone dresses up in the wackiest costumes and meets for a delicious breakfast, then everyone climbs Tinker Mountain and at the top is a picnic lunch. The day is spent uniting students, faculty, and staff...how much better could it get?"
College Sophomore,4,"Hollins is a beautiful school. The atmosphere, the women, the administration. I'm so happy with it."
Junior,2,"Most faculty and staff are really nice, some are pretty awful.  They fire people they should keep and keep ones they should fire. 
Not happy with recent policy changes either."
Niche User,2,"I am currently transferring out of Hollins University as a transgender student and film student. 

The school is a women's college and therefore does not cater to any transgender or non-binary individuals. While I had a positive experience with some faculty and some student organizations such as the film program or the student government (I participated in Student Government's Roundtable group), overall I had a very negative experience. 

Prospective students who are women and a part of the LGB community may find themselves a safe haven, but I would not say this is true for transgender students. The school is still processing the possibility of allowing transgender women in, processing as the Board of Trustees has not yet allowed for trans women to be let in. 

Positive elements I can think of include the university's almnae relations through the annual alumni conference titled ""C3""."
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a car, however I do have quite a few friends who do, and I can see that campus parking is a little difficult."
College Freshman,2,"Hollins uses Cisco, and the network as a whole is very slow, and the students have to log in almost constantly. It's the only really bad thing about the college, though."
College Freshman,2,"The closest thing we have to ""Greek life"" is ADA. They are extremely selective and no one even knows what they do."
College Freshman,2,The only time I wish I went to a bigger school is when I'm sitting in my room alone on a Saturday night when my friends at other colleges are instagramming pics of their school's parties.
College Junior,2,"Students are not allowed to live off campus unless they have a special exemption, i.e. they're married or have a child/children or already live within a certain distance to the school and commute. In that case, they fall into a special category of application, called a Commuter Student. Horizon students also typically live off campus, but again, exception to the rule. 

As a standard undergrad living on campus I cannot answer related questions on off-campus housing."
College Freshman,2,"Boring campus, and no co-ed things "
College Freshman,2,"Its nice to know i always don't have to worry about guys trying to sneak into my dorm or something since its all girls, but sometimes it would be nice to have it co-ed because it can be too much being surrounded by only girls all the time."
College Freshman,2,"Since i'm under twenty-one right now i don't know what the alcohol prices and variety look like, but i've heard that the parties are really good."
College Freshman,2,"They try to offer different options to those who are vegan, vegetarian and have to have gluten free meals, but the overall quality of the food is not that exciting and the hours are not that flexible sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"I received a great financial aid package from Hollins, the people in the financial aid office are very helpful and do what they can to help you but if you don't stay on them and let them know the money they think you and your parents have to pay for Hollins is not there then I will be a struggle. This past fall semester I had to have my grandfather call in and try to help me receive extra fin aid a week before I was suppose to go back to school."
College Sophomore,2,"the parking is terrible!  they are all kind of far from classes and dorms, they have no problem hadning out tickets if you are improperly parked. A car on campus isnt necessary if you stay on campus a alot but if you like to travel and go place it is nice to have. Parking spaces are too hard to come by"
College Freshman,2,"We have multiple parking lots available to the entire community. However, get  those headphones out, or bring a friend with you, because you will have quite a walk getting to your car."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a limited choice of food. I've had to switch to eating some types of meat because of the lack of options. The hours are weird. It is not the most healthy choice, but it's all that the school has."
College Senior,2,Hollins is on the outskirts of town.  There are no trains.  You do best catching a ride with someone or calling a cab.  The campus shuttle is available at times.
College Senior,2,"As a graduate student, I have not gotten much help with scholarships, though I probably haven't pursued it enough. Their system of receiving loan money awarded to you is a little ambiguous and frustrating. Every time you receive more loan money, you have to go into the office and apply for a refund, even if you have been set up for direct deposit."
College Freshman,2,"The only off-campus housing option is to live in the apartments across the street from campus. Which is fairly convienient, finding an easily accessible apartment in Roanoke close to Hollins is not very likely."
College Freshman,2,"Oh Siberia – Why must the parking lot be all the way out past the dorms? Pain in the behind with guests, and worse in the winter, with the cold."
College Senior,2,"Up until my last year financial aid seemed to help out a lot. But since I transferred in a bunch of credits when I came to the school, my last year I only had to go half-time. So I did not recieve a lot of aid and my parents was not eligable to increase their ""parent-plus loan"" not even for the minimum $5000 that we needed. I have to find a way to come out of pocket to pay that amount. It didn't matter how great my fathers credit was...they would not allow it!"
Freshman,1,"None of my classes were on-line, then they all went to on-line.  It wasn't the best because the professors haven't done it before and Hollins is designed to be a seminar style learning environment."
Sophomore,1,"I will NEVER step foot on campus again. Hollins University is full of rude admissions people. They say they give you a “great scholarship” but end up having to pay a bunch of money either way. My team and i were sexually harassed by a coach at this school, HE IS STILL THERE. We have shown proof and several girls quit because of his actions. He was never put on probation. They never tried to do anything about it, considering it happened 6 months ago. I have transferred and i know several other girls will be due to the fact of this. The dorms are disgusting, need remodeling.  Roanoke is sketch, not safe and there is nothing ever to do."
College Freshman,1,Hollins University does not allow students to live off-campus unless they are a commuter or have family that lives within an hour from the university.
College Senior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Senior,1,minorities get the short end of the stick
College Senior,1,they give you so much money to get retention up
College Senior,1,wifi lags and CISCO SUCKS
College Senior,1,only a party once a month
College Senior,1,Roanoke is sketchy and hollins security is open so anyone can get into Hollins
College Senior,1,"no one knows hollins exists so no discounts or recognition, Roanoke is filled with V Tech stuff"
College Senior,1,Just commute if you live near by  or transfer to speciality in the spring
College Freshman,1,"Our school cafeteria is run by the Sodexo catering company. To be frank, it sucks, simply because of its lack of variety and catering to students with special health needs. However, one should always anticipate special visits from guests, parents or prospective students, knowing that the Moody Center will flourish into top-notch restaurant standard. When those days are gone, we suffer."
College Freshman,1,"Drug abuse is uncommon on this campus, as most students choose to practice a fairly substance free lifestyle (with the exception of alcohol). The percentage of drug users on campus is incredibly small, and are well-known throughout the school. The most common drugs used are marijuana and alcohol (in addition to study drugs such as Adderall). If you do use drugs, you are highly unlikely to be reported, unless you are incredibly blatant and careless with your usage; and if you choose to be substance free, you need not worry about peer pressure and exclusion in your decisions."
College Freshman,1,"Hollins is not the most athletically-inclined school. We have a fairly commendable swim team and our equestrian is nationally-acclaimed, however our general sports/athletics teams pale in comparison to the average college. Most games, you will find, lack fan support, and students/coaches have to constantly beg students to join teams just to stay up and live. Our teams themselves, however, are very close-knit, and if you come to the school simple for the athletics, know that you will be one of the happiest students on campus."
College Junior,1,Country Strong – This town is tiny even though Roanoke is supposed to be a large city. It is filled with lots of country minded people and not very progressive. There is not a whole lot to do and almost zero options for shopping.
College Sophomore,1,"The professors try to be nice, but since this school is heavily research-oriented, most professors seem to consider teaching a secondary job. This shows in their lack of enthusiasm toward their classes. I've visited other colleges and have seen a higher number of professors who can teach in a way that helps students understand. In our professors' defense, there are some who do try and have interesting and challenging courses."
College Sophomore,1,few have cars no busses or trains bring you own car
College Sophomore,1,you need to have a high act or sat score no less then 26 on act or at least 600 on each sat sub score
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is hactic. If you live on campus there is a parking lot for students that seems like its a mile away (Siberia, as we call it) but its so far away we hate walikng to and from it."
College Sophomore,1,Fatty Food Rush – Imagine what limited vegetables taste like if the fatty fast food is gross. I recommend going off the meal plan.

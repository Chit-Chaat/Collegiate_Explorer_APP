Sophomore,5,Professors handled this with grace and made the transition very well. UNI made sure we all had the tools to do our classes online and succeed and were accessible for questions if we had any.
Sophomore,5,I love UNI. The people are very kind and the professors are invested in your education and care about teaching. Very high-quality instructors and lots of opportunities to get involved.
Junior,5,"Online learning has been a challenge, but all my teachers are handling it well. They all have educated themselves on Zoom and can use it effectively so during our class sessions we can focus on learning instead of trying to figure technological problems. When those issues do sometimes come up, the teachers handle those well and work around them well too. They use break out rooms sometimes as well so we can talk to our classmates and still connect to people even though we can't interact in person. I only have one on campus class, but the teacher has made it available on Zoom as well so if any of the students are worried, they can still attend class from home. Overall, the school has incorporated online learning excellently."
Junior,5,"I've only been here for a short time, but so far my experience has been great. The campus itself is so pretty and well kept, and it's not too difficult to find your way around. My classes are all good even though most of them are online and my teachers are good and seem passionate about what they're teaching. Other staff members that I've interacted with have been very nice and helpful as well."
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors communicated with us (the students) to see which format of online learning would help us best. They made themselves available for extra office hours and answered emails with any questions/concerns we had almost instantly. Most professors changed the testing format to something that would be easier for us due to the interruption in our lives, some of them getting rid of testing in general. Extra resources, if proven helpful, were provided to us, as well as additional and more in-depth study aids."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at UNI studying Biology, and I fall in love with it more and more each day. My advisor reached out and helped me before I even started classes as a freshman, and continues to help me with any questions/concerns I have. The science department is small in comparison to other state schools, but provides high quality education and hands-on experience to its students. All of my professors make themselves available for office hours and are willing to schedule other times if those don't work. I work on campus, and they are very diligent about working around my course schedule and ensuring that academics do come first. I also got involved with Greek Life, which has greatly enriched my experience and introduced me to some amazing people. This school is absolutely amazing and I am so thankful I get to attend!"
Junior,5,"Easy transition even with the coronavirus going on. They have helped me in every situation needed. They helped me on my student loans, and they were fast about getting my transfer credits in."
Junior,5,"I have to take classes online due to the coronavirus. The professor of the class is very helpful. Everything you need is online on their website, if you can't find it call them and they can further assist you."
Junior,5,"My experience at UNI has been amazing so far! I look forward to going back every fall semester because it is such a great place to be. The professors, faculty, and staff that all work on campus are so helpful and hands on with your education. There are so many resources available on campus with tutors, rentals, private study rooms and many other things that are constantly available to students. UNI always puts on fun activities for students on campus for study breaks. The overall place of UNI is amazing because it is not too big and not too small, everything is within walking distance and that is especially good for the dining centers."
Sophomore,5,"So far through my semester due to covid many classes were moved online, all professors were willing to help and the classes seem to be very easy online as well"
Sophomore,5,"The professors are very welcoming and willing to make sure you’re passing not only are the staff caring but many of the organizations are, these orgs are like a family"
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love UNI! This university not only has a beautiful campus but amazing programs and staff! I wouldn't change anything about this school!
Sophomore,5,Feels like home. Not too big and not too small. Lot of organizations to get involved with and lots of opportunities to network and gain experience
Junior,5,"Overall, I would highly recommend University of Northern Iowa. During my personal academic experience here, faculty and staff have been very available and flexible with helping me figure out what classes to take, as well as how to prepare for future jobs and such. The overall atmosphere is very friendly, and feels very personalized for a public college. Lastly, the class sizes are also a bit smaller than typical public colleges, which has allowed me to have a better sense of involvement within the classroom setting."
Niche User,5,"I really like the atmosphere. The first time I visited the college I knew it the collage for me. I like how helpful everyone is there. If I have any questions there is always someone who is willing to answer. They also have a lot of options for scholarships. I went to an art scholarship. I was a loads of fun. We made a collage and then we had a mini exhibition at the end. Every tour I have been on everyone has been so nice. I would recommend at least visiting or looking into UNI. I would strongly recommend going there, Especially if you are going into business or education."
Freshman,5,"Helpful faculty, caring staff, and a wonderful environment to be in if you are social. There's plenty of on-campus options for groups and extra curricular activities, making UNI a great place to be 100% of the time"
Junior,5,"Wonderful teachers in my major, but taking the right teacher for LAC's is very important. The Study abroad program is a must."
Niche User,5,I am transferring to UNI! I’ve been very busy at the college I attend now but UNI makes it very easy for me to stay in contact with the advisers.
Junior,5,I love the small town feel of the University of Northern Iowa. It is also small enough that you can have personal connections with your professors.
Freshman,5,"UNI is an overall great school, it is the perfect size- not too big and not too small. Even though it is a public school it still has that small town charm because of its location in Cedar Falls. And the pricing is very affordable, it is one of the cheapest schools in Iowa."
Senior,5,"I have gone here for the last two years. I also went here for a week during my second semester of college, but I left because I decided to change my major. But I loved it for the one week I did go here, and I actually loved it enough for it to bring me back. I had a brain tumor removed from my brain stem when I was sixteen, and it has had a huge effect on my academics. I have many side effects since the surgery, but the one that is the hardest to manage is that I have double vision. I have double vision because the doctors cut through the nerve that controls eye movement when they were doing the surgery. But I still had 4 eye surgeries after my brain surgery to try to correct my double vision, but none were successful. But the best thing that this college does is allow me to get help ANYTIME I need it."
Senior,5,"To me, UNI is the perfect size for someone who doesn't want a giant school where you're but a number despite what they say but also not the size of a high school where everyone knows everyone's business. UNI fits right in the middle as both big enough to get the full college experience but small enough to feel valued and heard. Not only is the campus beautiful and spacious, but the staff and professors provide an inviting and kind atmosphere that makes you feel at home. The staff also strives to give you the best education you can by aiding you in decisions like class schedules, graduation requirements, and anything in between to help you get the most out of your time here at UNI. Student life though not as crazy as larger schools, encourages involvement in clubs and sports in order to create a network for yourself in regards to future careers or merely making friends. Overall, UNI has its students in mind and wants what is best for them, every single one."
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience at the University of Northern Iowa so far! They have opportunities for everyone! The student organizations are a great way to meet people and gain experiences that are hard to find elsewhere. The campus size is great! It is big enough to feel like you are getting the college experience but small enough that the walk to class is typically at most 10 minutes. The on campus living is also wonderful! I have made lots of great connections with students and faculty at this organization!
Sophomore,5,UNI is a great place for your first college experience.  Its a big town with that small-town feel.  The campus is compact making getting to class very easy.  There is always something fun to do and something to learn.
Graduate Student,5,It was a smaller campus for a university which made it feel comfortable and inclusive. I really enjoyed the open minded community of students and campus is beautiful during the fall.
Sophomore,5,"I have been at UNI for a year and I love the environment, campus, facilities, and professors. The tuition freeze has been really nice on my bank account too."
Alum,5,My experience in this university is very great. I love the strong relationships that both professors and students have. They are always there to help you and ready to work with you in every step of your way. I love the safety environment of the school and the facilities that the school has made available for students. Most especially the excellent library. Being in this university is like being in your home and family. I wish that the school made a bit of changes on spacing of the school houses and dooms. Thanks. I strongly recommend this university for every one.
Alum,5,Loved my time at UNI. Enjoyed being able to get involved in different clubs and organizations. Great study abroad adventures!
Freshman,5,"I like how the campus is smaller than most other in state campuses, so I never feel like I am walking forever to get to class and I never have to worry about getting lost. I wish that the dining centers would not be changing their hours next year though."
Alum,5,"UNI is a FANTASTIC school to attend. Professors at the school are genuinely interested and invested in your success. The community has plenty to do, there are tons of activities on campus, and when you step onto campus it truly feels like it's own little community and feels like home."
Junior,5,"The classes are the suitable size for engaging in classroom discussion and for getting to know your peers on a personal level. The professors get to know their students and are always available for help. Additionally, for being a smaller state school, the University of Northern Iowa has a large array of classes and organizations for student involvement."
Junior,5,The University of Northern Iowa has so many events and activities to go to and I love the atmosphere. The teachers are very welcoming and I look forward to finishing my biology degree here!
Junior,5,The University of Northern Iowa provides an outstanding education. This university is the perfect size which allows you to get involved in many extracurricular activities. You will quickly feel like you belong and will be proud to call the University of Northern Iowa your home.
Alum,5,"This is the perfect place with a small town feel but access to bigger cities! The weather is sub-par, but the people make up for it!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at University of Northern Iowa has been great. I've gotten involved in campus organizations which helped my transition from home to college life. The professors I've had have always been more than willing to accommodate things for their students when necessary. I've really enjoyed the campus overall, everything is in close proximity so it doesn't take long to get places quickly. I would like to see more diversity on campus, although it's not something that's absent either. However, I think the more diversity you have, the more opportunities there are to grow and learn from others."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and positivity at this place. Everyone is super friendly here and there's always someone who love to help you if you ever need anything.
Junior,5,I love the staff and the small campus feel of the school. It's a great place to stay everyone is able to be there for you if there is any problems. The campus has great food and housing. Teachers are easily
Sophomore,5,"The University of Northern Iowa is a smaller university, where you have a better chance of getting to know your peers and professors. There are a variety of clubs to get involved in that fit everyone's interests. If there isn't you can create your own club! I have felt more comfortable talking with my professors and truly have met some of the greatest people at this University!"
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. The faculty are amazing and the campus is beautiful. The professors genuinely care about their students and want them to succeed. The class sizes are generally small, meaning you're able to get one on one attention from the professor when you need it."
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience at UNI thus far. The faculty and staff are excellent in assisting students with anything and are typically quick to respond whenever you send an email. Everyone is friendly and there's something for everyone.
Senior,5,Uni is my home. I’ve become a member of a community so much bigger than campus or cedar falls. UNI is well known across the country and I know that just graduating from Uni gives me a village of support and a network of connections.
Niche User,5,I like the University of Northern Iowa a lot. I like the amount of things that are covered at the university with your tution
Sophomore,5,University of Northern Iowa is a fantastic school. With a 16:1 student to faculty ratio you feel more than just a number. UNI takes pride in taking care of their students and making UNI an inclusive campus. UNI is and always will be my home and family.
Sophomore,5,"I'm only a sophomore, but I absolutely love it here. The classes aren't too terribly big, which is nice because I was intimidated by the thought of large class sizes. All of my professors have been really nice so far, and the food at the dining center is actually pretty good."
Graduate Student,5,"Beautiful campus with everything within a 10 minute walking distance. Classes easily reachable from anywhere on campus. Great dinning facilities, recreational spaces, events, educational assistance and tutor programs, and plenty of educational resources. There are plenty of places to live on and off of campus that help you connect with other students."
Sophomore,5,"There is an great community here at UNI. Everyone you talk to is very welcoming and always willing to answer questions. I've made some of my best friends here at UNI through classes, organizations and activities."
Junior,5,"The University of Northern Iowa truly has a bit of everything for everyone. While it is the smallest state school in Iowa, it is one of the most unique schools in the Midwest. As you walk onto the campus, you can truly feel the warmth and closeness of the community through both the school and the atmosphere of those who inhabit it. The dorms allow for that homey feel, and is never far from any dining center. The classrooms offer fun and intricate professors who will guide you through your academic journey. And the night life is almost as exciting as what goes on during the day; offering many restaurants, bars, clubs, stores, and parks. The University of Northern Iowa has a bit of everything for everyone, and while it may not be the biggest in size, it gives you the biggest potential for your future."
Alum,5,"The University of Northern Iowa is the perfect size with such a positive community. The layout of the campus makes travel to classes and dining services quick and easy. On top of that, they have many services included in your tuition that lower costs for you, such as laundry, athletic events, and printing!"
Junior,5,"So amazing, the people are great, the dining centers are iconic and I loce all of the teachers I'm learning from. UNI really does feel like home and I'm happy to be a panther!"
Sophomore,5,The campus is nice and enclosed that it only takes about 15 minutes to get across.  The students and professors are very kind and helpful.  The food is also great!  The only thing I would like to have changed is the distance between social spots and the university.
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoyed the size of the campus and the total student population. I also enjoyed the experience of living on campus and connecting with new people every day. The best thing about going to UNI was the ability to get anywhere on campus in ten minutes or less. Great for students who sleep in until 10 minutes before class.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at UNI and I loved it. Being 3 hours from home was not easy, but the staff and all the professors at UNI made the transition easier and I do not think I could have picked a better school for me."
Senior,5,"I absolutely adore being a student at UNI. It is a public school with a private college feel. Despite its smaller size, both in campus size and number of students, you still have big school opportunities academically, socially and athletically. But because of its smaller size, you are able to develop very close relationships with your professors and peers, setting you up for success in your future endeavors."
Alum,5,"The University of Northern Iowa is a great school to go to! I completed my undergraduate degree in education there and absolutely loved it. I have felt more than prepared for my student teaching experiences, as well as my first teaching job. I am now onto my graduate degree and couldn't be happier. I thank UNI for giving me the education I needed to be successful. You get the small town feel on a university campus that is second to none!"
Niche User,5,"Liked the size of the campus and the meal plan best.  Also, student to faculty ratio.  Most of the classes are taught by professors and not TAs.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating when we visited."
Junior,5,I think the University of Northern Iowa is an exceptional school. They honestly put the education of students first. They are helping students to build the skill that applies to not only to their major area but their future careers. I wholeheartedly recommend the University of Northern Iowa to any education students; you will gain a quality education and experiences you will not find anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,I started late in life and the process with well.  I am trying to complete what I started over 30 years ago. I would love to have the opportunity to finish my degree. I am 62 years old now.
Sophomore,5,I love UNI! I would recommend every high schooler pursuing a 4 year degree to look into this awesome school! The atmosphere is amazing. It feels big at first but then after you settle in starts to feel so small. Small class sizes are great and the dining centers have really good food!
Graduate Student,5,"This college is very friendly and welcoming to all students.  They are very helpful and the feel of the campus is that of a small, private college.  I've never had a bad professor.  Each professor has gone out of their way to ensure students understand the material."
Freshman,5,My favorite part about UNI is the size. The college is big enough yet not to big. It makes it easy to be involved and find your place on campus without being too overwhelmed. UNI is very welcoming and has a great environment for all types of people.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is relatively small, so it is super easy to get to classes in ten minutes. The people are all really nice and there are a lot of activities to do around campus. There are a lot of different study or hang out spots all across campus too."
Senior,4,I took a lot of summer classes to finish my degree in a reasonable amount of time. For the most part they were straightforward. You really can't take more than 2 or 3 max at a time though. It is a lot more work than being in an in-person class. I only had one bad experience with a class. It was extremely difficult to figure out from the start so I ended up dropping it. Generally professors do their best to reach out and ask for feedback.
Niche User,4,Great small class sizes for the size of the campus and enrollment. Good place to live as it's a small town feel right next to a big city in Iowa. Plenty of extracurricular activities to keep you busy. All around a great place to go to school.
Sophomore,4,The online platforms used are very beneficial once you get used to how they work. It does take a while to figure it out.
Freshman,4,My experience at UNI has been great so far! The professors are AMAZING and so willing to help. The campus is beautiful with nice buildings and a great recreation center. Dining centers on campus are really nice and always have something good to eat. There are tons of different clubs and organizations to join which is awesome.
Freshman,4,"I did not take any classes online other than the closure of campus due to COVID-19. With the pandemic and the transition of classes from in-person to online UNI was super supportive and understanding. Although some online classes can be tough, the experience was great and the professors were still so willing to help in any way the possibly could."
Junior,4,"UNI has a mid size campus, which is pretty good because I can get from one end of the campus to the other end in about 15-20 minutes. on top of that, people here are super nice and friendly, so making friends here is very easy."
Junior,4,"There is an emphasis on making progress towards diversity and inclusion, but it is not supported when students speak up about the change they wish to see and how to achieve it. In my department, I feel we are ahead of the curve."
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Northern Iowa because the people here encourage me to push myself beyond my comfort level. I am able to grow to be the best version of myself because I am constantly challenged. The resources and help offered are endless. I am bound to succeed here due to the level of care the university has for each of their students. There are many different things to get involved in on campus as well, which makes UNI the perfect place to get engaged and meet new people."
Freshman,4,"The University of Northern Iowa has great diversity and a number of resources for students. The professors are caring and passionate, and all staff and faculty are very helpful. The campus is the perfect size."
Freshman,4,I really like the University of Northern Iowa. All of the class sizes are small (around 26 students per class) so you get really close to all of your professors. Everyone that I have met is super kind. The campus is small so you are never too far away from any of your classes.
Freshman,4,"I really love my overall experience at UNI, I just wish the athletics were more ""fun"" in the student sections and there was more interesting activities going on around campus."
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Northern Iowa. It is not too small and not too big. I love walking around campus with the beautiful grass I see everyday. I love going to eat and going to the great facilities they got here. Only thing I don't like is that it rains a lot up here, at least a lot more than my hometown."
Niche User,4,"I recently went on a college visit there and my whole view of the college changed. I grew up in Cedar Falls constantly having children concerts, piano lessons and camps at UNI, ruining the experience of it being an actual college. But since I am looking at colleges more seriously this year and next, that college visit and my mindset shifted the way I view UNI. I love the campus, the food, and the people there. I am very serious about going there after I graduate."
Freshman,4,This University is very welcoming and accepting. They offer free programs that help new and older students through the stress of college tests and being away from home.
Freshman,4,Everyone has been super friendly.  Classes are nice sized and professors are willing to help when you have a question.  One negative is that some dorms are still without air conditioning.  The size of the campus is a positive as you can quickly get anywhere on campus with ten minutes of walking.
Niche User,4,"I really like how close-knit the community is at UNI. It made me feel like I was right at home! The dining center was super easy to find, and the food was really good. UNI is also great about sponsoring high school events in the state, and I really like that they care about the community."
Senior,4,The University of Northern Iowa campus is beautiful and has excellent professors. They have office hours and are actual professors and not just graduate students operating as TA's. They also have tons of events which is just great for new students getting the hang of the social aspect of college.  Lastly what I would change would be just. Change the requirements for your degrees. We do not need 45 credits worth of none degree classes. That is over one third of our total credits for graduation and that is ridiculous.
Junior,4,UNI is great school. Building relationships with the faculty is really important. A lot of the professors have connections and are very willing to help you in anyway that they can. Everyone wants to help you reach your goals and help prepare you for your job field very well.
Junior,4,"Good university. Very welcoming and everyone is willing to help you. The people on the campus are very nice and will be willing to show you around if you are needing help to get around. The campus is small, which I personally like. You can get from one side of campus to the other side in 5-7 minutes. There are many student orgs and activities going on every day. You can go to the sporting events for free and get 2 free tickets a semester for shows that go on in GBPAC."
Sophomore,4,UNI is a pretty good school. The main issue for me is the lack of diversity on campus. There are always events going on and there are tons of friendly people here. The professors that I've have were pretty chill.
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with UNI mostly due to its campus, as it's not too big, but not too small either. It's very easy to get around, and the overall scenery during the spring and summer is just absolutely beautiful. I've had some great professors, but also some not so great professors, it really depends on who you take and your own preferred teaching style. The people around campus that I have met have usually been pretty nice, hardworking people. Overall, I really love this campus, and I am so glad to have chosen it out of my other options."
Niche User,4,"The University of Northern Iowa has a great campus that is small enough to make it seem like home but large enough to give you the experience of living in a big town. The college is invested in your education, and the president is very present in the campus life and the lives of the students. The president has a positive attitude and makes it a priority that you are enjoying your time at the university."
Sophomore,4,"Perfect size, not huge but lots of different people to meet, pretty campus, nice administration that is easy to work with, professors mostly good and interested in their students. Plenty of housing options and availability, good value for cost."
Sophomore,4,"Small university with lots to offer, excellent music program, good sports program, quality services and teachers."
Freshman,4,"University of Northern was a great experience for me. The dorms could have been better, but they work for what they're needed for. Professors enjoy having connections with student to help them excel in their class."
Junior,4,The University of Northen Iowa is a fine institution that strives to provide quality education within a tight-knit community. The professors at this university really care about what they teach as well as the student's well being.
Junior,4,So far while attending University of Northern Iowa I have had a great experience. I love the class sizes and the ability to know each professor. Everyone has been extremely welcoming!
Sophomore,4,There are a lot of nice people here and the only thing I would change is the communication between staff and students
Sophomore,4,How the people treated you with respect and humbleness. This university has taught that it doesn't matter your background or ethnicity everyone has taught each other each individual has the potential do the successful
Junior,4,Really enjoyed the diversity and the helpful staff. The professors are generally very willing to assist with questions and any concerns you may have. Very approachable and understanding. Some of the things I would like to see change is more affordable on campus housing.
Sophomore,4,"UNI is full of friendly people that want the best for you! The professors are great, and so are the advisors. All the faculty are always willing to meet with you for any reason. The class sizes are perfect and the dorm life is the BEST. Also the food is always award winning and considered the best in the state."
Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate how the professors at UNI understand that their class is more than a class, but rather the last schooling student should will receive before entering the 'real world.' Especially in my education classes, the professors treat me like a future teacher, not simply a student. 

My favorite part of UNI is the college ministry. There are so many groups of people and churches that want to love and support you. I found my best friends through a campus ministry."
Sophomore,4,University of Iowa is a great small school in which students have the ability to feel safe joining programs and events. The campus is beautiful and easy to access but the surrounding area can be a little dangerous.
Sophomore,4,Faculty and staff are very helpful and really want students to succeed. Facilities are in great condition. The entire atmosphere of the campus makes you feel at home even if you're thousands of miles away from your hometown.
Sophomore,4,"I love how many different clubs and activities are offered!  I also really like how as an Education major, I got into the classrooms right away my freshman year which really helped me get hand on experience.  Cedar Falls is an amazing town and UNI really encourages their students to become involved in the community."
Junior,4,"The University of Northern Iowa is full of great students and faculty. As soon as I stepped on campus, I knew that I was home. It is a great place to grow in your knowledge and become a better person."
Freshman,4,"Northern Iowa was a wonderful school that helped me through difficult time and were understanding when my mental difficulties made it harder to attend. Even so, the administration worked hard so I was able to feel not only comfortable but heard."
Alum,4,It is a well-known university with an emphasis on business and education.  The education department is a globally recognized organization that promotes a highly-qualified program for future educators.
Freshman,4,"Academic advisor was easy to talk to and very helpful as far as helping to plan schedules. Excellent resources like the library and academic learning center, both were very friendly and helpful. Some professors were a little too stern and wanted us to figure it out on our own too much others made class fun and were very nice and understanding."
Freshman,4,"I love UNI! It's the perfect size, not too big, and not to small. Everyone is super nice, and there is so many opportunities for me!"
Junior,4,"A small campus yet closed communities. Small number of students per class. Easy to understand lectures. Most of the exam s are not cumulative, depends on the professor. Professors have high credibility to lecture the courses. Many majors offered in this university. High opportunities of  doing research for undergraduate students. Many subjects offered but for certain upper level subjects,  only offered every odd or even years. Students have to plan what courses to take in order to graduate in the year they desired to. Many internships or capstone offered ."
Freshman,4,"So far in my experience at the University of Northern Iowa, I have fallen in love with the environment it has and the whole concept of college. I think UNI is one of the most welcoming, accepting Universities out there. I have always felt so accepted and welcomed by my peers and professors. Also the staff and administrators are always very willing to help you be as academically successful as you can."
Freshman,4,"University Of Northern Iowa is not a very diverse school, but there are quite a few clubs you can join to get to know a lot of people like you. Staff and students are super friendly and will help you find the right path."
Sophomore,4,"The school is very nice, small enough that professors get to know you but big enough that you can hide if you wanted"
Alum,4,Good college. Very easy to graduate early if that is something you are looking for. I graduated in 3 years. I loved the availability of classes and the close interactions you got with staff.
Freshman,4,The University of Northern Iowa does not make you feel like you are just a number. It has a strong sense of community. It both feels like a large school and a small school at the same time.
Junior,4,"The class sizes are small enough that the professors get to know you personally and you can have better interactions with other students in your classes. It is a smaller campus so it is easy to get around and navigate, but big enough that you are constantly meeting new people. The education I have received so far has been above that of my peers attending other universities."
Freshman,4,I really like how the professors care about each student and try and create different bond with everyone. I would really like to see more diversity inn the student body.
Freshman,4,"While being at the University of Northern Iowa, I feel a great connection with the other students and the staff. There is so many organizations and clubs to join to stay busy in your free time.  The dorm housing and food courts could be really repeatative and sometimes it would be nice to change your options of foods. Other than the food court, I’ve really enjoyed my stay at UNI so far and can’t wait to see what my next couple of years have in store for me."
Freshman,4,"Great school if you are majoring in teaching. Ok for other fields. Not that many interesting things happen around Cedar Falls. They have great non academic services like free fitness classes and gym access. Also free therapy and doctor visits. The dorms are not air conditioned and get very hot the first month. Dorms are mid-century and not pretty inside; they do have sinks. Educational buildings are pretty. The wind makes it very cold in the winter. There are not many STEM programs. The students are super nice, I have been here a semester and only met 3 mean people. There is a great selection of food, most of the food is average. Freshmen who live on campus get unlimited meals. It is easy to get into, they have an algorithm, so you can see if you will get in or not before you even apply. Almost all students are white and from Iowa. Athletics are ok, the dome is nice, no hot or cold games. There is a lot of clubs for the size. There are not many big parties."
Senior,4,"The University of Northern Iowa is the perfect school for students who don't want a place that is too large, but also isn't too small. Professors to get to know you on a personal level and learn your name and it is a very comfortable environment."
Senior,4,"The school is great for academics! I would highly recommend coming here if you want to learn and have friendly professors. However, it's mostly a commuter college. People often go home on the weekends and there's not much to do in the area."
Junior,4,"I really like the atmosphere at UNI. People, such as other students, staff, and faculty members, are so nice and willing to help you."
Niche User,4,Took a visit to the Campus and have some friends who work as professors here. Great college and they have been super helpful answering all my questions.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the feel of the campus.  It has over 10,000 students, but doesn't feel that big.  I was an economics major and felt that the professors were really interested in the students' learning."
Junior,4,"I transferred to UNI as a Junior to finish my degree in Education. I lived on campus in the dorm Shull. I had a meal plan so pretty much ate on campus.  The teachers here are very nice and very helpful. Whenever you have questions in you can either email in them (which they respond pretty quick) or you can ask them in class. They are always willing to help. Anytime I had a question about my Ubill, dorm, parking  etc someone in all the offices were available for help. The fact that I can always get answers to my questions is what I love most about UNI."
Freshman,4,So far my experience at UNI has been very memorable. I love the people I have made. The overall academics is great with amazing professors.
Freshman,4,Northern Iowa is a great school! The campus isn't too big where it takes you forever to go across campus but it is still big enough that you meet new people everyday.
Freshman,4,"The University of Northern Iowa is a great place with caring people and staff. The professors genuinely care about their students and their success. They are willing to go out of their way to make sure that the students feel safe, wanted, and are successful in every way possible."
Sophomore,2,"No one really knew what they were doing which was to be expected, but all of the professors and advisors were very supportive. They were very gracious of the circumstances and just wanted us to succeed"
Junior,2,The school seems to be needing updates all over. It also seems that non of the staff know what’s going on. The school boats being “the cheapest 4 year college in the state” but if you did halfway decent in high school or on the ACT/SAT you can go to Iowa or Iowa State much cheaper. A degree from this school isn’t as respected as the other 2 state schools.
College Senior,2,"Like I said above, house parties are limited because they get busted for noise complaints or there being too many people. There are house parties but more like team parties or pregamming before you hit the bars later."
College Sophomore,2,"During my stay in the residence halls last year, it was not the best experience. There were bugs, flooded bathrooms, non-stop partying, and very loud neighbors that seemed to never go to bed. Calling the RA's on call does not help one bit, they don't care at all."
College Senior,2,Some professors are really good and enjoy teaching. Lots of professors seem to be taking advantage of their tenure.
College Senior,2,Administrators have done terrible jobs in the past regarding safety and security on campus.
College Senior,2,"Fraternities on campus have very bad reputations, but the sororities tend to have good reputations."
College Freshman,2,"Not a very good school. I plan to transfer else where. If you are trying to decide between the three state schools in Iowa, I would suggest either Iowa or Iowa State over UNI. The smaller classes are an advantage at UNI, but nearly everything else is better at the bigger state schools."
College Freshman,2,"Professors are unclear and sometimes not easy to work with. Food in dining center is bad, same stuff day after day. Food in the union however is fantastic, the problem is you have to pay with your own money in order to eat there. The food at the union is what I considered the food would be like at college, but instead it the dining centers feel more like a high school lunch. Not a friendly environment for dorms. RA's are not friendly, kind, or understanding. The frequently try and make life hard for you. This includes the residence life coordinator . If a RA writes you up for having your TV on at 1 in the morning the residential life coordinator will assign you to write a three page paper over ""how having your TV on at 1 in the morning is disturbing."" Therefor if you like to watch TV or play video games late, even on the weekends UNI is not the best for you. The coordinator will also constantly nag you and everyone else in the hall about join her hall senate. She basically shoves it down your throat with constant emails, letters and conversations. UNI claims to have the best wifi network in the nation, but actually it's probably one of the worst. Half the time you cannot connect your phone or laptop to the network unless you are physically plugged into the network. They give you an estimate for your room and board costs, but they do not include data overage fees. That should definitely be considered when thinking about coming to UNI."
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of living in the Towers. My roommate and I have had multiple problems this semester due to flooding and bug problems. I will not be living in the towers next semester.
College Junior,2,not very popular on campus
College Senior,2,"I wouldn't come here again because of the certain things I had to deal with. COPS, PARKING PEOPLE, CLASSMATES THAT WERE RUDE AND UNACCEPTING."
College Senior,2,I was told I only had to turn in the dependent information and other tax information for 2 years I was there. They screwed me over and made me show them my information for the 4 years I was there and told me I was informed with the wrong information. They just don't want to hand out any extra grants and money to their students!
College Sophomore,2,"UNI, has a big drinking scene where students use fake IDs to get into clubs. I am unsure about the drug usage on UNI."
College Student,2,I don't enjoy the food.
College Student,2,It's super cold on campus and very windy.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of diversity here.
College Sophomore,2,Not many areas to park so you would have to walk.
College Sophomore,2,Only the girls have a big part in the Greek life.  The Greek life for the guys is almost non-existent.
College Freshman,2,I would not choose this school again. I came here for Athletics and the team did not turn out to be anything as I imagined. If I was not on the team I most likely would have gotten to know a lot more people and would've possibly enjoyed myself more here. The Greek Life is unsatisfactory and there were not many other groups that intrigued me. Homecoming was fun and the traditions were enjoyable. At times I do enjoy it here and others I am bored and lonely.
College Freshman,2,During the winter the weather has sucked walking 5+ minutes to class every day.  And the wind is absolutely horrible.  Such a windy campus.  You do get used to it eventually.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much affordable public transportation.
College Freshman,2,Not many places to chose from and most aren't healthy.
College Junior,2,For student teaching we do not get paid but we have to pay to student teach. It is expensive because we have to buy supplies and travel all the time to get to schools.
College Sophomore,2,The foreign students only interact with themselves
College Sophomore,2,"I do everything needed, but I do not receive any aid. I even make the dean's list for college"
College Freshman,2,"It's super windy, and it's super cold in the winter"
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do off campus. Most of the time I felt like I was trapped living on campus because that was the only place around to do anything.
College Sophomore,2,I only see cops in the day time. You never see them at night and I feel very unsafe walking at night. There have been a few events that have made me nervous.
College Sophomore,2,What we pay for our meals is ridiciouls. I do not eat anywhere near what I pay for!
College Sophomore,2,In the dorms it is really noticable. You can smell it everywhere. 
College Freshman,2,Parking is only close to living quarters. If you want to be close to class you'll have to feed the meter and get there early.
College Freshman,2,It's a small town so it's easy to get around. When you want to leave town without a personal vehicle you're pulling straws to see how lucky you'll be.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are only good if you're a freshman. Once you're a sophomore, try to get an apartment. Do not sign the two year agreement."
College Freshman,2,The RAs in my building find really dumb reasons to write people up. Like having their door open a couple minutes before quiet hours. It's not even against the rules.
College Freshman,2,"I didn't receive any aid because my parent's ""made too much money."" My mother was laid off and didn't have any income. I ended up being screwed on tuition for first semester because I didn't receive any aid."
College Sophomore,2,"If someone were to want financial aid, they should look elsewhere.  For people with great academic standing or musical talent, there are scholarships available if they are done in the correct manner.  A music scholarship can be obtained through being a music student and an academic scholarship can be done only through joining honors.  If an individual decides not to be part of the honors program, a scholarship is still available, but not as attainable or with as much financial capabilities."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no way to get around campus other than walking.  The parking lots are far away, making it difficult to have a car at this school.  If transportation is wanted to get around the surrounding area, a car is needed.  Public transportation is almost obsolete and taxis are extremely expensive."
College Student,2,Not much public transportation for long distances
College Senior,2,"While the university has made efforts to increase the diverse population, I don't they have gone about it in the best manner.  When the student population is predominately students from Iowa (which, is already a state that isn't very diverse) I feel like the university lacks in their efforts to reach out to the white population to teach about our multicultural center.  Plus, it doesn't help that our university is known as a research institute which would increase our popularity amongst the international population like it has at the other two state universities."
College Freshman,2,"The weather in Iowa is pretty unpredictable. For example, this year...it was snowing...IN MAY!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"The campus isn't too huge so there isn't a large need to use the transit that is offered, but the parking is outrageously expensive."
College Senior,2,"There are plenty of choices in the area, however, the cost is ridiculous. Many landlords charge what one might pay for an entire apartment for each person living in one apartment.  Not all of the landlords keep up with the lease requirements and will avoid doing any work on the rental when needed."
College Junior,2,"It is always very windy on campus. So if it rains or snows, it is terrible outside."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not sure about any drug usage on campus, but I'd say most of the students here (or at least the ones I know well) drink alcohol. I wouldn't say there's much peer pressure to drink, though. People don't care whether you're drinking or not when you're hanging out. I'm not too familiar with policy enforcement involving drugs and alcohol because I've never been in any trouble involving drugs or alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"My first year living in the dorms wasn't terrible by any means, but it was less than what I was expecting. I was expecting to meet tons of new friends in my dorm and that just didn't happen. I think your experience really depends on the people you're with though. I didn't get along great with my roommate and didn't seem to have anything in common with the other girls on my floor."
College Freshman,2,I honestly don't know how strict this campus is because it's the only one I've ever lived on and I've never gotten into any interactions with campus security or police.
College Sophomore,2,The University of Northern Iowa is one of the WINDIEST campuses I have ever encountered. I'm not exactly sure why. The wind can definitely make the winter months miserable.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is from Iowa and there are not alot of different races. There are alot of political clubs though, so Ive seen/heard"
College Senior,2,I think there needs to be more people working in the office.
College Freshman,2,Many won't openly come up to you and ask to hang out but if you find the right people you can make friends in no time. The party life is a little bit different but it is fun to go out with friends on the weekends. I love my residence hall and how close I get to work with my professors. Its a great fit for me here at UNI.
College Freshman,2,"I think the average housing rental is very high, Students pay alot for school let alone pay for each room in the house. I think that is ridiculous, 4 bedroom 325.00 per room and this is a house."
College Junior,2,Not Enough Spots in Classes – I am currently behind in classes because by the time I was able to sign up for classes a lot of them that I needed were too full. Therefore I now have to take summer classes or stay for another semester.
College Junior,2,"NOTHING NEAR CAMPUS – THE NIGHTLIFE IS MAINLY FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE 21 OR OLDER..THE GOOD AND WORTHWHILE BARS ARE ON MAIN, NOT THE HILL. CEDAR FALLS DOES NOT HAVE TOO MUCH TO OFFER AND SO MANY STUDENTS FIND IT A BORING PLACE TO BE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU COME FROM THE BIG CITY LIKE I DO."
College Junior,2,"Apartments in Cedar Falls are difficult to find information about.  Not every landlord or apartment complex has a website designated to it, and if they do it can be difficult to locate.  Not only that, but the apartments are fairly expensive.  Most are 750+ for two people.  The university doesn't really provide any assistance finding off-campus housing either."
College Junior,2,"Where's the Money for Middle Class Average to Smart – I am very disappointed in the financial aid that is available to me, Middle class parent's and I am your average student.  I will come out of college owing a small home mortgage."
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't much racial diversity. The majority of the student body is white.
College Sophomore,2,"Hope You Don't Mind the Cold – Most of the time the weather is pretty good.  However, it gets really windy.  This is great for the summer, but not so much during the winter."
College Senior,2,"Walking or Biking Is the Way to Go – The campus is fairly compact, so walking and biking is the best way to head to class, but only if you live within a mile of campus. For those that do not live this close to campus, then they are out of luck.  

The bus system is terribly and doesn't extend into the neighboring city, where a lot of cheap housing is located.  Most students who live off campus drive to class.  The parking lots for students that drive are labels with letters in a complicated and confusing pattern.  Parking permits must be bought in order to park in these lots, and often parking can be scarce during the weekdays, especially during prime class times.  You can park on a few side roads near campus, but it's not optimum.  There is a parking garage available, but the payment option in it is complex and its rarely used by students.

However, they have an excellent Public Safety Office.  If it's late at night and you don't want to walk alone in the dark, call the Public Safety Office and they'll give you a ride home for free."
College Junior,2,"Not Strict – Drinking rules say that you may only have alcohol in your dorm room if you or one of your roommates is over 21. However, you may only have one open container in the room at any given time, and that includes the garbage. All drinking must be done behind closed doors, and most RA's don't notice unless people are walking around drunk."
Alum,1,"My experience at UNI was terrible. I had never felt so alone, ostracized, or looked down upon in my life. The professors make the content more difficult than it needs to be, the academic learning center is run by people who know nothing about what they're attempting to help you with, and any real support feels like false hope. Do not let the fake smile and seeming friendly demeanor of the student body deceive you, it's made up of snakes and sharks that will only use you for there own gain and stab you in the back just to get ahead. I hated this place and all I got was a worthless degree, and $40,000 of debt."
Alum,1,I did not take any online courses. I attended and graduated before the Covid-19 pandemic and online classes were not as common.
Alum,1,"I will be honest with you, my experience from Uni was great until I graduated, I graduated from UNI about 4 years ago and I wasted about 40,000 bucks. I have not been able to find a good paying job  and I am making the same amount of money as someone with an associate degree, I have 2 degrees from UNI and I was told that I was going to be able to make at least the median wage when I graduated from college. I am 27 years old and I am barely able to afford to live. I wish I could turn back time and not gone to UNI. Such a waste of money!!!!! I am beyond disappointed!"
Junior,1,"This school almost ruined my Bachelor's degree. A previous adviser gave me a degree plan. The next semester, she left the position and the new adviser clued me in that the previous one had lied to me. I was basically going to have to start completely over (and I had already had my Associate's at this point). I left this school. Not to mention how unfriendly students were. Professors for the most part are very good, but administration is horrible to work with. Most people I know have not had good experiences. I'm a minority and I experienced a fair amount of racism at this institution. The town itself is very average and doesn't have too many events. I could rant longer, but basically I'll sum it up by saying: this school was fairly horrible."
Alum,1,"Run from this ""school"" like your life depened on it!!! They ruined my life forever!!! They're still ""attempting"" to get my student loans squared away. I graduated 20+ years ago!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"I had a roommate last year who joined a sorority. All she did was drink at all of the events, and even though sorority girls try to say that they do all of these great things for communities, all I see them do is drink and party so I guess I'm biased."
College Freshman,1,Rule enforcement is ridiculous and a joke. Most RA's give the vibe that they are out there to get you more than help you  out. Same with Residence Life coordinator.
College Senior,1,"There was a party scene the first two years I went here. The cops have busted every party of my senior year and most of the fun is at the bars that are over capacity and hot. The bar scene is okay here at UNI, but it gets very repetitive, if you were from a city like me (Des Moines) you would go home every weekend because this place gets boring. The people seem to have their cliques and people that they only talk to."
College Senior,1,"The police in Cedar Falls and UNI have ruined my experience here and I have a clean record to show for it. I have never been arrested or detained here, but I have seen over 30 parties get busted and 5 friends arrested in-side of bars for minding their own business. UNI is a very crime less city and the cops have to make their paychecks by arresting kids who are trying to make a better life. I think I speak for a majority of the school when I say F**k the police here in Cedar Falls they have ruined my senior year and all the parties I have went to."
College Sophomore,1,It seems like it's always windy on campus. The winters are brutal. Very cold and it snows all the time. It's lovely here in the summer though.
College Freshman,1,The guys here are not as attractive as most diverse schools. Interests tend to revolve around hunting and sports. They dress very conservative and far from trendy. The style for guys is usually American Eagle jeans and a t-shirt at best. Many people here tend to have come here already in a serious relationship.
College Freshman,1,The winds in the winter make walks to class awful and they never cancel class.
College Freshman,1,I feel like all the RAs and staff are out to get the students.
College Sophomore,1,"No one really cares.. Every one is so caught up in drinking that if you don't do it, you can't be in the group"
College Freshman,1,It's freezing and the wind cuts through anything you wear. I had to invest in a really heavy coat. Not fun.
College Sophomore,1,"I could not imagine having a worse experience at college.  Everyone I met had a hidden agenda and was not actually friendly.  The experiences I enjoyed are completely tinted by how terrible my experience was.  This school is unique by completely ostracizing others, academically and socially.  As soon as an individual is not part of an organization or group, they are left behind.  I know of many who transferred because their experience was so terrible and now prosper at other schools.  I cannot wait to transfer, to be in a more productive and accepting environment.  Professors had no consideration to my hospitalizations, organizations were run in the most unproductive and corrupt manner, and once a person in a specific major or school did not like you, neither did anyone else.  It is very much like high school where so many people know about each other, despite the large size of students enrolled.  I would not choose this school and I wish I would have chosen the school I am going to now earlier.   "
College Sophomore,1,Parking is very difficult. There are very few available spots and the cost of the parking tag is outrageous.
College Senior,1,"There is not much to do off campus.  There is a mall, however, there are limited stores in the mall.  A Wal-Mart and HyVee are located within easy distance but not much to get excited about.  There are a good bunch of fast food restaurants within easy driving.  What the area lacks the campus offers, however, so keep that in mind when looking at UNI, there is always something happening on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is absolutely horrible, the university oversells permits and then there is no where to park. But if you park illegally for any period of time you will get a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,The parking on campus is excessively frustrating especially with all the new construction on campus and lack of parking for these new living spaces.

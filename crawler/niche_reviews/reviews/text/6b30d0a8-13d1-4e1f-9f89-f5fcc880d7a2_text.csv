Freshman,5,I love wright state's campus it absolutely beautiful and so full of life . The school in general is a really good school they care about your needs and want to support you .
Freshman,5,"I take online classes and my professors are always open and so encouraging and  understanding . Online classes was the best decision i have ever made , i have made some really great friends and some close friendship and great people ."
Senior,5,"I have been at Wright State University for about 6 years. My first choice of study was nursing. Then I switched to change my major to getting my bachelors degree in Social Work. Right now, because of Covid, all of my classes are online. So all of the professors are still learning how to conduct their classes to fully online through Blackboard Collaborate or Webex or Microsoft Teams. The instructors and professors at Wright State University have been fantastic during my entire six years at the Dayton campus. On campus, they also have several different options for meals, including some of the well known branches. They also have meal plans for students who reside in dorms or commute to campus often. Right now, I do not think that a lot of students are residing on campus or in dorms. And I do not think that a lot of students are commuting to campus because of the Corona virus. Tuition is very reasonable as well. There is not much that I would change about Wright State."
Graduate Student,5,Some posted pre-recorded lectures and others did active learning textbooks. Some professors also utilized discussion posts so we still interacted with the other students in the class. Classes were organized with frequent deadlines so you weren't able to fall behind.
Freshman,5,I attended those spotlights which were helpful and their whole website is filled on how to prepare and do all types of things. And when you give them a call they are so nice and helpful. So far it's great.
Freshman,5,"Honestly, I haven't attended the school yet but I have attended their spotlights which were very informational and friendly."
Sophomore,5,"Wright state is a wonderful college. There are so many academic, social, and career opportunities waiting at this college. If you are a determined student, chances are you will find Wright State an affordable and desirable option."
Senior,5,It has been great the professors truly care about the students and go out of their way to ensure that you will succeed. I feel that I have learned a lot during my time at Wright State and look forward to graduating.
Junior,5,"Wright State is a fantastic school that offers great courses and teachers to help you succeed! The classes aren't super huge so it's easy for teachers to really connect with their students and help them succeed. It is a beautiful campus that features many study spots, that makes it easy for you to focus on your school work. I would highly recommend going to Wright state."
Sophomore,5,An amazing university who is focused on success for all different types of students who is barreling different types of real life problems . Very diverse and very open to change there are a lot of organizations that student can be apart of
Alum,5,I loved my time at WSU. There is a lot of support for student success.  I am very happy with my education and the opportunities it has provided.
Sophomore,5,Wright State is an amazing place to go to school! I recommend it to everyone! If you are thinking about attending WSU come visit and you will be convinced! Professors are AMAZING!
Niche User,5,There are so many opportunities at Wright State and it is all offered at a very reasonable and affordable cost. Everything you would want at a college can be found here.
Junior,5,I have had a great experience for the most part.  Some instructors have been less than ideal but you'll have that at any school. The program that I am in is rigorous and is preparing me for my career.
Sophomore,5,The professors here care about your education. They give you what you give them. They are very easy to reach during office hours or by email. Most are pretty understanding when things come up and are willing to work with you.  There are plenty of things to do around campus as well.
Niche User,5,Wright State is so amazing!! Everyone is nice and they have something for everyone. The campus is beautiful and there is so much diversity.
Freshman,5,My experience at Wright State University has been amazing so far. It is really affordable and they offer a wide range of majors and minors.
Junior,5,Wright State University is such a welcoming environment for those who are looking forward to socializing while getting higher education. If you want to get into different aspects in life you should definitely go for WSU. You will always get help whenever you need it without a doubt. The heart of the campus is built just perfectly for everyone.
Sophomore,5,I really love this school my top choice and I plan on going back. The only thing I would change is the financials I come from a extremely low income family and would like more help
Freshman,5,This college is just like a home . Everyone is very welcoming and helpful with the college process .
Freshman,5,"Ever since my first visit, Wright State has felt like a home. I am going to be an incoming freshman, but I am utterly excited to join this amazing community! They are the only school to provide a program that perfectly fits my dream major/job and they offer a plethora of opportunities once I graduate!"
Freshman,5,wright state is a great school. it offers so  many different majors and pathways. one of the best things about this school is the diversity. another thing i like is that the university provide a opportunity for other students to work with disabled students.
Graduate Student,5,"I have really been enjoying my time as a WSU student. I'm doing the MBA program, and have been learning a lot. In fact, I've already applied some of the ideas learned to a business I just created."
Niche User,5,"I toured this school three times now, and am absolutely in love with it. The dorms are clean, and there are a lot of great options to accommodate all sorts of financial situations. There is a lot of diversity on campus, as I see all sorts of exciting people on campus and attending classes. The food choices are very diverse, and you will never run out of food to try. You'd really never have to leave campus, everything you need is there already. I'm super excited to be attending."
Senior,5,I love that i can commute to Wright State. The professors i have had in the psychology department as well as the nursing department have been outstanding. The professors truly care about their students and they want to see them succeed.
Niche User,5,I really love the campus and everyone is really nice. I'm an incoming freshman and it seems like this is the college for me.
Niche User,5,I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I
Junior,5,"For the pricing, I feel like it is the best value for the education I am getting. Also, it is a college that I can commute an hour to compared to two hours. On campus living is too expensive."
Alum,5,I got my bachelors of science in exercise physiology and had a great four years while I attended.  I did not live on campus so I did not have as much involvement as I would have liked. But overall I had a wonderful time and am happy with my degree.
Niche User,5,"During the visit, I got to see everything on campus as far as the different schools, the dorms, and the dinning area. The tour guide was nice and helped answers almost all of the questions that I had. The school was nice overall. I enjoyed the trip and I plan to be a 2019 freshman."
Sophomore,5,"I love WSU; GO RAIDERS! Even though some classes seem large, you can always seek help with a tutor or with someone in the class. The tunnels are nice for winter when it's too cold outside."
Freshman,5,"I like how dedicated the staff are to making sure their students exceed. The staff show they care and show they are not there just for the money but to see students get through college with minimum issues. Also, the school offer many scholarships students just have to get out there and get the scholarships."
Sophomore,5,"Wright State is an excellent school. It is a large school but, offers that close-knit community. They faculty is great and genuinely want the best for their students."
Graduate Student,5,Wright State offered me an opportunity to create a solid knowledge base in my field and enjoy my time doing it!
Freshman,5,"I love it here, it’s so Excepting to all and has many activities all professors are there to help you and even the academic advisors help plan you adventure through wright state!"
Alum,5,"The faculty actually care about you due to the small class sizes. They want to help in every way they can, they're just great!"
Freshman,5,"Wright state has a nice campus, the professors are nice, the dorms are spacious and clean. If you need help with something you can just ask and people are willing to help. The basketball team is pretty good. The local area has a lot of restaurants and things to do, places to work (mostly retail)."
Freshman,5,"What makes Wright State unique is the rather small classroom/campus size. It allows you to get a more hands-on approach to learning. Another plus are the professors. So far, I can tell that every professor I have had genuinely enjoys their job, and are happy to help you learn the material in any way possible. One thing that could be improved with Wright State is the budgeting, specifically into athletics. Wright State has many students who have great potential to be successful athletes, but with Wright State's financial issues, it makes it hard for some of these students to get a chance to show what they can do when some sports teams are being cut."
Freshman,5,"For a student that has never gone to college before and is completely new to the Dayton area and knows absolutely no one at the school, Wright state is very welcoming. I have found a close knit group of friends that are so close to me they are considered family to me. For my short time of being at Wright state even though I will be continuing my college career there I have found that because it is a much smaller school compared to like OSU there are many more opportunities and amenities to the students. such as there is the tutoring center which to me is worth every penny of tution. it is free to all students and the math lab helps with anything you need. Because of the tutoring center I have been able to excel at German even though it is by far the hardest class I have ever taken."
Freshman,5,"My Wright State experience has been great! I’m only a freshman so I haven’t been here too long, but my overall time here has been awesome. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly. I’ve made so many friends and I don’t feel excluded. Also, there are lots of campus activities so I’m never really bored! The classroom sizes are good and I feel like each teacher will give you the needed attention. It’s a fun environment to learn in and Id recommend it to all!"
Senior,5,"I first attended Sinclair Community College, and thought that it was okay, but it never felt like going to “college.” However, once I started going to Wright State, I started to get the campus life experience and really enjoyed going to class. I think I also enjoyed it because I was actually taking classes that related to my degree instead of taking prerequisites. I am now graduating this April and still plan on going to Wright State for my masters since I enjoyed this campus so much and it is so convenient for me."
Freshman,5,I love the school and the job experince I get through my lab and classroom education. The staff are super helpful. I love this school.
Freshman,5,I Really Liked That There Are Professor And Student Willing To Help You Succeed In You College Career.
Niche User,5,"I've visited Wright State twice now and have fallen in love with the school both times. I'm applying for colleges right now and they're currently my top choice. Beautiful campus, awesome dorms, amazing opportunities, and more take place in Wright State."
Freshman,5,"Well I haven't started yet, but I have visited the campus on multiple occasions, and I can say without a doubt in my mind, I love the atmosphere."
Freshman,5,I'm a first year student and I am very happy with my decision. I was stuck between this college and another and I'm happy I chose wright state. RAIDER UP .
Niche User,5,Everyone I spoke to was very friendly and could answer all of my questions. Plus they had the academic programs I was looking for!!!
Sophomore,5,I instantly fell in love with wright state from my first day. I felt welcomed. There are so many things to be a part of out there! Easy to make friends. I'd like to see more opportunities for students to get to know each other and to feel more at home.
Niche User,5,The professors at Wright State University all really care about every student. They always offer their time to help students. The classrooms are very nice and are a great learning environment to be in. The Dunbar library is especially nice! The third floor is the quiet floor!
Sophomore,5,I love Wright State University it is very different and it has so many opportunities for you to get connected with. It also has many different clubs you can join to get involved.
Freshman,5,I'm a first time freshmen myself but I've heard nothing but positive rumors about the university. I'm really confident in my choice because this college has a lot to choose from such as academic wise and organizations.
Freshman,5,Wright State is the right choice! They have many different majors to choose from and I promise you'll find one you love.
Sophomore,5,I love it there. The atmosphere is great. The teachers are all really great and so are the students. It feels like one big community.
Freshman,5,"Wright Stat is a fantastic University and coming from a smaller high school, the smaller class sizes are perfect for getting to know the professor and your classmates better to help give you a better overall college experience. Also, the campus is beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"The academics are wonderful, I really feel like I am involved in school on and off campus. I am learning a ton more compared to high school. Wright State definitely helps to make sure you are good to go with your learning experience there."
Freshman,5,"I came to Wright State university because I got recruited to play for the club football team here but aside from the sports it is a great atmosphere to get a great education and make long life relationships from. It is inexpensive to become a raider and I urge that if you want a great college education and experience, wright state is the ""wright"" way to go"
Sophomore,5,I like all of the international events and just the event in general that they have and I like the diversity around the campus. They need to work on the parking and the food that is on campus.
Sophomore,5,Wright state university is a very unique school.It is a very diverse school. I'm an international student and one would expect meeting  to be a lonely student making friends with only people from my country. But I'm a friend to people from over 20 countries including the domestic students. The education is really up to standard. The classes are so good thanks to the great professors wright state has. Also the success center that is solely for helping students is extremely helpful. It is my favorite thing about the school.  I was an average student before coming to wright state but as soon as I ended my first semester I realized how educational gifted i was. Wright state university is no joke trust me. You will work very hard for that A but it's not as bad as it sounds. One thing I don't like about the school is that some students work so hard to get financial help but they never get any.
Niche User,5,"Although i personally have never attended wright state I have seen and heard nothing but good things about the facility. My  best friend goes  there and she said that she really enjoys the amount of assistance provided by professors and the class size is not overbearing. She stays in  a single dorm so she doesn't really have to worry about a roommate or any spacing issues. As far as the campus itself goes, everything at Wright state seems well organized and put together. There are safety poles all over the campus so that the students can feel a sense of security. Also everything on campus is neat and peaceful. The student life is decent at wright state as well, the students have many events and activities that can help anyone who may be feeling uneasy about being alone at college."
Freshman,5,All of my experiences with the students and faculty have been positive.  Professors are helpful.  Counselors are also helpful in finding the right path to my future.
Sophomore,4,"The school is great, teaching wise. So far all of my professors have been helpful and nice. The workload can be a lot but that is what college is about. Overall, i enjoy my experience here at Wright State University so far. The only downfall is that there are some racist people here. I have experienced it first hand, about twice. I don't appreciate that because I am a person of color, and i fear for my safety at times. But it's not the worst racial experiences, but it's still wrong."
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience can be stressful for everyone, but i do believe that professors (mine at least) are trying to make things easier on us. There are still a few of my classes that are overwhelming because of the fact that it is a lot of work being given out in each of those classes. Having group work and trying to get in contact with other group mates can be difficult as well. But it is a learning experience. I just wish that we didn't have to pay full tuition for having classes online."
Senior,4,"Before the Corona virus happened, I had very little classes online. Most of our class content, quizzes and exams, and other things that were needed for the class was online on our Pilot page. That is also where our grades were found. But this semester, because of the Corona virus, all of my classes as a senior are online and lectures are through Microsoft Teams, Webex, or Blackboard Collaborate. The professors have been extremely understanding with us because we are all still learning how to transition into doing everything online."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed learning online, but personally I am one of those people that cannot learn math and science through remote learning, online, or self-paced."
Senior,4,"Advisors in this university are extremely helpful and really do out your priorities on whatever your degree or issue is above all else. I sincerely loved talking to any of the advisors I’ve needed to see while I’ve been here since Spring of 2019. They are the most helpful people you’ll see, next to some professors that care about their students."
Junior,4,I think that my professors provided a good online environment for teaching. I didnt like how we were held to the same expectation for being remote. It was not fair and we did not have all the knowledge to do as well as we would in face-to-face class.
Junior,4,I really enjoy this school and specifically the nursing program. It is very well known throughout Ohio. I enjoy the diversity that this campus has to offer and the amount of services that they offer for the disabled/handicap. The campus is very nice and I enjoy the tunnels. The one thing I dont like is how the university is constantly raising tuition because they are struggling with money or are not able to have steady financial decisions.
Sophomore,4,"The staff there is really there for you and only wishes for you to succeed. There is a lot of resources that are there to help you, such as math and English tutoring in the library. The advisors are available through an appointment to talk about any concerns with classes or questions you might have. The professors have office hours to discuss classwork or issues you are having.  The only issues I have had with Wright State are that their website is complicated and hard to navigate at times,  as well as the dining options could be better. They have limited options as well as no full-time dining hall."
Graduate Student,4,The campus isn't too small or too big. Campus is clean and inviting. Large commuter population and a large diversity of students.
Senior,4,"Wright state is a great college for affordability. There isn't much of a campus life because of it being a largely commuter school, but their are plenty of ways to stay involved if one tries to. Despite being a relatively medium-sized school (12,000-ish enrolled as of 2019), their are plenty of research labs and internships in the area, especially with the base."
Sophomore,4,I like how they encourage everyone to socialize and make lifelong friends. The advisors are always there to help you with any questions you may have. It’s a really good environment and the really care for their students.
Freshman,4,I found wright to be a pretty enjoyable experience overall. I met quite a few nice people in the multicultural center and would recommend to others. The only downside for me is that on-campus living is more than tuition.
Freshman,4,I am enjoying Wright State so far. It’s very close to home so I’m living at home at saving money on housing. I have a group of friends from high school that are going here also. We have a great time meeting on campus for lunch between classes and hangin out at the outdoor rec center.
Sophomore,4,I like attending Wright State I feel the class sizes are very reasonable and that most of the professors doo very well at teaching their students. The one complaint that I have is that some of the professors will ignore emails and not get back to you no matter how many times you contact them. The campus is also very diverse and I have noticed that it is very accessible for students with disabilities.
Sophomore,4,"At Wright State University, there are tons of opportunities to succeed and advance your career. Not only are there free tutoring services, office hours to meet with your professors one-on-one, but there is a smaller ratio for students and professors to get to personally know each other. This is helpful in so many ways because as a student, I can go up to them after class and ask the necessary questions to excel in the course. The resources and services at this school are unbelievable. There are so many extra-curricular activities and clubs to become a part of let alone start your own.  The faculty and staff are caring and only want to help you pursue your dreams"
Sophomore,4,"I am a female athlete at Wright State University. Overall, I am loving my time here. Because WSU is mainly a commuter school, you have many options for housing. The dorms are quite nice, and on campus apartments are also included. Slightly off campus but within five minutes drive, there are even more options for affordable apartments, condos, and housing. The area that campus is located in is very convenient for food options, shopping, parks, and entertainment. As far as education is concerned, I have had great experiences with all of my professors being well educated and helpful. However, they did have a long lasting strike that occurred in spring of 2019. This event shows light into the debt situation that WSU is suffering from. Despite the low budget/ debt experienced at Wright State, it is clear that the faculty and staff care about their students and go above and beyond to make sure we succeed."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and the classes are challenging enough. The buildings are newly remodeled and the campus overall is very pleasant. I do wish there was a smaller student to faculty ratio.  Other than the student to faculty ratio, my only complaint would be the parking. It can be difficult to find parking most days, and it’s to the point it affects my daily schedule."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the amount of campus activities and programs you could get into outside of the classroom. I loved the fact that you could study abroad with no additional charge and I loved the diversity on campus. One thing I didn't like was that sometimes the campus felt unsafe. I feel I would be afraid to leave my dorm room after dark. I enjoyed the academics and the opportunities associated with the university to include many job opportunities at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. I would love to be involved in the Air Force ROTC program at Wight State to get more involved in the community, make friends, and learn new skills."
Junior,4,"I am a first-year transfer student here so I am getting used to being on campus. I would say most things here are okay, some professors I am not a fan of. I have no tried the food or explored campus much because I commute here. One thing I enjoy about the campus is the underground tunnels so when it is really hot I can go under ground or when it gets cold I can go under also."
Alum,4,I  believe Wright State was a good investment. My engineering degree paid off months after graduation. I would recommend it to others looking for an affordable degree.
Niche User,4,Wright State is full of very bright individuals and polite professors who are always there to help. What I would like to see change is the complexity of actually getting started at the college.
Graduate Student,4,"Wright State is a great school. For all of the change that has occurred recently, it is steadily improving and continues to offer quality education and many different opportunities for students."
Senior,4,"I love how inclusive and progressive Wright State is! The only thing I would like to see change is more hours for my department, as it's hard to have one-on-one time with my advisor."
Sophomore,4,"The professor strike took away from my academics this year, by literally taking away over 20 hours of my instruction time, however this did not deter my professors or the university from helping me and those around me from achieving my educational goals."
Senior,4,I like how locally Wright State is one of the cheaper colleges. I would like for parking to be better instead of so far away. I think a parking garage with a tunnel that connects to the school would be very beneficial and convenient to both students and staff.
Sophomore,4,"Choosing to come to Wright State instead of better known or more “accepted” universities has been one of the best decisions of my life, the smaller class sizes allow for more one on one time with the professors and the professors all seem like they truly care about your education not just working for the next paycheck. Wright State University is a very inclusive university that has some of the best professors for any given field, one thing I would like to see change about this university would be to see the faculty spend less on making minor or unneeded changes to the campus life and invest more on the student's education and quality of the academic atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,I like how many teachers form a relationship with their students and want to help their students understand concepts. It was difficult learning during a strike that occurred during my second semester in college.
Junior,4,I have had a good experience with Wright State so far. I can easily contact administration for advising appointments. Advisers are helpful and are always in the student's best interest.
Freshman,4,"My classes have been an appropriate size, the academics have been challenging with attainable goals, and the faculty are highly skilled. The campus is gorgeous in fall months and I look forward to learning how it looks in springtime. The tunnels are a huge benefit during the winter months. Campus security is interested in the safety of each student. I safely ride my bike to and from campus each day. Grocery store and restaurants are within walking distance."
Niche User,4,I like how the school is smaller and the faculty make you feel welcome. I also love the disability program and all of the accommodations it offers the students.
Junior,4,"Wright state has had its hiccups within the leadership (strike, green card scamming, etc.) but overall I have enjoyed my time here."
Freshman,4,Wright State University is a very affordable school and I would recommend it to my friends to apply. Their are many activities and organizations that you can get involved in. At wright state you can get to know others in a small amount of time and everyone is very welcoming. When I went on my visit at wright state everyone was so genuine and really helped me feel wanted.
Niche User,4,"Wright State is truly a wonderful university. The people and faculty are so caring and supportive. They will really work with you in any way they can to help you succeed. The ONLY complaint I have, is that this year and semester, spring of  2019, the faculty went on strike. This has led to a lot of struggles for all students and faculty. Some classes have been cancelled, put on hold or changed in some other way."
Junior,4,"The experience at Wright State University was and can be amazing due to the faculty and the students around you. However, the administration has caused a large bent into the reputation of the institution due to their lack of financial management and their abusive tactics during the Faculty Strike that is currently on its fifteenth-day as I write this. With that being said, the overall experience of the school is great. I have met amazing people, who are now my best friends and have made relationships that will impact me for many years to come. The faculty are great and make the work fun and engaging to all the students that I have discussed any of this with. The faculty and students are like a big family that is always there for each other, thus I truly appreciate the experience there."
Freshman,4,"A well-knit community where the faculty are really willing to work with you. The food is actually pretty decent, and the dorms are VERY nice."
Junior,4,The teachers truly care about st ur debts education a d strive to help students be the best they can be.
Freshman,4,"At Wright State there is many different clubs and activities people can get involved in to make for a more interesting experience at college. I have made all my friends from the clubs I participate in. A downfall to this university is that the math teachers are not up to par. As every college has this reputation, Wright State is on the worse end of the spectrum. If you want a cheap, full college experience, Wright State is the place to go."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere both inside and outside of the classroom. The professors are willing to compensate any disability you may have, whether it be physical or mental."
Junior,4,"My experience at Wright State has been very good so far. It is a big campus but it is full of very friendly and helpful staff. It is not as intimate as what I was used to coming from a small high school, you have to your education into your own hands and ask questions and go to office hours. The staff is very willing to work with you and your schedule and I have always been appreciative of the service I have received."
Freshman,4,When I first moved on campus I thought i was in for a treat but after the first half of the semester things went down heel half of my classes got canceled before the semester was over couldn’t drink water from the sink in my dorm the water was horrible I didn’t have heat for the longest even when I called maintenance I had to get my own heater to keep warm. I suck in  My math professor wasn’t much instead of giving me extra help i was removed from class. My billing as been chaos every other day there’s a new bill and no one wants to explain what’s going on they’re rude every time I sit and talk with financial aid
Sophomore,4,I believe Wright State is extremely diverse and the staff and sport administration excels in all aspects. They are supportive and encouraging to all their students or athletes. I would agree that some of the buildings are a little old and hard to get around compared to a high school but other than that the school is great
Sophomore,4,"The engineering and computer science programs are good. Most of the teachers I've had will go out of their way to help with your problems if you contact them. They also have an office dedicated to finding internship and job opportunities, resume support, and interview practice. ROTC and air force opportunities exist on campus for people who want to take that route. 

It's main flaw is that it's largely a commuter school so there's not a lot to do on weekends when things close down early. Additionally, there's not much surrounding the campus so you need a car to access anything off campus."
Sophomore,4,It has a large campus and a diverse student body. The majority of the professors are good. They listen to the needs of their students and it is easy to get information on what's going on on campus.
Alum,4,I had a great experience with WSU.  The nursing program challenged me in realistic ways.  They have a cadaver lab I was able to learn anatomy in.  The CONH had a great new simulation lab as well.
Sophomore,4,"Wright State is a great school with solid academics, many extracurricular opportunities, and great diversity."
Sophomore,4,"As soon as I walked onto the campus for a tour I knew that there was something about it that made me feel at home. There is over 16000 students that go here but it still has a small town feel, and i like that."
Senior,4,"WSU is a great school for people like me who didn't know exactly what they wanted to study or do with their lives. Wright State has very affordable tuition, which is great because it allows students to experiment and change majors without feeling like they've wasted huge amounts of money. Something as important as a career field can't always be nailed down on the first choice. This is where Wright State's value truly reveals itself. It's an affordable university with a large range of programs study. With the air force base nearby and plenty of high profile companies in the area, it's easy to land an internship as well. My biggest complaint is the lack of social unity across campus. I hope this improves in the coming years with the addition of more clubs and extracurricular activities. I'd recommend WSU to any student who isn't quite sure what direction they want to take their career. I don't think they'll be disappointed."
Junior,4,Its a great college to be. nursing professor are very helpful. the institution provide adequate resources necessary for student success. i like the small lab/ clinical groups.
Sophomore,4,The things I like about Wright State University is the fact that all the classroom sizes aren't too big but a big thing I would like to see change is our financial crisis.
Niche User,4,"I really liked the campus. It was so pretty and unique. Also, everyone is really nice and helpful there. They offer all the activities and majors that I am interested in. The dorms are SUPER nice, especially the Woods housing quarters. Just an overall great experience."
Junior,4,"I choose Wright State because it is close to my parents, who I live with, it's close to base where I hope to work soon, and it was less expensive compared to other universities in the area. I like how some of the professors are very helpful. I do wish they are were as helpful as some. Changing up the tunnels a little would also be nice, they are kinda plain and creepy, also having more signs to know where you are going when you are new would be very helpful. Having the professors more accessible would be good, some are only there for class times or before/after, many students have classes back to back and can't get to the office hours well and the professors are not on campus enough to help students."
Senior,4,"Everyone here has Raider pride and cares about your education. Teachers are always available to talk to and really helpful. They have had to cut back on some programs with budget cuts, but overall it's a great school and I highly recommend it."
Senior,4,What I love most about Wright is the bonding the university has with rhe surrounding community and how the academics are a numver one priority!
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience has been great. I am involved in a lot go organizations and I have grown to use sources around campus such as the tutoring center. I would like to see more school events such as festivals held on campus. I feel that getting involved and making friends are hard things to do unless it is in an academic setting and I would rather be involved and meeting new friends while enjoying food trucks and activities."
Graduate Student,4,The lecturers are very experienced and the staffs are very friendly. They have great infrastructures and an awesome library. I mean there's a plane inside the library. The people are very nice. It close to every food joint you want to try. Want to eat at a New York deli its right there. Its also close to the air force base its just great. one down side its just too cold!
Sophomore,4,"Wright State University is a college that is dedicated to ensuring that all students have a chance to better themselves. The professors overall take time to ensure that every student is getting the time that they need, and learning assistants also aide in providing a positive learning environment. It is very affordable as far as universities go, but the food also reflects that. There is a diverse culture of international students and students from every possible background, allowing for healthy interaction and a unique community that is hard to find elsewhere."
Freshman,4,"Great college, but due to financial strain lacking in activities and things to do on campus, but for a strictly educational time, this is your best choice!"
Freshman,4,The staff and teachers their (at least the ones I've come across) were very friendly and willingly helped when called upon. The campus itself is rather well kept too. What honestly stops WS from getting fives stars is the horrendous parking.
Alum,4,I commuted but had a full schedule plus work opportunities in various departments.  The business programs were top notch.
Sophomore,4,"Wright State is a small, friendly campus. There is a club or organization for everyone and mostly small class sizes. General education courses sometimes have larger class sizes, but for the most part classes are fairly small. The math department could use some work, but everything else I've experienced has been great!"
Junior,2,"The engineering department hires decent people in the field, but they can not teach. When this coronavirus happened and classes were switched to online, most professors were inadequate with the transitions. This college is very mundane and not a lot goes on here."
Sophomore,2,Very few teachers were excited to teach and involved in their classes. The school is overpriced for such a mediocre education.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at Wright state University has been an learning experience,  the strike set me back in a time of depression and I stopped going to class because we weren’t learning or anything and I just wasn’t feeling it already so when the strike was over they expected us catch up on work we missed and I was struggling a lot on the work due to my condition. One thing I like about wright state is being able to communicate with my professors and they will help you a lot tbh."
Junior,2,"My graduation date got pushed back due to the strike. I was not being taught at the quality I believe we deserve. some of my professors were poor at teaching. I would ask questions and get responses like, ""it is not the difficult"" or ""I can't explain it any other way"". Very frustrating to go to class and not learn and feel completely embarrassed and hopeless."
Sophomore,2,"Many of the professors are not concerned with the well being of their class and I have actually witnessed professors discussing that they aim for their class averages to be low. There are a few gems, but the chemistry department in particular is a mess."
Junior,2,"Wright State University has excellent professors that teach a variety of classes. However, the school is poorly managed.  Additionally, as of writing this, WSU had had an 18-day strike.  While short, It was long enough to cause massive disruptions to dozens of courses.  Some professors even left for other institutes."
Sophomore,2,"Unless you are literally there to take a few classes and leave, don't go here. There is very little social life on campus and nothing to do in town. 

Classes and professors are stupidly easy.

Dorms are pretty decent but really loud and the RA's do little about the noise. 

If you're a commuter student or part time it's a great cheap option. If you're looking into it as a high schooler, I'd consider looking elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,They are in a  financial crises and have to make serious budget cuts. The only thing they seem to invest their time and money into is the basketball team.
Freshman,2,"The students on the floor are very rude! I would try and make myself notice to my neighbors and they would ignore me as I greet them. There would be times where an RA would knock on my door to write me up for being to loud for quiet hours. As they wrote me up they would say they had multiple complaints about my guest and I being loud. I then questioned well if there is a no warning policy, why couldn't one of my neighbors come and ask me to quiet down before they told the RA. They told me that the people on my floor are intimidated by my roommate. The reason being is because of the color of our skin. I have told  multiple people at Wright State the problem but no actions have been taken."
Sophomore,2,"Although the academic aspect of wright state is good, there are a lot of negatives that come with this university. For example, this school is bed bug city. They only treat by room and not by building which does not solve the problem at hand. One of the good things is they have a mass amount of shows and events to keep students  involved and become active students."
Niche User,2,"While I was visiting the Wright State campus, I learned that the campus is very accessible for handicap students.  The campus has underground hallways that connect almost all of their class buildings.  This would be very helpful during the cold winters or rainy days.  This campus also doesn't require students to live on campus, so this would be a great choice for people who live near the campus.  I would like to see the campus look more attractive (it has an old gloomy appearance)."
College Freshman,2,I saw a man get beat up in the middle of campus and 30+ cops showed up. I don't like it there.
College Freshman,2,I don't live on campus. It's outrageous what they want you to pay.
College Senior,2,It's hard to get work study on campus....REALLY HARD!
College Senior,2,You don't hear much about sports teams on campus
College Sophomore,2,Wright State doesn't have a football team which I think hurts them. Our school spirit is poor.
College Freshman,2,"I'm a pretty hardcore conservative, so all of the liberals that go to this school tend to be overwhelming at times. Also, I know like two people, so that sort of sucks. I'm hoping to transfer."
College Freshman,2,"My specific major is extremely competitive to get into, but when it comes to the quality of the program, it's excellent."
College Freshman,2,No one cares about the athletics at Wright State. Going to the basketball games is like visiting a graveyard.
College Sophomore,2,Don't really deal much with people involved in Greek life
College Freshman,2,"There is not much, they keep to them selves"
College Freshman,2,My experience at wsu was not really that good
College Junior,2,Students hardly ever attend games
College Freshman,2,"The health and safety resources on campus are good from what i have heard, i personally have not used them but i have friends who have used the services"
College Freshman,2,"As I said earlier, i plan on transferring after this year. I'm sure many people will like this universtity. I am just not one of them. It isn't that it is bad, it's just super boring and not that much cheaper than other alternatives."
College Freshman,2,"We have a division one basketball team, however no one goes to the games nor does anyone pay attention to it. There is no football team here at the university even though people have been asking for one"
College Sophomore,2,You never see them around unless recruitment is near or they want your money
College Freshman,2,The actual school part is good. The classes go well and all the professors are nice and helpful for the most part. However everyone leaves for the weekend starting Friday morning and if you live on campus there is nothing here to do.
College Sophomore,2,"It's the same foods and some places close early. Eventually it gets tiring eating the same thing. Though this is so, Wendy's does do discounts for students. WO's I guess is okay. Everyone goes there ."
College Freshman,2,don't really get help with scholarships
College Junior,2,"Got a minor in my major at my previous college and comparing it to WSUs its like comparing a Porche to a FIAT. the College of Liberal Arts has way too many requirements, sometimes I feel like I am taking classes to fill these requirements not to help me in the real world, like 4 semesters of a foreign language. The teachers in the program are ok but the head of the major and advisors suck. I do not take classes sometimes specifically for criminal justice, sometimes having to take psychology, sociology, or political science classes that barely touch on the criminal justice system."
College Junior,2,"Was in a frat at another university. At Wright State greek life is subpar, but kids in frats/sororities do not seem like they are better than other students which does happen at some colleges with a lot of greeks"
College Junior,2,"Wright State doesn't have a reputation of a great party school, but I'm a nontraditional student so I assume there are parties but nothing like UD or Ohio State. The bars around campus aren't that great either, but have cheap drinks."
College Freshman,2,It seems as if the school does not try help with further research in what financial aid can be given
College Senior,2,"I've actually gotten little to no aid from WSU itself, most of my financial aid I have had to apply for from third parties and sources outside of WSU and even that has been a struggle.  I've gotten a lot of aid from my father, who gave me almost the entirety of his G.I. Bill as he did not need it and the VA has been helpful with that but supplementing other costs  has been difficult."
College Senior,2,"To explain my rating a bit: I don't think the food options are bad, in fact WSU actually has a decent variety of places and food to choose from on campus.  But it's expensive.  Very expensive.  They will charge as much as $5 for a sandwich, something as simple as just bread, a slice of turkey and a slice of cheese.  And after draining us of all our money in tuition and books they heavily push their meal plans for eating on campus (which are very expensive as well).  I've looked at my food budget (for eating at home and bringing my own meals) and If I plan it correctly (i.e. stay away from those expensive cheeses at Krogers) it comes no where near the cost of eating on campus.  It's a pain to have to bring my own food, but the cost difference isn't nearly close enough for me to consider otherwise."
College Junior,2,Financial aid is horrendous here. Processing paperwork and meeting with an adviser is very tedious.
College Freshman,2,Ohio weather is the worst! It's cold... and it snows ALL the time!
College Junior,2,"I majored in Biological Sciences with a focus in Exercise Biology.  The program was not good and class availability is almost a joke.  The current professor running the program is about to step down so there are many questions left unanswered still.  Most of the required classes are only offered one semester a year and only have about 20 seats available.  If you do not get into the class there is really nothing you can do except wait, or take classes that have nothing to do with the program.  If I had to do it again I would have done the Athletic Training or Sports Science program.  My career goals are to work in the field of fitness and/or nutrition.  I have little concern about finding a job in my field once my degree is finally completed."
College Sophomore,2,Only sports this school talks about is the mens basketball team.
College Sophomore,2,"its on the outskirts of dayton, which is sometimes considered a bad city. but all of the suburban cities have a lot of places to go."
College Sophomore,2,"If youre not very social or involved on campus, its going to be boring."
College Sophomore,2,"This isn't a party school at all. If you don't have a car, your college experience will suck. You have to be involved in clubs to find good parties or have things to do. If not, your life is going to be pretty boring."
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much greek life here & they don't appear to be doing much of anything
College Freshman,2,I constantly hear about robbery and stolen cars. It makes me wish I didn't have a car on campus but I know that if I needed help that the police would be there in a minute. I also like that we have the emergency poles around campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,WSU is pretty strict. The party pit was overtaken by the Christians in action group and that which used to be party central where keggers were held. They also put a gate to separate on/off campus. They also train RAs to stop on campus parties.
College Sophomore,2,There have been multiple robberies and thefts on campus and very close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,Wright State NEVER cancels class during winter weather advisories even when the air-force base closes due to weather.
College Student,2,There is pretty much no decent bars or clubs. There are no major parties except for a kickoff for the freshman in the fall to welcome them. There are usually school sports games being held down the street at the Nutter Center. Sometimes artists and bands perform there. You can get transportation down there with shuttles or walk there.
College Freshman,2,"We have tunnels so we do not get any delays or cancellations, which makes it difficult for commuters."
College Senior,2,"We have had a large amount of snow since November 2013. Yet, school is rarely cancelled. Students have to walk and drive through ice and snow. It is now February, but there is currently another winter weather advisory in effect."
College Senior,2,"The drug scene here is somewhat hidden. Everyone is aware of it from alcohol to Marijuana, but unfortunately not much is done against it."
College Senior,2,"Safety here is not the best. My friend called the police to respond to her room mates' drug possession, but they never showed up."
College Senior,2,"Parking is not that great, and the local buses are terrible."
College Sophomore,2,"If you're a 4.0 you're good to go but if not forget it! they don""t offer anything for someone that is just trying hard & doing decent that really needs financial assistance. Ad for the people in the financial aid office they're rude to the students & don't try to help you find any type of help."
College Sophomore,2,Drive your own car as soon as you can!!!!
College Junior,2,There are only a few bars in the area worth going to. Most bars you have to travel into city of Dayton. Most of the parties take place on off-campus apartments close to the university. 
College Junior,2,Student involvement could be light years better. No one really attends the games but the team never performs that well either so students aren't missing that much.
College Junior,2,"Not very many people live on campus. Not worth the money. There are plenty of apartments around campus that are 1/3 the cost of resident fees. There are buildings sitting almost completely empty. The buildings are nice though, just expensive. "
College Senior,2,"Thee dining services are very limited and operated by untrained staff...there are not properly made coffee choices, no fresh pastries, very expensive yogurt cups, limited salads, etc.  "
Freshman,1,I recently attend wright state in the fall of 2019 and it was a disaster . If you’re thinking of going to this school don’t. The cafeteria service in the hangar they are very rude. The advisors don’t even give a crap speaking from the nursing department. I have also had very rude staff with attitudes when I asked a simple question. If you get a parking ticket it’s 50 or 100 dollars. The tunnels are good that’s it. I transferred after the fall.My current advisor even said the class I took as a freshman were ridiculous. Some of the professors are really nice. Parking is awful. Don’t go here not much going on they got soccer and basketball that’s about it. Trash I met some nice people here but after the fall majority dropped out. 10/10 don’t recommend what so ever maybe go for teaching I heard good things from that department but not for me.
Freshman,1,I did take a online classes my basic freshman year they didn’t even put me in an English class and straight into organic chem trash
Graduate Student,1,I have had so many problems getting in touch with advisors or being told wrong information almost every time. Things that should have been fixed in a day took semesters because no one puts any care into their jobs. I am mainly speaking of the math department and advisors here.
Senior,1,"This school is supposed to be a State school but they are against abortions and allow people come on campus to support their beliefs but don't allow their students the same courtesy.  This school supports science classes to support belief in god and support their own agendas but again, not their students..."
Senior,1,"Avoid WSU at ALL costs! A deeply corrupt and unstable institution so far in debt it's unfathomable. If you come here, prepare to lose lots of time and credits due to having to transfer. They committed HUGE H1-B visa fraud AND settled with the feds for $2 million for cheating people out of their student aid in still untold amounts. They still had to cut over $30 million last year. Even AFTER they pulled strings on the gov. (+20$million) Another round of cuts made it so they couldn't even afford to print paper in their own offices at one point. The labs are disgusting and outdated; they cut most of their cleaning crews. They cut a HUGE amount of faculty as well. Good luck having more than one option (if any) even for required courses in many cases. DO NOT take any of your math courses here especially calculus and up. 
Just the morning of writing this; they now need to somehow cut ANOTHER $10mill+. The humanities here are delusional only come if you already have a victimhood mentality."
College Freshman,1,I hate the parties. They disturb students trying to learn.
College Freshman,1,90% of the students drink and/or use drugs. It's awful.
College Sophomore,1,There aren't really any parties forreal. The Province always gets shut down  cause everybody just does the most.
College Freshman,1,"I live in the Honors dorm on campus, so I don't have to worry about finding a spot, but everyone I've spoken to told me that the parking here is bloody impossible."
College Sophomore,1,No money given too me paying out of pocket e
College Freshman,1,I'm not saying the food is bad it just have an bad variety of food
College Freshman,1,not enough variety. the reason people are so obesed
Recent Alumnus,1,Fighting a case right now that involves transferring classes.
Recent Alumnus,1,Just horrible because the whole online pin thing.
College Junior,1,The weather is not great.  The college is in Ohio... enough said.
College Junior,1,"Greek life is present at Wright State, but only about 2% of the student body even participate."
College Senior,1,"I HATE THE SNOW!!!!!!!!!! Also, when we were delayed, they didn't even plow the parking lots until after we opened, so everyone was getting stuck."
College Sophomore,1,You have to pay $50 a semester for a pass & there's never anywhere to park close to any classes you have!!!
College Freshman,1,There needs to be more spaces to park. It is too hard for me to find a parking spot!
College Sophomore,1,With so many students that commute the parking is awful and there is never a good place to park unless you come at like six o'clock in the morning. Don't park where you are not supposed to because you will get a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,It is boring and there is nothing to do.
College Freshman,1,It is super annoying and too time consuming for me.
College Senior,1,It's awful. I will see one amount on my online account and then receive a letter stating that I owe more and have only a few days to pay thousands of dollars that I don't have.
College Student,1,"The athletics at this school are not very good, there is little to none sports that are varsity."
College Freshman,1,"There is literally not enough parking. It is absolutely ridiculous. You can ask anyone who goes there, even the workers have problems. We pay so much to park, but then we have no where to park! It is one of the worst things ever. Everyone complains about it. You may drive around for hours till you find a spot. Or park and Meijer and its like a 12 mile walk to all classes."
College Junior,1,There are very few places on campus to dine. To get good food you have to go off campus.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. Every student has the same pass which makes it very difficult to get to class in a timely manner. As a graduate student, I believe that we should get higher parking privileges compared to undergraduates, however they are all the same."
College Junior,1,"parking spaces are limited
the fee for a parking pass is not included in tuition
the fines for not adhering to the rules are pricey"
College Sophomore,1,"Simply put - not worth the hassles
http://www.studentsreview.com/OH/WSU.html"
College Junior,1,Parking can be a nightmare. There are way more faculty and staff spaces close to the main doors that commuter parking. If you don't get there before 9 good luck parking.
College Sophomore,1,"I personally have never had to park because I have only lived in the dorms and I walk to class. But I hear a lot of grumble from people walking into class late about how hard it was to find a spot, and how they had to fight over one with another student! Sounds like a nightmare!"
College Junior,1,"The strictness is overall pretty good, but some of the officers tend to use racial profiling which has and still is causing some tension on campus. Just last year the Bolinga Center (part of the Multicultural Cener) held a Black Out town hall meeting to address these issues. The administrators said they'd help out with this as best they can, so I believe next year will be better."
College Junior,1,Horrible if you ask me. Everyone knows this already and I already gave an explanation earlier why.
College Senior,1,Take forever and there is way more teacher and staff parking but more students. what's up with that
College Junior,1,"The university needs to build another parking lot, one closer to campus that is for STUDENTS ONLY"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life on campus is not very big, and there are not very many fraternity or sororities to choose from. But what fraternities and sororities there are does not just concentrate on parties it concentrates on academics and charity events."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a nightmare. Especially around the noon hour or so. There is a lot of sharking that happens. Also there are way too many teacher spots. I think teacher spots out number student parking and we who pay 50 dollars for parking end up having to park either off campus or way out in left field and it is not a good situation.
College Freshman,1,"There is a lot of parking on Campus, but many of those spots are reserved. Sometimes the walk from the car to wherever your going can be long. Although the parking is not that good, I think it is cool that freshmen are allowed to have cars, many campuses do not allow this."
College Sophomore,1,The University seems to be pretty strict when it comes to underage drinking or fighting on campus grounds.
College Sophomore,1,Only 5 minutes of hot water for showers and their are 4 of us.  The hot water has gone out twice this semester alone.  I had to boil water today so I could do my dishes.
College Sophomore,1,Here at Wright State all of the Greek members are very snobby people. They all like to stick to there little clicks and not leave. If you do not fit the stereotype they don't talk to you. In reality no idea why its not like they have housing or anything.
College Senior,1,No Help for Transfer Students – I have recieved no scholarships from WSU and have applied for several. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA every quarter I have been here and have yet to recieve any help after transferring. It's very hard to pay for school out of pocket as a military spouse. Very unfortuante.
College Sophomore,1,"I will have a car on campus this year, but from my freshman observations, there is way too much parking for the professors, since their lot is regularly half empty. The student parking is greatly lacking, and I've heard all sorts of complaints about it."
College Freshman,1,"Greeks Are Irrelevant and Annoying – The rare times I see a Greek is when they're being loud and obnoxious while ""strolling"" around campus."
College Junior,1,No sleep if you are one of the few students that has a job while attending school. No consideration at all for neighbors and arguing couples all around threatening to kill each other.  No help from anyone and people act like its killing them to do their job. Unless you are black you won't get any help.
College Freshman,1,"There are shuttles and buses galore, but they don't go where you really need to go. Parking is terrible (there are lots so far away that you have to take a shuttle to get to them, however the shuttle doesn't go to that lot all the time)."
College Freshman,1,Most of the off-campus dining near Wright State consists of fast food chains. Two thumbs up if you want McDonalds.
College Sophomore,1,Driving at School – Wright States parking is horrible. There are never any places to park weather you have a commuter pass or not theres just not enough space on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on wright state's campus stinks! You often have to get to campus hours before class to try to find a spot and even then you might have to go to lot 20 which you must take a shuttle to campus, that's how far away that is. it's not even within walking distance. There has been debate about a parking garage but it doesn't look like it's going to happen. With the rapidly growing student population, they really should do something about this."
College Freshman,1,The Greeks – Greeklife at WSU isnt Huge ... The Greeks Dont have the Own Housing we have some greek events but they arent that special. Your Grade must be amazing to become one and you must have libaray time down at least a 1hr a day. I would say its better to be a Non-Greek but its not bad at all to join if you dare
Recent Alumnus,1,"Academic advisors in both my undergrad and grad programs did not have universal information. I was told incorrectly about a number of classes in my undergrad program. In my graduate program, I fought having to retake classes with the same professors, syllabi, and  textbooks as I took in my undergrad program, and was forced to retake them. Upon my last check before graduating, I was told, ""you didn't have to take these twice."""
Recent Alumnus,1,"Education Department – I attended the school for my undergrad degree in early childhood education, and also for my masters as an intervention specialist (only because it was paid up front by my employer.) Students are thrown into assigned practicum assignments with poor teachers, who are neither good at their profession or at mentoring others. When a mentor teacher left the classroom, leaving me alone with students with no notice, I was given a failing grade for that practicum and had to make it up by doing 2 practicums the next quarter. The teacher was not held responsible, although it was her poor decision making that caused me to be left alone."
College Sophomore,1,The weather affects our campus experience by us having to talk if it snowing or raining on campus. From the dormitory to the campus there are no tunnels.
College Freshman,1,"Night life is virtually non exsistant. Almost anything that has an enter sign closes at 10 or earlier. Which, is extreamly early for a working college freshman. There are a few clubs to go to on wednesdays and fridays that are very popular but forget about it for the other days of the week. A couple dorm/apartment parties here and there but if you dont drink heavily it really wouldnt be your thing."
College Freshman,1,"The Atmosphere Is Death – Campus is dead, long live the campus. It actually has nothing to do with the staff either; it's the students. They act miserable, they're insular to the point of being hostile to strangers, and the whole city is like that it seems. There are nice people here but you have to dig to find them."
College Freshman,1,"I Hate This Place – I hate it here. The meal plan is an entrapment scheme, the city of Dayton is just a massive pile of seething, evil, spiteful, pessimistic people who either have no ambition or hate everyone and everything. The dorms are evil, provide absolutely no privacy and don't offer anything positive whatsoever, the atmosphere is hostile and I hate it here. The only good thing about this school is the staff. Not all of the staff, but some of the teachers are excellent and the residence staff is alright. The rest of them are only as nice as they're paid to be. There is an atmosphere of helplessness here and most of the people here are perpetually miserable for good reasons."
College Freshman,1,"I Hate the Meal Plan – This mealplan is an entrapment scheme. It's 917 dollars per quarter if you live on campus, and you can only spend your mealplan money at Campus restaurants and establishments (which are absurdly expensive) or to eat out (which is absurdly expensive)."
College Freshman,1,"Not Worth It – The punishments at Wright State definitely make the action not worth it. When caught in the act of underage drinking, they not only will send you to a judicial system on campus, but you'll also have to watch a three hour information video online and take a test on about the negative effects of alcohol. It's just not worth it. Even being too loud during quiet hours can result in fines that are too expensive on a student's budget. My advice, keep it to a minimum, especially on the drinking, because like I said, it's just not worth it."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing Impressive – Pretty much the only thing Wright State has to their credit is the quality of some of their programs. That's about it. Campus life is almost non existent due to the large proportions of commuter students. Wright State will forever be the jealous little brother of Ohio State, and UD (University of Dayton), they are much more exciting and better overall places; WSU tries so hard to compare and brag about themselves, but they fall short. There are some very smart people here, but for each one there are 5 subpar students who may drop out in the future. A lot of people I have met here say they want to transfer eventually. Wright State is a good place to come for washed up people looking for second chances, and people who can't really do any better. If you can get in any better schools, just do it, you will not regret it. This is at best a safety net school. "
College Freshman,1,"Get here at 7 AM, MAYBE you'll find a spot then. They should build a garage."

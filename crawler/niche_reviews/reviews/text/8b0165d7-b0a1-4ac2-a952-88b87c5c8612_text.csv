Sophomore,5,I took this school for granted the first time around. It is very laid back but academically rigorous.
Junior,5,My online experience has been surprisingly smooth. Their online advisors and teaching system seem to work because I can usually expect a response or solution to anything I'm having a problem with pretty quickly and they are responsive and timely with such. The online portals and setup are clear and easy to understand and I haven't had any difficulties with anything technical. You are able to see all your information and grades seamlessly with ease through their online systems which saves me a lot of time and effort in locating important information.
Junior,5,"This is my first year attending this school and so far it seems well organized and that the staff knows what there doing. There is a lot of resources at the campus for students and the peer body is usually welcoming and friendly. My advisor is very easy to contact and I really appreciate that because sometimes my family and I get confused with the information we are supposed to provide. I feel that my education has been put at their priority and I genuinely do feel like I am learning a lot about my career field with the courses they have available. Living on Campus is also nice, there is a 24-hour library which I frequent pretty often and the food options are pretty extensive as well. The campus itself is located near a shopping center with plenty to do around it so I also enjoy that I can go venture out to the surrounding areas for other cool things as well. It is central to everywhere around Jacksonville which is convenient as it only is about 15-20 to get anywhere."
Senior,5,"Taking classes online was a rough adjustment, however, with the help of the teachers and new technology it has because the norm!"
Senior,5,I am in my senior year at UNF for mechanical engineering. I have had a great experience with this school and most of the teachers are very qualified and love their jobs.
Niche User,5,"I loved the University of North Florida! The campus is absolutely beautiful and walking to class everyday was a treat. The class sizes were small enough to develop a relationship with your professors, which I really loved. The library was very organized and a great place to study. Everything about this school was just great!"
Niche User,5,"I took several classes online. I think that UNF did a great job with assigning the most equipped professors to overlook and teach the classes online. Course content was easily accessible and the assignments were always structured in a way to access, see the deadline, and to submit easily."
Junior,5,"I've had to take all of the five classes online because of the pandemic. Most of the classes have a ZOOM meeting once a week.  I prefer face-to-face classes, but all of my professors have made being online feel a lot less stressful and I anticipated.  Anytime I have any concerns, my professors are kind enough to help me through them."
Junior,5,Every staff member I have met is extremely helpful. Every question I have is promptly answered.  I've never felt embarrassed to ask anything. I feel respected by all of the professors. I am so excited to be at this school.
Sophomore,5,"Wel first off I’ve lived in Jacksonville pretty much my whole life. My whole is family is here so it is nice to be able to attend a college that would not only let me study my passion of Criminal Justice  but be close to family. Since day 1 The University of North Florida has provided me with the tools I need to accomplish my goals and succeed within my major. The atmosphere around Unf is amazing. Nestled in the middle of a preserve. Unf gives you the opportunity to get away away from some to the hassles of a busy city life. From academics to clubs, Unf is the place to go, hands down."
Niche User,5,I haven't had any classes online so far. but I have been able to go on canvas and its pretty easy to manage.
Freshman,5,It is my first year and it has been great. The institution is on remote services right now but the staff is very helpful. The service is fast and you get everything you need even during a pandemic like this.
Freshman,5,Being  a new student at UNF during a period pandemic was really difficult because everything is new but I loved the way UNF operated and made it easier for us to be updated with all our materials and documents to start a new journey at UNF. Everyone was very helpful and e-mail were responded under 24 hours which made me feel better about the help I recieved.
Senior,5,"I enjoy taking online classes because I don’t mind not being in a classroom from time to time. That feeling has changed due to the pandemic. I can say that I have taken on campus classes for granted. I miss meeting new people, I miss taking notes in class, and laughing in class. Thankfully, I have professors that keep their class and assignments up to date online and are able to reach out quickly now that classes are online."
Freshman,5,University of North Florida is hand down the best college in Florida. Their nursing programs is one of the best in Florida. Not to mention that their unofficial mascot is a duck. North Florida is a perfect sized school with many different organizations and clubs available and still include the personal sized class.
Sophomore,5,"When I was young, my friends used to talk about their dream college. Picture frames, blankets, plastic cups with a swirly straw that captured your attention no matter how hard you tried not to stare lined my friends’ bedrooms. I never knew what college I wanted to go to. As the years moved on, this thought bugged me. By senior year of high school, I applied to UNF, a college 10 out of the 700 seniors decided to attend. I was accepted immediately. Was it wrong that I was not as excited as my friends were, running down the high school halls screaming about getting into FSU? For this I felt guilty and visited the place I would soon call home. UNF opened its doors for me that day. My life has changed for the better in so many ways possible. The professors are extremely passionate and grateful for you to be there. The cafeteria provides food for any diet. Student life flourishes. The dorms are extremely inviting. UNF has warmed my heart and it always will for the rest of my life."
Sophomore,5,"I like how helpful the professors are! The counseling system is great, too. The school has an awesome gym and the campus is not too big or too small, but just right."
Freshman,5,It's a fun experience I would love to attend. It seems like an environment I would love to experience and have my college experience with amazing people that will go there. I know that it is very affordable and help with financial costs.
Freshman,5,So far I have really loved my experience. The school is beautiful! It is the perfect size if you prefer a small to medium-size campus. There is so much to do there from basketball games to market days. There is something for everyone. Along with being an amazing campus there also many amazing places to dine such as Chick-Fil-A and Pita Pit. If you get tired of that the St.Johns town center is only a bus ride away! The teachers and advisors are awesome and are willing to work with you on whatever you need. There is also mental-health services with trained therapist there to help you. I am only a freshman but I have already fallen in love with this campus! Go Ospreys!
Junior,5,It's a small but nice university. There are many activities to do and clubs to join. It's an amazing atmosphere that I truly enjoy.
Sophomore,5,Personally I  have loved my time at UNF so far. I feel like they truly care about their students and hold many events that are free to students. It is definitely an underrated school compared to the bigger schools around. The campus is amazing and they are planning on adding more administration buildings and better dorms. The price of tuition is not that expensive compared to the other schools in the area as well. The class sizes range from 20 to 250 and most of the professors (except for a select few of course) are willing to help whenever and amazing at their job.
Senior,5,"The campus is safe, not too big or too small, and is surrounded by nature. There are countless opportunities offered for students academically and recreationally. They provide a lot of helpful resources and there is always someone willing to help if you need something."
Freshman,5,When taking a tour on the campus the people there were so nice we got to talk to some of the students that went to the university of north Florida and they said they loved it.Their professors were engaging and making sure you understand what’s going on in the class room I just fell in love with the campus?
Niche User,5,I absolutely adore the campus and all the programs it has to offer. I know this school is going to be the right fit for me!
Niche User,5,The campus is really beautiful and the amount of opportunities available to you could really be life changing.
Senior,5,"The University of North Florida has an incredible wildlife conservation effort so the campus is encapsulated by nature itself. One could walk its entirety in about 20-25 minutes, so it's convenient for those who live on campus. If I could change anything, I would definitely add more places to park! With the increasing student population, finding place to park has become a challenge. Also, UNF is known for its undefeated football team! Oh, you haven't heard? Go ahead, look it up!"
Senior,5,"Transferred to UNF with an AA degree. The last 2 years have been amazing. I will graduate in May, then hopefully return in August to attend grad school for International Affairs. Swoop!!"
Freshman,5,"great honor code, beautiful campus, greek life is amazing, good resource centers, nothing to change really"
Junior,5,"I love the University of North Florida! The campus is very beautiful. The teachers are so nice here, which is why I decided to transfer to UNF. The advisors here are also very nice. She helped me plan out my classes, which made it so much easier for me."
Sophomore,5,I love how it is surrounded by nature and everyone is so friendly.  The professors are very fun and lively as well. They have many opportunities for you to grow and find what you like.
Graduate Student,5,Loved UNF for undergrad so much I’m here for Graduate school. I’d say more food options on campus otherwise wonderful!!!
Freshman,5,"UNF is a very welcoming university with magnificent professors, staff, and students. Whenever I have trouble with anything, I go to the advisors, and they help me out tremendously. They have many valuable sources, like volunteer opportunities, on-campus jobs, clubs, etc."
Junior,5,"It's a really good school that even though smaller than most, strives to give you the same experience you would have anywhere else. No one like you, no place like this. Swoop!"
Freshman,5,The University of North Florida is a welcoming and open school. The academics are stellar but the school gives one purpose and cares about its students more then anything else.
Senior,5,"I like their positive environment. Their friendly students and staffs always create positive energy. Also, the professors and counselors are very helpful."
Freshman,5,"My experience with University of Florida so far has been great! The professors are really experienced and most of my classes, although somewhat difficult, are also very entertaining. Moreover there are a lot of opportunities to connect with other students, most of who come from different background and ethnicities. There are also a large number of clubs and organizations at UNF which offer you a lot of possibilities for your future!"
Niche User,5,"When touring there, they were very kind and informative. Any question I had, they were able to answer! Getting my information to them has been very simple and easy. All of my friends that attend this University love it. They put a lot of effort into their activities and their overall University and I am very grateful for that!"
Alum,5,"From the beautiful campus to the diversification of the classes, if you really want to learn about your passion, I think that the University of North Florida is a great place for you! I love my alum because of the presence and impact that all of my professors made in my life. The class sizes are small so they really try to understand, talk to, and prepare you for your future."
Senior,5,"I have had a pleasant experience at UNF so far, I have had access to everything I need and it is easy to find out what you need to do to stay on track!"
Freshman,5,"My experience with the University of North Florida has been great.  Everyone who works their is very nice, and they have several major options to choose from."
Freshman,5,Love it so far.  It has only been a week but everyone has been super helpful. I wish there was a football team but thats my only complaint.
Sophomore,5,"Great teaching staff and overall campus. Office hours are always available to students who need extra one-on-one help. Safety is one of this University's top priorities and it is exemplified in the way people act around campus. There is much diversity, allowing you to meet people and learn new things from students with different backgrounds."
Sophomore,5,"At the University of North Florida, I have received great academic experiences through professors that truly want to help you with your academic success. Not only academically is UNF sane, but the campus life is equally as great. Everyone feels accepted and can fit right in anywhere, may it be through clubs or just by socializing."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at UNF, but I already completed summer b. I love the location, the environment, and the friendly, academic atmosphere. Teachers are really helpful and nice to students."
Junior,5,The staff wants you to succeed and they are willing to go above and beyond to make sure that attend their college within your means.
Freshman,5,I attend at  university of north Florida. I started summer b and I totally recommend starting then. It really made me feel comfortable with the campus before fall. Also the food is wonderful and the dorms aren’t too bad either! There’s a wonderful basketball team along with an amazing gym. Also the college is a 15 minute drive from the beach depending on the traffic. The professors also are very friendly and try to help whenever they can.
Freshman,5,"It’s such an amazing school and everyone is so friendly. The process for enrolling is super easy, I know that I will have an amazing experience at this school."
Junior,5,UNF is such a gorgeous school. UNF is known as a hidden gem in the state of Florida. They are many diverse majors and programs. UNF does not always get the recognition that it deserves. I really recommend this school. I am an out-of-state student and I would not trade my experience for anything else.
Junior,5,I have always had an awesome experience with unf! The staff and current students are always so helpful! I am so proud to be starting nursing school with them next month and I know they will provide me with quality education. Unf definitely makes a positive difference in people’s lives.
Freshman,5,The staff and teachers at the University of North Florida actually care for you and want you to learn. The study materials and the amount of resources available are really helpful since it gives everyone a chance to be able to get all their homework and studying done easily.
Alum,5,"If you are looking for a smaller/medium sized school, in an excellent location with great professors, UNF is your choice! I absolutely loved my four years here and would not have traded it for the world!"
Freshman,5,I like their campus because the campus surround by nature. There are studies program from University of North Florida have been recognize by national and by Florida state. There are many different dorm styles that you can choose. The food on campus are amazing and they also have fast food on campus available for student. There are ton of centers and resources that can help you to pass your courses. UNF also tried all their best to provide financial aid to the one in need.
Alum,5,"UNF was a relatively small hometown college when I attended years ago, but its forward thinking leadership has advanced it to become a sound university for many major degrees.  I'm proud to say that my son just graduated high school and has chosen to study mechanical engineering at UNF!"
Freshman,5,This campus is very friendly and beautiful to be at. The school caters to the students and I always feel like I am making the best of my education here. I totally recommend this school to anyone who doesn't like big schools.
Sophomore,5,I love the small campus and how it allows students to really interact with their fellow classmates and teachers. They also excel in extra circular activities which make it super easy and fun to get involved on campus.
Freshman,5,Will be starting college next month.  So far my experiences have been positive from the initial tour and communication with the various offices.
Sophomore,5,"I really like the size of the campus, it is a fairly small campus. The location is surrounded by many stores and food options and a shuttle will take you to the stores and back. I also like that if you are local you are not required to live on campus even as a freshmen. I would like to see a improvement with the amount of parking  given by the campus."
Freshman,5,My name is Moon Ja. I am from a refugee from Burma. I have been learning English for four years. I study very hard to be able to attend UNF. My major is nursing. I love my school because I am learning very interesting in class. My school has a fitness center. I can go and run on the treadmill when I feel really stress. My school has a swimming pool. I go swimming when my brain goes numb from studying for a long time. My school has a lot of big tresses which gives us very fresh air to be able to do well on the exam. Sometimes my class is freezing cool. I would like to make it less cold so that I will be able to focus more on the lecture.
Senior,5,"I love it

Junior,5,I am returning to school after a previous bachelors and masters degree. It has been nothing but good to be so far! I am in the nursing program.
Alum,4,The online learning experience was great. I was able to learn the same way as if I was attending an in-person class.
Sophomore,4,Overall during the pandemic my professors work hard to make as many zoom meetings as possible to ensure we know what is going on. Inside the class we try to work as a community together so we all can have an enjoyable experience.
Sophomore,4,I am still experiencing the effects of University of  North Florida. I am actually a current transfer student. While in the midst of transferring I came into a lot of verification problem.But i have done many events and tours on the UNF campus very pretty and it is pretty big.
Senior,4,"So far its been great besides the fact that it's impossible to get instate tuition unless you graduated high school here. Great classes, beautiful campus, ok commute."
Senior,4,"Learning online has saved me, I work and go to school full time so having online classes that work and allows me to do my school work around my job."
Alum,4,UNF makes online learning easy to navigate and accessible. Professors are always available. The curriculum is organized in a way that makes it easy to learn.
Sophomore,4,I started taking my online classes after spring break because that is when the coronavirus made in class instruction difficult. For the most part I would say that the shift from in class to online instruction was pretty smooth for me. Most of my resources were online anyway so the shift didn’t really affect me that much. One class that I could say was a little difficult was math and that was just because I’m more of a visual learner which is more difficult through the screen. But in general my professors handled the switch professionally and effectively.
Niche User,4,My experience was very limited due to the virus. although they have had to move things online they are still working hard to give what the students need.
Senior,4,"I have loved my time at UNF! The people and professors are genuine and fun people. The Graphic Design program is a hidden gem of the school, offering a rigorous course load taught by well rounded and experienced professors."
Freshman,4,"I am extremely excited to attend a smaller school. It fits my personality well. I also like that UNF is in an urban area. It is close to the beach, malls, and fantastic internships. Living in Florida, I love the beach. I am planning to major in Education, they have so many opportunities for me to become a better teacher."
Freshman,4,I never took any online classes or I don't know if I am at UNF. I heard it's very good and rewarding. The professor give their time to the students to see them achieve better in life.
Freshman,4,I have never been there yet but I heard it is very excellent campus to be on with many different types of people there. It's a great scene to connect and learn with your professors at UNF. I'll be gladly to report more positive feedback when I go.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UNF has been amazing overall. The courses are very informative and actually teach you valid information. My professors have been amazing and have really helped me reach where I am. The classes are usually filled with very friendly people. The campus is beautiful and there are amazing resources one can enjoy. The fast food restaurants and coffee shops are great and very tasty. The University of North Florida is filled with so much love and enthusiasm. I absolutely love going to UNF, I always feel so happy there because the atmosphere is so peaceful and lovely. I would recommend for anyone to attend UNF, they would not regret it!"
Sophomore,4,"Taking courses online can be pretty easy but it really depends on the course. Over the past few months, due to the Coronavirus, classes were moved to online. Some classes are better in person because it allows for everyone to really connect with each other and many courses need students to discuss their week’s learning in person. This was tedious to do for my Creative Writing class, for example. Thankfully, I had an amazing professor, David Blanton, who made it simple and also fun for us to continue our course online. Each person’s online experience varies depending on the subject and especially the professor."
Senior,4,"I transferred to UNF at the beginning of 2018. I was excited to start my college career at a great university. The school is very diverse, I made a lot of friends from different countries. I have experienced many things that the old me wouldn’t have tried. I am now taking the opportunity to internship at UNF’s number news source, Spinnaker Media. I can say that UNF has changed me. I was a shy kid, now I am taking any opportunity to become successful."
Sophomore,4,"I love my university. I loved how UNF gives students many resources to succeed in classes. In campus there is many opportunities to socialize. Also UNF has amazing nature trails. They also provide kayaking, a rope course, rock wall, and many other fun things to do for fun. Something that I would like them to improve is the parking availability."
Senior,4,"Location: Right next to the town center and the beach. You really can't beat Jacksonville beach for a college town. There is tons of night life and so much good food. 
Academics: Very good nursing program and construction management program. Could do better with some engineering and biology departments. 
Athletics: If you're not into soccer or basketball your out of luck. We don't have football but all of that money is recycled somewhere.
Library: Tommy G. Carpenter library is very nice with awesome technology and seemingly endless amount of study rooms.
Food: Very healthy options on campus. Jacksonville is a 'home grown' kind of town. There are farmers markets every Saturday with fresh produce available for cheap."
Sophomore,4,The University of North Florida is a beautiful campus where you can find all sorts of interesting things happening everyday. It is a very relaxed campus with plenty of nature trails and nature activities to seek out. The food is also very good...most of the time.
Junior,4,The University of North Florida is a great school near downtown and the beach. The professors and advisors are awesome. Most of the classes aren't too big and you'll most likely get the guidance and help you need from your professors. and the school spirit is good. Everyone at UNF is very welcoming and doesn't make you feel left out.
Graduate Student,4,I am currently in my second semester at UNF. So far I have been satisfied with the professors and the workload. Most teachers seem to care for their students.
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to north Florida because of the campus and the overall feel of the school. UNF is a very welcoming community. The one thing I love about this school is how nature friendly it is. They have a nature walk and a lake that students can kayak or paddle board on their free time. The one thing I would change is the student life. I wish this school was more active with their students, but the only student life is really their frat/ sorority organizations.’"
Alum,4,I enjoyed UNF. The campus is small but not too small. The smallness gives it a comfortable feel. The professors I had were all amazing. The elementary education program was pretty great. The one thing I would change would be the opportunity for more student teaching.
Niche User,4,"I've had a positive experience with this college and the application process. I didn't get the amount of money for aid that I would have appreciated, but it was still a very fast and positive experience."
Freshman,4,"The University of North Florida is a big campus with a lot of diversity within students and professors which makes it unique, and it enhances several different experiences among the individuals. Safety is also one of the things that features the university, they would cancel classes if the weather might get dangerous and you would find the police located in a lot of areas at campus during night. The rules they enforce about harassment is also strict and i like them especially that i am a girl, it makes me feel that i am protected."
Junior,4,"The University of Florida is a good school if you are looking for a place that has a community college feel but you want to attend a University. The area itself is good with a lot of things to do and feels safe. The professors are great and very experienced in their fields, while also being helpful and available to the students."
Freshman,4,"If you are looking for an environment where you can lock down and be committed to school with little distractions UNF is the place to be. The campus is a small quiet campus filled with nature, where you can study and find a nice place to hangout. Even though classes can be up to 150 students, the professors make it very easy to get in contact with them and go out of their way to help every student who comes to their office."
Sophomore,4,"The people are great and the staff has supported me without fail. It's a beautiful campus with competent professors, staff, and students. It feels like a home despite struggling with the occasional professor."
Freshman,4,"I've had a pretty good experience here on campus, my professors are engaging with their lessons and answer any questions I might have and if I'm still confused on a topic they offer SI sessions which gives students free tutoring after school. There are services here to help students such as the Osprey shuttle bus which offers students easy transportation, Wednesday Market place days where you can sometimes get free food from food trucks or kiosk, outdoor activities at the lake or their nature trail, and many student clubs and organizations you can join."
Niche User,4,It was a great college to help me explore my career paths and choose the correct one for me. My experience was very welcoming and I loved the atmosphere at the school and I met some of my best friends there. It helped me get close to like-minded people following similar career goals.
Freshman,4,I like the school a lot. At first I wasn't sure if I was because of moving to new town and being away from my home town but the school has helped me find some of my lifelong friends and I feel like I am getting the best education I could with the career that I want to pursue.
Freshman,4,"As a first year college student with the University of North Florida, everything has been going well for me as a student. The advising staff is truly helpful, especially David Stout. The other students are exceptionally helpful for those who need help and generally all of the staff are friendly."
Junior,4,Great educators and beautiful campus! Would like faster response times when dealing with registration or financial aid issues.
Senior,4,The University of North Florida has a lot to offer for all student. With a phenomenal staff that makes sure to go above and beyond to make sure you graduate on time and with a following career path.
Freshman,4,"i liked the atmosphere, i would like to change the layout. also, needs healthier options. i wish they had a bigger salad bar."
Junior,4,"Professors care about their major classes, but the introductory classes often slack off. The administration needs some serious work, One Stop is not effective and there are scandals with department heads."
Junior,4,"This quite a step up from community college. I transferred from the local community college in Jacksonville, and I was very happy to see the new and exciting opportunities available to me at the university level. The campus is not too large, but it was a positive change from what I was used to. I have made many friends in my first semester; the students here are very close-knit and friendly. I have learned a lot in my classes, and I have enjoyed the professors here whom I've taken so far."
Senior,4,University of North Florida is a nice institution. Good buildings and student access to amenities like the athletic facility and various fast food places around campus. The teachers are a bit close minded and inflexible but that's a majority of college campuses these days unfortunately. All in all a good school to go to.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, but could definitely use some modifications and touch ups. Some of the buildings look a bit dated while some others look new and architecturally modern. Also, more parking! Parking on campus is the worst here, you’re better off parking far and taking the shuttle."
Freshman,4,"The UNF campus is beautiful the buildings are surrounded by nature. Most of the professors I've had were kind and respectful; they really care that you succeed. The campus is very diverse according to what I've seen on campus, I've met people from different countries and who spoke multiple languages. I had a into to disabilities course in which we were required to find three locations or campus features that makes it difficult for those with disabilities to get around. There is almost no flaw in the way the campus was designed to accommodate for those with disabilities. Some dorm rooms are better than others, I didn't like the freshmen's dorm rooms; it can use some updates but it's not too bad. Overall, I really like being a student at UNF because everyday I learn something new whether it's through the environment itself or the people."
Junior,4,Overall it is a very nice campus with very friendly students and teachers! It is in a nice location and there is a lot to do. Since the school is fairly small you can go talk to teachers and get one on one help unlike larger universities. The only thing I would change is more parking availability and more on campus food options! Just overall making the campus bigger and better would be nice!
Junior,4,"The one thing I enjoy the most about The University of North Florida is the look of the campus and the architectural design of the newer buildings. The dorms and housing around the campus are also designed well and give off an inviting, comfortable feel to the newer residents. The tuition costs are lower than average compared to most universities so I always feel like I am getting a great return on my investment. The safety of the campus is also a plus and the local area around the campus is mostly comprised of middle to upper class neighborhoods near grade schools. The only thing I think could be improved upon is the parking as some days I cannot find a single space even in the largest lots."
Freshman,4,"University of North Florida has been an amazing journey so far. I can call this place my second home. The staff at each facility from the cafe to the gym I am always greeted with a warm and friendly welcoming. It is easy to make friends here everyone is so nice and friendly, you will be able to find people from all walks of life."
Freshman,4,"The university has a lot to offer and consists of limited distractions. With a University such as this one there is no football team, which can be a dissapointment to some, but to me it helped me stay focussed on academics."
Senior,4,"UNF is a smaller college but still has a lot to offer. The smaller classes allows for more one-on-one time with professors who will actually get to know you by name, and not just a number. There are also a ton of hands-on experiences available from labs to summer courses that get students engaged in field work. The community is very welcoming and overall it is a great school. Oh, and did I mention it's close to the beach?!"
Niche User,4,the campus is beautiful and updated. the campus cafeteria has pretty good food. the university is also located right next to the town center which is filled with shops and restaurants.
Freshman,4,"I love the view, bu the weather can be ify! The University of North Florida was a top choice for sports and scene. But the process has been difficult with loans scholarships, I wish there was an easier process to get money for school. But its a great school so far, I can't wait to see what the next few years bring my way!"
Freshman,4,"The school is great, teachers help, students will help. You find help everywhere. A pretty clean campus, college communal bathrooms are a bit gross, but thats fine, what can you expect?"
Freshman,4,Very nice school. Very active student life. Wasn't really helpful when it comes to helping with financial troubles and fixing problems.
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more support by the RAS in the dorms. Also there are problems with the registration Department. Other than that the campus is beautiful and peaceful set in the woods.
Senior,4,"I have a current student at UNF the campus is small which is good form some. The advisers are helpful, the professors are top- notch. Overall I am glad with my choice of going to UNF."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed my first term as a freshman. I liked that my ENC class had around 20 students in it. It was easy for me to easily pay attention and to be able to talk to the professor. I enjoyed exploring around the campus after class. The gym and wellness center is the place I usually always go to after my class. There are many fun things to explore on campus and nice scenery. There are also plenty of  things to explore outside of the campus that are not to far; especially the St. Johns Town Center.
Freshman,4,I like that is close to my home and it has a good nursing program and I hope to do the rest of my years at UNF. I don't like how UNF only accepts certain bright futures scholarship programs.
Sophomore,4,"Its a different feel from South Florida. The school is a decent size, with about 15000 students, the scenery is beautiful, and the location is perfect. Just a mile from campus is a large outdoor shopping center and the beach is a short 15 minutes East."
Freshman,4,"My experience at UNF has been interesting. It is a hit or miss for the professors. Definitely recommend checking out ratemyprofessor.com before signing up for classes. The campus is good, takes around 5 mins to get to my next class, and the staff are really nice."
Freshman,4,The university really made me feel like I was at home. The people were always very helpful and the professors were always around after hours to help me understand the material. The campus also has a very calm and natural feel to it which I really enjoyed.
Freshman,4,"All of my professors at UNF have been extremely knowledgeable and engaged. They make large classes feel personable and will stay after if you have questions(if their schedule permits) and all have on campus and online office hours to assist student. The dorms are the nicest I've seen between looking at about 10 campuses, and the cafeteria offer so many options, all of which are fantastic!"
Freshman,4,Its a very unique university. It has almost anything you can think of. We have one of the biggest wellness centers throughout the United States. Its not a really big university which is what most people like.
Freshman,4,"Every time I step onto campus, I am greeted by friendly students or professors. On one of my earliest visits, I could not find a specific place I was looking for and someone near by decided to help me."
Freshman,4,"I recently finished my required orientation course. It was an awful experience for me. I am not a partier, and I was only looking forward to the academic part of college. If you like an exciting, loud, and welcoming orientation experience, I’d say you would be fine. However, University of North Florida preaches about being diverse, but I did not experience this. I was homeschooled throughout my life. My orientation leader and fellow pupils made fun of me for my education. This being said, the professors I talked to and my personal advisor were highly impressed with my capabilities and skills. In conclusion, if you fit the mold,  you will thrive on the social aspect of University of North Florida’s orientation. If you are like me, you will thrive on the learning aspect of orientation."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of the classrooms and how direct and personal I can be with the professors. I would like to see the parking prices and rules altered.
Graduate Student,2,"I felt I have paid alot of tuition through loans for this degree and I felt my academics slightly went downhill after experiencing COVID-19 firsthand. Overall, I would not recommend this school to others because of the cost, academics, professors and overall education experience."
Freshman,2,"The University of North Florida is a wannabe Ivy League school that lacks the funding and extremely intelligent students to be so. It is a school. Nothing more, nothing less. They banned tailgating in 2018 and have very little interesting on-campus activities. They are ranked as one of the most inclusive LGBTQ schools in the nation and it seems like that is the only audience they cater to. If you are either gay or extremely content doing schoolwork with no partying, go here. Also, be warned their English classes DO NOT function as normal English classes (with all work turned in on time the highest grade you can attain is a B, and then you must gain a certain amount of ""badges"" to progress to an A). This is the policy across all English classes. That`s a hard pass from me fam!"
Freshman,2,"The only reason I am rating 2 out of 5 stars is because of issues I’ve personality felt were not up to par with university standards whatsoever. Let’s start with the administration, or one-stop student services. I have waited for over 4 hours just to be told that I could not clear the holds on my account without the proper paperwork which I had not been informed I had to fill out. Because of this I was not able to register for classes or have any assurance that my financial aid was providing the necessary financial insurance. I later learned that my financial aid had been transferred to a different university. As I’m writing this I am waiting for another 3 hours to be called in to once again, confirm my paperwork."
Senior,2,"I am a part of the communications program currently and the internship rules that UNF has are ridiculous! I have checked other colleges, ones that are more prestigious and they don't have the persnickety rules UNF has. I have contacts in the Business side and that person basically said that the two professors who are in charge of internships for the communications department have full  leave to accept or deny anyone they see fit. They contradict themselves on a regular basis, they told my almost supervisor one thing and the same person emailed me and said something different. This supervisor works in the PR side of a customer service business and they said the person in the communications department was the rudest they have ever talked to, which is saying a lot coming from a customer strive business. I can see why UNF is labeled U Never Finish, because of these two people my graduation date got moved from December to May."
Alum,2,I attended UNF for two semesters and ultimately decided to transfer back to Florida State College at Jacksonville. The course scheduling options were very limited and not good for a working student.
College Junior,2,"There is little of diversity on campus, most people who go their are very preppy, rich and stuck up college kids. There are a few people that are accepting to minorities but most don't really want anything to do with you which makes it challenging to make friends outside of the class room. There are all kinds of religions that is practiced there."
College Junior,2,We don't have much Greek life and there is not any kind of specified Greek housing.
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of drugs in the surrounding areas
College Freshman,2,I did not enjoy coming here. It is hard to make friends cause not much goes on.
College Freshman,2,Fraternity life is a joke here.
College Freshman,2,"The classes at UNF are very thought provoking and fun to be in, but there is not much to do on weekends. The whole school is empty."
College Sophomore,2,"It has been ok, easy to meet with advisors"
College Freshman,2,There is not much school spirit and most sports are not paid attention to.
College Junior,2,I do not care about Greek life or housing. Not able to answer.
College Freshman,2,It was just annoying to deal with and very confusing.
College Student,2,With my experience with some of the Greek students is HORRIBLE. Some of the Greek student think they own the place and can do what ever they want. At my job that I work there were three Greek students from my school and they tried to steal five cookies and when asked to give them back they started cussing all the employees out. As a non-Greek student I could care less about the Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"It's all about who you know rather than the type of person you are. To me, that's extremely unfair and ridiculous, the point of joining is to meet more people and expand your vision of people."
College Senior,2,people that work on that department dont know whats going on half the time and they are very snobby and not very helpful
College Junior,2,"Dont' depend on the campus police to help you. First off, they are not even real cops. They are civillians and do not have any sort of code to abide by. Second, they do not care about you nor do they have any sympathy. I had gotten 3 tickets this past semester because I usually park in the lot around 4:30pm, and the only pass that was available to buy for graduate students is the 5pm and after pass. Never would I have thought 30 mins would gain me tickets. I mean really? NYC isn't even this harsh with parking. They booted my car last week and refused to take it off until I paid my tickets. The cops came out and basically laughed at me and made fun of me."
College Junior,2,There are very few scholarships offered and the fellowships are rare to obtain
College Freshman,2,"Resident assistants, or RAs are usually a mixed bunch depending on who you get. They can either be your best friend, or your worst nightmare.  too much red tape everywhere and nonsensical rules."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process is not good for transfer students. Most of their financial aid/scholarship options only apply to freshman students that have not yet been admitted. If you are a transfer student, as in my case, you must go to your corresponding college's office for information. When I did this, I kept getting the run-around. There is not any one responsible person for that in my college, and no one is familiar with the process of awarding the scholarships or getting a status on them once they are applied for. It is frustrating at times."
College Senior,2,all information must be submitted either in person or via fax. There is usually at least a 24 hr time delay on any document you fax before it is loaded in to your account. If you have any questions be prepared to spend a lot of time on hold waiting for an available person. The staff is patient and knowledgeable but the inability to get quick answers can be frustrating.
College Freshman,2,The clubs on campus that have parties are okay but they could be better.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not a lot of housing available, and if there is, it is extremely expensive."
Recent Alumnus,2,The parties on campus are very poor.
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive and very bad for you.
College Sophomore,2,"House parties are the main locations for parties, there is no Greek Row so Greek life parties are at members houses but they're not the biggest."
College Senior,2,"Non chain places are awful, and even then the chain places have a limited selection."
College Senior,2,"You can have a lot of fun at this school if you are friendly, open-minded and outgoing but compared to bigger schools there is just not a lot of partying."
College Freshman,2,The automatic scholarships are not upgradable and they should be. I could be getting more money.
College Freshman,2,There's not a lot of nearby choices so prices are high.
College Freshman,2,It could be much better. There's not many options so you have to eat the same thing often.
College Junior,2,"I don't agree with administration when I comes to academics and my classes, they are hiring professors with low ratings and it often affects students grades"
College Freshman,2,Too small and too much money.
College Freshman,2,There are not many active parties that many people go to so far.
Recent Alumnus,2,It was a hassle. It was stressful and nerve wrecking. I honestly feel like they don't care if you graduate or not.
College Junior,2,Honestly I have never paid attention to my schools athletics.
College Sophomore,2,"I did not get accepted into the honors program till the second half of my senior year in high school, and by then all of the scholarships had been handed out."
College Senior,2,There seemed to be a new report every week last year. Students just walked by the notices as if it were nothing.
College Senior,2,One Stop is pretty much a standard joke at our school.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you get on campus very early in the morning or toward night time, you often have to take the shuttle. This can be troublesome if you are pressed for time."
College Freshman,2,no school spirit. at all!
College Freshman,2,such an unsafe place early in the mornings and late at night! anything could happen and noone would know
College Freshman,2,Financial aid is always a hassle. My advice is to make sure you have all of the paperwork that you need and keep an eye on your financial aid status. Don't be afraid to revisit the financial office again to make sure that everything is correct
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation is good. Nothing cool ever happens here at night. Nothing really to do at night, unless you want to go downtown and get mugged."
College Student,2,They are so hard to get and there are not many available for all the majors.
College Junior,2,Florida is very hot and humid making it miserable to walk to and from classes outside.
College Junior,2,"Too much paperwork. I have to fill out paperwork for information already in my FAFSA, and send a W2 although I didn't get one this past year."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at UNF is honestly not as big as I thought it would be. Most of them are pretty average and at parties, it's basically the same people every time. Only a few faces come to mind when I think of Greek life at UNF. I don't really hear much about them; they're not a huge deal at the school. "
College Junior,2,UNF is in the middle of a nature preserve (or something like that.) Beautiful scenery but the pollen is killing my sinuses.
College Junior,2,"I was awakened at 1 am to remove a pizza box someone else had put outside my door. Really annoying, it's not like I can prevent people from putting trash outside my door."
College Sophomore,2,The people in the housing office are the absolute worst people to deal with. The dorms are grossly over priced and RA's have a if i cant see it touch it or smell it then its not there policy 
College Sophomore,2,almost no drug safety. adderall is taken like candy and alcohol consumption is off the wall and often used as a coping mechanism.
College Sophomore,2,Can't choose roommates unless a freshman
College Sophomore,2,Time slots for adding classes is ridic
College Junior,2,"Not enough options, same music , same people"
College Junior,2,I wish they had more options and availability overall
College Junior,2,Not a variety of food options
College Junior,2,Not a huge variety of classes for finance majors. Horrible availability for scheduling.
Freshman,1,I did not take any online classes. I will take some in the future. I look forward to see how the classes are online!
College Student,1,it is not the best sports program to be honest it could do better.
College Junior,1,They never try to recruit...they are prejudice.
College Junior,1,Not fond of Greek life at all
College Senior,1,"No greek housing is available and I have no idea what they do other than parade around campus in heels, dresses, and suits.  They always wear the same thing and look and sound like clones.  It's amazing really.  During basketball season they will tailgate and litter in the parking lot,  Any other time I forget they exist."
College Sophomore,1,I don't know where the greek life is at my school
College Sophomore,1,I haven't ever been to an athletic event at my my school
College Junior,1,"Didn't go here for undergrad so not really sure but from what i can tell, it isn't anything to write home about"
College Freshman,1,HATE the housing at UNF.
College Sophomore,1,"I have not been accepted yet, but I have heard there are 30 spots. Admissions is based on GPA (at least a 3.75), your TEAS score (at least 93rd percentile), an interview, and your extracurriculars (you must have volunteer hours). It is highly recommended to retake a class if your get a B-."
College Senior,1,The dorms are awful. There's nothing much more to be said.
College Junior,1,I have nothing to do with Greek-Life as I am a nontraditional student
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life on our campus
College Sophomore,1,We have sports at UNF?
College Freshman,1,UNF is way more difficult than the past schools I've attended
College Sophomore,1,I have not seen anyone participate in underage drinking or drugs.I am sure some students do since that is a nationwide problem but I do not partake in those kinds of activities.
College Sophomore,1,"There are never spots. Parking passes prices are absolutely outrageous. If you're running late, you're basically without a paddle "
College Sophomore,1,"Sent in forms 3 times and they ""never"" received them"
College Junior,1,It's hard to get in contact with faculty
College Junior,1,It is inconvenient that you have to be 24 to be considered independent
College Junior,1,There is definitely not enough parking. The parking passes are very pricey.
College Junior,1,"That is my least favorite quality of the school. Parking is horrible. If you have a 12pm class... you better come at least an hour early to get a spot or you will have to park and walk 20 minutes just to get to the school or ride the bus that is always late and crowded. Take your pick! I hate that I paid $170 for a permit but am never able to get a spot. Oh and instead of towing a car that is illegally parked, they boot it, taking up several spaces!"
College Senior,1,"Parking sucks. There is barely ever a decent parking spot. Unless you're there every day before 8/9 a.m., you will have to drive around several times before finding a spot."
College Sophomore,1,The two small garages that are near the core of campus are always full. You literally have to stalk someone coming up the stairs and follow them to their car  to get a spot. HORRIBLE.
College Sophomore,1,"Teams are decent, we do not have a football team so no real excitement about sports games."
College Senior,1,"Parking sucks, one of the dorms is dry, they're nazis about people parking when we're just trying to move into dorms, IT is incompetent, and they give you tickets over dumb stuff like skating/biking in open areas."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is terrible! The cost of parking permits is very expensive and even when you purchase a premium permit (Allowing you to park closer to the school), finding an open spot can take 30 minutes to an hour."
Recent Alumnus,1,Takes a long time to find parking close to campus.
College Junior,1,There are no spots at all. Ever. It takes half an hour of driving to get to your class on time.
College Senior,1,"Until recently you could buy a temporary pass and park near classes, but not now. Now you have to park in one of the two far lots and take the shuttle. The shuttle goes relatively frequently, but it is still a major hassle. As a commuter college, this is very inconvenient."
College Freshman,1,"I really don't like Greek Life, they are super cliquey and girls aren't allowed to wear anything cute without being accused of attempting to be a sorority girl (this has happened to me multiple times and it's infuriating) they have tons of exclusive events that technically aren't exclusive but you feel weird and would be excluded as a non greek life person, it's super annoying! But for the record,frat guys are better than sorority girls (maybe i'm biased as a girl)"
College Freshman,1,Parking is a nightmare. You usually get stuck parking far out in lot 18 which is really far from classes. You need to get to campus at least 30 minutes for a spot. Parking tickets are also handed out all the time. They are jerks.
College Freshman,1,"I am unfortunately not a fan of Greek Life on this campus or others so my opinion on this subject doesn't truly matter, per say."
College Senior,1,"Parking is too far from classes unless you pay for the garage, and beat everybody else to the few garage permits allotted per semester. The shuttle system used to take some time but was very convenient. However, they've changed it so that it only picks up and drops off from only the front half of one of the main lots and goes around the back of the campus. Absolutely ridiculous now."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is horrible!! If you do not get to campus before 10:00 am there's a high chance you won't find a spot! Well if you do, it'll be in the very back of campus. The good news for Freshman or who lives on campus is the access of walking to classes and don't have to worry about parking."
College Freshman,1,We they to pride ourselves on diversity but there honestly isn't a lot. I mean we have have different races and cultures but they stick together. There isn't a sense of community where we all join to be diverse.
College Sophomore,1,No one really cares about sports on campus. There is also not a lot of community support of UNF athletics. If they were in a better division people might start to care.
College Senior,1,"Shuttle buses that take students from long distance parking lots to campus in rainy or cold weather are difficult to catch.  Sometimes students wait for 3 or more shuttles to pass by before getting a chance to ride one back to their car, especially when it is raining.  Very overcrowded."
College Senior,1,I only received financial aid in the form of student loans.
College Senior,1,Parking is the WORST especially in the beginning of the semester. Students battle it out for one spot since they are so hard to come by; it's not unusual to circle a parking lot for an hour if it's mid day around 12-2 p.m. And they write out $30 parking tickets left and right; it's ridiculous!!
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is fine when your parking in lot 53, which is not within walking distance of campus."
College Senior,1,"You Never Know What Could Happen – Although people have been caught for reporting false accusations, there has been a recent case of a sexual assault in our new gym and a friend of mine has had to use pepper spray in a parking lot. I don't walk anywhere alone on campus at night."
College Senior,1,"A Nightmare – I live fifteen minutes away from school and have to leave my house an hour and a half before my class starts to ensure I can get a parking space. I pay $160 a year for a premium parking spot and half the time I end up having to park miles away in another parking lot. Only when you stalk students walking to their cars do you find a parking spot, if someone doesn't try to steal it from you."
College Sophomore,1,The school sells too many highly expensive permits and does not have the amount of spaces needed.
College Junior,1,"No Luck for the Late Wakers! Unless you are in the parking garage by 930am, you're not going to find an empty spot without a hassle. I have been forced to skip classes and leave campus due to lack of parking, and that was after driving around for 2 hours."
College Freshman,1,"School Spirit – University of North Florida is not Known for  its involvement in sports. in fat, the school doesn't even have a football team. Out of all the sports, the most school spirit is found in tennis and basketball. With that said, it's not much school spirit. Students on this campus are more diligent and hard working students than anything else. You can occasionally see someone wear a UNF apparel , and that's quite rare."
College Freshman,1,"Library Are Small – The library at  University of North Florida is very small and limited to four floors. The hours are restricted during the weekends and because theres just one library, it gets quite crowded and very limited space to park . it's a hassle to drive all the way to the library on campus because the conditions are very poor ."
College Sophomore,1,The parking at University of North Florida sucks there is never enough and if you do not pay 200 dollars a year then you get parking that is really far away. You have to get there really early to find a spot and get to class on time.
College Junior,1,"I have been at UNF for over a year, and the parking lot area is the only problem that I have with it. I understand that the student body is over 4,000, 5,000 students; but at the same time-when you buy a parking pass, you're only liable to park in selected areas. Making it difficult for other students to find a suitable parking space and attend class on time. 

The only positive I can give is the UNF Shuttle, they are really reliable when you need last minute assistance to get to class."
College Senior,1,"UNF is a college that makes biology a hard major to stick to, because they accept so many Biology majors and don't have enough classes for their students to get into. The lab work is more work than the lecture class and is only worth one credit. Some of the teachers do not like helping their students."
College Junior,1,"Parking is a total nightmare. You might want to arrive on campus at least 20 minutes before class. The fines for parking will put hold on your student account which can affect registration. Paying for parking daily is $3. If you want to leave campus, without a car, the city bus is your best option. Nothing is close enough to walk to."
College Senior,1,Not Likable – The sororities are very conceited.  They seem to be disinterest in people who are not popular or not attractive.
College Freshman,1,"Not Good – Parking in a garage is almost impossible, so if you're late to class you're screwed. There isn't even enough parking for students that live on campus and some have to park a 10-20 minute walk away from their dorms."
College Junior,1,"There are many transportation options on campus, but none that are inexpense or quick. There are buses that run on campus, but I recommend paying for a permit if you do not want to be late to class. One inexpensive but time consuming short cut I have learned from being at the school is to park in vistor parking at the apartment complex across the street from UNF Hall and walk across to the bus. If you live on campus walking, roller blading, or longboarding is the route majority of individuals take. All in all the transportation is a nightmare on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Fin Aid – i have loans... lots of loans. i have a 4.0 GPA and couldnt find any aid.
College Sophomore,1,"The cost are outrageous for parking and there is not enough parking space in the parking garage for students who buy those passes for the garages and sometimes tickets are given that were unnecessary. 

Another thing is the school provides shuttles from further away parking lots to campus but it is stressful waiting on the shuttle to bring you to class on time."
College Sophomore,1,"Eww What's That Smell? There are a lot of dorm options. The worst and the cheapest is the Hall. It's the oldest dorm here. Mainly freshman dorm there. The guys live on the first floor and the girls live on the second. They don't have their own bathrooms! Each floor has a community bathroom. The other freshman dorms going from worst to best, I would have to say is The landing, the cove, and the crossings. They are pretty much small concrete rooms, with 2 beds, 2 desks, a sink, and a bathroom. The buildings have small community kitchens with one stove, one sink, one table, and a tv. But hey! That's the college life, right? The restrictions on what you can have in the rooms are really strict! no curtains! Apparantely it's a fire hazard! even though we can't have candles or anything else flammable. 
     The upperclassmen dorms are a bit nicer. The Village is an apartment style dorm. You can either get a dorm with one other roommate and one bedroom, or 3 other roommates and 2 bedrooms. The 2 bedroom and 4 people dorms are the cheapest; however, you share a tiny kitchen and tiny bathroom with 3 other people. The 1 bedroom apartment-style dorms are more comfortable. When I first moved in, though, the water smelled like rotten eggs for a few days, the a/c froze, our shower curtain keeps falling down, the handle on the oven is broken, so on and so forth.
     The dorms are the closest to the classes, it has a volleyball and basketball court. There is one laundry room. The social atmosphere in the village is.... dead! All the time!
    The best dorms are the Fountains. They are the most expensive and the newest. They have their own track, pool, lazy river, game room, convenience store. They are the farthest from classes but there is a shuttle that stops there frequently. You can choose to have your own room, a room with 2 people and your own room, a room with 4 people and your own bedroom, or a room with 6 people and your own room. It's pretty nice."
College Sophomore,1,"The Food Is Not Good – I have not ever bought food on campus and for a good reason. Everything I've been told is that it's over-priced, there are not good choices, and the food makes your stomach hurt. Just the fact that it's overpriced is a turn-off for me. They do have a yogurt bar and a sushi place. They have a sbarros and a starbucks. Then they have Outtakes and a restaurant called the Boathouse. Both places are expensive without good options."
College Freshman,1,Stoner School – Everyone smokes pot and everyone is unmotivated to be outgoing and try new things besides new drugs.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is very expensive. I had to buy a $160 parking pass so that I could park near where all my classes are.

Niche User,5,"good college but will they open in the Fall and if they don't will they cut athletics? According to highered they have not met Fall 2020 admission goals by 10% equals $millions which is a concern. If they don't have Fall in person instruction I don't know how they will justify high tuition, transferring could be an issue."
Alum,5,"With some negative news articles about Oxy I felt compelled to post. I was somewhat of a lone wolf in high school, preferred studying over the school functions. I wanted to go to a small private liberal arts school where I could get away from the party school atmosphere and just focus on finding out who I am. Oxy definitely delivered. Didn't care about sports so can't comment about the caliber of student-athletes or the greek system other then its similar to a high school, to my knowledge not well attended. Oxy has plenty of unique clubs to join however from gardening to dance to those of a political nature so things to do. As for the price, over $70/year with everything yet worth it if a fit and for a  small personalized education. Post college, there are internships for  the surrounding community, good if you'd like to stay in Pasadena or downtown Los Angeles."
Freshman,5,"Oxy is my home away from home, even after just one semester. The small class sizes are incredible, as is the faculty. I met with every one of my professors personally several times throughout the semester and each was happy to speak to me, even if just to chat. The campus is stunning, too. Some days I wake up and almost have to pinch myself to believe I'm really there. Higher education has never looked or felt so good!"
Sophomore,5,"Oxy really emphasizes diversity and equity and it shows in the classes offered, extracurricular activities, and even housing! It doesn't sacrifice academic rigor, either."
Junior,5,"honestly, chose this college more for sports then anything else. athletic teams are equivalent to junior college level so great if you want to continue what you like after high school. party scene is intense. if you can afford it and like the liberal vibe I recommend."
Sophomore,5,"OXY is my dream school! The campus is beautiful, the students are smart and hard-working, and the community is super diverse - racially and socio-economically. The kids are so open minded and kind and welcoming and I made friends immediately. My classes are challenging and engaging and my professors are amazing! I love being in LA - the opportunities are endless for culture, food, arts, etc. Great research opportunities and internships available. Athletics are also great and our rankings are improving with each season. Facilities are quite nice and the food is top notch. Thank you, Oxy!"
Senior,5,"Oxy is the best kept Liberal Arts institution on the West Coast. I’m super happy to be here and love that the student body is involved in so many diverse clubs and community outreach activities. There’s a lot of diversity here. My professors are amazing and accessible and they want their students to succeed. The athletics really contribute to school spirit. Kids are open minded, hard working and really friendly. Awesome food and LA provides every cultural and professional opportunity you could ever want."
Niche User,5,Occidential is my dream college. I hope one day I'll get accepted to Occidental.  Really nice and easy college to start your college career.
Sophomore,5,"Occidental College, lovingly referred to as ""Oxy"" by students, alumni and professors is a college like no other. Being one of the only liberal arts colleges in a big city the opportunities I've had afforded to me are unparalleled. The possibilities for academic and cultural enrichment are endless, and Oxy helps students access them all.
The small size creates a community where the professors know more than your name, they know and care about your learning style and mental health. I love going to class knowing it won't just be a huge lecture, I can expect dynamic discussions where my voice will matter and I can grow by interacting with my professors and classmates.
Overall, I would recommend Oxy to anyone who wants a liberal arts experience mixed with the opportunities that can only be found in a global city like Los Angeles. It is a truly amazing place that I am grateful to spend four years."
Senior,5,"Occidental is one of the best liberal arts institutions in the western United States. The school is particularly strong in the following areas: Chemistry, Biology, Economics, Media/Arts and Culture, and Diplomacy/World Affairs (basically Political Science). Research here is better than at top level universities where most of the good research is reserved for graduate students - summer opportunities are available. Food is great, campus atmosphere is great, campus safety is good, facilities are a mix, housing is okay, health systems are great, athletics are incredibly family-like and great to be a part of. Many clubs and organizations to get involved in. Good access to the city, good local food and attractions. Excellent resources for post-graduation."
Niche User,5,"The community here is beautiful. I can tell that the staff is super caring, energetic, and genuinely wants the best for the kids here. The school and staff really cares about your future success by providing internships and guidance."
Alum,5,"Occidental College was a great place to attend college. The professors care about students and are willing to connect you to opportunities that provide growth. The location is unparalleled for small, liberal arts colleges because Los Angeles has so much to offer."
Senior,5,"Oxy is a unique place that is not for everyone. You'll meet incredible people and make lasting connections, but it is a very small school so that has to be something that you're looking for."
Junior,5,"I just transferred to Occidental College from Wabash College—a liberal arts college in Crawfordscille, Indiana. I have nothing but good things to say about Oxy, and I’m really looking forward to finishing my undergraduate degree here!"
Freshman,5,"Occidental College offers stellar academics with an added emphasis on finding a job/career post-college, excellent food, and an extremely beautiful campus. The professors are generally approachable and flexible, often providing over-enrolment overrides for popular classes when asked in-person and extending deadlines during exam heavy weeks. The students here have a work hard during the weekdays, play hard during the weekends attitude; although the party scene isn't quite as enthralling as what one might find in a frat party at a bigger state university. However, smaller, more private dorm parties are in abundance at Oxy."
Alum,5,"Occidental College is one of the most underrated colleges out there. It has excellent faculty who are committed to seeing their students realize their fullest potential and succeed in whatever they are passionate in. Great facilities, beautiful campus, great location, excellent weather year-round. I have formed lifelong friendships and gained great faculty and professional mentors and I am proud to call myself an alum there. Thanks to Oxy, I was able to get connected to many great opportunities such as study abroad, and now I am a Fulbright grantee. It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen."
Alum,5,"Living on campus is essential to beginning your student life at Occidental.   There were about 10 dormitories, of varying sizes and locations on campus.  When I was there - late 60's early 70's - there were dorms for men and others for women and others mixed.  Eating together in the student union was also an essential part of life at Occidental.  There was some diversity when I was there, but more importantly everyone came from a top-notch academic background.  Except for its location (near Los Angeles), I would rate Occidental a solid A all around.  The only thing I would change is putting the campus in a small New England town (Dartmouth, Middlebury)."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful school, amazing campus. Occidental would be my #1 choice in private colleges. They have so much to offer. A plus is its really close to home so i wont be too far. I'd definitely go there then transfer into a bigger school, i love how the classes have small amount of students. Which is great because then students don't get overwhelmed on not get much attention in the class."
Sophomore,5,"Occidental is a great small liberal arts college.  The faculty and administration truly care about the individual students.  The population is diverse, and the college is very close to Los Angeles and Pasadena, so there is  opportunity to get off campus and go into the city. Additionally, there are plenty of internships and opportunities to make contacts with businesses and firms that do business in Los Angeles."
Freshman,5,"Occidental is a great liberal arts college with a great location in Los Angeles. The students are what makes the college great, and the diversity and determination of the student body are what makes Occidental a great experience."
Alum,5,"An outstanding school with superb professors who care about their students.  Athletics and the arts at Occidental are also great. 

Having been on 50+ campuses in the past four years, Occidental probably has one of the most beautiful campuses in the entire U.S. And the weather is fantastic.

Last but not least, Occidental is the only small liberal arts college in the U.S. to actually be in a major city. I can't say enough about the opportunities that this brings for Oxy students."
Freshman,5,"I am having an incredible experience here. I enjoyed my classes and clubs, and had a great time being active in campus life."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, the weather, the small class sizes, the variety of classes and subjects, the welcoming community, the acceptance of all interests and people, and the engaging professors."
College Sophomore,5,Because the community is pretty tight nit there are opportunities for networking.  Being in Los Angeles is also a big plus.
College Sophomore,5,I love the diversity of interests that the student body has and the willingness of professors to help students achieve their greatest potential.
College Sophomore,5,"The classes are small and professors are willing to listen to opinions and allow for participation from each student. If you don't like speaking up in class, it's totally fine too (though professors prefer people who speak up). Office hours are always super flexible and helpful. My only issue is course selection. It's a difficult process, and the classes you want can be really limited. Other than that, you can pretty much take classes from any department, and really explore throughout your college career."
College Freshman,5,"Oxy was the perfect school for me, it's a small liberal arts school in a metropolitan center and there's always something to do there or in the surrounding area."
College Freshman,5,"So far I've had a great experience at my school. One experience that stands out is the school wide sit in that we had to combat institutional racism and discrimination against students of color. Once I saw how fast people gathered together to talk about such a difficult topic and how passionate they were about it, I knew that this is where I supposed to be."
College Freshman,5,Everyone wants to live off campus. It's a super great option and generally affordable.
College Freshman,5,"It's a little repetitive after awhile and its still not homemade, but they really try to make it customizable which is awesome, and they have a great variety and typically lots of different options. Some days are better than others!"
College Freshman,5,This is Los Angeles. You can really get any type of food you want if you're willing to venture off campus and nearby there are some pretty good places too.
College Senior,5,"Eagle Rock is terrific. There are a ton of great dining options and fun things to do within walking distance (karaoke, art walk, farmers market). Even better, we have the entirety of Los Angeles to engage with if immediate options become stale."
College Senior,5,"Really good off campus dining options, especially the food trucks. There are 10 different food trucks that come every Tuesday night on York and Fig. Other student favorites can be found at www.oxy.edu/los-angeles/good-eats"
College Junior,5,"Food is wonderful! Very delicious and you can always count on there being something you'll like. Many vegan and vegetarian and gluten-free options. Ranked #8 in nation for food on college campus. Can get repetitive, however."
College Junior,5,Everyone here presents themselves very well.
College Junior,5,"I love being on campus. Every spot is beautiful and can be transformed into the perfect study spot. The quad is the best place on campus - you can get work done or sit and talk to friends or professors. There are always events to attend, whether small professionalization panels or large dances."
College Junior,5,"The workload is more reflective of the work we do - rather than writing tons of papers, our work tends toward creating films, writing screenplays, etc. As a film major we have a selection of equipment (cameras, sound, lighting, etc.) for students to check out for free when they are enrolled in production courses. There is a computer lab specifically for film students with editing software. As a Media Arts & Culture major, you either choose a Production path or Critical Theory, or you can minor in Interdisciplinary Writing if you would like to do more screenwriting and things like that."
College Junior,5,"Professors are awesome. Small class sizes (10:1 student to faculty ratio, average class size of 19) and very accessible professors. No TA's teaching classes! Classes are discussion-based, rather than lecture halls. Workload is tough but manageable. Plenty of room for extracurricular activities. The most popular majors are Economics, Diplomacy & World Affairs, Biology, Sociology, and Art History. Professors hold office hours and students are welcome to make appointments or just show up to chat, which professors are always open to and excited about."
College Junior,5,"SO many options! Colorado Blvd, Eagle Rock Blvd, and York Blvd alone have tons of dining options of all varieties, and if you venture out into Glendale, Pasadena, or Downtown then you have hundreds of other options, as well."
College Junior,5,"I was put on Financial Aid and given almost 100% of what I could not pay. As time went on and I got good grades, I received more and more scholarships. Very thankful for the Financial Aid Office!!"
College Junior,5,"Eagle Rock/Highland Park is the best! So much to do in every direction. Lots within walking distance on York and Eagle Rock Blvd. 8 miles from Downtown, easy access to concerts, comedy shows, sporting events, museums, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"there's no specific criteria for getting into different majors, you just have to meet the major requirements"
College Sophomore,5,"As a math major, internships are easy to find"
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are very knowledgable and willing to help students. Courses can be tough, but the workload is manageable."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Oxy. The students and professors are very friendly, the classes are challenging but rewarding, and LA has so much to offer."
College Sophomore,5,"The food at Oxy is amazing! A lot of variety, the food is all cooked fresh, and the cafeteria staff are so friendly! Off-campus dining is really good too"
College Sophomore,5,"The girls are very attractive and friendly. If you don't want to date anybody, there's plenty of eye candy ;)"
College Sophomore,5,"The location is perfect. You're 20 minutes away from pretty much everything LA has to offer—great hiking, great restaurants, great concerts, great shopping, and great culture in general."
College Sophomore,5,"I loved living in the dorms! I lived in Braun Hall, which is on upper campus. I actually liked living on upper campus because it allows a separation between school and home. Also, Oxy is super small so it makes the campus seem larger. It would take me about 5 minutes to get to my classes from my dorm. Braun had a great community! I loved my R.A's who weren't strict at all, they only enforced rules that were in place to keep us and the people around us safe. There are also computer labs in all the dorms and printing is free!"
College Sophomore,5,"L.A. has tones of great restaurants!! Don't be afraid to explore! If you don't have a car, then walk around eagle rock, there are more good restaurants than you think."
College Sophomore,5,"When I toured Oxy I wasn't super impressed with Eagle Rock, but once I moved in and explored I learned that I really like it! I is kind of hipster and there are a lot of cool restaurants and cute stores on Colorado. There are two Starbucks' and lots of other local coffee shops within walking distance if you want a break from campus. I also recommend going to the Eagle Rock farmers market for fresh fruit and the Taco Trucks for late night snacks. There is also a target about 20 minutes away walking. I didn't have a car my first year and although L.A. is not known for its public transportation I found it easy enough to get around. I really liked going to the Americana in Glendale to see movies and shop. Old Town Pasadena is also close by which has lots of stores and restaurants. Students also often go to the beach on weekends which is a great break! Overall the Local Atmosphere is great!"
College Sophomore,5,"good food, needs better hours"
College Senior,5,"The Psychology major it great, but it is no where near easy. Not to scare any one off, but I know Psych is sometimes called the easy major, but do not come to Oxy with that mindset. Last semester, I took a Practicum class (a class with an internship attached) and I had to write a 50 page paper (worth half my grade) to accompany it. While 50 pages isn't typical, 10-15 is and you need to be writing at a high caliber level to satisfy your Prof. 

It isn't easy, but I don't mind because I know graduate school will be a breeze after all of this."
College Senior,5,"You have to select a major your Sophomore year at Oxy. All you need is to pick an adviser and get the head of your department's approval. Very smooth. Just try to decide early. I know it's hard, but if you want to be able to study abroad (Oxy has fantastic packages), you're going to want to get as much of your major done as possible."
College Senior,5,"Academics here are very rigorous. We have very talented, brilliant professors and they expect a lot out of you. But they are always there to nurture you and help you grow so you can rise to your full potential. I know graduate school students who are surprised at the rigor of our program, but it's so worth it!"
College Freshman,5,Oxy tries their best to offer us healthy options! Love the creative meals at the marketplace and the comfort food at the cooler.
College Freshman,5,On-campus parking is easy. Having a car will make your life easier here.
College Freshman,5,Los Angeles is sunny most of the time. The constantly nice weather makes it a great place to be most of the times.
College Freshman,5,"The quality of the food itself is great. It's better than most other college campuses. There are a lot of vegetarian/vegan options for those who need those options. The food gets a little repetitive sometimes, but it's pretty good for dining hall food."
College Freshman,5,For eagle rock we actually do have pretty good off campus dining.
Junior,4,Occidental College is the perfect school for those looking to connect one on one with professors and looking for undergraduate research opportunities!
Niche User,4,"FOR PARENTS - If your student is supports the liberal agenda, is in line for a scholarship of some sort to assist with the cost and is not interested in sports or social clubs and wants a school with out 2,000 kids this school could be great. Its almost entirely made up of a student body supporting the liberal agenda - expected since Obama went there. In terms of the price, for $80,000/year with travel I would expect more but its fine, comparable to a CSU level (25 ACT). As for sports they are well funded yet don't have a great deal of success so almost any student can walk on to a sports team which is definite pro if your student is missing this from high school. The party scene is intense over the weekends both with liquor and drugs so you'll have to weigh that one."
Alum,4,"Attending Occidental College was an overall positive experience for me. The campus is beautiful, the dining options are some of the best in the nation, and I absolutely loved most of my professors. The school's small size was very good for forging good relationships as well as personal academic growth, but did somewhat limit research and internship options. There was also quite a bit of friction between the student body and administration at times, caused by a lack of communication and students not feeling like their concerns were being heard or validated. However, I loved the diverse course options offered by a liberal arts education, and I believe that I received an excellent education and made lifelong friends here."
Sophomore,4,"Oxy has always fostered passionate and committed academics with a highly focused attention towards global and local impacts, while still maintaining an easy-going and inclusive west-coast attitude. I feel at home there. One thing that definitely needs to change, however, is their focus on the black students and black studies. The latter is a withering major and the former have suffered lack of support. Especially considering the unexpected deaths of two black students on campus this past semester, black students are feeling more desolate in the school's environment than usual. Oxy likes to parade itself around as a pillar of inclusivity, but the lack of ownership and material reparations dedicated to dismantling racist conditions of the college, such as the blackface incident from a donor of the school (who graduated in the 80s) that rose to light this past year, truly prove that Oxy thrives under a facade of progressive interests. Please change this! Our students deserve it."
Freshman,4,Faculty is dedicated to student sucess. Students really do have power in this institution. It is a PWI so it is very white.
Freshman,4,"Occidental College, while being a very small campus, is packed with activity. The students are energetic and they help run the many clubs and services that the school provides. The professors are very supportive and dedicate much of their time to helping students with their office hours. On top of that, the campus is beautiful and well-maintained. The food is delicious but also healthy. I would say the residence halls could use some improvement, as my dorm for my first year lacked air conditioning. Overall, I think Occidental College is a great school, and you get what you pay for with your tuition."
Senior,4,"Pros
- small class size, good student to prof ratio
- lots of clubs
- good abroad program
- great on campus food
Cons
- expensive if you don't qualify for much aid
- prof bend over backward to cater to students, frustrating for a student who works hard
- no college life with sports, people keep to themselves 
- offered internships are lower quality then what I expected of a private school"
Junior,4,"Oxy is a great school in many regards, but it also lacks in many places as well. If you are craving the bombastic college life you see in movies, Oxy might not be the best fit. But if you're content to be among likeminded folks in a tightknit community, Oxy is the best."
Junior,4,"I really love the personability of the professors and the investment they have in their students' success and well-being. In my two years at Occidental, I have had very caring professors who not only want to help you academically, but also want to accommodate your life outside of school as well."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a rising sophomore at Occidental College. Though this college is not too highly ranked, once any student arrives here, they will experience the full benefits of a liberal arts college. First of all, financial aid is extremely generous. Many peers have told me about how Occidental has offered them the best financial aid, which is always a great motive to come to this college. Next, with small faculty to student ratio, professors are all very accessible and easy to meet for office hours any time one may need help. Professors show they really want to build a relationship with their students, and constantly promote deep discussions for critical thinking. Though there are still problems in terms of diversity and within administration, staff and students have consistently shown their efforts into creating a better and safer community for all, which I extremely appreciate."
Junior,4,"What I liked about Occidental is that everyone I met there was nice and that they all had a passion for learning. The teachers also seemed like they actually wanted to help you achieve your goals and see you do well in life. The down side to this school is that it is so small and very expensive, however with the smaller class sizes, it is easier for teacher to engage with their students allowing for a better learning experience overall."
Niche User,4,When I visited occidental college I was not very interested since it was a small campus but then I realized that with a small campus comes more opportunities for students and the campus was very nice and well taken care of.
Sophomore,4,"The classes are not too easy, but not rip your hair out difficult. The majority of professors in my major are amazing and have really helped my writing skills. The food is pretty good. The major downside is the cost."
Niche User,4,"My over experience at Occidental college was great, I have a great time visiting a college that I didn't know was nearby to where I live. I get to meet new people with the comfort of my mentors and get to ask them my questions. The program that I'm currently in, MOSTe , has introduced this college to me. We have visited the college so many time, it almost feels like home. The tours that we go on are always fun. We get to have a view on how college really is rather that hearing the complaint that everyone has to say. This experience was really an eye opener and gave us a new point of view on college."
Junior,4,"My overall experience is pretty good. Small class sizes allow for a better understanding of the coursework. Not too diverse, since it's still a small school. Great location with much to do in surrounding neighborhoods."
Alum,4,"Occidental was great. I enjoyed the small class sizes and the close knit community. It was difficult to get into some of the science classes I needed, so I ended up in some very difficult classes just to satisfy the basic requirements. I recommend joining extra curriculars and sports if you can, and make use of the amazing library."
College Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus and closeness is unbeatable.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Safety is constantly patrolling.  Students have complained about their bullet proof vests and weapons, but they carry them because there are sometimes shootings off campus.  When that happens everyone gets an email and text about what areas to avoid until the situation is over.  I don't know of any students who have ever been harmed by the violence off campus.  Campus Safety also will give rides to any student who calls and asks because they feel unsafe, or even are too drunk."
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on what dorm you're in, there can be a great social atmosphere. It happens that the dorms with the worst amenities (no AC, communal bathrooms, etc.) end up having the most social dorms, so it evens out."
College Sophomore,4,"Stuff definitely still gets stolen, and once in a while there is an incident near or off campus with theft or robbery. Campus safety is always patrolling, and will provide services to students who need rides back to the dorm. I generally feel really safe."
College Sophomore,4,"Many alumni speakers have returned to speak about their experiences with their post-college lives. Many are doing work not directly related to their majors. Essentially, it won't be that hard to find a job with a degree from Oxy, but you might not be doing what you want, at least at first. The internship programs and on-campus jobs here are great, and offer great opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"Oxy is a D3 school so while the teams aren't the best, everyone knows someone who's on the team and so will go out to support their friends."
College Freshman,4,The area around Oxy is not the best however Campus Safety is pretty on top of anything going on around campus and is sure to notify the student body to make sure they all stay safe.
College Freshman,4,The Career Center here is great and really helpful at preparing you for the future. They're always having events inviting employers to campus to network with students and have events such as free linkedin headshots and help with resumes.
College Freshman,4,"Depending on what dorm you're in housing can be great or not. For the freshman dorms only 2 of them have air conditioning, however both of those dorms don't have great communities. The 3 dorms without AC have really tight knit communities and always have stuff going on there, and a lot of people from the other 2 dorms spend their time at those dorms. A lot of freshman end up in triples, which is not bad if you're fine with your roommates. All the rooms have laundry in them and each room has a microfridge in it, which is really convenient. A few of the freshman dorms are on lower campus, meaning they're closer to classes, while the majority of them are on upper campus, which is a bit of a walk but definitely fosters a close community of those who live there."
College Freshman,4,"While there are few choices in Greek life it is really fun if you get involved in it. Sorority wise there is one national sorority and one national multicultural sorority, however the local sororities are actually bigger than the national ones. All of them have a lot of on campus history and are a great way to get involved in campus life."
College Freshman,4,"Oxy may not be the school for everyone but it's definitely the school for me. The academics, although definitely challenging, are excellent and the professors really know their stuff. It's a small school and that really shows in the class sizes, which is super helpful. Socially it's really easy to get involved in stuff on campus and from that there are a lot of options to meet people and make friends. It's also really nice to be so close to the center of LA, although a car definitely helps around here."
College Sophomore,4,"Some aspects are good, while i feel certain teachers are very subjective and not easy to talk to."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very knowledgeable and dedicated. I have found the curriculum to be generally interesting and comprehensive. The workload seems to be very customizable, ranging from easy and overly manageable to difficult. In general, however, it is very fair and manageable. There are many different places to study. The registration process, however, is pretty awful. The server tends to crash when everyone is registering and many people do not get the classes that they want."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are significantly smaller than most colleges. The professors are very knowledgeable and generally helpful. There are a fairly wide variety of courses offered. Most classes were engaging.
College Freshman,4,"I frequently get emails about career strengthening workshops, etc. There is a career center on campus. I've gotten a few emails about employers recruiting on campus."
College Freshman,4,"It's only been one semester but the classes that I had this semester were interesting for the most part and even when I wasn't as interested I always learned something new, which I think is the most important thing. The teachers are always available for office hours, and students often work together when possible."
College Freshman,4,So far it seems like I'll have a variety of options available to me. I've talked to a few of my professors who have expressed that they and many others are available to help with career options.
College Freshman,4,"Decent housing. If anything the residents are the problem, some people don't know how to clean up after themselves or respect community property."
College Senior,4,I think what really sets my school apart from all of the others is the active student body in issues of social justice.
College Sophomore,4,"The food can get pretty repetitive, but the quality is actually pretty good as far as campus food goes..."
College Freshman,4,"I think the quality of food is really good, however, generally the food tends to lack in huge amounts of flavor. But pasta to order is always very delicious!"
College Freshman,4,Eagle Rock has some great off campus dining options. Lots of taco trucks and cheap restaurants to go to when you're not feeling the MP or Cooler within walking distance.
College Freshman,4,"They have great organic options, and are fairly good about dodging allergens. The food can get a bit repetitive though, and sometimes you just have to settle for grilled chicken and brown rice for a while."
College Freshman,4,Lots of great restaurants especially now that York Blvd is coming up/becoming gentrified.
College Freshman,4,"Over the past few years, the administration has worked very hard to hear students' voices and improve their Oxy experiences."
College Senior,4,I'm a big fan of the residence halls but it also depends on your roommate and which hall you live in. The facilities are solid and most RAs are pretty lax unless your safety is in jeopardy. It's really easy to get to know people and make friends in the first year halls too.
College Senior,4,"I love my off-campus house. They can get a little pricey living in Los Angeles, but there are cheaper options (as well as guaranteed on-campus housing which 3/4 of students take advantage of)."
College Senior,4,"We do not live in an especially dangerous area, but we still have LAPD trained campus safety officers patrolling the campus 24/7. They are also readily available to drive any student to and from a location near campus."
College Senior,4,"The economics department is really strong. The professors have a diverse set of experiences in the field and are easily accessible. I have never felt like I am lacking any resources, especially when I am in a class that engages with our Los Angeles location."
College Senior,4,"Just give fin aid a call, they're really accessible and happy to help prospective/current students."
College Senior,4,"Off-campus dining in Eagle Rock is great! There are definitely student favorites: Oinkster, Auntie Em's, Thai Eagle Rox, Cafe de Leche, and chili cheese fries at Troy's. You can even findThai and Filipino food in the surrounding area.  A couple dessert places that have become more popular as well, such as Donut Friend and Scoops. And of course, there's always taco trucks."
College Senior,4,"The Eagle Rock/Highland Park neighborhood has gradually become even more ""hip"" (you could also replace that with ""gentrified"") over the past couple years. It seems that there's new, trendy eateries, cafes, and boutiques having their grand openings every year. In terms of shopping, the Glendale Galleria/Americana and Old Town Pasadena are not far at all. And despite how urban it is, I was surprised at the number of hiking opportunities L.A. has. I most recently tried out Chantry Flats in Pasadena, and Griffith Park is only a 5-10 minute drive away."
College Junior,4,"As a film major, we get individual emails from our department about entertainment internships. Some are paid, some are not. I typically do my own research when looking for internships because I know exactly what I want. I had an internship the summer between my sophomore and junior year, and the Career Development Center helped me with my resume, cover letter, etc. I plan on getting an internship for the spring of my junior year, as well."
College Junior,4,"Some residence halls are much nicer than others, but overall I would say that living on-campus is great. Most students stay on-campus for 3, even 4 years. While some of the buildings are older and maybe less convenient of a walk, the community within makes up for it. Erdman is beautiful with hardwood floors, and Berkus is the newest (each room has its own bathroom, the building feels like a hotel)."
College Junior,4,"About 30% of students are involved in Greek life. They are fairly small in number but have a big presence on campus. Some of them have houses off campus, some do not."
College Junior,4,I feels safe on and around campus. Campus Safety is friendly and accessible.
College Sophomore,4,"It's LA, it's awesome, but it can be hard to get around without a car"
College Sophomore,4,The off campus houses are amazing
College Sophomore,4,"Off campus dinning is wonderful and there are a wide variety of options very close by, all of which are fantastic"
College Sophomore,4,"As a math major, the workload can be hard but it's manageable. The professors are very helpful. There are also many internship/job opportunities as a STEM major"
College Sophomore,4,Many students get internships and the CDC is pretty good about getting graduates jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"Housing is pretty good. Dorms are generally spacious (unless you're in a triple). All the dorms are close to classes and have good amenities like TV, lounge rooms, pianos, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall very diverse. The only area of diversity lacking is political affiliation. Pretty much all students are liberal, and the very few that are conservative hide it. If you are liberal, you will definitely fit in!"
College Sophomore,4,The Guys on Campus are great! There is someone for everyone :)
Niche User,2,"Its okay, poor rating equates to the cost v rigor, just don't think its worth it when there are so many CSUs at a fraction of the cost with so much more to offer. On the rigor side, they try by paying for guest professors from their associated fields, just difficult to compete. With the blue wave they should fair slightly better as international students pay full price. In all it reminds me of an unafforable east coast elite private high school."

Niche User,2,Online is fine just a hefty price tag to pay over junior college which is about the same level academically but at a fraction of the $30k price tag per semester. Oxy should low their prices if staying online this Fall as can't imagine pay that amount for value.
Niche User,2,"Totally disagree with some of the below posts,.. academic rigor is lacking. If you value diversity and liberalism in a isolated area of Los Angeles but close enough to attend rallies and protests its great. Most dorms don't have AC so can get hot. Food is good, student areas cool, not much to do on the weekends but party."
Niche User,2,"equivalent to a CSU or JC level, not hard to get As from classes. Would suggest JC over online as the costs is crazy high."
Sophomore,2,"I'm a female going here,.. school is crazy IX focused so they guys are terrified to talk with anyone. Also tons of drinking. Wish I knew how diverse this place was before I signed up. I doubt I'll stay past soph year. Prof are great."
College Sophomore,2,Not a huge part of campus life.
College Sophomore,2,"Very small, and their parties aren't that fun."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a fair amount of good points for Oxy, most of which you'd have already heard or seen in other reviews repeatedly. I can't deny most of them. But then again, the disadvantages have stood out more to me over the past two years. Small and tight-knit is good, but not when it's small and cliquey, with people rarely leaving the vicinity of the campus, the neighborhood, or their social comfort zones. Diversity is just a statistic; people have passive-aggressive attitudes towards dissenting ideologies. Overall, Oxy is academically outstanding, but can be very socially demoralizing for a minority of students."
College Sophomore,2,"Sports here has almost no attendance, nor attention given. They exist, and people talk about it, but no one actually cares."
College Junior,2,Party scene is mediocre at best. Administration doesn't care about students at all until the schools money is at risk. There is a lot of hypocrisy. Students preach acceptance and openminded right up until you disagree with them.
College Sophomore,2,"Some dorms are alright, some dorms are really bad. It really depends on what you get in room draw."
College Freshman,2,"There are parties. They're not great parties, but they exist."
College Freshman,2,The school is pretty tough about students living off campus if you're not a senior but I know some people who have gotten off in junior year. Because it's LA finding housing that's affordable is difficult.
College Freshman,2,"Let's be real, if you are looking for a party school it's not oxy. The majority of parties that happen are small groups of individuals in dorm rooms, or people who live off campus. The only way to get into parties is to know people. While the greek organizations do throw some great parties they are also exclusive so theres really no large party scene."
College Freshman,2,Since everyone is forced to live on campus the dorms should at least be nice and while they're not horrific they're really not great. Very few have air conditioning and if you are a first year expect to live in a forced triple. I know the bathrooms in many of the dorms are awful as well and the housing process is rather difficult unless you're an upperclassman.
College Sophomore,2,"The local area is up and coming but it's really not ""here"" yet. Honestly I had not realized how much I would miss living in a college town when I got to this school. If you want to do anything fun, you need to drive to it. We live in a residential area and not a great one."
College Sophomore,2,It is not necessarily the housing itself one should be worried about..it is the difficulty in obtaining that housing which is the real hassle (thanks administration)
College Sophomore,2,It depends on who you are dealing with. Some people will try to go above and beyond to help you out. But I have had my fair share of encounters with administrative persons who could not care less and even told my parents to take me out of school if we did not like the policies #rude.
College Sophomore,2,They are not very generous with their money
Senior,1,See above. Administration and their condescension towards students mars what could be a good experience for many.
Niche User,1,"Hi Parents, so just an FYI - NICHE DELETES negative reviews so you may want to do some additional research on this college. I know of at least 10 parents who wrote negative reviews just this past year. Why? Oxy is a very expensive (74k+ list price) college located in a less then desirable medium crime area outside of Los Angeles. The college is extremely LIBERAL - conservative or evenly modestly conservative views are not welcome here. There is little for the under 21s to do so they excessively drink on and off campus each weekend which is completely condoned by the college. The sports attendance is almost non existent as its equivalent to a high school level and there is no greek life or clubs to speak of. The college is financially stable yet highly dependent on the alum for donations. Several freshman students left after year 1 last spring, several more after this Fall, many more likely not to return after C-19."
College Freshman,1,We probably only have three or four Greek organizations for sororities and fraternities so it can seem exclusive at times but for the most part everyone can participate in most Greek events. However the lack of diversity within the system is horrible and worth looking into.
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties and when there are parties they are both incredibly exclusive and shut down before midnight.
College Senior,1,"Oxy has canceled all school hosted parties and dances and have begun to crack down on student thrown parties because a few students have gotten alcohol poisonings in the past. Campus if often boring and quiet on the weekends, so if you are a big partier and you are not in Greek life, you will be very upset.

Fortunately, once you are 18+, there are a lot of great clubs in LA to party at. Even better once you're 21 and can hit the bars."
College Sophomore,1,"The dining halls suck because they have a decent amount of variety, but it's all so s****y. The prices also are horrendous; it averages out to about $10 a meal, which unless you're an athlete and you eat massive amounts of food, is ridiculous. Meal plans are a waste of money, and almost everything you can buy with flexdine is also overpriced. Places that are slightly off campus, like in Dinkytown, are pretty good though (most of them anyways)."
College Freshman,1,"Don't come to Oxy if you're looking for Greek life. The two fraternities, Phi Kappa Psi and SAE have very distinct reputations. Phi Psi: the frat for weirdos without friends (they don't even have a house) and SAE: sexual assault expected (the frat for the East coast kids who want to be in a frat). Coming from the South where Greek life is king and crucial, the Greek community is really pointless here. As for sororities, many well-known girls are involved in sororities, but most are well-known because of their athletic involvement, not their involvement with Greek life.

Honestly, the sports teams are more like frats than the frats are- they get houses off campus for teammates and throw good parties for all students.

And no, the Greek organizations here don't throw parties. They might as well not even exist."
College Freshman,1,"Eagle Rock Doesn't Care – The community honestly doesn't care much about Oxy; they're not involved in any Oxy events, and don't take in real pride in the college. "
College Freshman,1,"It's Hard to Leave Campus. Transportation on campus isn't a problem at Occidental College. It's transporting off campus that needs improvement. Firstly, the bus system in Los Angeles isn't good to begin with. There aren't enough buses, so you have to wait a long time for another bus to come around. It isn't quick to get from Occidental College (near Pasadena) to Santa Monica by public transport. It might take 2 hours when driving there might take at most 20 minutes. Secondly, campus security may only drive 1 mile from the campus, which is one street away from the main bus stop. This is troublesome, because the neighborhood around our school is considered dangerous. Walking around when it's dark, especially alone, is considered a silly endeavor by the students. Thirdly, the Bengal Bus, our only shuttle, only runs from 6pm-10pm. There are only two shuttles that run, and each shuttle sits at most 6 people. The good thing is that the shuttle can go just about anywhere. The bad thing is that there isn't a set schedule for the bus, so you might have passengers that want to go to Pasadena and passengers that want to go on the opposite side of the campus to Glendale in one car, which is very inefficient. People with cars are considered very lucky to those without them."
College Senior,1,"Oxy is essentially a dry campus. The administration imposes so many rules on drinking and partying, and offer the students few alternatives. Everyone tries to go to off campus parties because the campus safety and RA's are very strict, but then the poor people who's homes were invaded suffer the consequences because campus safety and LAPD break up the parties. Also, some of the neighbors are mean, especially living closer to campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Nice dorms, TERRIBLE staff – The dorms are spacious and nice enough, but the REHS life staff at Oxy is easily one of the worst in the country. Serious reform is needed in the next year. Students, parents, campus safety, and many of the deans have had serious problems with REHS life in the past few years. The staff is disrespectful, strict, and completely misguided when it comes to discipline in the dorms. That being said, the dorms at Oxy are very nice and the rooms are spacious. The most rundown freshman dorms are way nicer than most upperclassman dorms at bigger universities."
College Freshman,1,"Too Strict for Own Good – First offense deserves a write-up and assessment by jury. Very harsh. We're college kids and the strictness of the policy isn't going to change anything. If anything, it makes drinking less safe because people are too afraid to report any problems or request help if things go awry because of fear of a write-up."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Severe – I heard this wasn't the case a few years ago, but lately there have been numerous complaints by the neighbors that have forced the college to be very strict. Off campus parties tend to get shut down very quickly, and on campus activities are heavily monitored by the RA's and campus security"

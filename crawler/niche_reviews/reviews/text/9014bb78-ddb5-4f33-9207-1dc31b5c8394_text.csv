Junior,5,"I feel like I have genuinely found a home here at Mocs U! I am an accounting major, and the professors who work in the business school are incredible. It definitely helps to be involved on campus to make friends, but because of how small of a school it is, meeting new people comes pretty naturally. The location is great, being close to both Orlando and Tampa, part of my heart belongs to Lakeland now!"
Junior,5,"Everyone at this college is extremely welcoming and friendly. As a student, I can say the academics are amazing as the instructors are the best in their fields. The campus itself is very beautiful and it always feels like home!"
Junior,5,The online learning experience was very well constructed and closely resembled the in class learning.
Niche User,5,I've always had a great experience with Florida Southern. I love the environment and am happy to be a Moc!
Freshman,5,Florida Southern is a amazing school with different things to do every single day and such amazing community
Freshman,5,"There is an unmatched vibe that comes along with Florida Southern. It has most of the advantages that a large school provides with the feel of a small school. You can walk to class and know everybody that you walk by. The sports are great, the teachers are all highly qualified, and the facilities are superb."
Freshman,5,"Florida Southern is an excellent college, very good student life and excellent professors. Would reccomend to any students thinking of coming here."
Niche User,5,"What I enjoyed about Florida Southern College was that I felt welcomed. From the first moment I set foot on their campus for a tour, I was immediately given a t-shirt, informational brochures, and water. Every ambassador knew how to greet their guests and how to entertain us throughout the campus walk. The area was clean, and the sun shined beautifully! Students that were nearby were engaged in their course work. For a private school, they know how to ensure the students eat well as they had numerous food choices in the cafeteria. The library and study room designs were flawless, and the atmosphere was relaxing! We were informed that day one of college, every student engages in hands-on work for their majors with a high-qualified professor. The best part was that about 95% of students by their junior year get to study abroad (which is included in the tuition!)."
Freshman,5,I love Florida Southern College. The professors really care about the students. If you are confused they are there to help you out. If you have a problem and you got and speak with them they will help you figure our how to handle it so that the next time you won't need their help.
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment at this school, the small campus and low student to teacher ration really helps you succeed. You get to know your professors and peers really well and everyone wants you to do your best academically and socially here."
Niche User,5,"Awhile ago, I went and visited Florida Southern College because I wanted to see some potential colleges that I can go to once I graduated my senior year. I went to see their academic buildings such as those who majored in education, business management, etc. Their classrooms were pretty spacious like one you would see in a high school classroom that could fit about 25 students, and I felt comfortable being in there because it not like other colleges where the classrooms are like the size of an auditorium, but small so you can easily interact with your teacher face to face. They also provide buses that can transport to the many areas that they have. Florida Southern does offer dorms and roommate surveys based on similar personalities or similar living arrangements. The staff are really nice people and I have met some students as well and they are all kind. I hope that one day I can go to that school and spend my years in college learning a lot and making many memorable memories."
Sophomore,5,"Best southern private school, individualized attention, gorgeous setting, friendly and safe environment to grown and learn in."
Graduate Student,5,"A small college that has adult and graduate programs. Professors and staff are not only respectful and willing to help, but they are also friendly and supportive."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed by time so far at Florida Southern, it was the best choice for me. The classes are small and interactive. All of the professors are very helpful and want me to succeed. I have no regrets about choosing Florida Southern College."
Freshman,5,"Florida Southern really does have the most beautiful campus. It only takes about 15 minutes to walk from one end of campus to another, so the walk to class isn't too bad if you aren't a morning person. The teachers at Florida Southern are well-educated with experience in their fields, and they really do want to see you succeed. Your professor will know your name, and get to know your personality so that they can help you achieve your goals. That is the best part about going to a smaller school. Not only do you know the professors, but you know everyone on campus. Stronger and more personal  relationships can be built in this homey environment. They give out really great scholarships too! The athletics are great, especially Basketball, Baseball, and Lacrosse, but I do wish we had a football team sometimes. The freshman dorms aren't the best, but after that they get much nicer. The food is pretty good. The local area is amazing, there is always something to do, or somewhere to eat."
Sophomore,5,"Florida Southern was my dream school when I was looking into colleges. After attending for a year, I am still loving it. The school has a very homey vibe and is super welcoming. The academics are very good and small class sizes allow for a good learning environment. It is a big plus to be able to have a closer relationship to professors and work so closely with aspects of your major. I have already been able to go on an all expenses paid trip to NYC for Advertising Week.  I love the school and opportunities available. I do sometimes wonder if I would have preferred to go to a bigger school, but I believe the education I am getting at FSC is better than what a bigger school would have. The small school has a smaller party scene for sure, but it is easy to go to parties elsewhere with the same energy."
Senior,5,"I love Florida Southern because of the community and size. It is a small school and you get to know a lot of people, but you don't know everyone. I constantly see people I have never seen before. It is very easy to get plugged in with an organization or group right away. The departments are great. I have learned so much and have gained a lot of real world experiences and connections."
Niche User,5,"My teachers were amazing and taught me not only about subjects, but they also helped me to understand life."
Freshman,5,florida southern is a very diverse school that has a very pretty campus.however the food could be better.
Niche User,5,Wonderful professors. Beautiful campus. Dorms could use updating. Cafeteria is great - fresh vegetables and fruit.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful Campus, small class size, personal interactions with administration and professors.  Excellent theatre company and excellent programs for prospective students and parents.  Big enough to have a lot of options but small enough to feel comfortable and homey."
Niche User,5,Florida Southern was the absolute best college I’ve been too. I ended up applying to the college and getting in because I loved it so much. I ended up getting in and now I’m going to be attending Florida Southern. I would highly recommend this college they truly care about each student and it is worth every penny.
Freshman,5,I am a Freshman in college and I love this school so much already!! I am very involved with the Barney Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. It is a fabulous program and there are so many opportunities given to each of the students because of our professors and the connections that each of them have from their workforce experience. Totally would recommend.
Niche User,5,"I was accepted into this fabulous college. The campus is beautiful! They really work with you throuh out the entire process of applying and enrollment.  They have so many great opportunities! They very safe if not the safest campus.  As a student you have a keychain alarm like button. You press both buttons and it immediately notifies the security office. It  gives them your exact campus location and pulls up all the information on you that they may need, such as allergies. They have a 15:1 ratio of students to teachers! As they grow they hire more professors to keep that ratio."
Junior,5,I have had so many opportunities with Florida Southern College that I would not have been able to accomplish on my own even in my dreams. The staff are so friendly and the environment on campus is professional yet relaxed. You are encouraged to be yourself and you can feel safe doing it.
Freshman,5,my experience there is that they have a top 10 for teacher engagement and one of the best and most interesting schools in the U.S.  if i had to change it i would say nothing!
Freshman,5,"Every school has downsides but, FSC  is the perfect school for ME personally. They have everything I need on campus,  like majority of my classes, I don't have to worry about anything but what I came to school to do, which is graduate."
Niche User,5,"In November 2018, I visited Florida Southern College, as I was interested in their cross-country and track and field program. As I visited, I got to know the runners and coach very well. I enjoyed the campus tour, the athletes, the atmosphere of the coaches and students, and felt quite welcomed. The college had a beautiful campus and eloquent architecture of which sets apart the campus from any other collegiate education institution in the state of Florida. What drew me in particularly was the athletic department and the coaching philosophy of the cross-country coach. Having a similar coach in high school, the FSC cross country coach convinced me this was the school fit for me. My experience wasn’t particularly “mind-blowing” nor was it completely unique to any other college visits I have taken. However, it was the simple culture of the cross country team that drew me in and I see nothing that need be drastically changed at FSC."
Niche User,5,It was a great experience there. I had a field trip there and we learned about a lot of leadership skills. We did a lot of communicating different people to get us out of our comfort zone.
Niche User,5,I loved seeing Florida Southern's campus when I visited.The staff and students were so nice and genuine. They have amazing opportunities and great academic programs.
Freshman,5,"Class sizes are smaller than other colleges, which makes it better for your professor to connect with you."
Sophomore,5,"Florida Southern College offers a lot to their students.  Academics, athletics, sororities, fraternities, clubs, and everything you need to make your college experience one to enjoy.  As far as changing anything, well, I wouldn't change a thing."
Sophomore,5,"This college is the best one in the state of Florida! I am a second year student who is a commuter, and I absolutely love this school. The campus is beautiful, and the opportunities here are unbelievable. If I had to change one thing about the school, it would be the availability of parking on campus. You have to get to campus an hour before your first class starts in order to actually get a parking spot. The campus itself is beautiful, however. It is Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, so the campus is known for the way it's built. All of the professors here are amazing as well. All of them want their students to succeed, and that fact is very apparent."
Alum,5,"Great place that will give their best and attention to every student there. Everyone there really cares for the student's education, safety, and experience."
Junior,5,"My favorite thing about my school is the size. Going to a small school never appealed to me when I was applying for colleges, but the minute I stepped foot on campus I knew it was for me. I love the small class sizes and the close relationships I have formed with my professors. Being able to talk one on one with a professor whenever I have needed has helped me to excel. Whenever I have questions regarding my education I know that they will be answered."
Freshman,5,"I was so nervous being 17 hours away from my family but the admission team and other faculty members at FSC have made this transition so easy. The campus has such a family-oriented feel, it's hard not to love it!"
Freshman,5,It’s a super friendly small school that makes you feel extremely welcome!! I’m so glad Matt has been so helpful in the college process and I’m so glad I chose Florida Southern!
Alum,5,I really loved attending Florida Southern College. They have a wonderful environment and really encourage students to excel. The professors do everything they can to help you succeed. You can not ask for a better college.
Niche User,5,The campus at Florida Southern is beautiful ad the people are very helpful. My father and I went on a visit here and within minutes students were asking us if we needed help finding anything. The campus looks out over beautiful Lake Hollingsworth and it very clean and well maintained.
Freshman,5,"I love it so much! Small campus, nice people, great setting! One of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen! Absolutely love it."
Freshman,5,"Florida Southern College cares about their students. They help you to achieve your goals in any way possible. It is also a community with in a community. FSC is located in Lakeland, fl. The town is a good sized town with many things to do, but when you are on FSC's campus  you feel as if you're in an entirely different town."
Sophomore,5,FSC is outstanding college.professors are great very helpful and available after office hours. advisors are very helpful too. outstanding research programs
Works Here,5,"FSC offers an outstanding private education on one of the nation's most beautiful and safe campuses. I especially love the faculty/student interaction, the commitment to academic excellence, and the Lakeland area. FSC is also a great school for extracurricular activity - from Greek life to student clubs to  intramurals to cheering on our stellar sports teams, there is absolutely something for everyone!"
Alum,5,"Florida Southern gave me the tools to ensure my success after graduation. I was able to thrive in the small class setting, and got invaluable experience while I learned through FSC's experiential learning process. Florida Southern immensely helped shape me into the man I am today"
Niche User,5,I will be an incoming freshman who will be playing lacrosse.  The school has made me feel incredibly comfortable especially Admission director Liz Green.
Works Here,5,I'm a proud staff member at FSC and find the community to be very special Students and professors are genuinely so engaged and passionate. It's truly a place where inquiry is engaged and one where you'll always feel supported. Lakeland has all the benefits of a college town but is so much more than that too--I love getting to live here as a young professional. FSC is home.
Sophomore,5,I’m obsessed with the small and friendly community of the campus and surrounding area.  I am having tons of fun while getting a world class education.
Works Here,5,"I am a staff member and also very proud alumnus. Florida Southern is a wonderful institution with a lot of educational opportunities and extracurricular activities for students. I loved my undergrad and graduate experience. I took advantage of getting involved in a sorority, community service, and I was a member of the chorale. I also participated in three internships and studied abroad. Lakeland is great too! It is a tight knit suburban community with a lot to offer college students. There are a lot of really great restaurants and I love the Lakeside Village. Florida Southern changed my life for the best! GO MOCS!"
Works Here,5,"My favorite thing about Florida Southern is how engaged the student community is--both inside and outside the classroom. Students can build their resume through internships, research, performance, service learning, and study abroad. Plus, with 94% of students living on campus, there's so many activities for students to be involved in when out of class. The bonus is the beautiful lakeside campus that makes FSC the perfect place to live, study and work!"
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, great people, amazing staff. Love it there so much. Home away from home. Never would have thought I would have loved being at school so much."
Freshman,5,"Great academics, faculty members are really nice and they explain everything really good. Residence buildings are good, with a great view, good location, beautiful campus, sports teams are really good, it is really fun to watch the games because the school spirit is awesome!!! The student-athletes are incredible, doing both things at the same time, academics and sports at a 100% !!! I love my school :)"
Freshman,5,This school has been amazing to me. My advisor was so helpful with enrolling me. Along with the finance department. My professors are so informative and understanding. The other students are eager to learn and that helps stay focused. It's not cheap but worth the price. The flexibility is incredible.
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful. The teachers are amazing. My favorite part is the close knit community that Florida Southern Mocs have established and maintain.
Freshman,5,I have had a great first semester.  The dorm room is spacious and there are 4 guys to 1 bathroom.  There are decent choices for food on campus.  My classes were small in number and my advisor was very accessible.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Florida Southern. Florida Southern has such a community filled atmosphere. There are so many opportunities for every student on campus. This year I got involved in Greek life, and it has been the best decision I have ever made. Finally, the professors at Florida Southern are very personable. I have had many professors give me extra help when I did not understand an assignment very well."
Senior,5,My time at Florida Southern was a great experience. I had great classes and professors on a beautiful campus in a great area.
Freshman,5,"I haven't attended Florida Southern College yet, however I am very excited to start in a few short weeks. The application and enrollment process has been awesome to say the least. It is clear that this school cares about the students and has been very helpful during the transition. My admissions counselor has been amazing. It was clear he took the time to get to know me."
Alum,5,"Located in the lovely town of Lakeland, FL. FSC offers a small town feel while packing in a top quality education."
Sophomore,5,Great Class Sizes and a very pretty campus. Professors are genuinely concerned about your well-being.
Sophomore,5,"This school has offered me so many great opportunities and I have only been there for one year. Since it is a smaller school the teachers are able to individualize the classes to fit your needs, and all of the teachers have connections in their fields to get you a job or internship. This school is really like a family and really the only bad thing is the food."
Junior,4,The professors at FSC who I have had have done their best during this crazy time. Most of them have increased flexibility for due dates because they understand how difficult it is to balance all of these classes in a new format.
Senior,4,I would like to see change in the way they communicate and care about student concerns. I would also like to see some more freedom with living situations and to be more relaxed with the rules.
Sophomore,4,My first year here was pretty good. It's a small campus so you could get from one end to the other in about 15-20 minutes walking and you tend to see the same/familiar faces every day.
Junior,4,All my professor were really helpful! They understood the circumstances of everything! The school on the other hand tried their best.
Senior,4,"I loved attending FSC. The faculty go above and beyond connecting with their students and in doing so provide an unmatched learning experience. The educators are incredibly accessible and often work overtime to ensure that each student graduates with an internship (I had 3 when I graduated). They emphasize and incorporate real world application within their classrooms. In doing so, many graduate are excepted to prestigious graduate programs as well as incredible entry level jobs. The close nit community that Florida Southern offers provides an unparalleled learning experience."
Junior,4,"This is a great college to attend. The professors are attentive and always very willing to help you in any way they can to help you succeed. The cafeteria food is not always great but it's alright. It is incredibly easy to get involved in student organizations and that is the best thing to do to find and make friends. Since the college is small, you are likely to see many of the same people in several of your classes and the class sizes are small so you can get to know your professor more personally and they can connect you to other resources available. The campus is very picky and uptight about its aesthetic reputation so it has been difficult for student groups to make the campus greener and more sustainable over the years but several are still trying. Nonetheless, it is a great school and I'm proud to be a student here."
Freshman,4,I love all the close sporting events and things to do downtown. Somethings I would like to see changed is the amount of other activities for students to participate in and not just sports events.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are amazing, the atmosphere is great, the students are easy to get along with. Facility wise, it is awful. There seems to be no concern for student health and safety."
Junior,4,"When I came to the campus for a day tour, I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and all my expectations were exceeded. Also not to forget the smaller class sizes, engaged learning programs, internship and study abroad opportunities, and lively social life here on campus. Student life here at Florida Southern is amazing. There are many entertaining events organized on campus for the students throughout the semester."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a Freshman at Florida Southern, and it has been a very positive experience so far. It took me a little while to get connected, but now that I am it's a lot of fun. The professor's and class sizes are great!"
Freshman,4,"The overall small campus gives it a sense of unity. The professors are very accessible  and have very flexible office hours. The overall ambiance for the college is nice and everyone around the campus is very polite. All faculty members are always looking our for students especially new students. There are many advantages, such as being ensured an internship. The campus is very clean and is very secure. There are always patrols on the campus making sure all students are safe."
Freshman,4,"I'm genuinely really glad I came here. There are a lot of clubs and on-campus events, so it's easy to get involved and make friends, and the people here are very welcoming and friendly. The professors are very accessible and willing to help; they'll even schedule time outside of office hours if you need help. Sports aren't a huge part of college life, but there are some people who get into it, and they have intramural sports and exercise classes. The food is pretty average, but there are a lot of different places on campus to eat, so you don't get bored."
Freshman,4,Florida Southern offers diversity amongst its students. I’ve been in contact with many of my peers throughout the summer. We’re well oriented and always willing to help each other with what it is that we have to do. I love FSC!
Junior,4,"Remarkable! I have been able to travel to Washington DC and Alicante, Spain; run in Spartan races and race at Track meets; learn about biology and the world around us; and most importantly, have been provisionally accepted to Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine."
Senior,4,It's a small campus so its perfect for those who want a comfy atmosphere. The only thing that I would change is the whole parking situation.
Sophomore,4,"Florida Southern is a small christian school with strong academic resources and great campus involvement. During my first year, I was assigned to an advisor who helped ease my transition from high school to college and showed me different areas to explore regarding my major decision. The school offers different organizations to get involved and has great Greek life participation. The professors are always available and there are multiple resources to help you. Overall the school provides you with a great education and creates a powerful sense of community."
Sophomore,4,It was a great first year. The school is located in a nice neighborhood right near Lake Hollingsworth. The dorms and food are not very great but overall the school is good.
Niche User,4,An interesting campus. Very architecturally inclined but I do not think it matches my personally. The campus is very old but blessed with great majors and minors.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is stunning and the small class size allows for a personalized experience with professors. Great food, especially in the on-campus woof fire pizza stop."
Sophomore,4,Florida southern college is an overall great institution. There are plenty of activities and clubs to be a part of and amazing peers that help support one another. The only thing I would want changed is nothing!
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time at Florida southern. The professors are polite and helpful. They genuinely want the students to succeed.
Freshman,4,I love the teachers here and the small homey environment. The food has a limited number of options and the housing is getting old and needs to be updated.
Sophomore,4,"I love Florida Southern. The opportunities for involvement are great and the location - being close to Tampa and Orlando - is amazing. My only issue is the facilities. Yes, they are Frank Lloyd Right - beautiful to look at, but not to learn in."
Freshman,4,"Florida Southern is pretty good! I came for the academics and they do not disappoint. I don’t care much for the food, but the campus is nice and fairly easy to navigate. Class sizes are super small!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, FSC is a great college if you love having smaller class sizes and one-on-one's with professors. Academic offerings are good, and the school offers a multitude of options for majors and minors. Other than academics, some housing facilities and some buildings where classes are held need to be updated. There is a wide variety of clubs to be involved with on campus."
Freshman,4,Love the small campus and number of students. This is a serious college not a party school. Love the campus with the lake and rose garden. Glad and proud to be a Moc.
Niche User,4,I was at Florida southern for 2 years but decided to transfer because i wanted to go to a better school for my major which is graphic design. The teachers were nice and helpful but some were a little scatterbrained. I enjoyed my stay while i was there though.
Sophomore,4,"I like how friendly the environment is there, however I very much dislike the passport program and wish it were removed as a requirement."
Alum,4,"Florida Southern gave me the chance to build close relationships with majority of my professors. As a result, I was able to excel academically and professionally, while developing good principles under their guidance."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the environment. Everyone is committed to doing their best whether it be the professors or the students. I've never had a bad experience at the college.
Senior,4,"I love the faculty to student ratio at Florida Southern College - I have great personal relationships with all of my professors and I love it. I would like to see a change in their buildings, lots need repairs and technology updates."
Junior,4,"As a African American, academically sharp student, I would say that for my first year attending Florida Southern College, I honestly enjoyed it. Why?
1) The people I've met are quite respectable, kind people. Though it is a majority-white institution, I personally have never faced any sort of racism. Furthermore, I generally feel included.
2) I enjoyed all of my professors that I have had over my first two semesters at FSC. I took shards of knowledge away from certain classes.
3) I enjoyed some of the campus events. I attended theatre productions, jazz performances, lectures (e.g. ""Child of The Sun""), and more. Personally, as a person who does enjoy learning new things, I enjoy such events. Others may not be as interested, and that is understandable. To each, his own.
4) Most of the professors care."
Niche User,4,Florida Southern College came to my High School for college night. They explained all their academic advances and clubs.
Junior,4,"The best thing about Florida Southern is the people. Faculty, staff, they are all kind and willing to help. Due to the small class sizes, we are taught by full-time faculty, most of who have the highest possible certification in their degree."
Niche User,4,"I visited Florida Southern for a short weekend for a soccer ID camp I attended there, and the campus is beautiful! Very clean and well-kept. They have received many academic awards, as well as awards for how their campus looks. I just think the architecture looks a bit strange next to all of the modern things they have there- Frank Lloyd Wright designed most of the school, and his design is a bit eccentric."
Sophomore,4,"Florida Southern College personalizes its approach to education through engaged learning, which means that whatever field you're in, you'll get involved and hands-on experience with materials and professors who seek to know you personally so that they can do their job to the best of their abilities. Lakeland is a bustling town with both a great regional location and downtown area, but there's so much to get involved with on-campus that even if you didn't go out often you would never be bored (except by choice)!"
Sophomore,4,"Being able to switch majors was easy and Doesn't put you behind. Athletics are competitive, and facilitate outstanding. The food has much to be desired."
Senior,4,"It was interesting going to a small college when all I was exposed to was the large college atmosphere. But the ease in making friends, getting a name out on college, joining different clubs, and exploring the local area made this decision easy and worth it. They were pretty generous with the scholarships and it was nice having a home-like vibe at college."
Freshman,4,Florida Southern is a very student involved campus! There are countless clubs and organizations to get involved with including many that specialize in helping other students with their studies.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a current student.  I love it so far.  It's a fairly small school, but that keeps students from falling through the cracks like my friends at big schools say can happen.  Several of my professors email if you don't come to class, which I think is sweet; they care and want to see you succeed, but you have to put effort in on your side.  I think this is a school that is overlooked in the initial college selection process, but it's a place where most students are happy they ended up, and would not want to transfer out of.  Lakeland is great, and not far from Orlando, and even closer to Tampa."
Sophomore,4,It's a good school but the food is pretty gross and it's really expensive. Would recommend if you're just into academics but definitely not if you're looking for a party school
Senior,4,"As a senior, my time here at Florida Southern has been full of long nights in the library, countless trips to professors' office hours, fun campus activities and late night trips around Lakeland. While the school is small, this allows for a tight knit community and constant campus events. Small classroom sizes also allow for higher quality relationships with professors which can be really beneficial when faced with challenging topics."
Freshman,4,It is an amazing community with an unbeatable view! All the teachers and professors love all of their kids and it shows!
Sophomore,4,"The small school atmosphere makes connecting with professors easy and enjoyable.  Any dissatisfaction with this college comes from the fact that it is a private college, so tuition is high, but while the money that goes to education I feel is well spent, other costs feel wasted. Housing isn't in great shape, and due to lack of rooms, I was paying the cost of a double when I did have a roommate but we shared a single-sized room. My payments currently seem to be going toward baseball field renovations while the science building, where I take all of my courses and use laboratories, are old and falling apart. I'll still stay the distance in order to receive the worthwhile academic programs, and I enjoy the social aspects of a small school, but be cautious of where your money may go."
Freshman,4,"I've only finished my first semester, but it's been an amazing experience so far! The application is easy, courses are amazing, love the dorms, lots of places for food, beautiful campus, and a ton of activities to do every day."
Junior,4,"I just finished my third semester at Florida Southern College and I loved it. They got a great freshmen class, a new sorority on campus, and our sports team is still awesome!! The things I will like to see change are more diversity and more majors!"
College Sophomore,4,"The drug scene at Florida Southern College is not too bad. There are students that use drugs, but they don't force it on others and can hide it well enough not to make a scene."
College Junior,4,The career center works hard to help students. The problem is almost nobody uses it
College Sophomore,4,"My school offers internships for fourth year students, which I believe definitely helps students ease into the work force. I know music students who found jobs as soon as they graduated due to their internship experiences, faculty connections, and the help of the career center on campus.

 I am studying music business, and Florida Southern College's business school is ranked number one in the state of Florida, and number four in it's region. This high ranking and my upcoming internship will be of great help to me."
College Sophomore,4,"My courses have been great so far. The class sizes are perfect when it comes to student and teacher interaction, but may cause difficulty when registering for classes due to classes getting filled up quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"It's great to see groups of people come together in their brotherhood/sisterhood to make our campus and the community a better place. I have seen many greek activities on campus that act as a positive contribution, such as fundraisers and activities that bring awareness to social issues. There is no hazing allowed on our campus and Greeks and non-Greeks get along very well, which makes the social atmosphere very peaceful. I am currently trying to set up a social sorority in my school for music students, which I believe will create a tighter bond within the women in the music department."
College Sophomore,4,"I have attended a few games, and the fans never fail to show their spirit. There is a lot of support from every type of student for our school's teams, but I wish more support was shown for the women's teams. Sometimes their performance is even better than the men's. In fact, both teams have great rankings, but the women's teams are ranked higher. Nevertheless, it's always great to kick back after a long day of studying and support our school's teams."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience has been great, and I feel secure about the next three years of my college education. I've made great friends and acquaintances who are as passionate as I am on this gorgeous campus. My music professors are very helpful and they truly care about my future. I know I will hold these connections dearly in my search for a career. Florida Southern College wasn't my first choice. I was financially held back from my dreams of going to Berklee College of Muisc, but I do not regret my decision. Everything has fallen into place."
College Sophomore,4,The professors I had for my classes were all great and very helpful if I needed a further explanation on anything.
College Sophomore,4,I am probably biased due to the fact that I had a huge room and my own bathroom. But heard from others that housing is a nightmare.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very confident that I will get a job after graduating.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone has safety keychains that they press if they feel scared or are in danger.  I've never had to press mine so I don't know how fast the response is but theres always multiple security guards in golf carts driving around.  Every time I leave my dorm I see at least one.
College Freshman,4,The professors are so nice and interactive. All the students are very welcoming and they go out of their way to help you.
College Sophomore,4,"I know there are a lot of good resources around campus to help you land internships and jobs which is great. If you have the right professors and advisors in your alley, you will have access to good things."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone I know that graduated the past years got jobs right out of school and on top of it mot of them got positions in the companies and hospitals that they had dreamed of attending.
Freshman,2,The only real thing that I liked about the school was the athletics and the small classroom sizes. The campus is small allowing for easy maneuverability but the living arrangements are average at best.
College Sophomore,2,They give the freshman the best dorms and then its all down hill from there.  Mold and bugs are prominent.  They simply just do not take care of their facilities. Also I would highly recommend that all in coming student are fully aware that THERE IS NO OFF CAMPUS HOUSING.  This means no house parties at all.
College Sophomore,2,There have been a few incidents that I've heard aren't taken quite as serious as they should've been. The school is very concerned with its reputation.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing but AWFUL experiences with community living. They seem to have a hard time doing their simple jobs and can't keep things in order. Every year they let in too many people than they can house. They are unprofessional and rude rather than accommodating and understanding when you try to work out issues with them. I feel as if I am dealing with people at the DMV rather than those of people who are supposed to represent the school well and be here to help me sustain a good time on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is HUGE at this school and seems like a bunch of cliquey high schoolers in my opinion. If you aren't a part of greek life you are basically irrelevant.
College Freshman,2,I lived in Dell and it was extremely small and very dirty. Im sure there was mold somewhere in my room because i was barely ever healthy.
College Freshman,2,"I don't live on campus, but I've been into some of my friends' dorms. They look absolutely horrifying. The beds are literally right up against each other, and the room is probably as big as an average room for a child who lives at home with their parents. They make the bed really tall so you can fit your belongings underneath it because there's practically no space for anything else in the room. There's only two desks, and maybe a closet. Everything feels insanely cramped. There's only like one bathroom to a whole floor (I'm not sure about this, maybe 2). It's insane because my friend at Nova has a 2 people dorm that looks like a living room compared to Florida Southern's."
College Freshman,2,The teacher's seem to be good but some don't really care. The classes are pretty small with about max of 40.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms stink, they are old and out of date, you could have a 2 person dorm with 4 people inside, restrooms are a disaster"
College Freshman,2,"The teachers are very inconsistent, the price you pay is a lot compared to what you get out of the college"
College Freshman,2,There really isn't a party experience. If that is what a student needs at their college of choice then FSC is not for you.
College Freshman,2,The only bar nearby was closed due to a tragic accident with a student here. It's a dry campus so drinking must be kept on the down low but it still happens.
College Freshman,2,This can go two ways they are great if you dont like to have fun but if you do they are all over you
College Freshman,2,great staff and friendly people but boring campus
College Freshman,2,spivey sucks and is over priced but i love my hall mates
College Freshman,2,"FSC did not provide me with the ""college experience"". They treat students like high schoolers and there is very little to do on campus and around Lakeland. I believe that the dry campus policy has caused more issues than it has solved. Sports teams are very separated from the regular student body and as an athlete, this was very frustrating. I had some amazing professors and some that did nothing but present powerpoint that were made by textbook companies. The campus is beautiful but that can only make up for so much. I have decided to transfer because I was not being challenged and did not feel as if the people around me care about my wellbeing."
College Senior,2,"The diversity here isn't great, mostly due to the cost and location of the school. It would be nice to see some color!"
College Sophomore,2,Unless you're in greek there is hardly a party scene. Kaus is gross. Stay in drinking in the dorms with your friends is the normal non-greek party life.
College Sophomore,2,Vegan/vegetarian options are extremely limited. The food quality is very poor and you're forced to eat on campus freshman and sophomore year until you can live in an off campus apartment. Very oily everything.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman year I got a single dorm which had a great view and was in a brand new building. The only downfall is how small it was I could take two-three steps both ways and I would hit a wall. They treat the freshman the best so that they come back the next year. Freshman get the best dorms. Sophomore year you still have to live in the dorms and if you have a high enough GPA you can get average dorms which is what I got. I live in hollis (which had a mold problem in the beginning of the year for some of the rooms, I walked in one girls room and it felt extremely damp gross!) and you share a bathroom with 20+ other girls there are three bathroom stalls and four showers. You don't have access to any appliances you clean everything in a bathroom sink. You can't have any appliances in the dorms to cook your own food either unless you want to run the risk of it getting confiscated and fined. The worst part about the housing is you have to live on campus all four years. Once you're a junior you can live in an on campus apartment and they have converted all of the rooms to doubles and triples since they don't know what to do with all of the students. If you want to live by yourself in an apartment forget about it. There are only 3-4 single apartments TOTAL. I'm living with random roomates but at least I get a single room to myself which I had to fight for. Most people share rooms in the apartments."
College Junior,2,I couldn't pay for the student loan because it's so expensive. I can't go to school unless the student loan is paid.
College Junior,2,"This place is only good for the main attraction that is the college. I'd never settle down here, even if it is a pretty place."
College Junior,2,"Mold in dorms, bland apartments with filled up pool, distance from classes makes it a struggle... there's a laundry list, but I can't go on forever."
College Junior,2,"People who end up here usually don't accomplish much else in life. I feel like I should get out, but I wouldn't know where to turn."
College Junior,2,"Tuition is freakishly high, students are intolerant. Hands on experience isn't necessarily hands on. Basic college education equivalent to a high school education. Food is rotting. I don't know where my money goes. Rooming with a potential psychopath."
College Freshman,2,I've heard living in the apartments can be quite the hassel
College Freshman,2,"Lakeland isn't a great place to live. The locals are somewhat sketchy, depending on where you are in town. Lakeside Village is a great area, but it's too far to walk from campus. The area around campus is residential and can feel a little unsafe at night. Downtown Lakeland is okay and there are a few nice places to eat, but no shopping. Although we are halfway between Orlando and Tampa, if you don't have a car, good luck getting there."
College Freshman,2,I don't party so I wouldn't know.
College Junior,2,There are public buses that run by the school. Every few months the school has a shuttle-to-shop where they drop people off at the mall. I hope either you have a car or a friend does. I have my own car.
College Junior,2,"The campus isn't that large, so it's no problem to walk from one side to the other once (twice is pushing it). Unless you get there early, it can be difficult to find parking. There are small parking lots all around the school, it is just a matter of finding a parking spot near where you need to be, instead of finding one across campus and hiking to class."
College Freshman,2,The best and least difficult option is to just live on campus. The requirements to be eligible to live off-campus are to exhausting to meet.
College Freshman,2,"The guy to girl ratio is so bad, wayyy to many girls for all these boys"
College Freshman,2,"The health services on campus are atrocious. If you need anything but free ibuprofen, hit up one of the urgent care clinics (or the hospital) nearby and you will be much more efficiently and effectively taken care of. 

The safety services are okay - they're mostly friendly and they're frequently visible driving around in their golf carts. But that's all they really do. Luckily there is hardly any crime (and no violent crime I've ever heard of) on campus, as if there was they wouldn't even be able to react to it appropriately as most of the officers are too old and overweight (and completely unarmed) to protect a student's livelihood. All safety has ever done for me was unfairly written several parking tickets.

The areas near campus are mostly non-sketchy but there are better spots than others. There are occasional townies or unwelcome friends-of-friends on campus that have lingered on campus for periods of several weeks, but never has it been a safety issue."
College Sophomore,2,"Florida Southern is a dry campus, and they enforce it. Alcohol and drugs are a huge ""no no,"" and you will be punished if you break this rule. Visitation is frowned upon as well. If you have a significant other don't expect them to be able to stay the night because it won't happen."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly just fast food, Taco Bell, Chipotle."
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do outside the campus.
College Freshman,2,There is not much going on except Kaus and fraternity parties.
College Freshman,2,"I received financial aid, but I am still paying far too much."
College Freshman,2,I wanted more then I recieved
College Junior,2,"Sometimes its hard to find a spot, parking lots are not spacious and  seem like a maze to get through. Learn to parallel park. "
College Freshman,2,not very good at it
College Freshman,2,"Lack of parking, and spots are usually pretty far away. "
College Freshman,2,On-campus transportation does not exist.
College Sophomore,2,"The school has a lot of restrictions on off campus housing, which is cheaper than the dorms.
"
College Freshman,2,The food situation sucks in general.
College Freshman,2,The wireless internet here sucks.  It only works half the time and is very slow.
College Sophomore,2,"Caf food is getting better, but still pretty bad. Undercaf food is just greasy and people can tell for hours afterwards that you ate there, because the smell lingers on your clothes. "
College Sophomore,2,"The Health Center is a joke and thinks ibuprofen is the answer for everything, and you have to worry more about safety hitting you with the golf carts than them helping you."
College Sophomore,2,There is very little parking. It is almost impossible to find a parking spot during the day.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of parking for students, so  it has challenging to find a spot."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty close to campus and I believe that they have university apartments.
College Freshman,2,"The campus claims to be a ""DRY"" campus and also claims to have a zero-tolerance policy for offenders who partake in drug and alcohol usage. This doesn't affect me because I don't do either, but I know friends that have had to deal with bad roommates being a drunken pain in their necks. Usually, if you take it to your Resident Adviser (R.A.) they try to mediate it and they really only bust people who have PHYSICAL paraphernalia in their rooms, and even then it's only a slap on the hand. This is bad because they are free to continue under a 'probation' when I believe that if they say ZERO-TOLERANCE they should really mean that and give no second chances."
College Freshman,2,"FSC likes to say that they are a ""dry"" campus but the truth is that students have three strikes before they are actually kicked out. A large amount of students participate in alcohol consumption. I will say though that the students themselves have enough self-control to know not to drink to the point where you cannot progress in your studies."
College Freshman,2,"Although I do not ever really feel unsafe, the method of security is a button that you push and it only works within a 3 mile radius, and does not seem to prompt a very fast reaction in the case of an emergency."
Recent Alumnus,2,"WHEN I FIRST VISITED THE CAMPUS I PERSONALLY FELT LIKE I WAS THE ONLY HISPANIC THERE. THE FIRST TIME I WALKED INTO THE CAFETERIA, I WAS SHOCKED SEEING ALL THE MINORITIES SITTING BY THE BACK DOOR CORNER ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM WHICH WERE ALMOST ALL AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE REST OF THE CAFE WAS FULL OF WHITE AMERICANS AND A FEW EUROPEANS WHICH SAT AT THE TENNIS/GOLF TABLE. COMING FROM NYC, I COULDNT BELIEVE IT. FORTUNATELY, THE YEAR BEFORE I GRADUATED, I SAW THE INCOMING CLASS AND BECAUSE OF DR. K (PRESIDENT) THE POPULATION OF MINORITIES INCREASED. APPARENTLY, I WASNT THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THE PROBLEM. GREAT JOB DR.K!!! - CYNTHIA MEDRANDA CLASS OF DEC.2009"
College Junior,2,They're all really annoying and stupid. I get pretty tired of them fast.
College Sophomore,2,"Dry Campus – The college maintains a dry campus policy for all students, regardless of age.  RA's range from strict to chill, but there is a different RA on call every night so you never know who you'll get.  Most people end up going to Kaus or Socialite, both of which have been busted several times with no obvious ill effects.  If you are caught drinking on campus or return to campus obviously drunk, FSC maintains a three strikes policy."
College Junior,2,very strict rules on campus decorum re underage drinking and drug use.  Cheating not tolerated in any form.  Drink but don't advertise.
Recent Alumnus,2,"FSC owns an enormous chunk of property around the campus that is lovely property- and the college knows it, charging a large sum."
College Junior,2,"Never have problems – The student health center is always available, if you need a excuse from class, a prescription or medicine it is really convienent. The safety officers are fun too, they are cool, you will constantly see them on their carts driving around, but I do recall someone being shot when running around the lake, and someone being hit by a car on the lake as well. "
Senior,1,I only took online classes on zoom and it was an uncomrtable experience. i hope they decide to keep classes in person year round for 2020-2021
Junior,1,"My only experience with online courses at this college was during COVID so this may not be reflective of typical online courses at this college, but my professor cut the exam times in half to ""reduce cheating"", images that we needed to answer questions on the exam were not visible, we were expected to teach chapters to ourselves, and the laboratory work was suddenly 10x more difficult."
Freshman,1,Pretty bad college if you ask me. Nothing exciting or good to talk about it. The food is okay but not very good and the living conditions aren’t bad. But honestly my high school was quite a bit better quality and it was a public school. Definitely not worth the price.
Niche User,1,"Worst college/experience ever. Save yourself the expense and do not attend this school. My high school was better the quality of this school. I transferred and went to a a way better college for half the price. I do not even say I went to the school due to its inferiority. They thrive on being a ""beautiful campus"" but that is far from the truth. They try to give you scholarships to get you there but they do not care about the well-being of their students. I wish someone would have told me this before I decided to attend that school. If you want to be happy and have a great education, you will not get that at this ""college""."
Sophomore,1,"FSC is an alright academic school, but there are reasons so many people transfer out. The dorms are gross, besides Nicholas and Wesley, which only freshman live in. There are 0 parties because there is no off campus housing for ANYONE, besides commuters, which is bizarre. The ""parties"" get busted an hour into them. If you're looking for a college experience DO NOT come here. Sororities and fraternities are MEDIOCRE and the only reason people go here is because of sports scholarships or they had no friends in high school. highly dislike, and would never recommend. Its in the middle of nowhere Mason's is the only club and its so boring. Not even that close to the beach. The campus is also disgusting there is nothing nice about it."
College Sophomore,1,If you are not in greek life in school you probably will not have that amazing and fun college experience.
College Senior,1,"Freshman housing - JR - the oldest building. Falling apart. Bugs. Mold. 

Pairing up roommates - horrible. I was bullied by mine. 

RA handling problems - My RA was super nice in JR, but she never resolved in the issues. 

Freshman housing - Dell - better than JR, but it's a literal prison. 

Pairing up roommate - good. my new roommate was super nice. My new hall mates were amazing. My new RA was so special and nice. I never had any problems, but if there were any i know my RA would have solved them. 

Housing process for returning students. I was lucky. I was able to get a good spot on the list because although I'm 18 now, I am technically a senior with good grades, so I was able to choose good housing first. 

My boyfriend and other friends, tho, who were freshmen with average grades, were about number 1,700 on the list to choose a dorm... Lets just say even now some of my friends STILL don't have a dorm, or just recently got it. There was no choice for returning students that were Freshmen. 

I'm 18, a senior, and an adult. I have a job. I'm not allowed to live off campus unless I get approved?

There are 22 year old students who are also not allowed to live off campus unless they get approved. I believe that is too much control."
College Freshman,1,The nightlife is horrible. Party scene is awful. There are none.
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene. Greeks don't have houses. We drink in our rooms and I had more fun in high school.
College Freshman,1,Horrible. It's pathetic. The fraternities and sororities don't have houses and aren't even allowed to. Literally the greek suites have RA's that will write you up for an empty beer can.
College Freshman,1,"All these other reviews were written, I'm sure, by the college itself. This school is HORRIBLE. Do NOT come here if you want to have a genuine college experience. Greek life is a joke and the only kids that enjoy it were the ones that didn't have a single friend in high school. Please STAY AWAY. There is absolutely no having fun on campus. Campus is dead on the weekends and all the administration wants to do is fine you and screw you over. The education is mediocre at best. Do not come here, it's a joke. The only fun you can have is going to tampa on the weekends and walking around the decrepit but still beautiful campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Besides college owned apartments where students still have to follow the policies of no visitation and alcohol (even though most students living in these apartments are over 21), the college does not allow students to live off campus at all. Students must be over 23 years old to live off campus, and by that age most students have already graduated."
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no way to get around without having your own car or riding a bike. However the town is so large that it is very difficult to get to places farther away.
College Junior,1,We aren't allowed to live off campus (besides school owned apartments) until you are 23. 
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is awful! There are never any open spots. Most students completely disregard others and park so horrible no one can get in. Many times, students take up two parking spots. They park where they are not supposed to and it's just now that campus security has actually cared enough to give them their very well deserved fines!"
College Sophomore,1,Not very willing to offer you grants/scholarships or even loans unless you literally show up crying. It takes a lot of work to get them to budge.
College Sophomore,1,"Luckily Lakeland is a small enough town that if you have a bike you can ride it to the downtown area. Bikes are also available to rent at the wellness center. The issue is that if you really want to go somewhere that aren't small shops in the area, you need a car. I never saw buses while I was there. If you want to go to Walmart, or even Mcdonalds you need a car which is really inconvenient unless you have a friend on campus that has a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Florida Southern doesn't seem to have a whole lot of diversity. The majority population on campus is white. I also felt like there wasn't a whole lot of room to make you feel comfortable in being diverse. Most guys are into sports/fraternities, as well as the majority of girls are sporty or into a sorority. Not all, but most students at FSC come from families that are in the upper class of the economy. Personally, I didn't feel comfortable at FSC because of the lack of acceptance in diversity. Otherwise, it's a pretty good school."
College Freshman,1,"There is ONE bar in town called Kau Kau's Korner. I wouldn't recommend it at all. It's just a dirty hole in the wall bar. It's close enough to walk to but if you're truly interested in a nightlife scene you're better off going into Tampa and hitting up Ybor City. The campus itself is a ""Dry"" campus so no alcohol allowed on campus, but a lot of student organizations plan fun little parties here and there if you're not looking for a ""nightlife"" but more of innocent fun events."
College Junior,1,"They're giving the best dorms to the freshman starting next year, and you can't live off campus unless you're 23 or older. That leaves about 2,000 students living in poor quality dorms while the students who haven't worked there butt's off to get where they are get the best living spaces."

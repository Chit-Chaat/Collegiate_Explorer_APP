Freshman,5,A- State was honestly not my first choice in what college I wanted to go to. Picking my college was a big decision for me. I am the first one out of my parents to go to college and I felt like I was pressured to choose the right one. My mom was not ok with the decision that I made and her opinion matters to me so I stayed close to home. That's how I ended up at A-State and I am honestly glad that I did. I started off college in the wrong way. I was getting started on my own and missed the first two weeks of class which left me in a constant state of being behind and trying to catch up and get work done. Doing work this way keeps me stressed and very anxious about failing or choosing to drop out cause I feel I can't do it anymore. College is something that is not for everyone and I honestly and so glad that I decided to pursue in going. I was persuaded by the cadaver lab here on campus to join the medical field and I am excited to start my journey to becoming a surgeon.
Freshman,5,Online classes here at A-State are ok I guess you could say. I think it helps those who are shy and don't choose to talk in class. Doing it all online gives you the choice of not showing your face so you don't have to worry about anyone looking at you while you talk. It gives you confidence in your answers.
Freshman,5,I have taken all of my most recent classes online and I love it! It is so much easier for me to be able to mange classes on my own schedule and still be able to work to provide for myself at home!
Freshman,5,I love Arkansas State University! There is really nothing that I would want to change about the school currently. I have had nothing but an amazing experience at this School.
Sophomore,5,I take all of my classes online and love the Blackboard Arkansas State uses. Easy to use and navigate.
Freshman,5,"I am fixing to start my freshman year at Arkansas state university. I am excited about college and hope for a wonderful experience. They have been awesome at having zoom meetings with us this summer to help us on our journey. I hope that our year will go as expected and that the COVID-19 won’t affect my college experience. Thankful for a college that is sending out wonderful information to us regarding any questions we have about college expenses, courses, and housing."

I have enjoyed on my experience so far, even in the midst of the Pandemic, the teachers were very flexibly and also very concerned about our wellbeing."
Junior,5,"I have taken quite a few classes online at A-State. Some are pretty simple and it is apparent that the professor is experienced with virtual instruction. . Foreign language was very difficult online, but that was not the professors fault."
Freshman,5,What I have seen of the college it is very open and calming. They have a lot of activities for each person or student.
Junior,5,"The teachers really care about their students and are always there to answer questions or provide support. It is an affordable college, but a great one. The campus is homey, which is very comforting."
Niche User,5,"The campus is very bright and welcoming. There is a lot of diversity and you get out what you put in. The only downfall is from the dorms, they aren't terrible just adequate."
Senior,5,"The cafeteria and foot court are amazing on their own but add starbucks and Einstein’s to the mix for perfection! I love the energy, diversity and opportunities."

Freshman,5,I honestly wouldn’t change anything. I have loved my freshman experience so far! We have the best Chancellor!
Junior,5,"A-State is an awesome school in a town that is growing. They really care about the students and want to see them succeed. ""I felt lonely and afraid at first, but the staff and student body helped me feel right at home""."

Niche User,5,I overall like the cleaniness and professors of the college. I would like to see more work done on the dorm rooms.
Junior,5,Friendly down to earth. Everyone is willing to help in any way they possibly can. The staff in all areas are knowledgeable and polite. No one looks down on you .
Niche User,5,"I love Arkansas State University. Every time I am on campus, everyone is so happy to see you there! the Games are the best! Wolves Up!"
Senior,5,"A-State has high standard of care for their students and their futures. As a working LPN to pay for school, I was hit with terrible news of my hospital closing its doors with no warning. I didn’t know what to do. The faculty members of Arkansas State University- Jonesboro Mrs. Angel Hamill, Mrs. Joy Jennings, Mrs. Judith Pfriemer, and Mrs. Cathy Hall not only heard my cries for help but listened and jumped into action even the Registrar’s office-Mrs. Danielle Childers, Financial Aid-Mrs. Andrea Jones, Mrs. Jamie Carmack, and Mr. Finney. These faculty member’s dedication to excellence have inspired me."
Sophomore,5,It has been a home away from home. I love the environment and the love from the campus as a whole. It has made me very happy. My grades have been good and I've realized my potential with learning and how far it can take me. They open up new opportunities and show you what there is in the world.
Sophomore,5,"Arkansas State University is an amazing college that provides you with a homelike atmosphere. This college gives you small town vibes that coincides with a large education. The red wolves is a school of many attributes, and a school that is your home away from home."
Niche User,5,I think Arkansas State is a great local college to attend. It's Choir Department has yet to fail me with their performances and their directors have always shown excellence. Every professor that I have met all have shown me kindness and I would absolutely love to be able to attend here.
Freshman,5,Arkansas state university offers the great experiences of meeting knew people and being able to become apart of many different organizations on campus. There is a place for everyone no matter how different.
Sophomore,5,I left home to find another home at Arkansas State. The atmosphere at Arkansas State is always on of encouragement and acceptance. I have had countless opportunities to do things beyond my comfort zone and grow as a person.
Sophomore,5,I have recently transferred to Arkansas State but I know I have found the school for me! The staff has helped me in every way possible in my transfer. The campus is beautiful and the students are welcoming! I am so excited to build my future here.
Alum,5,"This university for anyone wanting to find a family away from home. This university gives you the option to pick your meal plans and they have very good food in the food court and in the cafeteria. This is a huge sports loving university, especially with football who has won multiple Sunbelt Championships. The teachers at this university really care about their students and if they get the material in a timely manner, they are so easy to approach and discuss the lecture with."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is very welcoming and inviting. I would like to see Greek Life expand on campus, and see a more diverse student body. ASU's campus is calm enough where you are not overwhelmed; however, the resources that are available are great and very useful."
Freshman,5,"I love the school and the environment on campus! It's the perfect fit for me and all the sporting events are full of energy, especially the football games. The professors make good use of their time given to teach you necessary information. All around great school."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and there is just enough space in between each building. The cafe offers a variety of different options for lunch. The staff is very friendly and is helpful in every way possible. If you have any questions, you can always email someone for help."
Sophomore,5,"It is amazing, because it is small enough where you know people but big enough that you see new people everyday. I am involved in Greek life, intramural, and Student Government Association. Also, I love to cheer on the Red Wolves. I love being on the Student Government Association, because I am able to be one of the first to know what is going on on campus. I want to make a difference on my campus, and this is one of the ways that I am able to do so. Also, I love being involved in Greek life, because I am able to make so many more new friends and encourage other people to do so."
Graduate Student,5,The professors in the Communication Department are always willing to help to further my education and make themselves available upon request to share their current research along with helping the student learn more about the students research opportunities.
Senior,5,"Arkansas State University is the best college to go to! There is always something to do with the school, on and off of campus.  I have been going here for a few years now and can not image myself being anywhere else.  They have an excellent staff and the teachers truly care and want to see you go far in life.  I have made friends I will have for the rest of my life and we get to experience college together.  Another plus about this university is the cost each year is so much cheaper than all other surrounding universities."
Freshman,5,I love everything about this university! Very diverse community and very friendly students and staff. Many opportunities under this university that would be very beneficial.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Arkansas State University, I fell in love and knew this is the college I would be attending. The people here are so friendly and are always willing to help in any way. I learned a lot about this university in one full day. One thing I really loved about Arkansas State University is the security that was surrounding the campus making sure people were safe. While being here, I noticed how active and involved students were on campus and how well people got along. The professors here are very concerned and are there to serve their purpose. At the end of the day, I believe they are the ones there to help make sure you are doing what is expected of you. Overall, this is a five-star university and I cannot wait for what all it has in store for me."
Freshman,5,"I like how diverse the school is and also there are plenty of resources to help each and every student succeed. Everyone is very friendly, peers and staff."
Niche User,5,"Arkansas State's mission is to educate leaders, enhance intellectual growth and enrich lives. Founded in 1909, A-State is the second-largest university in the state and a leader within the Delta and Mid-South region. It hosts the first osteopathic medical school in the state of Arkansas, NYIT's College of Osteopathic Medicine, and opened the first U.S.-style residential campus in Mexico in fall 2017.

In addition, A-State has top-ranked programs in creative media and speech communication."
Freshman,5,"I am not student at Arkansas State University, but I will this up coming year.  While going on a college tour to Arkansas State University, I could see myself going there.  The campus is beautiful and the dorms seem fit for a freshman."
Niche User,5,"Arkansas State University has a very friendly and safe environment. This college has always been in my top 2. Arkansas State University, doesn't just better students education wise, they also help students become better people."

Niche User,5,"Very welcoming school, always smiling. The school is very organized and people are very helpful when needed by other students. Has a wide range of food items and wide range of majors."
Freshman,5,Great school. The staff is very helpful. You can learn a lot of things and be very successful. Everything on campus is easy to access and find. It is very open and everyone is very friendly.
Junior,5,Teachers are mostly friendly. Very helpful students and staff. A lot of clubs and opportunities. Offers many services.
Sophomore,5,I love Arkansas State University. I genuinely consider it my second home. All the campus has to offer benefits me and my studies in every way possible!
Senior,5,"I really enjoy ASU, it has a hometown feel to it, the professors are willing to help you with whatever you need."
Junior,5,"Arkansas State University is a very open and welcoming university. Many people there, especially the administration and students who are involved, are outgoing and try to make you feel comfortable. There are also many foreign exchange students so there is a lot of diversity, which is something you don’t get to see if you’re from a smaller town in Arkansas."
Senior,4,"Online has been up and down. Some classes are just not made to be online and it had been difficult. One of my teaches has videos going over problems but it is hard to
See how he works them out sometimes."
Junior,4,"I am not very good with online learning , but the professors I have had are very helpful in doing everything they can to help online whether it is emailing answers or explanations to questions or posting extra notes and videos to help with understanding the material of the class."
Junior,4,"Arkansas State is the best school. The campus and the buildings are beautiful. I have had nothing but great experiences from the professors and classes I have taken. There have been occasional random fees throughout the semester but that is probably with any school. There are many activities on campus to get you socially involved on campus and different ways to bond with your peers and make friends. Food is pretty good except sometimes the cafateria may be eh. The one campus living is pretty expensive , but that is every school. There are apartments and buildings for different students. The honors building is very nice and you get what you pay for. There is a ton of help on campus concerning trouble with classes. Tutoring is very helpful and is free!!! There are individuals in the field of the class that help people struggling. I never liked going in person , but they provide an online meeting through zoom so you won’t even have to leave your room to get help with your work."
Sophomore,4,"None of my classes are strictly online, however, they are hybrid classes with some of the time being spent online and some in person. The online experience that I have had at Arkansas State University has been quite satisfactory. The university has greatly adapted to accommodating students who need to transition to online classes."
Sophomore,4,Arkansas State University has provided me with many enjoyable academic experiences as well as social. It is a great blend of smaller city with a larger university. Teachers make it a priority for their students to grow academically as well as mentally. Arkansas State University has equipped me with the tools that I will need in order to succeed in every aspect of life.
Sophomore,4,"I love the major selection Arkansas State provides. Rather than just a Comm. major, I am able to major in Strategic Comm. with a social media emphasis. This allows me to take more specific classes I am interested in. The application process was not smooth, as not everyone in the offices were on the same page, which is why I did not give five stars."
Freshman,4,Arkansas State University is a very well- rounded college that provides you with the education that you need to get a good career.
Senior,4,"Great school. Enjoyed being a part of the school culture. It was very inclusive. For me, the best part was the professors. The work is not too bad. I have learned quite a bit. The teaching staff is also very diverse."
Freshman,4,"I love the faculty, they go above and beyond to make sure their students succeed and show real interest in their students. Some thing that need improvement though is being able to get ahold of the college via email or phone, it takes a while to get a reply and you sometimes don't get one at all."
Junior,4,"I cannot speak for other departments, but the history department is top notch at Arkansas State! Every professor genuinely cares about their students and wants them to learn about history. Our chancellor is incredible. He is great about keeping students informed, which has been especially apparent since the COVID-19 pandemic. Best library ever! 

Like any school, however, A-State has its flaws. If you don't live on campus or participate in Greek Life, you will not make friends easily. That really got to me as a freshman. I feel like A-State higher ups have a greater concern for commercial investments and athletics instead of educational value, but the professors make this difficult to notice, as most of them care. If you aren't from Jonesboro, you may be disappointed in the city. There is not a whole lot going on around here."
Freshman,4,The online experience is easy to understand and the help center or teachers are easy to contact if need be.
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the campus.  Very beautiful. The enrollment process was great as well. Once I starting attending classes it took less than a week to learn the campus and how to get around. The professors are ok but most had other jobs on campus. For example, one of my professors was a teacher, department head, and an advisor. He was often unprepared for class and would cancel. I really needed to learn everything the class had to offer and felt unaccomplished after the semester ended. Other than that and an issue with the Micro- Economics class, the school is great. The Micro Economics class curriculum was too outdated for me. I could not grasp it and when asking for help I felt belittled so I quit asking. I ended up dropping the class. I am sure now that I know which two teachers to avoid, next semester should be amazing."
Junior,4,The online system is good. They use Blackboard mainly. Some classes require the use of a webcam during exams.
Niche User,4,"I just enrolled in college for my ADN to BSN , enrolling process is pretty easy, Emily helped me a lot in explaining step by step for process. I am starting May 18 and super excited for this new chapter of my life."
Freshman,4,Arkansas State University is a great school that is supported by the whole city. There is a lot of diversity and clubs so each students has a chance to fit in. It allows students to learn how to be responsible. There are many professors who care about the well being of the students.
Junior,4,"Campus is nice, generally kept clean. Great facilities. Although, sometimes it feels like the teachers don't care about their students. That would be something to fix."
Junior,4,"I am an online student so I can only speak on my experience with that. But overall I have had a pretty good experience. I have not had any bad experiences so far, if anything is ever needed from the professors they are always just an email or a phone call away. If there is anything that is not understood, they will do what they can to help you."
Sophomore,4,"I liked my fist semester. I kept to myself mostly, but still enjoyed it. I had 2 classes that were hard and i have no clue how to study, so I didn’t do good in those classes.  I did not like how in biology lab, it is a teacher’s assistant teaching the class. I feel like i would have done better if it was the actual professor. I did like that every teacher was easy to talk to and understood when things happen."
Senior,4,I love ASU the classes are interesting and informative. I am in the online program and it fits very well with my job and children. Although the classes are a bit pricey I cant wait to graduate from there and become ASU alumni.
Sophomore,4,There’s a great atmosphere Arkansas State University. I have been very pleased with my experience here. The people go out of their way to make you feel at home. The one thing that I would improve would be the tuition increase each year.
Senior,4,"Most professors are excellent and very responsive and helpful. Lots to do, housing is nice. Applying for grad school and other things done on line has been a pain. The system is very disjointed and not at all streamlined. It takes some work on your part to get things done."
Freshman,4,"I really like the fact that student involvement is strongly advocated at this school. However, food in the cafe could improve."
Niche User,4,"I like the diversity that Arkansas State University has. I've met so many people with different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and I've befriended them. The University shows genuine care for all of its students. I would change the food, it's mediocre."
Freshman,4,"I was very nervous moving from my hometown, Memphis, TN, to Arkansas State this year. Being a freshman in a new town, new ""home"", surrounded by new people at times has been pretty rough. However, I believe that Arkansas State has truly made me feel welcomed and determined to achieve my goals during my college career. The environment and individuals I am surrounded by every day inspire me to get into the Radiology program and pursue in Sonography. There is rarely ever a time when I go out and feel unwanted here. My professors have been extremely helpful to me these past few months and the events that are held here make me want to do things out of my comfort zone. Because of Arkansas State, I desire to strive towards greatness more than I ever have before."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience on campus is positive as a sophomore, but I have trouble getting the necessary funds for classes. Currently I am trying my best to stay active on the weekends here as well, but it is hard considering  things shut down here after Friday. Other than that, the professors are amazing, campus activities are loud and fun, and I have met very cool people here. Tuition and how much it cost may feel like much, but if I was fully covered, I would be having even more of a blast."
Niche User,4,"The day I walked on to Arkansas State's campus, I instantly fell in love. I have only visited 2 times so far, but I am planning another visit up very soon! Everyone there is so kind, it just felt like home while walking around touring the place. I really love how easy it is to be so involved in organizations around campus.  I could definitely see myself making Arkansas State my home for the next 4 plus years of my life, in the near future."
Senior,4,"Arkansas State is the perfect place for anyone who wants great teachers, a beautiful and comfortable campus, and a a university size that's big enough for you to meet plenty new people but small enough that you feel right at home! I love the STEM department and athletics. I had so much fun!"
Junior,4,The professors care and want the students to succeed. it is affordable and people  here are kind and welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"The overall campus is very nice and clean. Classes are, for the most part, fairly involved and informative. It would be very nice for engineering classes to have more explanation provided by the professor teaching them."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been average due to meeting new friends and some fun activities. Life in the dorm is maximized by game night in the lobby and student union. We also had pajama parties, movie night, and bingo. There are many activities to keep busy and build bonds with friends."
Junior,4,"being local is very beneficial but other than that, I wish there were other benefits for those who do not live here locally, and more online classes were offered"
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful. I loved my professors and enjoyed my time there very much so. The food on campus was delicious and the overall vibe on campus was amazing. I met a lot of wonderful people there and cannot wait to start my second year there.
Freshman,4,Overall it was an amazing experience. The staff was so welcoming and the aura on campus is very inviting.
Sophomore,4,"I'm not very involved on campus because I work so much, but it's a pretty decent school. There's lots of oppurtunities to be involved within the ASU community, many options for classes for ALL majors, and plenty of places to get coffee."
Junior,4,I like that the classes are small and that the teachers seem to care about how you do in the class. The class times are flexible and if you go to the classes you should do well. the teachers have outside of class hours where you can go to them if you should need help or if you have any questions. The teachers are willing to put in the effort to help you succeed if you do. The campus is fairly easy to navigate and the classes are easy to find. The staff is willing to help if you nnned anything
Freshman,4,"I love the Arkansas State University campus it is very beautiful and I can't wait until spring comes, I bet it will be even more prettier. This is my second semester as a freshman and l've been loving the school so far. There are some professors that tend to ruin it for me sometimes, but I try not to let it bother me to much."
Freshman,4,Arkansas state is a pretty good school in my opinion. I like most things about it. The things I don’t like is that you can’t get food at anytime of the day. I have a 7 day meal plan but it’s kind of pointless if I can’t go to the cafe and eat when I want.
Senior,4,"The process to get in, or renew things in general, can be quite confusing and irritating at times, but overall it’s a lovely, small, 4 year institution."
Freshman,4,Great campus and very friendly teachers. I am learning at a much higher level of completion than I have at other universities.
Niche User,4,I have had a great experience with this university and I believe it is a great institution. This university works with local high schools to spark interest into upcoming graduated and by offering dual enrollment classes.
Niche User,4,"I like that ASTATE has the best medical program that everyone tries to help one another succeed. No matter the circumstances each person is pushed to their abilities.  I personally spoke to one of the advisers and they gave more information than I planned to learn, which was helpful later on. He was very friendly and tried to help me understand certain things. I plan to graduate in Arkansas State University with my bachelors degree in Biology. My future career goal is to become a Pediatrician. To work with kids and become a doctor."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed most of the ammunition’s that they offer there, but I would love to be more in contact with them. I live very far and sometimes feel very much brushed under the mat with some of my questions."
Graduate Student,4,"The programs are affordable and the online program is easy to follow.  Professors can be challenging and some do a lot more work than others.  I would recommend this school to anyone, I have had a great experience thus far and have one year left."
Freshman,4,"Arkansas State University is very accommodating to all students from all walks of life. Their student support is easy to talk to, and their professors are top-notch."
Graduate Student,4,"I am a graduate student.  I feel I am receiving an education that will adequately prepare me for my chosen health care field. The instructors are well prepared and seem genuinely concerned about our education. 
I would recommend the program I am in to other students choosing the same field. I wish tuition was not as much as it is and I wish I could obtain some financial help."
Sophomore,4,I love everything about ASU! It is a great university with an amazing campus. The professors are also very friendly and helpful during lectures.
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my first year at A-State, and am looking forward to another this fall! The staff is great and really helpful, and there are so many chances to get involved in campus or in an organization. The atmosphere is always joyful! Go wolves!!!!"
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see a better relationship between greek life and the school. I am not in greek life, but I feel that there's a lot of pressure put on them and not enough understanding. They do a lot for our school."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is small enough that you can move around carefully, and yet it is big enough that you can explore many aspects of the university. There is such a fantastic vibe when you step onto campus with all of the activities and sports going on regularly. You'll never be bored."
Graduate Student,4,Everyone was friendly. The professors were easy to talk to but some of the advisors made it hard to understand for those of us coming back into school.
Junior,4,"I like the wide variety of the professors and the help you are available to. The only complaint I have is parking. Besides driving around for thirty minutes to park, I normally have a great day in all of my classes."
Senior,4,"I love the atmosphere of Arkansas State. The people here are friendly, but it is big enough to feel like a university. The only downside is no night life for it is in a very conservative town."
Junior,4,"I am a Jr. at this university. transferring to asu was easy and well balanced with the help of my advisor and teachers. This year has been hard but thankfully all of my teachers have been with me throughout the year. When I need their help with something, they are always ready to help. I love how they will always set time aside for students who need help."
Freshman,4,Arkansas State has a very nice campus with great facilities. As an incoming freshman this can be overwhelming at times so I recommend getting involved in some way to make new friends and create a sense of belonging.
Freshman,4,The school as far as education is amazing. Professors and teachers are very helpful and try their best to help you understand.
Freshman,4,"I am in my second semester here, and so far it is an outstanding school! The facilities are great and very accommodating, teachers are understanding and friendly, and the atmosphere is overall a welcoming, enjoyable place. I recommend anyone looking into college to take this school into consideration."
Freshman,4,I like the people and the campus life. I think this school should remain it's high quality college ways.
Junior,4,I absolutely love the help and support I have received from the staff through the entire process of getting enrolled and registered each year for my classes. I would like to see a little bit more training to the advisers for class selection so students can get enrolled in their classes right away like they should.
Senior,4,"Astate College of Business will prepare you to work for large corporation, start an entrepreneurship, or for whatever endeavors you may have in business; However, the graduation rate is low, but the school as started a team of professionals to raise the graduation rates by providing students with more opportunities such as special tutoring programs and improving advising."
Junior,4,"So garbage so good. I’m in my 3rd year and the teachers are swell, most of them are very helpful and will work with you if you need it."
Alum,2,"Astate online is a waste of time and money. I recently completed my Bachelor's with them and I wished I had gone somewhere else! It was a battle from the beginning with the office of admissions, then financial aid, and last but not least the actual program. The inital enrollment and application was easy, but after that you had to call and stay on the people to do their job, otherwise nothing would get done. I graduated May 11th, 2019. The ceremony was also on the 11th. I was cleared to graduate and walk on the 14th or 15th, and it's now in the middle of June and I still have not received a diploma. My advice to everyone is avoid ASTATE!"
Freshman,2,The classes were good and I like the campus but I felt very disconnected and isolated here. I think the way that rush works needs to be re-evaluated after 40% of girls dropped and I was extremely pressured into continuing to go through rush even though I made it very clear I was unhappy and that I wanted to quit I feel I was forced into continuing the horrible experience that left me with a low self esteem and feeling very alone. I had a hard time making friends here and I wish I never had to go back. Arkansas state gave me an awful college experience and I don’t want to continue my education at this school.
Senior,2,"I submitted me transcripts from ASU for a military assignment and for other employment opportunities...without fail, all of them asked ""ASU? is that like, an accredited school?"" Very glad that I went onto other places to further my educational record and to have something positive to show other than ""ASU Red Wolves"""
College Sophomore,2,Campus housing is not the best
College Sophomore,2,"I personally don't like Greek Life. I am not in it, nor am I interested at all to be in it."
College Freshman,2,"I lived in University Hall this past year and it was a bad experience. The bathrooms were so old and were constantly growing mold and never looked clean. I think the school could do some major renovations. Also, there is not enough on campus housing for everyone and a lot of people have to rent off campus, which is unfortunate because the bulk of scholarships given by the school include money for housing."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly don't know if I'll ever feel safe on campus
College Freshman,2,"We have had mold issues, it is loud. The plumbing is bad and when you have a problem it takes a long time for your work order to get to it."
College Freshman,2,nothing is ever open! everything closes super early here and it is very inconvenient! plus there aren't many options
College Sophomore,2,"There are not enough parking spots, and parking enforcement is harsh I have even heard teachers call enforcement officers ""Parking Nazis."""
Recent Alumnus,2,"I went to the financial aid office for help to start looking for aid, and all I got was a ""there's a computer to fill out your fasfa"". Needless to say they were very rude and unhelpful."
College Freshman,2,"They seem strict but really, we were told at the year not to have alcohol in our dorms and I've been in some dorms with bottles of some kind of liquor, nobody does anything. But they're pretty strict on parking, a little bit too much compared to the other problems we have on campus."
College Senior,2,The rating is better for undergraduate students. For graduate students is very limited. In the science area the grads students meet from time to time by themselves.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most fraternities and sororities are all about parties and getting the most people into their organization. The school does have a variety of Greek organizations that are service and not social, but the social ones appear as just cliques that are ready to party."
College Junior,2,"The classes don’t line up with the comprehensive exams we have to take. There is no funding for conferences or professionalization experiences for students. Only a handful of faculty members are under 60. There isn’t even funding for a working printer in the writing center, yet the football team gets a new field. The humanities are greatly ignored."
College Junior,2,My campus needs better tornado planning because our area has a lot of tornadoes
College Freshman,2,Considering that my hometown is 4 to 5 hours from school. Transportation is usually always an issue.
College Freshman,2,"It's almost like I didn't leave high school. In fact I think it's worse , but the level of anti-socialness is ridiculous. You can honestly speak to a person in a friendly manner , and it's as if they start to panic. Because they usually freeze up , and don't know how to respond."
College Sophomore,2,it is bad but there is no entertainment
College Sophomore,2,"If you know where to get all the financial aid you need, you are doing good.  Yet, if you don't know where to look, who to ask, ect you end up taking a lot out for student loans"
College Senior,2,Expensive and not on time.
College Senior,2,The parking situation is awful. There are never good parking spaces and the enforcers are inept and inadequate. 
College Senior,2,The frats and sororities are annoying and intrude on an otherwise uneventful learning enviroment. 
College Senior,2,Cars are a necessity. I dont understand how people get along without them.  
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing to do. All banks no fun. 
"
College Sophomore,2,"It was average experience, but the conditions to keep the financial aid were a bit unreasonable."
College Sophomore,2,Students really don't have many options that are within a reasonable price range.
College Senior,2,"the school is very strict on maintaining a good gpa.  If your gpa dips, you are placed o  academic probation."
College Sophomore,2,The few good residence halls/apartments fill up so quickly and are not based on seniority.
College Sophomore,2,"Jonesboro is a terrible place to live. It has gotten better as far as the night life is concerned (as restaurants have adopted liquor licenses) but still remains a flat, hot, isolated, mosquito-infested Delta town. Furthermore, without a car, transportation around town is nearly impossible, and biking is dangerous."
College Senior,2,The bus will take you to various locales in town.  It is convenient for students that do not have a car.  Every student pays for it within tuition so you might as well get your money's worth.  You can travel anywhere within town qithin 15 minutes.
College Freshman,2,I had a suite mate who smoked marijuana with her boyfriend on our floor of the dorm. When the smoked it the smell lingered in the hall and in our bathroom. The smell was so strong that my room mate and I would complain about it. It stank really bad.
College Junior,2,"My reason is because I don't live close to my campus. I'd just rather live on campus and not have to worry about bills and insurance, and utilities. Can't really give a complete review because I haven't checked out the apartments near by on rent costs and stuff."
College Freshman,2,"They have carts for the disabled and busses that run across town, but that is about it."
College Junior,2,"There are campus police, however, there are incidences that were committed on campus that should have been more publicized for the students safety."
College Sophomore,2,"AstateAnywhere is more commonly known as AstateNowhere. Sometimes it works brilliantly and other times it's ridiculous. There is a 24 hour computer lab in the library that has printing available and you can print in the library itself from a few computers, but that printer often goes down. I would say you definitely need a computer on campus but you can do without a printer."
College Sophomore,2,It is SO COLD in the winter. Rain is also a very common issue. You have to walk a good ten to fifteen minutes to get anywhere on campus and you are exposed to the elements the entire time so this constant cold and rain from about October to March is miserable.
College Senior,2,"The programs are great, too much emphasis is placed on the Football program."
College Sophomore,2,It has its good ones and bad ones. Versatility is there though.
College Junior,2,There is limited parking close to any buildings of nessity.  The parking garage is full of reserved parking.  So it is useless to even try to park in it.
College Junior,2,"There is not enough parking, and its way over priced!"
College Sophomore,2,"There are not too many places to choose from, but there are a couple that are fun.  Most have a night every week for those who are under 21."
College Sophomore,2,"At ASU, you're most likely going to find ""good ol'"" farm boys and southern sorority girls. Most people are conservative with a strong religious affiliation. If you aren't like them, they are generally less accepting."
College Sophomore,2,"I received the amount of aid I needed, but it was a headache to deal with the financial aid office. They frequently gave me the run around and I had to really be vigilant about making sure they were taking care of my case."
College Junior,2,"The rooms are not up to par, most of them are nasty looking and they expect you to clean it when you're they but its not clean when you get here."
College Junior,2,"They guys are decent - mainly jock-type people and the girls are mainly sorority-type. Most people are stuck up, but there are a few really nice people."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Hot and It's Cold. Not much to say about this. On hot days it is rigorous trying to walk to class a long distance, and on cold days it is completely miserable to walk. When it rains make sure you have an umbrella, and when the weather is nice.... Well, that is the best time to enjoy the campus! When it's not too hot and the sun is shining, ASU has some really scenic places to walk to. Provided you're into that sort of thing of course."
College Junior,2,"Lacking a Lot of Important Programs – While the cost is very low, so is the value of the program. Most of the classes are cursory at best and will not prepare you for a career in Computer Graphics unless you are willing to put in extra time to learn on your own, you will probably not succeed in the field."
College Junior,2,"Non- Paying Internships – As far as I know, none of the internships, including this one were for pay. The assignments are interesting and can give a student some experience for their field, but there were no interviews. Candidates were chosen on the basis of portfolios submitted. One was even chosen and had to use software she had not even taken a course for yet. Most of the internships that were offered began after the semester started and were not included with grades."
College Senior,2,"Graduate School – minimal financial aid options available for graduate students.  The cost of graduate school is higher, so there should be more availability of scholarships."
College Senior,2,I live off campus and have an hour commute each day.  Parking availability is slim.
College Freshman,2,"I Don't Know Too Much – I was never one to go out and party, mainly because I am severely skeptical of others intentions and I do not drink whatsoever. But all of the other students seem to know where to go to wet their whistle and cut loose, so I suppose the nightlife is up to par."
College Freshman,2,"Very Average – I don't feel particularly safe at the campus. Especially at nights and living in Arkansas Hall. The place is prone for theft and the campus has been prone to muggings, as well as a few shootings. UPD is often around, yet always seems to arrive too late and is unable to render any assistance beyond ensuring that they will try harder next time."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Been Okay – It's been okay. College is college. I've butted heads with roomates, their boyfriends staying over. Not sleeping, or being able to work. Love the professors, thats about it."
College Senior,2,Improving but Boring! The athletic teams are pretty good but the games can be very boring. Very few school traditions and average to low attendance.
College Senior,2,"Subpar and Mediocre – Most teachers are not very professional, difficult or knowledgeable. A lot of repetitive gen-ed classes and unnecessary requirements."
College Junior,2,Nothing Really to Set ASU Apart – Can't really offer anything to tell you that sets the campus apart from any others.
College Junior,2,"Interesting Computer Graphics Program – The program is interesting but really only glosses over what you need to learn Computer Graphics and Web Design. if you are looking for an in-depth program- this is not the program for you. Many of the courses are on-line, so if you are not a self-starter- this is also not a program that will work for you."
College Freshman,2,"Not the Best Place to Live – The freshman dorms at ASU are nasty. I feel like they are not well kept up and are always junky. The upperclassman dorms are a little better but not much. As soon as I get enough money to move off campus, I will."
College Junior,2,"Less Than up to Par – The computers at ASU are new and in good shape, but the internet connection is terrible. The computers are extremely slow and the servers are often down. There is free printing in the library, but it takes at least 30 minutes to print 1 page. There is often not any computers available at all because there are so few computers compared to the number of students. To get anything done in a timely manner you need your own computer and printer"
Graduate Student,1,"Awful experience, I would suggest students don't depend of this being your only school you apply for or you will be like me and have to wait until next year to apply to another PHD program.  They rush you to complete applications and no follow through.  Not even a letter to state that I wasn't accepted into the school. 
 Thanks ASTATE!!!!"
Graduate Student,1,"Awful, I applied for PHD program in April 2020.   I felt rush by admission representatives to complete application in April.  When app was submitted, I was told decisions will be made August 1st.  Why rush me, if app would be sitting in a file for months and not be seen. It is now August 13, 2020 and I haven't heard back from the school on a decision and registration and payments are due on August 21, 2020.    I called multiple times and have been given the run around for days now and no phone calls returned.  This is unacceptable when people have other options for school."
College Freshman,1,I believe Greek life has a poor impression on youth.
College Sophomore,1,"mold, get ready for mold. oh and faulty elevators that's scare you"
College Sophomore,1,"In the end I just wish I would have picked somewhere else. The classes suck, teachers are rude, advisors try to talk to out of your major, and I've had mold in my dorm all semester but they don't do anything about it. They need to improve a lot of things."
College Freshman,1,the cafeteria is disgusting! I was served a raw piece of frozen chicken! It is the same thing every day!
College Freshman,1,living on campus in a dorm as a freshman is the worst! My room had mold and was beyond dirty. I was later carried to the hospital for the poor conditions
College Junior,1,No help for graduate students
College Freshman,1,"Yeah , its pretty bad to me .Considering that I think I've had them most run-ins with the campus authority. Honestly, I really don't do anything. They just come out of nowhere and start to question me about things."
College Freshman,1,The scrictness on parking is beyond ridiculous. Do your research on where you can or can't park at what time. The policemen give out tickets like candy.
College Senior,1,i have never seen a public transportation on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone complains about this. I lived on campus so it was not a huge deal for me, but It could still be crazy."
College Senior,1,You have to get to campus super early if you want a parking spot.  I really wish they would focus on making more parking spots.
College Junior,1,The Frat houses have alcohol on campus all week long.
College Junior,1,The campus police are far too strict and they blockade what should be access road into and out of campus.
College Senior,1,The fact that a parking permit for the year is $55 is robbery. There are twice as much parking for faculty and visitors than for actually students!!! To make things worse if you park in the parking garage you still have to pay $200+ for a assigned parking space or pay by the hour just to park.
College Junior,1,"We have to pay $55 per year for a parking permit. However, there are not very many free parking spots and the parking garage fees doubled in the last semester alone. I feel if you are already having to pay for a permit, the garage fees should not have went up."
College Senior,1,"I work for the parking department on campus. They are great about giving tickets ($10-$150) and there is little parking up close. They promote walking, lots and lots of walking."
College Sophomore,1,Expensive and there is never a spot. Then you have to make up a spot which results in a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,The University dorms are stinky and old. Need new ones.
College Sophomore,1,"Jonesboro, AR is a dry county and therefore, there are no bars and there is no alcohol sold within the county."
College Sophomore,1,"Trying to find a parking spot is ridiculous at the beginning of a semester, but halfway through people start dropping/skipping class more and it isn't so bad.  Sometimes though, you have to literally follow a student walking to their car so that you can take their spot when they leave."
College Senior,1,"Parking, especially for off-campus students is absolutely terrible. Because of new construction of sorority houses, lots of parking has become inconvenient and further away from central locations of campus. Not to mention, you must drive around for 10-15 minutes to try to find a parking spot."
College Senior,1,The parking is so awful! You have to drive around for atleast 30 minutes to find a parking spot if it's not 8 in the morning.
College Junior,1,The parking areas are so far from any of the buildings you might as well park off campus and walk!!!!!  The only decent area to park is the parking garage and 98% of those spaces are reserved for faculty only.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a major pain. Primarily because of the traffic and general congestion of the colleges location. The main campus road has been closed off indefinitely due to a deal that the campus has made. This has resulted in driving around campus being unnecessarily more difficult, which in turn makes parking like pulling teeth. There are numerous rent-a-cops and cops who are on constant alert for even the most minor parking violation and they will not hesitate to write an outrageous ticket for each infraction. The whole thing is just a fixed system to garner the school more money, and their only solution is to build another layer onto the parking building so that they may have more area to write even more tickets. Parking is by far the worst part of this school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No to this college – Please say NO to this college. I have been in this college for 2 years and believe me the college is all about money. International  admission sucks. They are not at all cooperative. They say something and do something. They will keep mailing you for donations but when it comes to important mails, they are not obliged to do so. I have seen huge bunch of students taking transfer from this college and I will also never recommend this college to anyone."
Recent Alumnus,1,Please No to this college – I have been with Arkanasas College since 2 years. Please say NO to this college. The college is all about money. International admissions sucks. They are not at all cooperative. They say something and do something. I have seen a huge bunch of students taking transfer from Arkansas State University as they are terribly upset. If you are in be ready to take the consequences.
College Freshman,1,"Not Helpful – My experience with finicial aid is dreadful. Anytime I recive emails from them or have to go meet with them I always dread. One because they don't act like they are willing to help you. They act like they are there for the paycheck and that is it. It seems like they care less if you are helped or not. Two, they never know the answer to any question you have. They either have you wait forever or send you all over campus. Finally, they never get back with you like they say they will. They will say they will keep in touch with you when you are the ones who has to keep in touch with them."
College Sophomore,1,"Public Transportation in Jonesboro is very rare. There is one bus stop on campus, but might run once a day. The university does not provide shuttles or other means of transportation."
College Student,1,"You pay 50.00 for a student pass that does nothing you still have to pay everyday to park and its high, and the lots have holes and suck big time!!!!!!"
College Student,1,"IT Very Poor – Network up and down too much, not all computers work in the classrooms. Very poor IT support."
College Student,1,NO CAR – IM JOINING COLLEGE TO IMPROVE MY OVER ALL LIFE SO I CAN GET A DECENT JOB TO GET A LAPTOP AND A CAR
College Junior,1,You pretty much have to blunder your way through financial aid here. There is little to no communication from the financial aid office and you stand a good chance of not getting what you need unless you are persistent in pursuing what you need and calling them constantly. It can be very frustrating. They tell you- we just need this- then guess what?! you need tow other papers next time! They should have a checklist to hand out to students so they know what is required and when.
College Junior,1,"Lousy Grading Standard – ASU has a lousy grading standard. If you have a B it is graded as a 3.0- no matter if it is actually a 3.9. A C is a 2.0, etc. This means that a C can bring your GPA way down and lose an academic scholarship for you, even if your GPA is actually what is needed to keep that scholarship."
College Junior,1,"The only reason they don't have an F is because the President/Cheif/etc. of the Financial aid office has been very, very kind and lenient with me and my scholarship. The rest of his office and staff are terrible. They are disorganized and rude. They could care less if you get yourself into a mess. You can only do so much by yourself without their help to get your mess cleaned up. At some point they need to quit worrying about their issues or whatever they're thinking about and help you out A LITTLE BIT. They weren't even in their office half the time I called. It's ridiculous."
College Junior,1,"This issue is personal for me. I forgot to sign in on my teacher's sign in sheet a few more times than I should have and out of that, I actually was lucky to get a D in her class when I had clearly made a solid B+. I had never had a teacher care for attendance like that one, and I was almost a junior when I had her. So, attendance policy has left a bitter taste in my mouth at ASU. It's so bad that I applied to another school to take corresponding courses so I would not have to take that teacher again to raise my grade."
College Junior,1,School Experiences – I really dont like the campus set up.I came from a school in California and it s step down in every way to me. But its a great place for study only people because very less distractions going on around you.
College Junior,1,The parking is hard to find any where on campus. The best thing that happened to me was that I lived on campus last year and didn't have to find parking nor figure out where I can and cannot park. There are so many rules and they are not willing to explain them when the permit is given. The campus does not offer enough parking for all students.
College Freshman,1,Way Too Much – Arkansas State is one of the most alcoholic schools I can think of.

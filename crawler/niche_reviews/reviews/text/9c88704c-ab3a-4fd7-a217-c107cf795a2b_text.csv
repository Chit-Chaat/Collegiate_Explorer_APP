Sophomore,5,"I love Dean College because they are always looking out for their students. They are dedicated to always doing what's best for us, and have really taken into consideration how the students feel when thinking about going to school still during a pandemic. As a transfer student, I am looking for any money that I can get to help me pay for tuition at Dean. They make me feel comfortable being who I am and have helped me to realize that I can achieve my dreams."
Sophomore,5,So far I really love Dean and how consistent they are with reminders and checking in calls to make sure I am doing well with the inline adjustment.
Freshman,5,"This is my son’s first year at Dean and he loves it and so do I. The food is great and the staff are extremely nice and I do mean all the staff . From the cute cafeteria lady, mail room clerk and the ladies in the financial aid office . You will feel like you are right at home. Thank you all"
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed visiting the campus, and thought the area surrounding the school was wonderful as well. I felt safe in choosing this as the school I wanted to attend, and think it will really make a difference in my life and career."
Niche User,5,I'm in love with what I've seen from their dance program as it is rare to see such diverse styles taught all at one school and with such talented staff.
Freshman,5,"All the professors at Dean College are very kind and genuinely care about each individual student. College is also nice because it is a clean slate and a great opportunity to find out who you are and what you'll want to do with your life. I have met some people in college who don't like it because there's drama but, unfortunately, that is something in life that we may never be able to change. But what really matters is wanted to learn and willing to put in all your effort and dedication into hard work."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Dean College was amazing it was a great school filled with many activities on campus, The faculty and Staff where extremely helpful. Dean College made me feel right at home as soon as i got there. I think the only think i would like to see change is the population of students i would love to see more diversity in this school such as Hispanic and African American students it would make Dean an even better place."
Freshman,5,"I am looking forward to be starting the next four years of my life as an exercise science major and football player at Dean College. Dean College is a small school in the town of Franklin, Massachusetts. The atmosphere and the energy from the people and the student at Dean is mind blowing. They take so much pride in what they do at Dean and make it a priority to make sure you have everything taken care of. Dean is a really great place for me to learn and to continue my passion in football and I'm excited to continue my path with dean. #GoBulldogs"
Sophomore,5,"Dean has a family-like atmosphere and the small school is conducive to a great learning experience. The ""Dean Difference"" shows in the care and concern that each student receives from both their Career and Academic Counselors to the faculty and staff. 

I knew when I took my first tour of the campus that this was the place where I belonged. They truly do meet every student where they are and raise them up to excellence.  It is a private school that isn't hung up on getting the ""perfect student."" Instead, they look at each student as a whole individual, and then they build leaders."
Niche User,5,I love going to Dean College! It has really amazing opportunities to experience the involvement in and outside of campus.
Freshman,5,The faculty and the students here are amazing. I immediately connected with the community on campus.
Niche User,5,I do not attend but I did go on a tour. It is a very Nice campus and I enjoyed the people.  I plan to attend and commit for broadcasting.
Niche User,5,"i'm set to go there in September. The campus is small and comfortable,safe and the people are very friendly."
Freshman,5,I toured this campus and I absolutely fell in love. I will be attending Dean College in the fall of 2018 and it would be nice to get a scholarship to help my family afford it. I am looking forward to what is in store for my future as a bulldog!
Senior,5,"What I love about Dean are the small classes and the ability to get involved in leadership positions in the various clubs and organizations. The teachers try their best to make sure that the students are involved and participating in discussions inside and outside of the classrooms. Due to the fact that Dean is a small school, anyone who wants to get more experience being part of a team or even leading a team has that opportunity to easily get involved and gain that experience. The advice I give to new students is that, you’re experience at Dean is what you make of it; get involved (it’s easier than you think), make new friends (your network of people start with the friends you make in college), and don’t be afraid to make mistakes."
Alum,5,nice small school close to home if I wanted to come home on weekends.  met a lot of great friends there that I am still today friends and in contact with. Small campus offered alot.
Sophomore,5,Dean College has an amazing environment as well as high quality professors. The faculty is amazing as well. Everyone on this campus makes each other feel very welcomed and comfortable.
Niche User,5,We liked the small community and family atmosphere.  The fit is perfect for my daughter.  The professor and faculty know all of the students.
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus and atmosphere. Love the classes and the professors, a great place to learn. The library is my favorite place to go, to relax, study, and even hang out. "
Niche User,5,Dean college has a flexible admission policy.One can get admitted without SAT/TOEFL.Submission of admission materials online is so exciting and reduces the cost of postage.As an international  prospective student Dean is the best option for me.
College Freshman,5,I am new and it been great and everyone helpful.  I could got to my coach or staff with any quesstion.
College Freshman,5,The have great ties to the boston creative community.
College Freshman,5,The professors are all approachable and dedicated to your success.
College Freshman,5,They have a tie to the Kraft family that own the NE patriots and they get you real life experience right out of the gate.
College Freshman,5,The program gives you real life experience right out of the gate.
College Freshman,5,I'm new but it's apparent that Dean prides itself on knowing each student and coaching them to success.
College Senior,5,I would have to say Dean College is a great school if you need smaller classes to focus and most importantly they are very helpful and are ready to help you when you need. The care for our education
College Sophomore,5,My college provides us with all the technology needed for their system. It's compaddible to most computer softwares and they are super simple to use.
College Sophomore,5,My school provided it's students with plenty of oppurinities to work with professionals in the real world. Professors encourage students to strive to be better.
College Sophomore,5,The professor do nothing but try to help their students and succeed with our careers. The professors at my college have taught me different things every time. There's not one professor I can't learn nothing from.
College Sophomore,5,The Career Center is amazing at helping guide you to internships and jobs relating to your Major.  I work in a work study in the Admissions office and I really love it and love giving tours as an Ambassador.
College Sophomore,5,"Academic flexibility is amazing as far as scheduling and moving things around to fit my needs the best, and be able to attend all my groups and meetings too."
College Sophomore,5,"There is an amazing staff to help you with your career goals, internships and guidance at the Career Center."
College Sophomore,5,Everything and everyone at Dean College leads you to many career prospects and want you to get the most out of your time at Dean as a student.  I have been involved in so many clubs and jobs on campus that I get to see how all of the recruiting and admissions departments are the best!
College Sophomore,5,"Arts & Entertainment Business Management is an amazing Major!  It is so interesting and fun to learn.  My concentration is in Dance, so I also get to do my passion in some of my classes.  There is so many opportunities to interact with the Theatre concentration students.  The main professor Joel Thayer is amazing!"
College Sophomore,5,"I have had nothing but amazing experiences at Dean College.  Everyone is extremely helpful.  I recommend the academic coaching at least for your first semester, just to get you organized and get through any anxieties you may be having.  Get involved!  Dean has great clubs, and is partnered with the Kraft Organization, and so many opportunities are available."
College Sophomore,5,I love it and couldn't enjoy it anymore then I already have
College Junior,5,"The theater program at dean is well-connected, and has many dedicated faculty. The teachers are all multi-talented and very dedicated to the program. Sometimes there is a lack of balance between being harsh in a constructive way and giving positive reinforcement, but overall the theater program it is a well-oiled operation"
College Freshman,5,I am learning so much and taking so many classes tat are bettering my education.
College Freshman,5,"Sometimes they make it too easy, but I am happy they are available to help."
Junior,4,"You make your own college experience and I think mine at Dean has been great so far. Although I do recognize Dean's mistakes and hold them accountable for any situation they face, however I personally have had a good experience at Dean."
Freshman,4,So far my experience at Dean College has been excellent! I’ve been welcomed into the school and easily made new friends. All my professors are great to work with and always willing to help a student.
Sophomore,4,"Dean is one of the most unique schools I have ever seen. The teachers and staff always go above and beyond when it comes to helping their students. The food is always super good, and its buffet style so there is always a lot to choose from. The only downside is the cost. While almost every student gets financial aid between 18,000-22,000 for the school to be almost 60,000 a year, it can be a bit too much for the average family. However, the staff is worth every cent!"
Freshman,4,"good school with good academics. amazing arts programs, many options to learn new things. all programs are very well managed and very well organized. classes are fit to your major which is very nice and helpful."
Alum,4,my experience with dean college was fun the experience going there was amazing because it was my actual first 4 year college and meeting new people is the best because there is so many different personalities. what I like about the school was the sports programs traveling to different states playing different teams the butterflies the rush that goes through your body is the best feeling. but what could change is the café it should be open for a long period of ti
Junior,4,"I feel at home at Dean. Being from far away, I love the community that Dean builds and has on campus and with the community in town."
Junior,4,"One thing I enjoy about Dean College is the population, Dean College is highly diverse and you meet a plethora of wonderful individuals. Also, I enjoy how Dean faculties are always willing to help the students or whoever is in need of help. If you need help with an assignment there is always somewhere available to assist you."
Freshman,4,"Dean College is a great school, it is basically impossible to fail. Dean offers so many resources  and free tutoring/help sessions. The food in the dining hall is delicious and offers lots of healthy options for everyone. (Vegans, Vegetarians, gluten free, meat eaters ect.)
 
      There is NO Greek life on campus, not much of a party scene here unless you have friends who live in the condos or have a car. Dean has many study abroad options with access to over 50+ destinations a student can travel to.  I wish Dean had a pool or foreign language classes (Spanish,french, german,latin)"
Freshman,4,I really love how small Dean College is. It is very much like a small community and makes me feel like I have my very own family here at my school. The students and the staff here are incredibly nice and treat me very well. Another thing I love about going to school here at Dean College is the cleanliness of the college. The staff work very hard to keep everything very clean and it really shows. The campus is beautiful.
Freshman,4,Dean College is a great college to break yourself into the new environment with.  The teachers and faculty at the college make It a point to learn about you and where you are from.  They also make sure that you can succeed in their classes.
Freshman,4,"Dean itself isn’t a bad school, just a small school trying to make its name. However, for me, getting the money to go to this school has been more than difficult, and I have spent all of Christmas break stressing over school rather than having an actual break. I think the financial aid could do better."
Freshman,4,"It's great for theater. Beautiful campus. Supposedly, freshmen can't be commuters, but they're not too strict about it, which is great because I couldn't afford to live on campus. They have great food here too. They could do a better job of not treating us like babies; for some reason, attendance is part of our grade for some classes. Obviously, if you're not showing up to class after a few weeks, the class should be dropped from your schedule, but if you don't come to class maybe two times, I don't see how that could be a big deal. Multiple professors have scolded kids for showing up late or not coming to class as often as they would like, and I understand that it's a smaller school, so it's more noticeable, but it's college. The only other thing is that they are so strict about parties. I'm not even a big party enthusiast, but I understand that that is a big part in a college student's experiences."
Alum,4,A very small campus but a great place to make life long friends from all over the world. The classes were clean and up to date. the Library is great as well as the tutors. The price is kind of expensive.
Niche User,4,I thought that the student body was friendly and welcoming. I loved the size of the dorm rooms as well. I found it beneficial how close the college was to stores and restaurants throughout the community. Over all I think that the campus is beautiful. 
College Freshman,4,I have not done yet.
College Freshman,4,still to soon to say first year here.
College Sophomore,4,My school has given me ample opportunities to reach out to anyone if I ever needed help. But time management has never been a problem.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of the professors in the program in which I am in are great about giving us after-Dean opportunities. They are constantly posting jobs both locally and nationally.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of the professors in the program in which I am in are truly helpful with after-Dean opportunities. They are constantly posting jobs both locally and nationally.
College Sophomore,4,"I really like how the classes are small. This gives  me a chance to get to know the professor on a personal level, this way I feel like they care more about my success."
College Senior,4,Prodessor help you at anytime you need. It's very hands on
College Sophomore,4,The best experiences I had were at this school and I wouldn't want to do it over again. This college gave me the ambition to do better and the desire to explore more. They taught me how to make anything into a business you just need to have an idea.
College Sophomore,4,When picking for my classes my counselor did her best to accommodate my requests. She did her best to give student a schedule that worked for them.
College Sophomore,4,I like how my school informed me on important dates i needed to attend to. They also advise you about things when they happen.
College Sophomore,4,"I love how my school thinks a lot about their students. They have a lot of good resources like a library, computers and laptops you can check out. My school sees our needs as well as they can."
College Sophomore,4,Not to many people would think of my major as I good career. But if you love it you would enjoy it
College Junior,4,My Advisor has been very helpful and makes sure my schedule works exactly how i need it to.
College Junior,4,i had one on-line course. I had no issues with it.
College Junior,4,"Dean has great services for its students.   There is the learning center, tutors and counseling.  Every student has access to help."
College Junior,4,Dean offers tons of job internships. Dean has a relationship with Kraft Foods and Patriots Stadium.
College Junior,4,My experience has been great so far.  The professors are approachable and helpful.
College Junior,4,I'm working towards my General Studies degree.  The school offers many internships and job opportunties
College Junior,4,Dean is a great school. Its a small school so the teachers know you and are there to help you.
College Junior,4,It's my first year.  At first I thought that the course work would be overwhelming.  The professors and their knowledge of the subject made it less overwhelming.  A lot of the material are relevant to the modern world will prove useful when I graduate.
College Junior,4,It's small enough that I can commute home ever night but still be able to feel connected to the students that live on campus.
College Senior,4,I am a dance major at Dean College. I am earning my Bachelor Arts which allows me to be able to explore more than just dance. There are many internships that we can do once we are a sophomore. I have never been to Massachusetts for dance but I have always heard amazing things. I went to an Greater Hartford of the Performing Arts Academy for high school and I feel that my knowledge for dance was better than at Dean College. I did get to learn how to be on my own and how to socialize with other dancers who are aiming for the same goal as me.
College Freshman,4,"As a freshmen, I can already see the amount of opportunities Dean will open up for me."
College Sophomore,4,I look forward to participating in my internship at my school. I'm sure it will advance my career prospects.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of opportunities to work in different aspects of my major program. Staff is always helpful in offering advice too.
College Sophomore,4,The programs offered are great.
College Freshman,4,If you want to take advantage of some of the internships established (like with the Kraft Group at Foxboro) it's amazing. But you have to apply yourself.
College Freshman,4,"As a business major, there are a number of great opportunities for internships in this field.  I hope I can take advantage of this."
College Freshman,4,"It was a little diffcult to get used to such a small campus community since I grew up in the city, but the DEAN does a decent job offering extra curricular activities.  I wish they offered intramural athletics for students who aren't elite athletes but want an athletic experience. 

Food is good, dorms good, easy to access transportation to Boston and surrounding towns. 

Having an academic coach to keep me on track with my academics has made a huge difference. I have gone from almost not graduating high school to a solid B and sometimes A student in all of my classes.  For students who have different learning styles, there's none better than DEAN."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my school because it is diverse and small. The classroom sizes are not too big where I can not focus. Also the atmosphere is always fun, either it is basketball game or football game."
College Freshman,4,"I have not actually attend college yet. The move in date is September 7. I have to gain 12,000 more dollars. My fasa, Basketball and Presidential scholarship only cover up 38,000. I am trying to come up with the rest so I can farther my education and basketball career."
College Freshman,4,I really love being at Dean. All the staff and professors are really nice. The professors try to do the best they can do so that each student will succeed. The President of the school makes sure the property is kept really nice. There are a lot of activities students can participate in. if a student does not get involved they will not a good time at school so make sure they do whatever they do to have fun.
College Freshman,4,Class options are flexible in terms of scheduling and class selection.  Staff is overall very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Professors at Dean typically do their jobs well and class sizes are small.  There are plenty of courses to choose from, and I have had an overall positive experience."
College Freshman,4,"The diverse student body is typically very accepting and friendly to everyone in the Dean community.  I was surprised to see how nice people on campus are, as compared to other schools."
College Freshman,4,"The value of my education seems to be worth the tuition I pay, with the exception of a couple classes I am currently taking. The financial aid office has been helpful with any inquiries."
College Freshman,4,"As a dance major, the dance classes are very challenging and constantly push me to handle more of a workload that I ever have before.  However, the workload or core classes are very easy and I do not gain much from them.  The staff is, for the most part, very helpful.  There are many resources to find internship and job opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"At Dean College, I can typically meet with anyone at any office in a timely manner.  I have taken full advantage of the help that my advisors, financial aid office, library, and athletic coaches offer."
College Junior,4,It has been very good not that bad i enjoyed my first semester.
College Senior,4,You meet alot of people really quick.
College Senior,4,They put alot of thought and effort into their staff. But their are some that should probably not be their anymore.
College Senior,4,I am not a apart of any athletics.
College Freshman,4,"You have plenty of shows to be in. You get an internship in you senior year and have to complete senior seminar as well. As a dance major in my school, we tend to have more classes per semester than the average student."
College Freshman,4,"We as a student body are very diverse. A typical student at my school goes to every class, is very friendly, smart, and is involved in a lot of school activities. We all come from different places, have different economic statuses, and worship different religions but still manage to get along very well."
College Sophomore,4,"Dean has a great atmosphere, it makes me smile as I walk through the campus especially when it is a nice day out. The dance program is also unlike most dance programs because it not only has ballet and modern but also jazz, tap, hip hop and contemporary. Dean also gives us master classes where choreographers from all over the world come and teach. Dean is just a happy place to be and is helping me grow as a person and dancer."
College Sophomore,4,"Dean College is definitely the right choice for me. I have not only gotten better as a dancer but I have made some friendships I will keep forever. One great memory from Dean was last year my roommate won a contest as Dean and we got to go to the So You Think You Can Dance tour, it was amazing and we had great seats."
Freshman,2,Not coming back after first year. Lots of weird people and everybody goes home on the weekends. The campus is too small to do anything and you end up staying in your dorm all day after you finish your classes. Only positive way to experience the school is by commuting.
Freshman,2,"its a small school where there is nothing to do on or off campus. the theatre department is okay but its not a place where you can make connections anywhere outside of New England. the Academic classes are easy enough that you can miss four classes in a row, come back on the day of the test and get a 94%. the kids all act like they are still in high school and its so small that when something happens everyone know about it. Campus safety makes you feel like you're a 7th grader, so if you are looking for a school to baby you and make you feel like a middle schooler this is the school for you."
Freshman,2,"Small community.  Pretty Good food.  Not very much to do on campus or off.  Lacks convenient shopping within walking distance.  Students generally are relatively apathetic, and Disrespectful to Professors.  The workload is pretty light.  Education, at least in Freshman year, is of pretty low value.  Decent amount of support for students.  Students and faculty are friendly for the most part.  Very Safe.  Limited selection of courses and courses can be difficult to get into.  In my opinion, not worth the cost."
Sophomore,2,"Not worth the money. It's a school mainly for people who aren't serious about their education. They will literally take anyone (they will pay you to come here!) The food is dull and the dorms are worse. Social life isn't great since most people just stay in their rooms. Don't expect Greek Life or parties, instead expect obnoxious students and a miserable college experience."
College Junior,2,The options for testing careers at Dean are very limited.
College Freshman,2,"This school cost way too much. I feel like most of my money is going to the workers who keep the grass looking nice and pretty. In the winter time, there was no heat in my room and the water was cold most of the time. We only have one dinning hall that gives very limited options and the other places you have to pay. And there are not enough dorms for everyone to be comfortable."
College Sophomore,2,i do not take online courses
College Senior,2,"Although I love it here and I definitely am getting a good education, I think I am paying much more than I should be. The dance training is amazing, however the academic classes are not the best. The quality of the dining center is also poor. My family is in a bad financial state, and we are not getting the amount of financial aid that we should be getting."
College Senior,2,"The education I was getting was pretty good for what I was paying, but tuition was still very high for this out of state student. Financial aid for international students was not so good either."
College Sophomore,2,Dance and Communications Focus – Dean seems to have a main body of Dance and Communications majors. The only reason it's still a good school for other students is because it is mainly an associate's/bachelor's school. Dance and Communications are its focused majors.
College Senior,2,Dean College is expensive for it being a private school that is in a quiet location. The financial aid and scholarships are accessible to students. The biggest problem is the financial aid office. They are disorganized and rude. There have been confusion with payments and problems with contacting the office. I have heard the same reviews from multiple students and parents.
College Senior,2,"Improvement Needed – Dean College is very expensive and for the amount of money we pay we should get more from the school. The Dance department doesnt have the proper rooms for dance classes and Our stage is not for performances. The school needs to find ways to make the school work for both the dance, theater and other majors who have to perform in some type of way , including getting bigger fields for our football and soccer players."
Senior,1,"This place does not worth the price tag , students get beaten up the college does 
nothing to help them  in fact I believe that as soon as they receive your tuition they just want to get rid of you. The college hired a evil student conduct director who uses gang members to attack and beat there disabled students ,after the college cashes your check you are history don’t come here this is an evil  place. Most students after leaving Dean college 
becomes fearful  and withdrawn .  I am not asking the public to believe me do your own investigation."
Freshman,1,Not at all what admissions makes you think it is. Not worth the high price tag at all. Supposedly friendly and diverse and accepting but is not any of those things. Have been made fun of for my looks and skin color. No effort made by advisors or Res Lfe to make sure kids are adjusting and included. Very disappointing!
Freshman,1,"Crazy expensive and you're literally paying campus security to drive around on their golf cart because this school is too lazy to have blue lights on their campus. In math class you have to take as a freshman you learn how to use a ruler and how to tip at restaurant.. this is college right? They show you dorms you will never live in on the tour and put you in these small nasty rooms instead. This school is money hungry for everything. Not to mention how rude everyone is including students and staff. Terrible food, if you like eating pizza or pasta with watery marinara sauce then good for you. Oh and the dining hall closes mad early so have fun going to boomers for over priced rude ass people for some food. Once you even mention you want to transfer the staff looks at you and laughs and doesn't help you whatsoever. Not to mention a girl got rapped last week and its been over a week, still enrolled playing baseball like nothing happened. If you are not a dance major DO NOT COME HERE"
Freshman,1,"i honestly have never experienced something as bad as this,absolutely no night life, campus safety treats you like your in middle school and classes are full of delinquent football players. if you're not an athlete or dancer they don't care. it is WAY over priced. Not to mention there is zero to do on campus, you go to class then go back to bed... everyday."
College Junior,1,It is very expensive to attend that school
College Freshman,1,This place is overpriced and just an awful school 
College Senior,1,Not So Happy – The school financially is not so good and the staff could talk to parents and students with a little more respect

Junior,5,"Whats really great about kettering is that when youre kind of burnt out from school, you get to go back to work, and vise visa. The co-op experience is non-comparable to other schools, being able to work in your field of study while going to school is an incredible advantage to your education."

The co-op experience is non-comparable to other schools, being able to work in your field of study while going to school is an incredible advantage to your education."
Freshman,5,"Being at a small school can seem like it will not have a lot to offer, but Kettering is not like that. There are so many different clubs to join, student life organizations, Greek organizations, and intramural sports to play. The small class sizes help with the shortened semesters and create a more personal feel and connect with the professors and faculty. Everyone there is really focused on your success."
Freshman,5,"Although I am only a freshmen, I can say proudly that Kettering University is an excellent learning establishment. The university's co-op program is like no other university in that it gives you 4 years of work experience in your major by the time you graduate. In addition to the co - op program, the university also has excellent professors that care about your learning experience. The class sizes are also very small which makes the learning experience very nice."
Freshman,5,"Kettering is a great place. It has a unique curriculum that allows students to use what they learn in class through co-op jobs, switching between work and schooling every three semesters. The people here are also amazing. The upperclassmen have been very useful and have made orientation very fun. Everyone in my unit is awesome and I can't wait to spend more time with them. I haven't even started class yet and I already know that picking Kettering was the right choice for me."
Sophomore,5,"Kettering University has been an excellent university to attend. Their co-op program is unbeatable and will help and graduate student to excel immensely in life. The opportunity to get the job experience AND the education is hands down one of the best offered in the nation. The athletics at the school is non-existent, other than intramural sports."
Freshman,5,"Kettering has a wonderful campus. Their engineering labs are extraordinary, and all of the extra-curricular activities that are available blow me away!"
Niche User,5,"I like the opportunities it brings for student, however, I wish the university was more diverse and accessible to other students including those who can't afford the tuition."
Sophomore,5,"I have dreamed of going to Kettering University all my life. It's unique blend of a Co-Op internship (which is paid btw) and heavily lab based classes give students a break from the traditional lecture halls most campuses see. Finishing off our four year degrees in two years, and being able to also graduate with two years of engineering/science/business experience sets us apart for the rest of the world."
Senior,5,Kettering University challenges you while preparing you for you future. It's in depth courses and it co-op program give you experience to you your whole life.
Junior,5,"The most notable thing about Kettering University is the co-op program. With no time off, students have three months of in-class time, after which they go to a co-op, where they work real-life jobs with real-life companies. This setup rotates continually until the student graduates with his/her degree."
Sophomore,5,"Kettering University is a great place to be. Students, staff, and faculty all share the same mission to learn and succeed. Their unrivaled Co-op program allows students to gain on the job experience throughout all 4+ years of school. Return on investment is incredible with a 99% placement rate."
Freshman,5,Their Co op program allows you to graduate with up to 2 1/2 years of experience in your field of study
Senior,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the co-op program. It is great to be able to work full time while earning your degree, without work and school overlapping. I wish that tuition was lower, but the co-op program attempts to offset the high cost. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get a straight answer from financial aid or student accounts regarding your awards and payments. The university spends a lot of time, money, and energy on recruiting potential students; however, for currently enrolled students it is difficult to get support from the university in a number of things regarding student life (starting a new club/organization, hosting an event, etc.)."
Junior,5,"I have had great experiences with almost all of my classes and professors, and the best part is that I get to work a co-op job 6 months out of the year to gain experience and help pay for school. The biggest downside to Kettering is its location in Flint, Michigan where you need to be careful in order to stay safe."
Niche User,5,"I like Kettering University because of the co-op program that the offer and its a private college as well, and therefore, a smaller campus and more one-on-one."
Niche User,5,The atmosphere is fantastic! A small amount of majors meaning great focus on those few majors. No teachers assistances just professors. Fantastic Co-op opportunity!
Freshman,5,This is the most unique college cause of the curriculum it follows specially the co-op here is just amazing. small campus enables us to know each and every one of our batch mates. The profs r awesome and so is everything else.
Alum,5,"If you're a technically-minded person who likes to get your hands dirty and wants to pursue a career Engineering, Kettering is definitely the place for you.  The co-op program is unrivaled at other universities and the school does everything possible to help you achieve your personal and professional goals.  The campus is on the smaller side compared to larger public universities, but I enjoyed having a smaller student body, as it allowed for lower student-to-professor ratios and an environment where you got the chance to know most of your classmates.  Additionally, the school has done a lot in recent years to upgrade and modernize the campus and facilities.  I'd recommend the school with absolutely zero reservation."
Junior,5,"I love Kettering University because you feel like not just another student, but one that is recognized by name. All of the professors are passionate about what they teach- and it shows. They are kind, knowledgeable, and want you to succeed. I am known by name when I pass professors on campus, and you really feel looked after and motivated. I have learned so much from my classes, and I might even pursue my masters degree through Kettering."
Senior,5,"Kettering University is challenging in some ways, however the lessons learned during college is well worth it. The faculty here are amazing to work with and the Co-op program is amazing!"
Sophomore,5,Everyone at Kettering wants to help you achieve your goals. The professors are always available to give extra help with any questions on the material. The small classes sizes allow you to ask more questions during class. Tutoring is offered everyday and studying is required in order to succeed.
Sophomore,5,great place to go to college worth every penny. It may seem like a huge undertaking to go into so much student loans but the experience you gain from the co-op puts kettering students so far ahead.
Junior,5,"Great school. Small classes taught by professors with years of industry experience. Outside of class, the co-op experience gives the the chance to apply what you are learning, and also supplement what you have learned by gaining the industry experience."
Freshman,5,So far Kettering is great.  I like the variety of clubs that are available.  The students are wonderful and very knowledgeable. The dorms are small but I don't spend a lot of time in there except to sleep or study for test.  Professors are very knowledgeable and there to help when needed.  What a great University!
Freshman,5,"Kettering is not the number one party college in America. Nor is it a household name. But it is a well known name in the industry. Kettering students are known to have standards, values, and experience that cannot be found elsewhere. The reason for this is Kettering's co-op program, which is an unbeatable opportunity. The Kettering campus currently is aging, but new building are being built. The food service is not super, do to an awful contract with the company suduxco. The school does not really have any sports teams per say, but does offer intermerial sports which can be fun. "
College Student,5,The Co-Op program provides great internship opportunities for all students. There are also some on campus jobs that can be found and applied for but there are only so many. Our Co-op advisors help in the beginning and when if a student decides to change companies they will help you out between the job fairs that come to campus.
College Student,5,"Greek life at Kettering Univeristy is a major part of campus. Considering the social atmosphere of campus, most of the students are greek.  There is only 3 sororities on campus due to the ratio of guys to girls. Since Kettering is located in Flint, Michigan they play a major role in helping the community to turn around and look and become great again. Non-Greeks don't act any different towards Greeks. The non-greeks are invited to the same things greeks are so it is a nice balance and everyone can join in."
College Student,5,"Kettering has an amazing Co-op program which gets you right into the field and let's you develope skills you need. This helps with finding a job after graduation along with the fact that you can say that you have 2.5 years of real world experience. Super high hire rate, I think it's around 90+%."
College Student,5,The resident hall is a great place to grow and meet new people during Freshman year. I am actually becoming a Resident Assistant to continue the growth of this community.
College Student,5,"I love this school, from the small size to its direct focus on STEM and Business. The professors are great, I've had professor who wasn't the best, but it's a needle in a haystack. The co-op program is great and if you plan on getting into the automotive field, there really isn't a much better place than Kettering, formerly General Motors Institute."
College Student,5,I believe we are ranked in the top for Greek Societies on college campuses. They are active in the Flint area and are always working on some sort of community service.
College Student,5,Kettering University has a great set of professors that are experts in their fields. They care about teaching you the information needed in the short 11 week terms.
College Junior,5,"There is no better program in the country than Kettering's co-op program. You start in a co-op job from your very first freshman term (I was hired before I even started school). Kettering also has one of the highest job placement rates for their students, post graduation. The co-op program is second to none, and provides invaluable job experience."
College Senior,5,"I still have 2 terms left of classes, and my co-op company is already beginning to prepare an offer letter for me."
College Senior,5,"This is, by far, the best university that I have taken classes at. There are a few professors which you should do your best to avoid, but overall the professors are all very helpful and willing do meet or do anything they can to help you out."
College Senior,5,"I LOVE Kettering. I transferred to Kettering from Arizona State University, and the way that Kettering is set up is extremely more effective and personable than a traditional university. The way that Kettering alternates between work and school terms is great and provides invaluable on the job work experience so that you graduate already having professional experience in your field of choice."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone here has a co-op. If you work somewhere for four years and they don't offer you a job, you wouldn't get one anywhere else either."
College Freshman,5,"Best College Reviews ranked Kettering second in their ""50 Best Colleges for Greek Life"". The Greek community is large and involved throughout the campus."
College Freshman,5,"If I wanted to go to a big school, I would have. Kettering is perfect for me and I have never regretted my decision."
College Freshman,5,"the co-op program is a great idea, and lets us get experience before we graduate."
College Freshman,5,I love kettering. they care about your education and do everything they can to make you successful.
College Freshman,5,"Kettering is currently ranked 12th in the nation for ROI, so the degree is very fulfilling. Kettering's co-op program really does take you further than most other schools. You will undoubtedly graduate with a job."
College Freshman,5,Greater than 50% of students go Greek. You almost need to at Kettering because with Greek life there is also much support for classes and such.
College Freshman,5,"Kettering University has the best Greek Life that I have heard or seen of any university. Hazing does not exist to my knowledge. There is a variety of houses with different criteria to join(GPA/pledging/etc.) and different values. I am a member of a more academically focused house on campus and have personally discovered the benefit of ""going greek"". Community involvement is very important to most of the houses - whether it be community service or philanthropy to a charity of their choosing. Greek students generally are discriminated as party animals, and although that may be true for a select few, the demanding courseload discourages that. 48% of students at Kettering University are Greek. Most live off campus, in their chapter house, or on their own. A couple Greek houses are actually apartment buildings leased from an apartment complex across the street from the university. On average, students who are Greek have a higher GPA than their non-Greek counterparts. There are Greek houses that allow alcohol consumption on the premises as well as parties, and there are more refined houses that are ""dry."""
College Student,5,"About 60% of students are Greek, so you could say that Greek life is very prominent here"
College Student,5,"Nobody really cares, we're all in this together so we might as well be nice"
College Student,5,"Being in Flint, MI, security is taken very seriously"
College Student,5,"Very prominent on campus, very involved"
College Student,5,"You get a co-op from the start, 98% employment after school"
College Student,5,My co-op experience has been amazing. I was put with an awesome group of people that are developing me professionally. The entire department knows me quite well and me them. I am almost sad I have to go to college which is the only reason I am in the position I am today.
Recent Alumnus,5,I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Kettering University offers so much for being such a small school. It's co-op program is something that just can't be matched by any other university in the country.
College Freshman,5,"Getting into the program was easy, advisers are more than willing to help answer any questions which you may have."
College Freshman,5,"The greek life on campus is very active.  There are many fraternities, one of which I am part of. PI KAPPA ALPHA"
College Freshman,5,"The coop program at Kettering is the absolute best, you're basically guaranteed a job out of college and you're working for a couple years while going through college."
College Student,5,"3 Months on, 3 months off. Payed. You get weekends and our an actual employee of your Co-Op, thus I get vacation time. And real world experience."
College Freshman,5,"Its the only way to go! I love it! Kettering is different because being greek can make it much easier at school. They have old tests, books, and people who have already taken the courses. As a freshman check out as many houses as possible!!"
College Freshman,5,YOU CAN'T BEAT THE WORK EXPERIENCE. School is not bad because they do try to relate it to what you do at work and it actually proves to be helpful often.
College Sophomore,5,Student life has a lot to offer
College Sophomore,5,The most active people on campus are are greek the greeks are the ones who are the go getters
Sophomore,4,Kettering University is an amazing university for any kind of STEM field it combines the learning of a university with the experience of a job. The resources are there academically to keep your grades up. The professors are mostly good with a few exceptions like at any school. I'm so happy that I've gone to Kettering i wouldn't change this experience for any other school.
Freshman,4,"Kettering University is a really good university. I liked the staff, the other students, as well as the campus layout."
Niche User,4,"Kettering University prepares students for lives of extraordinary leadership and service by linking transformative experiential learning opportunities to rigorous academic programs in engineering, science, mathematics, and business."
Senior,4,Kettering has allowed me to get a jump on the actual industry that I will be working my career in. It is an extremely unique program where I have been able to learn and also learn to apply in a practical way.
Sophomore,4,"Kettering University has given me opportunities that would not have presented themselves with other Universities. Will small class sizes and immediate job experience, I have made connections with my peers as well as my professors. Kettering truly gets you prepared for your future without cutting corners. It is fast paced and intense but shows you what it takes to be a contribution to your community in more than one way."
Junior,4,"The professors at Kettering are rough, but overall a good school.  I would highly recommend joining the Kettering Ultimate Frisbee team."
Freshman,4,"Very unique program with Co-op education. Getting on the job work experience is something I feel any university should have students pursue and Kettering has that engrained in their legacy. However while the campus itself is pretty safe and modern, it is located in the middle of Flint, which isn’t the best area to be around."
Junior,4,"Kettering University enhances a student's experience through its work study course curriculum. The academic experience is one of rigger and true character development, however, is not unfair in what it asks. The ease of co-op (work study) attainment and execution is unmatched by most other universities, especially at this tuition rate. My only gripe with Kettering University is their governing. Kettering University spends a large portion of their funding on gaining new students, but tends to forget about its current students. Kettering University's president and governing figures do not regularly demonstrate the desire to listen and improve the campus based on current student's wants and needs. Although I do not feel I have any voice in what happens to campus policies, I do feel as though my degree and academic experience will be a great return on investment."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the school is pretty good. The fact that there is a co-op program is pretty much the only reason people attend this school. Many professors simply do not care about you or are barely willing to help. In addition, it is located in Flint making safety somewhat of a concern."
Senior,4,I really Enjoy this school and it is a great way to get into Engineering and have a incredible stable job once you get out. Although the dorm life and local city are not the greatest there is still plenty of fun to be had in the Flint area and it is not a big party school because of the high workload.
Senior,4,"Kettering University is specially good when it comes to job readiness. There Co-op program is one of the things that puts this school over the top, students gain experience while also earning a paycheck."
Sophomore,4,"Very close community, I know at least one person everywhere I go. Small campus that is safe and easy to navigate. Most professors want to help you, though some are not good at teaching. Classes aren't that hard if you go to them and pay attention. Lots of clubs and sports to get involved in as much/little as you want. You have to live in the dorms your first year attending."
Freshman,4,"It is very different from your typical college/university experience, but it basically guarantees you a job in your preferred career."
Junior,4,Very nice and helpful professors. With a lot of knowledgeable people all willing to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The school has a great program that I have come to find very useful for my experience.  The only difficulty is having shorter school terms which can cause a lot of stress due to constant studying and homework, but the school is preparing me for the future and giving me a way to do so during the school year."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, a great school due to Kettering's unique co-op program, along with awesome professors and courses that encourage students to succeed. The return on the investment is quite high, if not one of the highest in the nation, even though the tuition is quite expensive. The campus is based in Flint, MI, which is not the highest quality location. Though, the staff at Kettering do their best to make it extremely safe. The actual dorms on campus are nice (a fridge and microwave are included in each room), but the food isn't the best. 

Kettering is a great school for any engineering students who are willing to exceed in a rigorous, hands on environment. The semester moves quickly because each term is 10 weeks long, as opposed to the regular 15 week semester.

If you are a non-engineering major and/or a chemical engineering major it can be extremely difficult to find a co-op unless you have connections."
Senior,4,"Kettering has amazing professors and the work term opportunities has been a very good learning experience. However, the co-op department is lacking in terms of caring about their students, listening to their students, and being professional."
Junior,4,"The reputation of Kettering University precedes it. Whenever my college comes up in conversation, people are impressed with my dedication to an accelerated engineering college. In all honesty, they should be, it is difficult, but worth it. With the high level of academics in the STEM field and the hands-on work experience half of the year, it is a top-of-the-line educational experience!"
Senior,4,"Many of the professors wanted to see students succeed. Some of the professors were only there to collect a paycheck and do research, but they were few and far between. Administration staff was moody and temperamental every time I had to visit them.
The buildings were older, but Kettering constantly tries and updates their equipment to meet industry standards. Sure, I wasn't testing on the latest graphics cards, but for what I needed, it was sufficient.
Intramural sports and Greek Life were a fantastic way to connect with other students on campus.
The part of Flint that Kettering is in isn't the best part, but it's Flint - what are you going to expect? There's a Flint PD substation across the street from the main campus building so that offered more of a sense of security."
Sophomore,4,Kettering University is an excellent engineering school. The faculty are very knowledgeable and there are many opportunities outside of class to complement the curriculum. What probably sets Kettering the most apart from other engineering universities is its integrated co-op program. Students alternate between 3 month academic and 3 month co-op terms year-round. This work experience has helped me in applying my studies and made class more interesting since I am learning what I have already/will soon be using at my job. The work experience is an incredibly valuable asset and gives Kettering graduates a jump-start to their career right out of college.
Graduate Student,4,"Academically, the curriculum is challenging; however, it is of relevance to propel students like me to learn the real-world situational challenges and how to deal with them."
Senior,4,The absolute best thing about Kettering is the co-op program. This is the reason most students attend the university as it is very hard to beat. The value out of this program is rivaled by only a few universities in the country.
Junior,4,I really like how much I learn and the co-op opportunities. I wouldn't change much about it except the price to attend.
Sophomore,4,Kettering is a fantastic University and program to be a part of as a college student interested in  any STEM related degree. Their Co-op program is second to none in the connections they have as well as the meaningful and powerful experience one gains from attending this university. Finding a job after graduation is all but too easy because of the 2.5 years of experience already under your belt. Overall great school but the people who go here are not always the most exciting or diverse.
Junior,4,"What I like about Kettering University is its emersive academic system.  KU based its educational philosophy on a dense in classroom study for 3 months, then 3 months at a co-op of your choice. The overall experience that you gain from this University  is by far one of the best schools for engineering students."
Sophomore,4,"Curriculum isn't as difficult as expected - just compacted. Professors are average, but you can get close with them as the school is small, which creates a good sense of community. The closeness allows for a level of safety that Flint in itself make not make you feel, but it is a great city with a lot to offer when you're done studying. Kettering's food isn't exceptional, but there are a lot of good places to eat close to campus. Greek life is a massive part of campus life, but not anything like the stereotypical Greek life. Definitely would recommend as it increases involvement and social life. Greek life is the focal point of the party scene, which is much more exciting than anyone would expect. Overall, a great school with a lot of opportunities both before and after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"Greek life is pretty fun, teachers really care about how well you learn material. The co-op program is a great way to offset the cost as well as get on the job experience."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the co-op opportunity and real-world experience obtained from working in the field during my schooling. Understand the responsibility of a full-time employee is very beneficial.
Sophomore,4,It’s a great place to get an excellent education and also gets you great hands on learning. It’s the best of both worlds.
Freshman,4,"Kettering University is a great school. The co-op program is the main draw for the majority of students, and with good reason. You are able to go to school and work in the real world. The way our schedule works, you are in school for  3 months and then you work for 3 months, go to school 3, work 3. We get breaks for Summer and Winter just like everyone else but we are also getting work experience. We also go right into the classes you will need for your degree and skip over a lot of the gen ed classes. There is also a really good system set up for tutoring. The food is pretty good and you can use your meal exchange at the Einsteins across the street. There are a massive amount of clubs, but there some really cool ones. Like you can get certified for scuba diving. There are a lot of intramural sports but no official teams (it's a nerdy school, what do you expect). The dorms are nice and you have more space than you would expect, and campus safety is always on duty."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my first semester at Kettering University was very challenging academically, but I was exposed to many different opportunities such as Greek life, intramural sports, and other clubs."
Niche User,4,"Kettering is located in Flint, MI.  It is a pretty small University, but still offers a very great education. The dorms are maybe a little smaller than your average University, but with their CO-OP engineering program, you won't be in your dorms for that long."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student to Kettering from a community college, and haven't found the classes to be that challenging. The challenging part is that they overload you with 16-20 credits in a 11 week semester, and that is what makes the experience more difficult than other schools. Personally, since I have always had to have a job while attending the community college, I was use to this stress so this hasn't been difficult. I have found that many of the professor are much more arrogant than my professors at the community college (even though all the professors I had at the community college were also PhD) making communication or asking for help much more difficult. Kettering has a chip on its shoulder for being the best of the best, but what really makes Kettering a good school is their co-op experience. The co-op experience is great at Kettering and the students are usually paid very well, typically above $14 dollars an hour. "
College Student,4,There is no varsity sports at kettering but intramurals are really nice and fun.
College Student,4,I wouldn't trade my kettering experience for anything!
College Senior,4,The Kettering experience is something not to pass up if given the opportunity. It is one of the best engineering schools in the country.
College Senior,4,"Kettering University is a great school overall but it is far from perfect. 

The best thing about it is the co-op experience. Not only do you gain job experience, but you are able to start networking with colleagues and other individuals. The relationship with employers is already there before you are hired on full-time. 

One of the bad things about Kettering is the work load your classes expect of you. It is a typical (and sometimes more difficult) engineering curriculum except it is packed into only 10 weeks per semester as opposed to 16 weeks at another University. The work load can sometimes leave you feeling depressed and anxious since you are required to manage your time and activities at a very fast rate."
College Student,4,Some professors are outstanding while others need some work. They all are experts in their fields so they know what they are teaching well but their teaching styles and personality may not fit what the new generations are looking for in a professor. They all want their students to succeed. There are many different types of classes offered for all majors available.
College Student,4,"Campus safety can be seen anywhere on campus. They are always around and we have stations around campus that you can presh the blue button and they will show up. Even though Kettering is located in Flint, Michigan it is safe on campus and the blocks around campus."
College Student,4,The dorms are very spacious and your suitemate can be closed out if you do not get along or need just need some privacy. It is nice to get to know everyone on all the floors during orientation by the units. There is also many opportunities to have a good time from ice cream socials to movie nights there is something different each week. The only problem I had was the wifi. Since the building is all brick the wifi is only accessible in the speciified unit rooms.
College Student,4,"Kettering University is a wonderful school! The classes you take prepare you for your co-op experiences in your designated fields. The co-op experience has been by far the greatest thing that I've experienced. It lets me experience what I will do in the future with my degree once I graduate. Also with the co-op experience it allows me to manage my money, gain responsibilities living on my own, and gain responsibilities within the company I work for."
College Student,4,I love the professors here at Kettering. They treat you like a person and the small class sizes allow you to learn in a welcoming environment. Definitely well-versed in their material and willing to take time out of their day for your well-being.
College Student,4,The campus feels completely safe. There is a small police station near campus and the campus is well lit at night. It also has cameras and security in many places.
College Student,4,"I did not go Greek, but they play a very important role. They participate in the community a lot. Kettering is in Flint, Michigan and both Kettering and the fraternities/ sororities have put efforts forth to improve the community."
College Junior,4,"Being in Flint, you would expect Kettering to be a dangerous place, but Campus Safety does a great job of keeping it safe. They also built a Flint Police station right across the street from campus. As far as sexual assault goes, I've never heard of any incidents on campus, so I can't provide an accurate account of that."
College Junior,4,"The majority of professors are very passionate about the subject they teach. Some professors can be hard to follow/understand, due to a wide band of cultures and languages, but they are always willing to help you out, if needed."
College Junior,4,"Over 40% of Kettering is Greek, and there's plenty of houses to choose from. No one pressures you to join, and many of my friends have gone Greek and invite me to all their functions."
College Junior,4,"Kettering is a perfect fit for someone who would values on-the-job experience in addition to practical book knowledge. It also has great one on one professor/student interaction, due to the small class sizes."
College Sophomore,4,"It's safe on campus, but off campus- NO!!!!"
College Junior,4,You will not have trouble finding employment.
College Freshman,4,I like that we basically have our own rooms
College Freshman,4,Greek life at kettering is different then other schools.
College Freshman,4,Kettering only offers intramurals because of our terms.
College Freshman,4,Kettering basically says to not be stupid and be a responsible person. Nothing ever gets out of control and most students are pretty mature about drinking.
College Freshman,4,I would simply say that Kettering is pretty diverse and nobody really has a problem with anyone.
College Freshman,4,"Kettering has some of the best engineering programs in the country. With that comes great responsibility. There are only two terms per school year and each term is only 11 weeks long. This is much shorter than the traditional 16 week semester. However, the same amount of material is covered, which creates for a very tough and challenging academic curriculum. Its engineering, so the classes can be difficult. Keeping up with homework and studying is very important. Find a study space that works for you and is not well known."
College Freshman,4,"There is almost never an assault on campus. Any assault that does occur is never a student. Kettering is located in Flint, MI, which is a relatively dangerous city. Campus Security does pretty well at patrolling and keeping the campus safe. Assaults very rarely occur. Just stay on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the time I get good professors, but as with every University, there are always bad professors and Kettering has some. Most classes are interesting and some hands-on. The further along in the program you are, the more hands-on you get. Class size is perfect - relatively small."
College Freshman,4,"The academics as I stated before are aimed as intended for future engineers to be able to obtain a career in their field. The coursework is challenging and demands additional study time due to the shortened semester length. The only negative for academics that I have encountered is that certain professors should be avoided, but because it is a smaller school, sometimes that is impossible."
College Freshman,4,"Kettering University is a unique 4.5 year program that gives students the tools to gain work experience at the start of their freshman year, and which continues throughout their entire stay at Kettering. The students are on a 3-month(11 week) rotation between school and their co-op. The co-op program is the reason most students attend Kettering since it; gives students work experience and a decent income during college. Because of the relationship Kettering has with many employers, it is very easy for a competitive student to attain a co-op position either on their own or at a University sponsored career fair. Kettering's intense Engineering program is unique, challenging, and rewarding, and makes me proud of my decision to attend there."
Junior,2,Engineering college in general is very theoretical a lot of the stuff learned and taught is not that useful in industry. Kettering in particular is very expensive and hard to afford with little financial help.
Senior,2,Lack-luster academics.  16/17 Week semesters crammed into 10 weeks.  Professors seem to not care about students unless you suck up to them.  We have no idea where our tuition dollars are going.  School is trying to be too political.  The saving grace is the co-op program.
College Freshman,2,The housing is terrible compared to how much you pay for it. They require you to stay on campus your first year. You get little to no value out of staying in the dorms relative to price.
College Senior,2,The overall living experience isn't great considering the city it is located in and the surrounding area.
College Senior,2,"Athletics are not really focused on at Kettering. This is because it is such an intensive engineering school. However, I feel that if athletics were further focused on it would take away from Kettering's academics."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are alright, but not nearly worth what they're charging for them."
College Freshman,2,We have one intercollegiate team in ultimate frisbee. The weight room is tiny and so packed with equipment that nothing is actually usable.
College Freshman,2,"The main reason for my poor rating is that because Kettering is located in Flint, Michigan - a dangerous and dilapidated city, I feel that security measures are currently inadequate. I believe the health aspect is adequate as there is a wellness center that is staffed with nurses and stocked with a variety of medical supplies. On the otherhand, the few campus safety ""officers"" are often spread thin, and are only a walking uniform - they do not have any way to handle a dangerous situation other than calling the Flint police, which are often hours away from making an appearance. Aside from purchasing a new campus security vehicle and lights/cameras, I feel that the actual people tasked with ""securing"" our campus are not properly equipped. A fraternal brother of mine was assaulted and robbed across the street from campus and I went to wait with him for 2 hours for the police to show up to tell him there were busy, but have an already list of prior offenses for the culprits' vehicle. I would not say I feel safe to walk alone outside on the border of campus day or night. I would highly advise to stick in groups and stay as close to campus as possible and away from any shady looking individuals."
College Student,2,"Quite many parties, but only guys..."
College Student,2,"There are just few scholarships, the school fee is still a lot even you got financial aid, so expensive."
College Sophomore,2,there is no need for that long of orientation
College Sophomore,2,i have yet to go to bed one night without hearing 2 sets of sirens while in bed
College Freshman,2,The food on campus is really not good or nutritious at all
College Freshman,2,"The housing is super old and run down, but they manage to keep it at a comfortable temp. The halls are dark and depressing, and so is the scenery outside your window."
College Freshman,2,Not much to choose from unless you want to drive somewhere downtown
College Freshman,2,"The ratio of guys to girls is horrible, don't be expecting to meet a girl here, honestly. If that plays and significance in your choice of schools, start looking elsewhere. The girls stick to the dorms or are Greek, and are few and far in between. The ones you want to meet are in relationships, so just get ready to be friend-zoned. People on campus were mostly from the tops of their classes, and that comes out in interactions with other students. Lots of opinionated people, and due to the amount of guys here, sometimes feels like you can't discuss anything without it turning into a testosterone-fueled  match of wits."
College Freshman,2,"The CO-OP is the only reason I would consider going here again, the education is average at best. You're literally paying for the CO-OP and small classes, that's about it"
College Freshman,2,Meeting new people is practically impossible
College Student,2,"This is Flint, Michigan which is obviously not the safest place to be out by yourself. The areas directly around campus isn't too bad but you definitely have to be smart about where and when you go places."
College Freshman,2,"Flint has declined since its hay-day, if you're going to Kettering, stick to campus."
College Junior,2,Flint is bad. Go there for the Co-op and Greek Life
College Sophomore,2,"It's an engineering school. They stereotype is true for a reason. Neither the guys or girls on the whole are attractive, but most of the ones that you'll see around still enjoy going out and having a good time."
College Sophomore,2,Students only go to house parties/fraternity parties in Flint. Most of them stay away from the bars in Flint.
College Sophomore,2,"Kettering University was not built to look pretty. The student body is mostly engineering students who don't care about the aesthetics of the academic building. The walls are white concrete blocks and the desks are the same ones that were used 40 years ago. Campus is tiny, and there's not much land."
College Sophomore,2,Thompson Hall was the worst dormatory building I've visited. Other campuses offer much more and actually have options and amenities
College Sophomore,2,Flint lives by a set of its own rules. There's nothing much a few security guards riding around campus can do
College Freshman,2,Flint is not a college town.
College Freshman,2,The scholarships help but the financial burden is still heavy for someone having to make up the difference by working.
College Freshman,2,"Kettering is in its own safe ""bubble.""  We are always advised to stay on campus as much as possible."
College Student,2,"The variety is limited and I struggle to find healthy, vegetarian options. The dining halls have weird hours, and nothing is open during late night hours."
College Student,2,"Other than fraternities and a small dowtown area, there is not much to do. It is close to community colleges and U of M Flint, but I have not met anyone from neighboring schools, yet."
College Junior,2,Not a very safe town.
College Student,2,"They are strict about saftey purely for our saftey in Flint, but overall they aren't too bad about drinking because Flint police have more things to be worried about.  I mean obviously they don't want to get caught allowing underage drinking, but they know it happens."
College Sophomore,2,"Scholarships for incoming freshmen can be pretty good depending on your ACT score and GPA before leaving. For example I had a 25 ACT score and a 3.5 gpa. I received 45000 over 4.5 years, or 5000 a semester. Which isn't to bad, I also received some money from financial aid. But Kettering is expensive 36,000 for the year. Most people don't have that type of money and I wish that there was more available. But there are ways to get additional money through having work terms after every academic semester which can help bridge the gap in paying for school. Also taking advantage of school scholarships and diversity scholarships if applicable."
Recent Alumnus,2,With in the last year parking has become a huge deal on campus. There isn't enough spaces for students close to the AB. Security has been giving out a lot of tickets to students and towing cars. Students that don't register their cars don't have to pay the fines. It has turned into a war almost between students and security.
College Sophomore,2,"Don't Stray Away from School – The school itself has a good atmosphere, but living just north of it can be a real problem. Every term I hear of at least one person who goes to school getting robbed just off campus and shootings are heard of and are common. There is a theater that we go to that is quite enjoyable and downtown isn't bad. You can walk around the city during the day and walking at night is just downright not advisable. There is a commercial street not too far where we can do some shopping and some dining when we want to get out of our house (or dorms) and that area isn't bad."
College Student,2,Flint is an area with a high crime rate that can make you feel unsafe at times. However Kettering University on campus safety provides a good deal comfort while on campus. There is not a ton of things to do in the city of Flint itself but there is a high amount greek life on campus which always provides entertainment.
College Student,2,"Our football team has been undefeated since 1919, only because we do not have one.  We do however have a hockey team, but I'm not sure how they do since very few of our students go see them.  That is the only actual sports team we have, and the rest is all intramural.  We do try to get everyone involved in our intramural sports though and usually that has a decent level of participation"
College Sophomore,2,They Barely Satisfy – There are just inter mural sports other than the hockey team which I have never really seen too much support through the school for those guys.
College Student,2,"Drinking Is Most Prevalent – Since Kettering is primarily an engineering school containing many socially awkward people, drugs and alcohol aren't seen too much. However, for the percentage that do participate in these activities, I haven't heard of any drugs used on or around the campus. Drinking is far more popular then drugs here. However, being in Flint, I'm sure if a student needed to use drugs, it wouldn't be too hard to obtain them"
College Freshman,1,Financial aid was a disaster for me and one of the reasons I started university so late.
College Freshman,1,"It's Flint, there's little to nothing to do. People try to get out of here, not stick around"
College Student,1,I can't wait to leave. Especially the food since it is a lump sum.
College Sophomore,1,Flint's one of the most dangerous cities in the US
College Freshman,1,Its Flint. Downtown is fun but only before like 8:00 pm.
College Sophomore,1,Flint is the worst location for a college town which it will never be
College Junior,1,We have no off campus eating other than fast food places in unsafe areas!
College Freshman,1,"Campus dining is absolutely horrible.  It is expensive, $9 for a meal, and there's only one option - Sodexo.  Sodexo is the bane of existence for most students at Kettering.  Prices are high, quality is low, and there are no other options."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel very safe on campus, but most of the frat houses are alcohol-fueled date-rape dens, and little is done to stop it. Best advice, don't go to frat parties. Secondly, the recent outsourcing of the health center has made it impossible for low-income students or those with not-great health insurance to get medical care."
College Freshman,1,Flint is not exactly the best place to be at night. However it can be fun with a few friends and locked car doors.
College Sophomore,1,"What Girls? If you are coming to Kettering to find a girl, you have the wrong idea."
College Senior,1,"It's weird - they started using Google for e-mail and such, but the computers in the labs and library are running IE 6 and can't run Gmail properly. You have to either install Chrome/Firefox (and do it EVERY time) or use the ""dumbed-down"" less feature-rich version, unless you bring a laptop. I'm a computer science major and I had a few classes in the Linux lab... the Linux computers are using a version of Ubuntu that's about four years old, even though you can download the latest version for free..."
College Junior,1,They treat the students like children and attempt to control the consumption of alcohol while the students pay them $30000 a term to go to their school when and allt they want to do is have a little fun but the school is so uptight that they try to control everything and its Bull.
College Junior,1,They Tow students car if they do no have a permit and they will even tow your car if it is in the dorms parking lot where visitors park all the time.
College Junior,1,Someone put an upper decker in the teachers lounge in the Mott Center
College Sophomore,1,"Girls Are Hard to Come by. Because it is an engineering school, there are very few girls who attend this university. And the ones who do attend the university fit into the category of ""engineer"". You probably won't find your soul mate here."
College Student,1,"Due to the closing down of General Motors' facility, the small city of Flint is one of the most depressed in the world.  There is a mall, and Flushing and Grand Blanc are close by with their various attractions, but Flint is not a good city for a college to be located in.  Students get mugged by locals several times a year and you are not supposed to walk around alone during any time of the day. Campus however is very safe and beautiful."
College Freshman,1,"Flint Died With the Auto Industry – The only indication that Flint was once a vital piece of America's automotive industry is the fact that many patches of concrete, once the foundations of factories, lay deteriorating around the campus. With the factories went the restaurants that once fed the workers. Now the only places remaining are mainly fast food chains and pizza joints, and all of them are at least a 10 minute drive from the campus. The three dining options at Kettering are: Go greek so you can eat at the house, pay for the cafeteria food, or be prepared to spend a lot on gas for all your trips to get fast food."
College Student,1,"Kettering is in the heart of Flint, one of the worst city's in America. I personally have had my car stolen. The locals are not exactly friendly and they don't really care about personal property."
College Sophomore,1,There's basically no financial aide available to students.

Sophomore,5,"It is a wonderful college, you get a lot for your money. The teachers are generally very good and very communicative. The EMT program is amazing, I suggest anyone who wants to enter medicine get your EMT license and see if you like it!"
Senior,5,Everything is good. All campuses work in collegiality. Students can take classes where they are available in any campus.
Senior,5,Students  and the staff are working as one team. Services are provided on time and the stuff cares all. The study environment is safe in all campuses.
Niche User,5,Online classes are about the same across the board; success in online classes depends mainly on student discipline and dedication. The college does provide an easy-to-navigate online platform and my online professors have been helpful and accommodating.
Sophomore,5,I started after high school in 2018 ever since then I love the atmosphere the people there  are very helpful. The in person sessions before the Covid 19 pandemic were easy and the professors were easy to work with always communicated to let us know where we were in the assignments and if needed any help to reach out to them with questions. Another thing I loved about Florida State college was the ability to move at my own pace without getting penalized also adding to that the amount of effort the staff and professors put in to make sure all students are on track with their classes and financial aid.

Freshman,5,This is my first collage im attending and I honestly made a good first pick. it is so easy to ask and set up classes for online.
Sophomore,5,"Learning online through FSCJ has been very helpful. I work full time so I can only take online or late night classes. My professors have always been helpful with any questions I have had, and have made good use of online resources to help myself and other students."
Sophomore,5,"FSCJ is a wonderful school for anyone looking to attend college. Whether you are coming straight from high school or coming back to school, it can help you achieve your goals. A big positive for me is the cost, I work full time and any other college would be too expensive."
Sophomore,5,We did finish our classes last semester online. Through lecture and lab assignments. The professors did a fantastic job at making sure they were covering everything and that we understood.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy going to school at the Downtown location. The professors are great and have passion in teaching the students.
Sophomore,5,"My online classes have been key in my ability to return to college later in life. 
I work full time and have a family.  The ability to work at my own pace through online classes and during my own hours have been key to my success to date.  Even though alot of the classes I take are online, the professors are all incredibly thorough, helpful and AVAILABLE!  I have been incredibly happy with all of my online classes with the exception of College Algebra because I struggle with the subject it is best for me to do this course in a classroom!"
Sophomore,5,"For the classes meant to be taken online, FSCJ has great online tools (like 24/7 online tutoring). The professors are interactive and find different ways to keep you engaged even thought it is online. Some professors will even have one-on-one conference calls."
Freshman,5,I like how the school accepted any race and made sure everyone safety was first. I liked how when the pandemic cake they notified us and made sure we were able to still do our work and  pass classes on time. I think they should have more scholarships available instead of certain scholarships selected for you.
Sophomore,5,"I loved my experience at FSCJ. After high school I was new to the college world with little to no help. I successfully completed my A.A. in timely manner after high school with FSCJ and now they are helping me transfer to UNF. My first semester of college with them was smooth. I recommend this school to anyone who is nervous about entering college. Classes are small, campuses are easy to find classes in and class schedules are considerate to anyones schedule."
Freshman,5,FSCJ has great programs (online and on-campus) as well as knowledgeable professors. It is also affordable.
Graduate Student,5,Florida State College At Jacksonville is a great state college to attend the school itself is cheaper than a University. The professors are helpful the only downside is the advising sessions and financial aid.
Sophomore,5,My experience has been great. The student support staff on campus are always encouraging helpful. The professors are attentive and the course load depends entirely upon the student. Jacksonville is a great place to live and is constantly realigning the city's goals to focus on the betterment of its residents.
Sophomore,5,"Florida State College Jacksonville is an exceptional school. FSCJ has lots of great opportunities /clubs that will help students become successful and reach their highest potential, which will enable students like myself to accomplish and meet goals that will help them become top leaders and be prepared for anything that comes their way."

It feels like they really care about my education and they want me to succeed. I always recommend it to anyone who is looking for colleges that are slightly less expensive.

Freshman,5,"My experience at FSCJ, downtown campus, has been pretty straightforward. Everyone is there to learn. I love the focus and how hands-on it is. I would like to see more clubs and school spirit!"
Senior,5,It's an amazing experience. The teachers really help you out and want you to be successful. I had a dull enrollment at my school. I took their class. Their campus is pretty. It is clean. They are young people and older people. The class is about like 20 or less. You don't get a lot of homework.
Freshman,5,It has been amazing so far and I cannot wait to obtain my A.A. next year. All my classes have been online so far and the system they use is user friendly which is a plus.
Freshman,5,Make it possible for me to go to college. I’m really how easy the process of applying was. The staff is really nice and helpful.

Freshman,5,I am a current high school senior who has has the opportunity to take dual enrollment classes through FSCJ. It has been such a neat experience to take college classes my last two years of high-school. This has definitely prepared me for whats to come once I enter college full time next fall. The professors give good feedback and are extremely helpful.
Freshman,5,Florida State College has been a very good place for me to easily gain credits in a short amount of time at a low cost. It is near where I live and has a very nice campus as well.
Freshman,5,"I go to Kent campus specifically and its a beautiful school, and the professors are very helpful. There is not really any fun activities to participate in, so if I were to change anything it would to have more fun events or clubs."
Freshman,5,"I  like the professors, they show they really care. With taking two classes and working a full time job they really are flexible with the times that I   can schedule my classes. The Deerwood campus is very nice, quite and feels like home... I   like that It isn't a very busy campus too. My classmates are very nice and I've made new friends there."
Freshman,5,FSCJ has been so easy to work with and their staff are professional. FSCJ has made higher education more attainable for me through their online degree program

Junior,5,"Since I started back I have a wonderful experience. I have great professors that are willing to work with you, especially my Anatomy and Physiology Professor Kines.  Also so that I can be more involve while attending school I joined the Student Life Department as Student Ambassador. Being a Ambassador is fun and I get to interact with other students. Addition, I enjoy giving campus tours to current and/or potential college candidates.  Overall FSCJ is far most the best college experience I have had, so come out and join us."
Junior,5,I have been enrolled on and off at Florida State college since 2007. I have had the most wonderful experiences throughout the years. All of my professors have been great. They are really understanding and are more than willing to help in any way with your growth. Most of my classes have been taken online due to work and personal life demands however the experience has been just the same as it was on campus.
Freshman,5,I love that Florida State College at Jacksonville have professors that actually care. The Professors i have had are willing to work one on one with students and really explain the lectures so you are able to apply those same concepts in everyday life. I would like to see more student night life on campus.
Freshman,5,I went to the testing center to take my  PERT exam and they were very helpful and professional. They made sure I understood everything before I took the test. Most places just give you a time and place and wish you good luck. Thankful I was able to take it here.
Freshman,5,I am a first-year student and thus far I love it.  The campuses are nice and safe.  the technology is first-rate and the students are diverse and friendly.  I love it here and I think it is a great choice for anyone else starting out here in Jacksonville.
Freshman,5,"great school , many campus. diversity and 4 years degree college.

Great flexibility taking classes and online classes are great too."

Sophomore,5,"My experience here as been great. I love how the campus is smaller than a University because it makes it easier for me to learns in a smaller classroom with less people. This college is a great school to attend if you are unsure with what you want to do. They have an excellent team of faculty, and so far they professors there has been phenomenal."
Alum,5,"FSCJ is a great, affordable college for students who intend on transferring to a university later on. It has 4 campuses and 4 centers across the city of Jacksonville. Plus it offers plenty of online classes. If you live in the Jacksonville area and are planning to pursue a degree in engineering or law, I recommend that you obtain an associates degree/transfer degree from FSCJ. It will save you money in the long run. While FSCJ does offer a wide selection of programs and certificates, it offers a very limited selection of bachelor degrees. Overall. FSCJ can give educational opportunities to just about anyone."
Sophomore,5,"I have been an FSCJ international student for a year. I can say that it has been a great experience. I have enjoyed every class that I have taken. Even though some of them were hard, I still managed to get a good grade. Also, mostly all of the teachers that I have chosen were well' prepared and nice."
Niche User,5,"When visiting Florida State College at Jacksonville, I was very surprised with how much I fell in love with the campus, the students, the cross country coach (as I am wanting to be a college runner) and the advising office.  The campus was big but easy to navigate with how open it is.  When visiting, the advising office helped me with a problem I had with my application.  They were super helpful and sat down with me to make sure everything was figured out without ""rushing"" me."
Freshman,5,My experience at FSCJ so far has been outstanding. The staff is very helpful and always answers any questions or concerns I have in a timely manner. The professors are great and the classes are even better. The campus location I attend is beautiful and easily accessible. The buildings and classes are easy to locate as well and if you are having issues located a class someone is always readily available to assist.
Junior,5,I like how affordable this college is compared to others in the area. There are a bunch of campuses to take classes at and online options to work around any kind of schedule.
Senior,5,What I like about Florida State College at Jacksonville is their hard work and dedications  for students. The teachers are very professional. It's much cheaper than any universities.  I also love how it gives you more options and a variety of classes.
Freshman,5,I love the fact that there's many campuses you can pick from and not just have to stay in one area. The professors are great and understand you if there's any problems you are having.
Senior,5,"It's cheap and easy to graduate. If you want to graduate with an degree, it's best to start off in a community college. The teachers there are mainly great from my experience."
Freshman,5,I like FSCJ because the teachers are great. Some are very helpful when it comes to school work. The things I want FSCJ to change is to not let teachers talk about their personal life to the students.
Sophomore,5,I liked how there were many campuses to choose classes from and the campuses are not too big so getting to each class were easy.
Freshman,5,I like the overall experience at my college. The program I’m in is very helpful and I’m happy that Florida state college of Jacksonville provide helpful program and people when you are stuck in a situation

Niche User,5,I love it. It's very easy to get around and has many activities to make you feel at home. It is also helpful with the tutoring.
Sophomore,5,I have been attending FLorida state community college for two years now. This school has given me the best college experience and best academic experience.

Sophomore,4,"For the price, the college is very nice. Great people and professors! Has a lot of interesting events to go to. I recommend the ted talk events."
Niche User,4,"Florida State College is a great option for a lot of different categories of people including recent high-school graduates looking to save money on their general education courses before transferring to a much pricier university, and older college attendees returning to school after various education-hindering experiences looking to finish their degrees via convenient, flexible means like myself. The wide variety of days and times offered makes it easy to work around my employment and family schedule and the quality of the coursework is more than sufficient compared to with university standards."
Sophomore,4,I had a good experience with Florida State College at Jacksonville. All of the teachers cared how their students do in classes and administration is very helpful.
Sophomore,4,The online classes were mostly easy to understand and it's very convenient if you have a full time job.
Freshman,4,Florida State Collage at Jacksonville is a good place to learn. My first year experience is  very inspiring and there are a lot of support by the college to promote student success.
Freshman,4,This Collage has People that really care about the education the students want and will dedicate all the time and effort they have to make it happen.
Sophomore,4,"FSCJ has made so many improvements with their courses. They offer bachelors level degrees, have simulation labs for medical courses (nursing, dental, PT/OT). Keep up the great work"
Sophomore,4,My instructors have been great at adjusting coursework to an online format in the wake of COVID-19. I really appreciate all the extra effort that has gone into providing excellent education in an online format.
Sophomore,4,"The staff has been helpful in my experience, and the courses are very affordable. So glad to see this institute get state-accredited!"
Sophomore,4,"The online classes are very comprehensive, and the teachers usually do a fine job of keeping in contact for any questions that may arise."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled at FSCJ to obtain my Bachelor's in Logistics and Transportation.  As a 51 year old student, mother and a full-time employee  reentering college later in life,  I found that the online classes offered have been key in my ability to be able to go back to college.  The ability to work at my own pace and my own hours have been key to my success to date.  The professors have all been excellent.  There are ample options for classes as well.   The only issue I have had was the financial aid verification system they use has been difficult so I have had to try to find other sources of funding."
Graduate Student,4,"FSCJ is constantly updating their systems to keep up with new students and technology. From three years ago my experience was delightful online. And now, with the new system. it was no time at all to learn and enjoy the features. The teachers have multiple outlets to distribute their information to make sure you are fully immersed even if you're not able to take in class classes."
Graduate Student,4,This school has multiple canvases each with their own strengths. Downtown is the best library and tutoring. Kent is the best classrooms. Northside offers the best campus in general. South campus offers the best student services.
Freshman,4,"As a student currently enrolled with Florida State College at Jacksonville, I have come to experience some very inspiring professors that encourage me to be successful and help me strive to be the best that I can be as a student -- and as a person. I am taking courses here to obtain my associate's degree so that I may transfer to a university where I can receive higher education for my career, the staff and professors incorporated within FSCJ want to see their students succeed and are preparing them for what they truly desire to accomplish. As a student coming into college for the first time, I was quite nervous...but being enrolled with FSCJ has helped ease the tension and pressure associated with the expectations of others and I am happy to be a student within this college environment."
Freshman,4,"Although learning online can be challenging at times, professors at Florida State College at Jacksonville do the best they can to work with students and maintain an open line of communication for any questions that may arise."
Sophomore,4,"For me, FSCJ has been a great stepping stone; a launch pad. The professors I’ve had have been so supportive and truly try everything to help you understand the material. It’s a great school to start (and finish) your degree(s). Honestly, the only minor issue I’ve had there is in dealings with the bookstore."
Junior,4,I really enjoyed taking classes here for 4 semesters. The teacher i had for my Journalism course were all either good or great. Many professors here are so good that you'd think you were going to a much more higher scale university.
Sophomore,4,"Generally, I'm glad that my professor's interest in the class and their contribution to my education. I'm taking online classes at FSCJ but they were usually not live stream. I think the college should think about interactive and live classes.The students must feel they're in the face-to-face class so that they can take courses seriously. If they can't provide this, with the lack of student participation, the quality of education can not be provided."
Sophomore,4,"It has been hard during this Covid-19 pandemic, but FSCJ has taken tremendous strides in making sure the students at this college re still able to continue there education from home, especially in short notice. They have allowed us to have all of our classes online and made it a lot easier to keep in contact with our professors and other classmates. The actions that this school has taken during this pandemic are commendable, and I am glad for it to be apart of my journey through life."
Niche User,4,Really a great school to go to to ease your way into college before going to an actual university. Professors are really nice. I am making really good grades as a dual enrolled student.
Sophomore,4,I like that I get the same education without the pressure of a large university. I do wish the testing centers were better at communicating.
Freshman,4,FSCJ is a good community school. The counselors have always been there to help me with any issues as well with guiding me. The transition between high school and college was smooth. Classes are also fun and the majority of the professors have been very nice and fun to learn with.
Sophomore,4,"Classes and professors are the best, class sizes are small and flexibility is always an option as it's a community college. Only issue is having to deal with the different offices, as when I first started taking classes I had to talk to financial aid three times and all three I got different answers for the same questions, try and find someone that already attends to help you or figure out things on your own because the office is not really helpful."
Niche User,4,Excellent staff. Very helpful and always available. I am taking classes here as a non-degree seeking student to fulfill prerequisites for my graduate program. Excellent variety of classes and very affordable.
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my experience at FSCJ - online courses are good, it can sometimes be difficult to connect with an advisor"
Sophomore,4,"I earned my AA degree from Florida State College at Jacksonville. It's a community college with multiple locations around the Jacksonville area. It is an affordable community college that is a great option if you live in the Jacksonville area. All of the classes I took weren't too hard, and I never had any complaints about my professors. You just need to make sure you pick the right ones. The campuses are nice and I enjoyed all of my classes. I took traditional classroom and online courses to earn my AA. I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. It is an option if you want an affordable college, or you want to return back to college as an adult."
Sophomore,4,I like that the professors want you to succeed and there are a lot of help options for any and everything you need help with.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Florida State College at Jacksonville and I've loved my experience here so far. What I love most about the college is the diversity on campus and you get to meet other people from different cultures. Also, we always have some sort of event happening on campus to give students a break after spending hours in the library studying or completing course work. What I would like to see improve is having more variety when it comes to the food choices."
Freshman,4,"My experience as a student at FSCJ has been positive.  My art professor has been phenomenal and extremely helpful.  Where I have had issues is registering for classes.  I have been advised that when you register to pay at least $1.00 to reserve your spot, unless you are able to pay the full amount."
Niche User,4,"I am a dual enrollment student at FSCJ and have visited and attended many of their campuses. The quality of education and learning is very good. The professors that I have had personally have been helpful, insightful, and focused on the students' individual success. 
The reason I'm giving a four-star rating is because I'd like to see some improvements within the dual enrollment process. Plainly stated, it is a mess. Due dates are hard to find and follow. Processes for getting and returning textbooks could be a lot easier. 
There are many clubs and events that are fun to attend. The security text alerts are very informative. It's a great college to go to, and I recommend it if you can get past the dual enrollment hurdle if necessary."
Freshman,4,Nice atmosphere. Professors are diligent in their teaching. The bookstore has everything you may need as materials for classes. The website could be a little more organized but it is overall easy to find what you are looking for
Freshman,4,"Florida State College of Jacksonville is pleasantly well put together state college. The academics/programs offered are very similar to other universities. The facilities are really nice, the staff is always willing to help, and their website is easy to navigate along with having an online library for research purposes."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at FSCJ has been a good one. The school offers a good variety of classes you can take to complete your associates degree. My professors have all been great as well, they always want to help you succeed. One thing I would is the selection of electives they have. More of a variety would be nice."
Senior,4,"I liked that FSCJ was a small adjustment from High school. Going to a university straight after High school can be scary and stressful. The campus was small and I have made several friends during my stay here. The teachers go above and beyond to ensure the students are understanding the material and even with the small funds we have they try to give the ""college experience"". I definitely think when I go off to a university I will be able to adjust better straight after High School."
Niche User,4,"It is a nice school so far, I am still new here though. Dual Enrollment is fun! I think this is a good college to start at, it is not over the top crazy academics, but it is not super easy at the same time. Of course depending on who you are that might change, but from my experience as a high school student, it is pretty OK."
Sophomore,4,"The most thing I like about FSCJ college is all the teacher I have are nice and answer me any questions I have until I understand it. However, there is one thing that need to change is the counselor because different advisors tell me to do different things which is confusing."
Sophomore,4,"FSCJ is what is making it out to be. There are several campuses that one can attend, and one can attend more than one campus at a time. If you are someone who prefers to stay to themselves, that is fine but networking and speaking up and going to events around the school and to each campus is how one is to mingle with the students and faculty. For some, they use this schoo as a transfer school, and some use this a 4-year college. There is a diversity of students and the school tries to be as open as possible. There will always be new faces and one can make long lasting relationships here."
Alum,4,"Classroom size manageable,  several campuses around town to accommodate every side of town. Safe campus, parking availability is great."
Freshman,4,The professors I've had so far are very knowledgeable and fun to be around. The campus is very nice and simple to navigate.
Junior,4,"Florida State College at Jacksonville is an excellent start to upper education as the professors that can be found at FSCJ are some of the best teachers I have had thus far and demonstrate compassion for students that do not have the opportunities of others as well as presenting options for saving money on an individual basis with some professors opting to have completely free books, and the price for the college itself is the entire reason why I started my college education here as basic financial aid was able to cover all my expenses and this is the same for many of my colleagues. The staff can be a mixed bag however with a few of the advisers being less helpful in degree planning than optimal, requiring multiple perspectives from advisers per semester to properly plan your degree and prevent excess or useless credits."
Freshman,4,"A good school. The admissions office just needs to get their life together, and not loose paperwork."
Freshman,4,My experience was pleasant thus far. The staff is nice and supportive. I appreciate the time taken to help pave a way towaeds my future. I would like the appoinment scheduling to change. That way I can set an appoinment from home and not have to physically be there.
Junior,4,Florida State College Jacksonville (FSCJ) is an affordable school offering a good variety of courses and degree programs.  There are several campuses and online programs that provide convenient options for taking classes.
Freshman,4,Counselors and professors are great. Financial services forces you to have a bank account that is very difficult to work with.
Junior,4,I definitely love how you are in a close classroom environment and are able to receive one on one with the professor if addition help is needed. I wouldn't change anything.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the financial aid could accept me throughout attending for more than two years . I also enjoyed the easy access to all your schoolwork through their black board system.
Niche User,4,FSCJ is know to be a great college to start off with and then transfer to another if you will like. FSCJ has many opportunities to find your future career and help you bet the best you.
Sophomore,4,I love how it gives you a university feel but the class sizes are small and intimate enough to where you can still have one on ones with your classmates and professors.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience at FSCJ.  The staff has always been helpful and there have been amazing opportunities for me to get involved around campus.  As someone who often travels and is not always able to go to campus, online courses have been a great way for me to continue my education.  However, the customer service for online students could use some improvement as it is difficult to get questions answered."
Alum,4,"FSCJ is a good place to complete your degree . The social scene isn’t very big, but there are a few areas to interact with other students and there are occasional events held in common areas . The tutoring is great and teachers are usually good ."
Freshman,4,It's a pretty average state college but they do have good professors. They could improve the common areas with there being more of it also have a decent food option instead of high style food almost there.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are have the highest credentials in their fields, which is a necessity to most. The community on campus is lacking, but they have made great efforts in expanding this. The campus itself is your standard community college campus, but there are some perks. Lack of a comfortable study area and lack of majors for the Bachelorette program are what forced me to take away a star."
Niche User,4,"I had a good dual enrollment experience. They had many resources to help students like me succeed. Because there were so many campuses in Jacksonville, I had many options when choosing my preferred classes."
Freshman,4,The school is very organized. Its in a very clean community and its close to a lot of fast food places.
Freshman,4,Great experience so far! Everyone has been helpful and the online classes have made life easier ! The online teachers have been very accommodating. The grading system seems relatively fair!
Sophomore,4,Florida state has been a great college. It was a little rocky at first trying to apply and getting everything in order to start . Once I was finally enrolled and started classes it was smooth sailing from there. The professors really care and are very helpful. Over all I gave had a great experience  at Florida State College of Jacksonville.
Niche User,4,"My experience at FSCJ was a very good one. While visiting, in my opinion, their campus was nice and the people there were very nice."
Junior,4,My experience here at FSCJ has been pretty decent. They have academic advisers that will definitely make sure you are on track and progressing like you should be. The teachers I've had are very comfortable in their teaching ways and welcoming to approach for any questions and/or help. I'm using FSCJ to help me get back on track with my schooling so I can move on to the next step and I'm taking advantage of all the resources while I'm here.
Junior,4,"This college has several campuses around Jacksonville.  This has allowed me to find the class I need at the time I need it to ensure I continue to be on track.  All of the professors, except for one has been very helpful and accommodating.  The parking has never been an issue for me, but I've heard some classmates complain about it."
Freshman,2,"Virtual college has been a horrible experience. Every single class has a different place to see what work you need to complete. So for one class everything could be listed under ""grades"" but others the work doesn't show due dates unless you work to look for it. I will not be coming back once I finish my AA I have ADHD and already struggle to pay attention now I have to play hide and seek making sure every single assignment for all 6 of my classes is complete. Make it easy it couldn't be that hard."
Niche User,2,"There are good professors at this college, but the majority of them are not. The syllabus they hand out is usually extremely vague. Most of the professors aren't using the online tools to let students know how they're being graded. There isn't enough practice work given out for most of the math classes, especially statistics."
Sophomore,2,Florida state college at Jacksonville is definitely improving on its long waiting times but there is still many issues with unqualified professors teaching subject they do not know about.
Sophomore,2,"I have attended FSCJ for my Associates in Arts degree and continued on a few later to attend the Practical Nursing (LPN) program. The years I attended for my AA were 2013-2015 and I am currently (2018) enrolled in the LPN program as I type this. Most of the teachers I have had are adjunct teachers, meaning they have regular jobs and teaching at FSCJ is just a supplementary job for them and they definitely treat it as such. The financial office does not answer calls, emails and when you go up to their actual office they don't have any answers.The administration holds no accountability for any issues on their end and like the other offices rarely reply to any form of contact. I've had many issues with different departments at this school and have been either blown off or disappointed each and every time. If I could go back and attend a different school I would. Unfortunately at the time this was the only option for me financially."
College Senior,2,My previous is been okay.  I was finally making headway on completing my education only to sit out waiting for the school to obtain approval from the Dept of Education.  Once I am able to return now I am being told that the SAP rule now applies and the school no longer offers an appeal processes for extra ordinary situations.  This is not fair.  The school also deals in tricky that is really dishonest & unfair to students.  This school system is not structured to encouraging growth or continued education.
College Junior,2,"The application experience was ridiculous. My credits were not assessed until I was admitted to the B.A.S. program-which may not seem like a big deal-but when you are trying to decide which school will accept most of your classes, it becomes an issue. Proving that my previous coursework was the same as theirs took almost a year. I could not start classes on time-even though i chose distance learning and rolling classes. 

Once I got started though it has been ok. The prerequisite requirements hold up a lot of classes, so I would not have transfered so late in my degree, as their classes for early childhood education are different than the other college I attended. For example I have approximately 32 credits in my field that is not applied anywhere."
College Junior,2,My school is mostly a two year school meaning most people only come in to earn their AA degree to transfer out elsewhere.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know anything about the post-grad services.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't think it's the best school in terms of ratings, I think it's just a stepping stone for the younger students on the way to university."
College Junior,2,"The teacher was not very helpful when I would email with questions or concerns. I have since learned that this is not the best option for me as I prefer the one on one teacher to student interaction.  The discussion boards were lively and thought provoking, but the teacher interaction was little to none.  There were no unique features and I found the website difficult to navigate. Since taking online classes, I will be staying with classroom courses for now until I can transfer school, where I will later reconsider."
College Senior,2,"FSCJ is not the school for you if you want a well rounded college experience. There is no sense of community, the class selection is limited, and clubs are unstable. The website is never properly updated and programs (such as English honors society and the Honors Academy) have been suspended several times for ""structural redesign."" If you're looking to get in and get out, without putting much into college, this is the school for you. Class work is not challenging at all. I learned more in my high school freshman year film analysis class and high school sophomore year plays and playwrights class than I did the the FSCJ counterparts. I'm bored to death at FSCJ and am only returning until I am able to afford a better school. They have very limited bachelor's options and most of them are new and also need ""structural redesign."" I new that FSCJ wasn't going to be the challenging and comprehensive school I desired (I was accepted to Savannah College of Art and Design and to Columbia College Chicago, but couldn't afford either). Not only is the school lacking in interesting coursework and a student life experience, but my disabled husband experienced extreme discrimination when he wasn't allowed to attend an overnight trip to a conference with our student newspaper. They wouldn't accommodate a handicapped accessible van to get him to the even, nor would they allow him to be driven separately. The administration brought in lawyers to talk to our newspaper adviser to uphold that he was not allowed on the trip. I quit the newspaper (of which I was the Associate Editor) and took two semesters off while I investigated my other options. I'm still not positive I will return for fall semester despite being registered for classes. FSCJ has my talent grant (from 3 semesters ago) on ""hold"" until they determine my financial eligibility.""Talent"" grants should not be based on financial standing, but the talent you possess and the hard work you put into a job. I would not recommend FSCJ."
College Sophomore,2,I took a typing course and it was an awful experience i will never take another one based on that first experience.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know much about the student body because their is very little advertisement.
College Sophomore,2,The school takes at least thirty day after classes have started to distribute money to students.
College Freshman,2,"I am only saying this because I do not like to take online courses. The tech can be difficult to work with, and I am a visual learner."
College Junior,2,"I do not like that the biotechnology classes are offered in a very specific order throughout the year and only offered in certain semesters. lets say for example... If you miss a chance to enroll in a specific one for summer semester, then you have to wait an entire year to take it because it is only offered in the summer semester. This makes it harder to complete the program on time if you have a job and a family. Also, the classes are only offered as evening/night classes, this can be hard to plan around if you work at night or very early in the morning."
College Junior,2,Workload always seems to be heavier in online classes... and sometimes emails don't get answered in a timely fashion. That's usually up to the individual professor though. Every online class seems to have a group project. It's annoying and a pain. We understand the concept of working together and being able to present: but not every class needs to have group projects and presentations. Especially since they don't relate much to real work experiences.
College Freshman,2,Personally I don't like learn over the computer I like being in a classroom with my peers. It's a lot easier for me to focus and not become entirely bored .
College Sophomore,2,I don't care for it because when I try to get financial aid it still tells me I'm a dependent.  I do done things on my own and I don't have a family on my own. So why am I still being called an dependent?
College Freshman,2,The value of education is okay and the financial aid process is a huge headache... im still dealing with that and my talent grant. The financial aid process needs to be quicker and the people need to be more on top of it.
College Sophomore,2,the classes are flexible based on a certain part because there so few that it is always full before i can even get to it. so it is hard to get flexible classes for my afternoon jobs to maintain my finance for the classes are balanced.
College Sophomore,2,There are very small classes available on the class to obtain because there are many students trying to take classes as well. There are less program such as elective for the student to take at the school. More major classes compare to elective classes.
College Freshman,2,"Not many activities go on, athletic centers are very minimal on campus. "
College Freshman,2,It is difficult to discuss the differences in majors because I am only a freshman in college. Although I strongly believe that the curriculum and workload of the different programs vary depending on how competitive each major is. 
College Freshman,2,"So far, I have had incredible professors guiding me through college to help me find my way. "
College Senior,2,"The disorganization& the fact that I'm  learning more from a Facebook page full of only other  students, rather than gathering information of our nursing program at FSCJ-from the school, well that  doesn't exist! "
College Freshman,2,"The overall experience is average. Its not what I would call the ""college life"". Right now I'm focusing on work and grades to get me to where I need to be."
College Freshman,2,"The student body is very unopened to new people. I noticed everyone there pretty much stays within their own social circle from high school, not really opened to the idea of meeting new people."
College Freshman,2,The workload is a good amount. They do not overwhelm you and it is challenging at times. The process through blackboard and the connections account is a very easy process.
College Junior,2,Flexibility is generally great and I can pick and choose classes that are later to accommodate a work schedule. My AP courses transferred easily and many of my electives transferred into the major I applied for readily.
College Junior,2,The Business bachelor programs are still new and it's a little stressful that higher level courses are condensed into 8 weeks instead of the traditional 16 weeks.
College Junior,2,"Registration is very easy. Peer-to-peer interaction is more forced in online courses than it is in a classroom setting, where it happens more naturally. The professors do their best to respond in a timely manner, but some can be difficult communicating with. "
College Junior,2,"FSCJ is less about the social aspect that universities provide, and more about being easily accessible to a variety of people. Campus life is relaxed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Only discounts that our school would do is very minum and to local areas around the school. 
otherwise if I go to the mall you have to ask or they would have a sign saying student discounts.
the discounts we have is to Jags game but its sold out 5mins after posting it. 
other colleges near by have NASCAR, Monster Truck and other cool events even host field trip to ride a bus has a group to go to see the event. 
this school sucks and we have More Money issue then most collegs in the area"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Something always goes wrong with the computers, Printing is stupid who have to use you Student ID and have to put in $5 minium in your ID to print papers that a 10cents per page even front and back. We have people who come here with barely any money to afford printing."
College Senior,2,I have experienced some excellent teachers and I have experienced instructors that in their opinion could not care less if students repeated their class again not bothering to offer any assistance to help everyone be successful.  Some instructors offer more resources to students such as study guides that are helpful with course objectives while some instructors have students on the edge of their seats because their tests consist of their rants and ravings from their lectures and not the outlined objectives.  Some hybrid courses contain online modules that may take at least 8 hours to complete for each chapter not including the reading and face time in class making the course harder to complete when a person is working or parenting or have other classes. In my experience persistence is key to success but a failing grade is a blow to the G.P.A. even if it is completed successfully after repetition.  Patience and persistence pays off.
College Senior,2,"Academics are offered at the school, however when a student is in trouble and obviously in need of help there are not many professors willing to offer additional assistance to ensure success, in fact too many often anticipate failure and give the impression that the student should just give up based on their personal preferences, or they can be helpful and reach out to students and even offer extra credit to help students succeed.  Too many professors seem to want students to fail especially where the biological and medical sciences are concerned and deemed them ""weeding course."""
College Sophomore,2,"The computer network has problems every now and then. Almost every professor that I have had at my school has had to delay an assignment or lecture because of problems with the network. I have been there for a year now and the problem still continues. It's stressful at times because we are constantly under a time limit, it occurs so much that it is pretty much expected to happen"
College Sophomore,2,Honestly for me the tuition isn't worth what I'm learning with the little help I get. The school always had a problem with financial aid and never helped me with what I needed from them. I learned the hard way not to depend on them when it comes to tuition.
College Senior,2,"I think the financial aid process is just that.... a process.  It's really hard to get anyone on the phone.  I waited an hour and a half once, on hold. I've had to submit forms more than once, because they somehow weren't scanned into the system. I also feel that if I have an outside loan, the school should not have to ""allow"" me to receive that loan.  The loan should be disbursed to me, so that I can pay the school. Financial aid is a must for many students, and the process should not be such a pain in the neck!"
College Senior,2,"Its a good college but it has the potential to be a great college.  I understand some of the high up administarators were caught up in some legal ""scandals"" these past couple of years and ther were excused.  That effects the school and its students which leads to effecting thier futures.  I hope that we can get some reliable heads in the offices of the school and also more interactive teachers that think outside the box as they ask us as students to do."
Recent Alumnus,2,its a pain to even get someone on the phone...this is bad. The paperwork never shows up where it needs to be. LOST!
College Junior,2,I have only received financial aid about 2 times. The aid I received was not enough to cover classes and books. I have paid out my pocket every semester. The college also took my loan away and put a financial hold on my account and I couldn't register for classes for a semester. But overall I think the value of my education is worth all the money I paid.
College Junior,2,I have had the worst experience trying to get accurate help with my financial aid. I have missed days at work because I am running back and forth trying to get all the proper documents. I will be told I have everything and the next week my classes will be dropped. It's always a hassle.
College Senior,2,"It is a community college, not much of a relationship building school"
College Junior,2,"When it comes to tuition and financial aid you have to do 90% of it on your own. They tell you to fill out the FASFA. That is seriously it. I'm a 23 year old independent because I take care of my mother and grandmother. I actually could receive more grants had I known about them. The women at the office just say to try for loans and don't really have time to hear your situation through. I didn't even know the FSCJ website had an option for a scholarship search in til it was too late for the semester. 
I wish that there were more people to help in the tuition department so maybe they would actually sound interested in your financial burdens."
College Senior,2,FSCJ is under a lot of stress right now and I'm afraid I will lose my accreditation because the school is receiving a bad reputation
College Freshman,2,I feel like the out of state fee is extremely too much.  The information that you need to become a resident should be less than a year maybe six months or less because you never know a person's reason of moving.  I also think that if your moving in from another state you should move a year before you really want to start school so that you won't have any problems with getting your financial aid and it will save you from being embarassed.
College Junior,2,The FA department is a mess right now. Good luck to all new students trying to figure out what they qualify for...
College Senior,2,The cost of tuition is very fair and I am able to pay it myself.I do recieve grants every couple of semesters which helps tremendously. The only thing that is lacking is the communication of deadlines and with advisors.
College Freshman,2,I feel that the whole financial process is so stressful! They aren't really helpful when you ask them information about it because of the fact that there are students working in the financial aid office and they seem to not know what they're doing. I would say that you have to make sure you apply for financial aid early so that you can get enough money.
College Freshman,2,"I give it a C because there are some people who help you out but then there are some people who don't. Everything seems to be unorganized and some of the people don't seem to know what they're doing, but then there are some who do seem to know what they are doing. All in all its pretty much average"
College Freshman,2,"I learned somethings through my financial aid office but,the whole process was really frustrating and confusing because, when I first applied and turned in my paperwork I was told that everything was fine all of the things I needed turned in was in. But when it was time for me to purchase books and get enrolled I couldn't because, they said I had paper work missing that was suppose to be turned in by a certain date and I ended up starting class late and was behind in my classes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I suppose it does as much as any other community college would do, which basically means they can point but you have to walk alone."
College Freshman,2,"Tuition is not bad if you live in state.The financial aid on the other hand is not to my liking,its very hard to get financial aid from fscj. The school kinda gives you the run around too"
College Senior,2,Updated Equipment – Our computer labs are great. They all received new and updated computers. The only issue I have is now we have to pay .10 to print even classroom related material. I feel this is wrong because we pay enough in tuition and fees and this should be included.
College Junior,2,Professors are difficult to get in touch with outside of class and the school makes little to no effort as far as guiding their students. You could go an entire semester without talking to a single person on campus.
College Junior,2,There is really not a very good post-graduate service of new graduates finding a job in their career field right away.
College Junior,2,Not a Lot of Variety – I'm just getting my associate's degree so I can transfer. I intend on majoring in physics and there aren't really a variety of classes I can choose for that major.
College Junior,2,"General Overview – They don't explain things to you properly when it comes to financial processes and procedures. The teachers are decent except the foreign ones. Most of them seem apprehensive and not very helpful towards the students. Class registration is easy, just sign up online."
Freshman,1,"Virtual college has been a horrible experience. Every single class has a different place to see what work you need to complete. So for one class everything could be listed under ""grades"" but others the work doesn't show due dates unless you work to look for it in several different tabs. I will not be coming back once I finish my AA I have ADHD and already struggle to pay attention and turn things in on time now I have to play hide and seek making looking for every single assignment for all 6 of my classes is complete. Make it easy it couldn't be that hard. Still doing well grade wise but I am NOT enjoying this school"

Junior,1,"Technologically, the school gets a zero. I should know because I've completed 80% of my associate's online, not with the help of their glitchy websites and MAJOR technical issues that the ""help desk"" never assists with. Granted, it's a community college, but I've been dropped from classes for ""non payment"" AFTER they've taken my money. So couldn't take classes that semester, and didn't get my money back for THREE MONTHS."
Senior,1,"i do not attend there yet . but i will i graduate from highschool in may 2018.  i will attend the fall semester 2018. Honestly this school looks good on the outside due to its low cost to attend.The online courses are great for first time college students that may work full time .FSCJ is a very good school.I have enjoyed the learning experience, and every professor I have had, except one has been great. I would recommend this school. I believe you will be very much satisfied.i HAVENT HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE IN COLLEGE JUST YET, BUT SO FAR HAS BEEN GOOD AND HELPFUL.Everyone has been very friendly and very helpful in every way.This is great school with great teachers. I am also undecided about what University I will attend.The instructors for the most part were great. Very helpful. The financial department needs work and is improving. Overall my good outweighed my bad and I would seek another degree"
Niche User,1,"I'm so sorry for those that have to attend this school like I did. The most likely reason that a student is attending FSCJ is because of the cheaper tuition. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for. I have had some great professors here, but I've also had some sub-par ones. But the biggest pain about FSCJ is working with the administrative staff. I have been lied to on several occasions by staff members with no compensation afterwards. It seems that the majority of their employees don't know how to fully do their jobs - which is okay, because everybody's learning - but it has cost me dearly. Depending on which campus you attend, you will either be in a very nice new building, or very old buildings. There isn't much in between. There are no athletics or dorms to be spoken of."
College Senior,1,"I was asked if I had ever taken any other classes or received any certificates.  Classes that I took for my jobs that was work related or certification only are counting against me which is not fair.  This was paid out of my pocket to help me in my career part of my employment.  They had nothing to do with my actual education, but the college added these classes into my transcript which is not fair.  These classes was added into transcript to make me disqualified according to the SAP rule, then being informed that no longer an appeal process available.  This was extremely deceitful and dishonest dealing."
College Senior,1,School is facilities is not set up to encourage career change.  Mostly set up for you to fold.
College Junior,1,Financial aid has become worse over the years! They lose your paperwork and don't let you know and then you end up losing a whole semester of studies. Professors aren't always available for the classes your need... and some BAS programs should just be a cert/technical degree.
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't think their ate specifics.
College Sophomore,1,"I applied for financial aid back in late February and my school still is not showing my information as submitted with FASFA. It is very frustrating and it's causing me to worry whether I am going to be able to attend school, because I can't unless I have help."
College Junior,1,They do not provide classes besides child development and asl for speech language pathology majors.
College Freshman,1,My school does not have very much scenery. It was built to have very minimal scenery and study space for students. 
College Senior,1,The school can't accommodate for students at all! 
College Senior,1,"Just because my folks still claim me, so that I can have coverage for tricare(since my dad served 30 years). In order to focus fully on my studies of nursing school, I am blessed my parents help me out financially.  Granted, that comes with no outside help because they claim me. It's sad because I don't make what they make, and I have to pay them back. Explain the fairness to me?! A young, middle class woman unable to receive help, yet I'm only trying to better myself and avoid student loans that have gross interest tapped on! 
My name is Mackenzie Cassidy and I need a scholarship! I attend FSCJ "
College Junior,1,"The tuition is one of the cheapest in the area, no doubt about that. Financial Aid can be very aggravating. The Financial Aid analysts will usually tell you to ""check your status/you can find this information online"" and can be less than helpful. Get your ducks in a row early on when applying for financial aid, and get everything you need in early. The waits can be horrendous at Kent Campus."
College Junior,1,college algebra made me cry.
College Sophomore,1,There may be opportunities to connect with employers but there is not much advertisement for it. It is a very long process trying to figure out who to talk to about the career services and actually find someone who knows what they are talking about.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Its like they want you money, they rip people off, no one knows what their doing, and they lie about you FA"
College Sophomore,1,"I have had to go up to the school quite often, sometimes as much as 4 times in one week. It seems like everyone I had talked to gave me a different answer to the problem I had. The issue with this was I never got a straight forward correct answer. Also they never seem to update my student connection portal. I went in to ask about holds on my financial aid and they say I have none, but according to my accounts I do."
College Sophomore,1,"I tried to get in to classes after high school, but every time I got what I needed, it either wasn't what they needed or I need something else. This lasted for 6 months until I was finally able to sign up for classes. The financial aid system at FSCJ is flawed. They never work at full capacity, they are unorganized, and when their office is full they only have 2 people working. You need to get there early, and make sure that you have everything that you need for your sucess."
College Junior,1,The school is unorganized and the staff don't return calls nor do they follow up with students. they do not compare notes in system to tell student what is the next step. it is like they feel as if it is the students faught they hired staff that falsely approved financial aide funds and now they are taking it out on new student. my experince was the worst.
College Senior,1,"For the last three years, I have had the worst problems with the financial aid.  They have denied me every semester, only to find their own mistakes after classes had already begun, and they have put me under the impression this past year that everything was covered under financial aid.  Come to find out, both semesters I was dis-enrolled from classes and was shown a bill.  Last semester I was able to receive the aid, but this semester they told me I could no longer receive any financial aid, and I ended up paying almost $3000 out of my own pocket."
College Junior,1,The online classes professors tend to slack sometimes when it comes to grading or getting back to any of the students.
College Junior,1,They are not very organized you may have to wait for hours to be seen and it takes more then two months to get everything cleared for financial aide
College Student,1,"My parents and i ultimately decided to pay for my classes out of pocket simply because each time my mom and i went in there it was something else, they weren't upfront about everything that we needed to complete the financial aid process. I believe they weren't really open to us in regards to what we needed i.e. Tax transcripts, 1040xs, amended returns and identity theft paperwork etc. It was an overall hassle to deal with to be quite honest."
College Junior,1,"Getting financial aid is very difficult. The counselors are all over the place, and the lines are really long during the first few weeks of the semester. Every time I would go they would tell me I was missing something else. You do not have the same counselor either. The whole process was a nightmare."
College Junior,1,Everytime school get close to start they mess up my financial and tuition
College Sophomore,1,The tuition at FSCJ is cheap and very reasonable but the financial aid process at my school is HORRIBLE. The financial aid advisers are slow and unorganized. They are so unorganized that our enrollment this semester was extremely low.
College Junior,1,the financial aid process was a nightmare! Everytime I would call I couldn't get a definite answer or the CSR was unsure. If I could do it all over I would of  went to another college
College Junior,1,"Financial aid called me a week before classes started to let me know that my fafsa wasn't verified, and they couldn't process my talent grant because of it. So instead of having the talent grant cover all my classes, I had to pay for them with my own money which was very difficult considering I have just graduated high school and don't have that much money to begin with, but I managed to get it all together in time. And throughout the process of getting my fafsa verified, I have been going back and forth trying to get the papers I need to get it completed, only to be sent back with more forms to receive from the IRS and turn in to the school."
College Sophomore,1,"Amazingly Disappointed – This school de-motivates students with their lack of customer service and lack of concern for students. I have never incountered such rude unhelpful People working at a college. Along with the ridiculous policies they have. It's no coincidence that the graduation rate is only 31%. Most of the teachers are great, if you can make it past admissions, enrollment  and financial aid without giving up hope!"
College Freshman,1,Not Much – There is no one who is willing to explain what to do about printing or even where to print. The people who are suppose to help at the library and learning centers are not friendly or even approachable. They seem like when you ask them a question that you are bothering them.
College Freshman,1,"Only My 1St Semester – I have not seen any unique things at FSCJ. I know that the one of my courses  that was on line, we had a group project to do. The leader of the group was not a good leader. His comments and actions were bias against people in general. Very unapproachable. Felt that he could be in trouble at some point in his college life, If he does not change is approach will dealing with diverse people."
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid is an ongoing process even when you apply early
College Sophomore,1,"I cannot understand why this school is so horrible! No one takes an interest into helping you when asked for, and no one seems to know the answer to anything. I wouldn't choose this school is I could do it all over because it takes forever for you to even start classes."
College Sophomore,1,The students nor the faculty are friendly or helpful what so ever. Ask them a question and its a round about answer that you get. No one tells you what you need to know till the last minute and then accuse you of never asking. I've grown tired of this school and hope to transfer as soon as possible.
College Junior,1,"The career counselors are unfriendly and very hurried. Both times I went to their offices, they were very discouraging and almost mean. They seemed rushed for time and I didn't feel welcome there."
College Sophomore,1,"No Way! I absolutely hate online classes. But it varies with the person. For me, it is definitely a last resort."
College Freshman,1,"Online Work – I really don't like online classes. I have attempted two and ended up failing one and withdrawing from the other. If your a busy person I wouldn't recommend online work because it can easily be forgotten about. Its not that the workload was heavy for me; its just that it was always the last thing on my mind, literally."
College Sophomore,1,Fairly Useless – The school offers no scholarships to foreign students whatsoever. Most of the students are on financial aid and barely pay a cent for the college thus I feel as though they should make more of an effort to support those who dont have financial aid

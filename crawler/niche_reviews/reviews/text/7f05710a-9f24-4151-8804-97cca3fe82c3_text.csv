Junior,5,All staff are hands on  and provide excellent resources. They are aware of possible obstacles that may occur and try to help students avoid them at all costs. It is very easy to reach faculty and information is always available on the school website and email.
Junior,5,"Online classes are pretty easy! In order to succeed, I give myself time to study and focus on the information provided online. Books are now available via web so it makes it easier to have the materials needed to complete the course. The professors are easy to reach and the coursework is very thorough."
Sophomore,5,Online is great. The teachers are willing to teach and they will always help you when it is needed. Online is great but some of the staff sucks
Niche User,5,I learned a lot the years I attended because the pass faculty really cared from 2008 to 2015.  I am not sure what the faculty is like now.
Niche User,5,"Online classes were ok teaching myself, but the online classes where the professor interacted online was great."
Freshman,5,I liked that the school gave me a chance. Always made sure that I was taken care of money wise and academic wise. Great sincere people.
Freshman,5,Overall this school is average. It could be a lot better if they where more interested when it comes to the student education as a whole.
Freshman,5,The teachers want to see you flourish excel and be successful. I think they should make it to where you can major and minor in different subjects.
Niche User,5,"So far,I've had a great experience at Atlanta Metro,the teachers are impeccable,and I feel very sure of myself when I'm in the classroom or in an online course.I am a dual enrollment student ,so the transition from high school to college early was very scary ,but everyone at Atlanta Metro made me feel welcomed."
Senior,5,"The professors are helpful and understanding. The class scheduling is flexible, which works well for students with jobs. The tuition is not expensive and the food is delicious, especially the lunch special. The after school clubs and activities are enjoyable. The necessary changes I would have would be increasing the staff, especially in financial aid, and having more Bachelor Degree options available.  Long story short, I love it here."
Freshman,5,"Atlanta Metropolitan State College has some great professors. The tuition is very affordable. It is apart the USA, which is makes Atlanta Metropolitan State College accredited in state of Georgia. However the cost of school is cheaper than any other state. Atlanta Metropolitan State College just started a four year program, which is the LOWEST costing school in Georgia."
Freshman,5,"When I went to visit and apply to Atlanta metropolitan state college I saw a great environment , great admissions counselor I worked with Ms. Shontae Hogan’s she know I really wanted to get into this college she helped me every step of the way told me everything I needed to know and what I needed to get done and I was able to overcome and get accepted into the Atlanta metropolitan state college , great Acadmeics and cool campus housing choices .

Sophomore,5,"AMSC is a great school for every student. The professors here are awesome, always willing to help students."
Junior,5,I personally love Atlanta Metropolitan State College. The campus is beautiful and you can really see the transformation happening. It is somewhat a small school so the staff  to student ratio is low which helps a lot when I need assistance in the classroom and assistance with other problems I may have on campus. It’s also a blessing to have a low staff to student ratio because sitting in financial aid isn’t as bad as they are at other schools. My overall experience is a ten out of ten!
Freshman,5,"I haven't started school there yet, but so far the overall process of getting admitted and signing up for classes has been great. Everyone is a big help and they make sure that i am getting the information that i need to be sucessful at their school."
Freshman,5,"Very friendly and helpful staff, teachers always work the extra mile to help you achieve your long term goal."
Freshman,5,My experience is going great. The campus is large but not large enough where you can't get around in a decent amount of time. The class sizes are not overly packed so the professor can help and answer questions.
College Junior,5,AMSC is very flexible with classes. You can choose to have classes on the weekends or at night. The classes are designed to help the students get what they need.
College Junior,5,"AMSC has a plethora of work-study opportunities and has even hosted a couple of job fairs, with companies ranging from Microsoft, Allied Barton, and Google."
College Junior,5,Attending AMSC is a home away from home. You get to meet a lot of new people and have the opportunity to experience new activities. The faculty is always there to help you know matter what the situation is.
College Junior,5,I was able find classes to fit my schedule.
College Junior,5,It's what you make it. If you put in the work then you should succeed.
College Junior,5,The class sizes are not to large where the teacher does not interact with a student. Now that they offer Bachelor's degrees is great not have to change campuses.
College Junior,5,My major is biology. The equipment is state of the art. The workload is what you make it. The courses are applicable to my major and my future major of biological sciences.
College Junior,5,This the best school for me. Its a very walk able campus. The professors are very nice. People a kind and willing to help if they see you need help.
College Freshman,5,I love that most of the class sizes are small because the level of interaction with the students is more ideal. It even affects the office hours making tour professor more available for private study if you need it.
College Junior,5,The admission process was a breeze. I was able to come and take the compass test and pass.
College Senior,5,Career Center is great they keep us update with internship opportunities and job opening. They even had a resume writing and practice interview session. They are Awesome.
Recent Alumnus,5,central location great professors and staff

College Senior,5,"Our tuition is manageable, and the financial aid advisors do all they can to help"
College Junior,5,You get to know the student s who have the same major as you very well. There are only 4 required classes for my major so we will see each other in all of our classes. We work together and create connections that will come in handy in the future.
College Junior,5,It is a really big campus and you can find a lot of quiet spaces to relax or study. Most buildings look new or regenerated. Georgia State University is a really big campus but it is a great campus.
College Junior,5,Georgia State University is in downtown Atlanta and they are 2nd rank of one of the top schools. I would say that's a plus because you can have job opportunities.
College Junior,5,I made it through my first semester at Georgia State University and so far it is a great school.
College Junior,5,I never realized how much activities you can do especially if you have a big gap in between classes. I can use the time to work out or sign up for certain classes.
College Junior,5,It is possible to be successful and work. They make it very easy for you to do both.
College Junior,5,You get what you pay for. I think that the teachers and they resources that you get there well over exceed the amount you are paying in tutition and fees.
College Junior,5,Online classes are good. They give you a chance to learn on your own and also a chance to be independent. They differ because you're pretty much on your own schedule and you don't have anyone making sure you get the work done.
College Junior,5,Majority of the student body work and have a family. There are some people there who don't fall under that.
Freshman,4,Much more efficient with the assignments everything mostly is online other than the textbooks for the courses. Less chaotic than papers.
Niche User,4,Atlanta Metropolitan State College is an average college but it does give you that one and one help that you do not normally find in any other college/universities. I only know this beacause my brother attends.
Freshman,4,This school great for people that has families and full time jobs. I would like to see more student interactions.
Freshman,4,"I like the small campus and class size that the institution offers. The tuition is affordable and the professors are very hands on with students and their success. What I would like to see is student housing, a better meal program, and more extra-curricular activities. I would also like to see more school spirit and the reinstatement of the school's basketball team."

Atlanta Metropolitan State College makes sure that students have weekly seminars that they can attend at their own will. The professors on the other hand can be difficult, but its college! We all need a challenge in our lives. Many professors are there to help you in succeeding to reach your dreams. I use ratemyprofessor.com when choosing any of my instructors. The cafeteria is awesome! They have foods of your liking at any time. This school is a community college for anyone who stays in the Atlanta area. There is no housing so tuition is really cheap and affordable. If you are looking for a school that allows you to work around your schedule, then Atlanta Metropolitan State College is the right school for you."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Atlanta Metropolitan State College my experience there's is great due to the very good professors. I like the class room sizes of AMSC which is 20-30 students per class, because I can build a better relationship with the professor. The school is so far good , but joining the clubs is difficult, because they aren't available."
Sophomore,4,The school has a welcoming staff and environment. The teachers are always on time and work with the students even after class yours. There are other students that like to help when you have difficulty in class.
Junior,4,"I like how AMSC treat their student as family. The Professors are very friendly and are willing to help you, to push you so you can achieve your dreams."
Sophomore,4,I like that I can take classes at my own pace. The professors are really hands on and the class room setting is really small and I can get a lot of things done that way .
College Junior,4,"Online courses are basically like social media, except you get graded for the work you've done. How much time you put into it will reflect in your grades"
College Junior,4,Professors at this school are really caring and want you to succeed. They will help you in any way possible as long as they see you putting forth the effort as well to make the class work for you

College Junior,4,"AMSC is the perfect conduit for any college student pursuing a Bachelor's or Master's degree(s), at a more prestigious University.  My institution provides the necessary exposure for students beginning their college experience.  From instruction to administrative help, AMSC's Staff&Faculty foster a warm and compassionate learning environment."
College Junior,4,The advisers really help you to make sure you're in the correct field.

College Senior,4,"Just like any school, there were teachers that cared and those that did not, overall communication is key to being successful at this school as far as class is concerned"
College Senior,4,"I love the school! I would recommend starting off college at this school to just about anyone due to the fact that it is super affordable, there is room to be successful and the professors are awesome, as well as the staff. However, I would advise only an associate degree here as there are no dormitories and commuting can become a hassle if you live far."
College Junior,4,"I actually don't take an online course from the school I go to. It's an eCore from another University in Georgia. I like it but online classing can be tedious and feel like more work than it actually is and finding assignments is very hard. If it isn't necessary, do not register for an online course."
College Junior,4,Your degree is always valuable. It's in how well you did in your classes (GPA) that really counts.
College Junior,4,"The professors are great. Especially in English, Math, and Fine Arts. They are the best at what they do because they love what they do!"
College Freshman,4,My only issue with this school is the lack of communication throughout the departments where you are going back and forth between the offices.
College Freshman,4,I love that although it is an online class you still can go to office hours and the teacher knows who you are.
College Freshman,4,This school is great for beginners who didn't do great in high school but want a second chance. If you apply yourself this school truly helps you.
Recent Alumnus,4,Good classes but need improvement.
College Student,4,"The school location is very close, and easy to get to."

College Senior,4,"This school is a great school, especially if you are planning to transfer to a four year university. The professors are more hands on, convenient , and their office hours are very organized and flexible. The President is very hands on with the students at this school, and so are some of the staff."

College Freshman,4,"Its a very affordable school, and even offers a flexible pay schedule."
College Freshman,4,I was able to create a schedule that helped me most.
College Freshman,4,Its a small community where students can learn and enjoy the company and support of friends and staff.
College Senior,4,"We have a new gym, student center and bookstore. Very resourceful!"
College Senior,4,"Depends on the staff member but as a whole, great staff"
College Junior,4,Most of the facilities are great. There are not that many computer labs that are for all students. The computer for all students ate located only in the library building.
College Junior,4,"I have been able to get most of my classes scheduled around the time and days that I wanted

The exceptions are the ones where there were not any available classes during a certain semester or if I waited too late to register for a class"
College Junior,4,We have computer labs for students and visitors with some free printing. The school just rebuilt the student center and added a larger book store and gym. There are few resources for students to take advantage of like the tutoring centers for math and English.
College Freshman,4,AMSC has been a staple in the community for years. I have watched the school grow from a couple of buildings as a junior college to a 4 year state college with several buildings. I love the ease of maneuvering around the campus as well as the new programs added for more educational opprtunities.
College Freshman,4,"The school offcers multiple computer labs in every building except the Physical Education building. The school gives each student money on their identification cards to use for printing. The wireless network is average depending on the amount of students logged in, but the availability of computer labs renders the need for a personal computer obsolete."
College Freshman,4,"The school recently renovaed the student center which boasts a new gym and activity center for students use. The library offers great services, such as computers and book loan program. "
College Freshman,4,"Atlanta Metropolitan State College employs knowledgable professors dedicated to their craft. The curriculum is consistent with subject content. The registartion process is simple, especially with early registration offered. The workload is suitable for all types of learners and the learning support center allows those with difficulties to get available tutoring."
College Freshman,4,The school offers different times and days for the appropriate classes needed for my degree.
College Junior,4,"Well you finally have your major classes to be more successful and to accept a career in your field. Although it is much more occupation because when it comes to your major more work and study is needed. However, art classes fill up fast especially for the graphics design class. It is best to get overflow forms also depending on the student as well. Overall they are great classes."
College Junior,4,"I am a transfer student from another school, because I've already taken my core classes. All I have to do is my major classes which is a good thing."
College Junior,4,It is great meeting new people especially at your level. You may have younger generations and older generations as friends. Hey they are people too. But it is great to know people and how they are.
College Junior,4,I always get financial aid because I don't have to pay a dime to go to school. Although I still would apply for scholarships and grants just in case if I don't have enough for the year. 
Niche User,2,Metropolitan College was a wonderful institution. They offered state of the art facilities. Up to date technology throughout the campus. An engaging student center. Also knowledgeable professors were always available when needed outside of class. The location of the campus is great.
Sophomore,2,"My withdrawal form had not been put into the system, and there was new staff.  I was in debt almost $3,000 for another semester I had unknowingly been registered for."
College Senior,2,"If you get to the classes during early registration there are some flexibility,, yet all classes are not up, you have to wait for reasonable options during regular registration. uncomfortable experience"
College Senior,2,Not really talked about... from my experience
College Senior,2,"Though i put a bad rating, the school has room to grow! this school is unlike any other college as far as student engagement. The students are just not interested. Can be a little unprofessional at times."
College Freshman,2,I prefer the traditional classroom experience versus online courses. The peer to peer interaction is necessary and more conducive to a proper learning environment. Also the availability of the professor is a big plus.
College Sophomore,2,From what i have seen it works when it wants to & dose not when it wants too!
College Sophomore,2,"I just have to do what i need to do , dispite if they will help me or not , for poeple that work in the public relation dept. they realy do not care or wantto help anyone."
College Sophomore,2,"Slow, Disrespectful, Unhelpful in many ways , Will not & wil  not explain things to poeple who ask , and treat poeple as if they are suppose to know ."
College Freshman,2,The school uses a new program called D2L. No one seems to know how to use it. Sometimes it takes longer than normal for the professors to connect with students.
College Junior,2,"Majority Work Aleast One Job. Majority of the students work aleast one job. 85% of the students are parents that carry other responsibilities. They are surrounded by different age groups, different religious, and backgroung. This allows you to explore your peers outlook on life and school. they are also trying to maintain grades so that they can end with a career and not just a job."
College Sophomore,2,"Small Computer Lab – They charge for Printing , and You only allow to print one page. The wireless access is free. Some days the wireless does not work"
College Sophomore,2,Not Very Good – Having only just expanded to a four year college rating there is very little in the way of graduate support. Most stay for two years then move on. I have not heard of any help with finding work and the like.
College Senior,2,"My school mostly consist of people who work a full- time job, and just there to get their GPA up so they may transfer. Most of the students are not really as focused as they should be but they are getting better."
College Sophomore,2,Alumni Network Weak – There are very few alumni events held on campus. Graduating students do not know there is an alumni chapter. The alumni chapter does not sponsor anything for students. They have little or no visible presence.
Sophomore,1,"Currently enrolled here. Ive done 4 semesters straight. Now that i am about to graduate and transfer they dropped my financial aid. They have terrible communication. Dont answer the phone, wont email you back, and have an attitude when you do call. I would not advise anyone to enroll here."
College Sophomore,1,This isn't like a typical college campus.
College Sophomore,1,This school is very good for people that want to save money. DO NOT think you can come here and slack. The teachers teach at all universities in GA and are hard. I am a biology major
College Senior,1,I don't have any insight from my school on my specific major
College Sophomore,1,"The school's tuition and financial aid process is very frustrating only because if you get one thing wrong on your FASFA, you will be sent a verification letter explaining that you were ""randomly selected"".  If it's one time...Ok.  But twice?  I'm not dumb.  And this is after I turned in my FASFA forms on time.  Then when the semester is about to start, I learn I don't have any money for books.  I ask what can I do, and the advisor says to take out a loan...even though all I had to do was to sign up for another class in order for me to have access to the rest of the money.  I eventually sign up for another class, but I have learned that most of the financial advisors are not generally to be trusted for some things."
College Sophomore,1,"My professor wasn't an idiot by any means, but when it comes to interaction, she was either very cold, or somewhat warm.  And her demeanor did little to cool my classmate's frustration.  However, when interacting with her face-to-face, she was warmer than usual, and I liked seeing that side of her more.  I didn't get the grade I wanted because of my own faults, not hers.  Even though I studied, I didn't study well enough, so hence my grade.  But I learned that not every professor is going to be friendly in the classroom and I should try to get them during their office hours more often if I need help in the class."
College Junior,1,It is not separate from the rest of the community colleges.
College Junior,1,"Need Improvement – When it comes to class registration process, it is a terrible time in AMC.i basically walk all around campus, from building to building, before you is actually completed with registering for a semester."
College Sophomore,1,Staff Frustration – Staff is not friendly at all. It's hard to find a staff to help to find important information to be successful.
College Junior,1,"Never Again – Atlanta Metropolitan College has some of the worst staff and faculty members. They aren't really helpful, they have attitude problems. The teachers/proffesors have an habit of calling students grades out in front of the whole class, which is not only unprofessional but against school policy."

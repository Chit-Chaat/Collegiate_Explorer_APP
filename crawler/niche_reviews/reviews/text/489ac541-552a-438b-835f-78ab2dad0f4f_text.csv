Sophomore,5,"At Fairmont, this was the first time that I was introduced to online classes. At first, I was shaky about them, until I realized I could do them on my own time. If I get it out of the way for my other classes and athletics, it saves me so much time."
Sophomore,5,"It feels like home to me. I did not want to move so far away from home. As only a 2 hour drive, it is nice to be able to live your own life the way you want on this campus. So many things to do and many nice people to meet."
Sophomore,5,"The professors were great with online, they got back to you very quickly if you were having problems"
Sophomore,5,I love fairmont state I tried WVU 10 years ago and it wasn't a good fit. I decide to go back this year and finish what I started. I came from a small high school. So the smaller sizes of class & the one on one with the instructors is awesome. Would not change a thing.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this university, they are really worried about their students and their grades! I cannot thank the advisors and facility enough for helping me, and caring about my grades."
Niche User,5,I have visited this college on many occasions and it is the top college on my list. I have a desire to join the flight program at this school and would 100 percent recommend it to all my friends and family in West Virginia.
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoyed the small campus. The overall help from all staff and teachers was excellent. The ""party scene"" was strictly off campus and allowed for the school to focus on academics and sports."
Junior,5,"Fairmont state university is an excellent institution who makes student fell like home. Faculty and staff are remarkable and are always on stand by to help the students.
Being an international student,  i was afraid of not being accepted as I am, but once I entered the university and met the faculty and colleagues they made me feel welcome.
I am currently in the process of becoming an Mechanical engineer, and so far I have been motivated and fascinated for what my department offers me during the classes.
I conclude this review, describing Fairmont State University as an excellent institution."
Sophomore,5,"I like Fairmont State university due to it's location, size, and affordability. FSU's campus is located far away enough from home to where the area feels new but not completely unfamiliar. I did not want to go to a campus near home because I wanted to see a bit more of what is beyond the boundaries of my hometown. FSU is also a smaller campus compared to nearby colleges. The classes are smaller, which means I can develop a more personal relationship with professors and meet people easier. FSU is a school I would consider a good ""bang for your buck"" school, filled with plenty of friendly faces and lots of programs to choose from!"
Sophomore,5,Liked the size and location. The class size is much better than your larger schools. I do wish I had access to more aid so would not end up in debt.
Freshman,5,I Fairly enjoyed Fairmont State. I would prefer a major in Videogame Design to be added to Fairmont State.
Niche User,5,"Their Maroon and White Day was very informational! I loved their small campus and friendly staff and students! I enjoyed visiting their campus and I am excited to be an upcoming freshman this year! I am excited to see what they can offer to my education and for my future, I am glad I picked Fairmont State University for my home for the next four years! All of their professors and students were very open and inviting to the freshman visiting and they all wanted to help the best they could and they made an effort to remember your name and where you came from."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent university 
On behalf of mechanical department  I can say that this department is perfect in every way
All classes are interesting and the teachers are amazing"
Niche User,5,"When I visited Fairmont State it felt like a well rounded, helpful institution with great qualities and great people."
Sophomore,5,My college experience at Fairmont State so far has been excellent! The professors genuinely care about every student and they take they time to personally get to know you as an individual. Not to mention we have some of the best places to hang out and get food and drinks right on campus.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from Potomac state college of WVU. Fairmont state welcomed me with open arms and allowed me to become a falcon right on the spot. Financial aid, student mentors, and teachers all gave me answers when asked and helped me when i was struggling. the only thing i would have to say i dont like is the fact the university is on a hill! It is quite the workout i must say. other than that, Fairmont is my second home!"
Sophomore,5,"I started attending Fairmont State in fall of 2017. I was a recent graduate of a local high school in the area. Like any other new student I was nervous, but the staff, and my academic adviser made me feel more than welcome! They go above and beyond to help their students, and they really do care about your academic success. Fairmont State also has a beautiful campus, surrounded by plenty of housing, and a diverse community. I have only been a student there for a year now, but I have loved every minute there. It's safe to say when graduation day arrives I will miss Fairmont State's campus, and the staff working there."
Freshman,5,I like the small campus and the one on one attention from professors and advisors. They always make time to answer any questions.
Sophomore,5,they provide accommodations for people who drive and often free food and snack along with a library you can take naps in so you're not living in your car.
Alum,5,"FSU is a small school, so you get lots of one-on-one attention. I very much enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond. The teachers really care about their students, and they have a great theatre program."
Junior,5,"I am an Accounting major and I absolutely love it here! The class size is small, so you get one on one time with the teacher, who knows your name. The teachers care about your education. They are experts in their field, and are great teachers. I would not want to go anywhere else!"
Sophomore,5,"Fairmont has been one of my best experiences thus far in life. I have learned many life lessons, and made many lifelong friends along the way."
Freshman,5,I love how the entire universty is accessible by foot travel once on campus. I enjoy the small class size and the interaction with the professors.
Sophomore,5,"It is an amazing environment that is so friendly. Mostly, everyone knows everyone and if not new friendships are established. The classes are very informative. Professors work with the students in the best ways! It is an amazing school and everyone should take time and check out FSU!"
Freshman,5,"Starting college at Fairmont State University was very nerve wracking at first. Once I got on campus I managed to make a lot of friends and become involved. I loved my classes, the professors will help you with anything and everything, they really want to see you succeed. All around the campus, student life and safety of the school is great. I’m loving my time at Fairmont State."
Niche User,5,"Fairmont State, are nice and easy to work with. The only change I would not mind to see, is pace on application."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the friendliness and environment of this university. Not only was I welcomed to the school with open arms, but I had the opportunity to meet amazing people along the way. There is nothing the staff won’t do to help a student to pursue their career goals."
Senior,5,"I have been attending Fairmont State since August of 2014. Right away they were involved in what I wanted to study. Although I have been put behind a year in the elementary education program, I have had an amazing experience. The professors have a vast interest in your work and grades make you feel like you are welcome and at home."
Sophomore,5,This is a great school. Small but great. Teachers are awesome and truly care about their students learning. It is very easy to get involved with clubs or frats. The school is very proud and has a lot of school spirit.
Sophomore,5,"So far, I have loved all my classes at Fairmont State. The class sizes are small, making it super easy to talk to professors, and to my classmates. The small campus is the best for getting to classes on time, and makes for an easy commute!"
Sophomore,5,I like that Fairmont State is a smaller school and that I don't have to walk very far to get to all of my classes that I have throughout the day. All the professors are very nice and helpful.
Senior,5,I personally love Fairmont State University. The professors care about your success. The campus is beautiful and easily accessible to all.
Freshman,5,I have attended Fairmont State in the past. I am returning there this fall to pursue a degree in Electronics Engineering. The campus is beautiful. The professors are great. I'm excited to see where this takes me!
Freshman,5,Fairmont State is a great college. They always have fun stuff going on. Campus is nice and so are most people.
Freshman,5,"Fairmont State is a great small-town university! It offers small class sizes to give you an individual leaning experience. This allows the student to engage with the professor, rather than being a number in a large crowd. This university rests on a beautiful campus and offers an excellent overall student life."
Junior,5,I really enjoyed coming to Fairmont State.  I was a transfer student and they made the transition so easy.  They were so helpful and nice.  I love it here.  I am doing so much better in my academics.  I feel like the professors have a genuine care for the students and try and be involved as much as possible.  I have yet to have a professor who did not try and be as helpful as possible.  There really is not anything I would change about FSU!
Senior,5,"As a first time college student, FSU had everything I was looking for: close to home, friends, parties to attend at night and classes to attend during the day. I completed my first year of college and left to pursue a vocational degree. As a returning adult student, FSU also fit my needs: a bachelor's degree program to enhance my career, online classes to fit my busy schedule and knowledgeable and compassionate instructors to assist me. I would fully recommend FSU to any student looking to pursue higher education."
Niche User,5,It was amazing. The campus is awesome and the class sizes are smaller. I really enjoyed the tour i got from there and look forward to attending there next fall.
College Junior,5,"I really love my professors, especially in my program. They are very helpful and smart, and they care"
College Sophomore,5,"I have had an outstanding experience so far at this school. The professors have always been available to help and advisors always try to meet with you as soon as they can. Not only that, but the gym at this  school is very nice and an easy thing to do between classes. The fellow students at this school are also very approachable and always willing to help."
College Freshman,5,"The faculty really care about their students and their progress, and always make it a point to talk about their office hours."
College Freshman,5,They have a GSA that meets every Thursday and as far as I know there is no out-right discrimination among students.
College Student,5,I feel very safe in all parts of campus
College Student,5,"FSU is a great school to attend. There are a plethora of opportunities on and off campus. The campus is fairly small, which makes travel easy."
College Freshman,5,The courses are great and the professors are kind and approachable.
College Freshman,5,The campus is amazing and everyone on staff is extremely helpful and caring. The students are very nice and always willing to help
College Freshman,5,The parties can be pretty awesome. That's how you make tons of friends. During welcome weekend I actually met someone from my major and was really excited. We talked about it for a few minutes then went on our ways. The frat houses or baseball/football/cheer/volleyball/etc. houses are the best places to go!
College Student,5,"n ,n ,m ,nb j,m nm"
College Freshman,5,There was a survey That took about two hours explaining sexual harassment and how important it is to report it and not be a victim and know what's going on despite how long it was it was a good thing.
College Junior,5,I love the class diversity.  Some classes are in giant auditoriums and some are in high school sized classrooms.  For the most part the professors are nice.
College Freshman,5,that's pretty much all there is to do in Fairmont is party
College Freshman,5,theres such nice things here. its really beautiful
College Freshman,5,criminal justice is such an awesome major I love it
College Freshman,5,the people here are awesome I really love this school
College Freshman,5,"Has multiple diners, fast food chains, and other restaurants available for students"
College Sophomore,5,even though i dont get financial aid from the government the school worked to get me a small one.
College Sophomore,5,everyone expects college student because thats pretty much what fairmont is is a college town.
College Sophomore,5,there are people from every country and race and every religion and culture. it is most definitely a melting pot.
College Sophomore,5,"They have a good bit of a variety, and the food is delicious."
College Sophomore,5,"It's really good, because there is a bar that is walking distance from campus and there is always someone who is throwing a party."
Junior,4,As a student in the business school I have yet to have a professor that did not want people to fail. All of the professors I have had have been extremely helpful and are willing to take time out of their day to make sure that you comprehend the material. It is a small campus so it’s not that far a walk between classes. The falcon center offers many different things for many different people. From exercise equipment to basketball courts the falcon center has a space all athletes. Along with that they host many different  Intramurals that many of the students take part of. The falcon center is also home to the food court and the dining hall. These are where most of the students congregate and hangout. The falcon center serves as the central feature of the campus and provides everything that a college student needs to be able to live on campus.
Junior,4,"When we had to go online because of Covid-19 it was a smooth transition and I equate that to the amazing professors that the university has. They created inventive ways to interacts with the students and not only wanted to make sure we were doing well as students, but wanted to make sure we  were doing well in a global pandemic as our lives changed."
Freshman,4,"This college offers opportunities for the greatest chance of success. The faculty is helpful when it comes to the enrollment process, especially now due to COVID-19. There has been many set backs but the staff at Fairmont tries their hardest to help the students succeed."
Senior,4,"Small school, small class sizes, great professors. Easy walk from class to class. Going to miss attending this school."
Freshman,4,It’s a very small and tight knit community that I love. My only problem with the school is it’s location.
Freshman,4,"I thoroughly enjoy the campus! Beautiful scenery and it's close together, so the earliest I've ever left for a class is 15 minutes. This college on the hills in truly a serene location to receive my education. The dorms are clean, and it is so easy to get involved and make new friends! With an indoor pool, a large gym, a floating track, a quiet coffee shop, and even a sauna, you can hang out absolutely anywhere with new acquaintances and best friends. I love where I am enrolled, just be prepared for steps!"
Freshman,4,Love the small campus. The staff is very invested into the students . Shout out to my boy Justin in the kitchen !
Freshman,4,"Coming to Fairmont State was one of the best decisions of my life. Not only is the size of the campus ideal, but both the students and the professors are kind and supportive. The types of education programs they have here are amazing and the staff are always willing to help you if you have any issues, whether personal or academic. It is so easy to get involved on campus."
Sophomore,4,The staff here are wonderful. The size of the college allow for a very personal learning experience!
Senior,4,"They get my financial aid wrong every year. Other than that, I enjoy going to school here. The classes are small which is a plus. Dorms are clean. The whole campus is clean. They have a nice cafeteria and gym. They have two pools for students to access."
Sophomore,4,"I love that Fairmont State is such an easy place to get around. Also, the teacher to student ratio is good, and so your professors actually know you by name and it makes everything go a lot smoother. They really care about you there. The dorms are definitely very old and do not receive enough attention by the staff. The cafeteria for on campus living students has very SLIM hours so lets hope your only hungry from like 4pm-6pm on weekends. Greek life is amazing, but sadly they are trying to shut it down for some reason. Love the academics about this campus! Student life and housing? Not so much."
Sophomore,4,"As a rising Sophmore at Fairmont State University. I have had successful freshman activities that have motivated and help me become a great student. Fairmont has many opportunities for students to grow and be frequently involved in their school.  The teachers are always so involved with all students and want to see you succeed. I believe the foundation, Fairmont is built on has made the college a better choice for students. As a proud student athlete, I would like to see Fairmont involve the athletes with  non-athletes more. This could be rallies or even changed dorm room arrangements. I believe if a school is divided will it and can it be stronger than it was as a whole. The coaches tend to want to keep their athletes together, but that then divides the nonathletes from us. My first year has shown me that I only have friends on my team or other athletes. However, I will be sure to reach out to gain more freindships and create new longlasting bonds."
Sophomore,4,"Fairmont State University is, overall, a good school. I only visited Fairmont my junior year of high school and I immediately knew it was where I wanted to earn my degree. My program is smaller compared to others, which is great because I receive the attention needed to help me better understand my field of study and the material covered in my classes. The professors are very helpful and encourage an open door policy with their students. Both the staff and students are friendly. The university also hosts many school and community events, which brings everyone together.

There are a few minor things I would change about the school. I wish the school would help out of state students, like myself, whose tuition is double that of in-state students by implementing a neighboring state cut in tuition, more scholarship opportunities, or options that could cut down tuition."
Niche User,4,Fairmont State had a very helpful staff and a beautiful campus. It was easy to get around and it felt like home.
Junior,4,"Fairmont is a small school, creating a very personal atmosphere and connection to your professors. Here, you're not just a name on a list, but a person who they want to see succeed."
Junior,4,I enjoy going to school here because it is close to home and they treat you well! I feel that our safety should be more of a priority and that our should safety come first!
Sophomore,4,Fairmont is a small university. The nursing program fills up quick. The school also has a lot of different facilities for its students
Junior,4,"Since new presidentcy Fairmont State as a whole has gotten a lot better with admissions, education, and athletics."
Sophomore,4,"Fairmont State University gives you a great college experience with small class sizes, it is located in a college town, and excellent resources for students. The campus constantly has events happening in order to get students more involved, and there are many different types of people that attend FSU. It is located in the mountains in West Virginia in the small town of Fairmont with a plethora of dining options, as well as outdoor recreation. The dorms are brand new and are extremely safe with RA's on duty at all times."
Sophomore,4,"Have been having issues with a few teachers and getting aid, but I love the campus itself. So I overall like it."
Junior,4,You're in classes with 30 people or less. This allows more interaction with professors without feeling like you're just one of many numerous students. It's a smaller campus so getting from one class to another isn't a problem.
Freshman,4,I love how homey FSU is. Everyone that works there is incredibly nice and helpful. I recommend FSU to everyone and am proud to be a Falcon!
Senior,4,"Fairmont State University is a great school to attend if you're a non-traditional or older student. The campus is small and very few classes require you to travel off-campus. Additionally, the classes are fairly small, so you and the professors work very closely together."
Sophomore,4,"I love fairmont state, because here it doesn’t feel like I’m just some number; I feel like the professors interact in the classroom with students very well. Sometimes the professors have trouble getting back to students in out of class situations (via email or blackboard messenger) though. The only thing I would want to change is the ease of asking a professor a question outside of the classroom and that is all."
Freshman,4,Fairmont State is a lovely university with a great staff. I especially enjoy how friendly our admissions office is. The campus is small but is big enough for a great college experience. I personally love it here and cannot wait to see what this school has in store for me. The classes are great and they are not huge like some university's can have. This is great to build relationships with professors and hopefully that can lead to internships and many more opportunities.
Freshman,4,All the professors are really nice and easy to approach. They really want their students to succeed. Everyone is really nice and the classes aren't too big. The food is good and there are tons of stuff to do. The dorms are pretty good and the campus is really pretty and quiet.
Freshman,4,The falcon center is a huge plus. They've just built brand new apartment styled housing as well. The only thing that I wish that they would fix is the extremely strict rules for residence hall students. Not being allowed to have extension cords is a real hassle.
Freshman,4,This school is somewhat small which makes it nice because you have more of a chance that your teacher can help you. It is also nice because if you know people here it is not hard to see them around campus.
College Junior,4,"We all we required to take a small online course on personal safety and the services available from campus, which we were given credit points for."
College Junior,4,"Ive never attended the actual sports games but the university has a very nice football and baseball field. Also, a volley ball net is on campus."
College Junior,4,The professors at FSU are very passionate about their teachings of subject for the class. The administrative department could be easier to contact when help is needed.
College Junior,4,"I like that my school is small, and the professors are very helpful and nice."
College Sophomore,4,Really no issue at this school
College Junior,4,"I love my college very much. I love the atmosphere as well as the students i have met, and the professors I have met, however, i do think there could be some improvements."
College Junior,4,"I believe that there is a very promising chance of getting a job after leaving Fairmont state as long as the student chose a career field that is in demand. The professors help with scholarships, and they help in any other ways that they can so its up to the student to succeed with the help they are given."
College Junior,4,"I think most of the people involved in greek life on campus care about helping the community, but some are just interested in partying."
College Junior,4,"I think out athletics program is amazing. The coaches are very encouraging, and they make sure that they keep the players on track."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love Fairmont State. I feel that the professors as well as the staff in general are very helpful, and they actually care about the success of the students."
College Student,4,"My school experience has been great. My favorite part about my school is the counselors there; they have always kept me where I need to be. Another factor that made my school experience better was the sporting events and community service activities, along with the clubs and organizations, I participated in. Being active in school really makes things easier!"
College Sophomore,4,"Great resources for students, and great activities. Advisors and faculty could be a little more helpful"
College Sophomore,4,I've always felt safe on campus & never felt like I was in harms way
College Sophomore,4,All professors want to see students succeed. They're always willing to help. Class sizes are nice & there's a great variety of courses offered.
College Sophomore,4,A degree from this school is very valuable. It's said Fairmont graduates are offered jobs first.
College Sophomore,4,Very good nursing program. I would choose this school again.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Not the best school you'll ever attend, but a very solid and safe backup choice.  Academically, very strong.  There's some small-town school drama, though."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Better than most in the state (and the best in many fields), but it's not a top-tier school because of lack of funding and hiring pool."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Not a lot of problems in general.  Our upper administration likes to sweep things under the rug, but most of the mid-level admins are very adamant about addressing issues, and quickly."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Well, I've worked with housing and residence life since I arrived here, and I don't see many problems internally.  A lot of our staff genuinely cares about the students.  There's a lot of money issues that prevent our more ambitious projects, and some of the staff is sub-par because we have a small hiring pool, but most of us do try very hard to keep the students happy."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have some complaints about recent administrative monetary misuse, and the administration's dismissive view of students as a whole, but the faculty and staff are great and there are no other major issues, so it's pretty good."
College Freshman,4,I love Fairmont State University. It's close to my hometown. The class sizes are relatively small but still large enough.
College Freshman,4,"Yes, you have your people that show up to their dorms positively soused, but their friends encourage them to go to bed and many people offer to be DDs. The same works with weed, although people usually just stay in their rooms and try to smoke as discretely as they can."
College Junior,4,Social Sciences department is top notch. National Security/Criminal Justice in particular have top notch staff.
College Freshman,4,The value of this degree will be huge. I can't wait to get all degrees and be done
College Freshman,4,It's great! I love my professors and my program! Cant wait to continue!
College Student,4,Many students receive jobs on campus in the field they are looking to find.
College Student,4,I've had a great experience thus far in my college career.
College Student,4,I really like the campus housing. It has been a great experience.
College Student,4,"Currently our basketball team is ranked number three in the country. I, however, am a fan of the arts and I do not pay much attention to the athletics on campus"
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at Fairmont State bring the student body together.
College Sophomore,4,"Fairmont State has many good qualities along with a few negative. Campus is beautiful! For the most part classes are small. Teachers are helpful in my experience. A few negatives include campus security could be better, classes become over packed, the wifi does not work fifty percent of the time, and campus needs more student parking."
Freshman,2,Good campus life I love chi alpha but too much drama and racism Alicia the head of housing is very rude
College Sophomore,2,"Football is horrible. It's sad though, there's some talent on the team"
College Freshman,2,No one seems to want to stay long enough to earn a degree in the first place.
College Freshman,2,No one supports each other and the school does nothing to showcase anyone's abilities.
College Freshman,2,I hear students talking about drugs and alcohol all the time
College Freshman,2,There is no protection for people walking campus at night
College Senior,2,Drunkenness causes fights around here. It's dangerous and annoying.
College Senior,2,The financial aid process was a mess! I suggest being prepared to fill out a ton of papers.
College Junior,2,Very boring and all the parties are either fraternities and sororities or at this run down bar in the middle of nowhere.
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any.I received one $500 scholarship, but when expenses are in the thousands it doesn't help very much."
College Sophomore,2,Apply as early as you can
College Sophomore,2,Its alright. Not the greatest.
College Junior,2,Just don't even try the parties. They're not worth the time.
College Freshman,2,Winters here get really bad.
College Sophomore,2,Most people smoke weed. It's normal here.
College Student,2,nothing ever to  do in fairmont
College Student,2,fairmont needs a chick-fil-a or a pop-eyes
College Junior,2,"There aren't many off-campus housing selections to choose from and what is available is poorly maintained. The cost is outrageous considering the living conditions, deteriorated roads and limited parking. Although, many are close to campus and provide convenience for the students. There aren't many places to shop nearby."
College Junior,2,"While for the most part my personal experience has been positive, this school does not have the appropriate amount of staffing in that department. They overlook a lot and miss things. I had been receiving the PROMISE scholarship (the WV state scholarship) and the semester I lost it, my package included it until several weeks into the following semester and I was made to pay it back, despite it being their mix-up. I know for fact that there are a great many other sorts of issues around the start of the semester and this year they started cutting it for people who would have received difference checks to help pay for things like books and gas."
College Junior,2,"It's a bit half-and-half. This is a dry campus, and dorm rooms are inspected frequently. Plus the visitors for the dorms are carded for IDs and the person they are visiting has to sign them in and out. On the other hand, there are a lot of smokers all over campus. You cannot go into the Engineering and Technology building without going through a wall of smoke. And outside Jaynes, the Business and Language building, there's a lot of smokers.
Academic honesty is a big deal, but I personally haven't seen anyone cheating nor have I cheated, so I don't know how much the University itself responds to that. The professors themselves, on the other hand, they spell out the first day that they do not tolerate it. At all."
College Junior,2,"Greek life at FSU is what you make of it. If you choose to be in a frat or sorority then so be it, if not then okay. I will say that at FSU frats and sororities will try their hardest to get you to join, but if you don't you aren't looked at badly."
Recent Alumnus,2,I am not too aware of what drugs are on campus. I do know there has been an increase in Police enforcement in the city itself.
College Freshman,2,"There's a bus that runs regularly around campus that is free for students. Fairmont is kind of in the middle of nowhere so a car would be extremely helpful to get to where you need to go. If it's any store other than Wal-Mart, you'll most likely have to go to Clarksburg or Morgantown."
College Senior,2,Fairmont is under construction.  They ars building the city up. Close to numerous restaurants and fast food places. Two towns with malls within 30 min drive
College Sophomore,2,There are really very few options off campus (that are reasonable distance). There are a few Mexican resturants that are really good - otherwise it is mostly fast food type places
College Junior,2,"Many students abuse substances whether it's prescription drugs or regular drugs such as Ltd, marijuana, cocaine, etc."
College Junior,2,Parking is horrible. Restaurants are not close enough. Clean area. Safe.
College Freshman,2,There are very few restaraunts and they are not close to campus.
College Freshman,2,Finding a parking place at campus can be hard during the first few weeks due to the amount of individuals attending and on campus to get assistance from student services.
College Senior,2,"pretty much all white , alot of stupid people so i guess thats some diversity"
College Sophomore,2,The athletics at this University are not very big. The events are attended but not a lot of people know when games even are to attend. I wish that the fan support for these sports were bigger and more people talked about the sports around the campus.
College Freshman,2,Doesn't offer a lot that I am actually interested in.
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot right around campus.  Some scattered about town, but nothing to brag about."
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes if they give you a scholarship for one year, they will take it back the next with out question and for no reason."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is definitely an issue.  There is not much space for a lot of people to park.  As well, the spots fill up rather quickly.  I think they need to make more room."
College Sophomore,2,The library is wonderful. It's very clean and they make things easy to find.
College Junior,2,"My Material and Process class only had to instructors which weren't enough for the amount of student that were in that class. Even though the professors tried their best to get things done with everyone, it was difficult for everyone t learn equally."
College Senior,2,I do not use public transportation on account of it insufficient running times. I have to drive 20 miles a day to classes in bridgeport wv because our school doesnt offer a bus to go there
College Freshman,2,"Fairmont State University has great potential but everyone who goes here lives within an hour from the school. This means they all go home because for some reason home is more fun than getting drunk and hooking up with college girls. Currently, there are 2 minor Frats. They don't really have a house designated for them either! Pretty sad. Girls arent the best, but that just gives everybody more of a reason to go to WVU."
College Freshman,2,"Slim Pickings – The Cafeteria is open for 3 hours for each meal. Weekend meals require a separate meal plan. If you want pizza, better go to little caesars off campus because in the Caf, the pizza is always the consistancy of plastic. The Nickel is a little place to eat in the Falcon Center, but its hours of operation are pretty slim. The food here is a lot better than the Caf, but your meal plan money wont work here. Its stupid."
Freshman,1,"Terrible school. I  went here my freshman year of college and I regret it so much. It was such a waste of my money.  It truly feels as if i   am not getting challenged in any of my classes and some of the assignments professors give are assignments that freshman in high school receive. There is nothing to do around campus, and nothing to do in the town. If you don't do a sport you're not going to feel as if you're important. Not to mention they are processing a law that allows students to bring concealed carry on campus. Which makes non of the students feel as if they're safe. Don't go here."
College Freshman,1,I genuinely hate this school. It ruined the idea of the college for me and I can't wait to transfer.
College Freshman,1,"The AC systems don't work half of the time, and I'm pretty sure there is mold growing in the dirty communal bathrooms."
College Freshman,1,No one takes anything seriously and the greek like is not well liked.
College Freshman,1,"This school is in a run down town and doesn't deserve the title of University. It's more like a terrible community college, with nothing to do and rude students. The people are rude, and my quality of life has gone down exponentially while attending this school."
College Junior,1,don't do greek at Fairmont!!
College Junior,1,transportation options are bad in fairmont
College Student,1,theres not much diversity here
College Student,1,uhhh i don't drink or do drugs
College Student,1,sororities  and frats in famous don't get that much love
College Freshman,1,"Most of the off-campus dining options aren't close to the school. To get a decent selection of places, you need to either go to Morgantown or Clarksburg."
College Junior,1,"I don't actually live on campus, but I hear nothing about sports on campus.  Very few students even wear Fairmont State attire.  The ones that do are usually together, so I would assume they are connected by a sport or group of some sort.  However, I have seen photos on Facebook of students attending football games.  Therefore, my school does have some sort of school spirit."
College Sophomore,1,"Fairmont Is Not the City You Go Out in – Fairmont is a very spread out town. The bars are small college dives. If you want to go out for a night, then you drive to Morgantown."
College Junior,1,"Better Get to School Early – A parking garage was built but still does not solve the parking problem.  This is a college where the majority commute.  If you get to school past 9:00 am, it is difficult to find a place to park unless you are in the ball field.  The parking garage is often full not long after this time and on the other side of campus, more spaces are taken away from students for faculty.  I would hate to be a handicapped student trying to park.  The spaces for them is even more limited.  One more thing, the parking garage is already showing signs of falling in after only a minimal number of years of being in existance."
College Sophomore,1,"When I applied for financial aid, my dad was making far less than the previous year due to an unfortunate job transition. It was also less than fortunate that we had to use his job records for the previous year on the FASFA forms. To make a long story short, I have to work my way through college to help my dad pay for it so that we won't have too much money to pay back in student loans. Though I've enjoyed my experience in college, I am rather disappointed in Fairmont State's inability to acknowledge extenuating circumstances."
College Freshman,1,"While there are some sororities and fraternities, there really arent many to choose from. Some Ive never even heard of."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid staff at FSU often seems unwilling to offer as much help as students need in many ways.

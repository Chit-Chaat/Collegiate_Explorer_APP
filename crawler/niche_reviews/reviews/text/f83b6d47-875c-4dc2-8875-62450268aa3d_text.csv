Sophomore,5,"Yes, Wells is a very small school in the middle of nowhere, but it also comes with a very tight-knit community. Campus may be small, but since it's so old and the some of the building plans are more ""complex"", there's so many cool spots to find. Plus the outside area is beautiful, particularly in fall when the leaves are changing.

The food is pretty bad, but not inedible, and it gives you and your friends a reason to take one of the free shuttles offered by the school and eat out for dinner some night in Ithaca or Auburn. 

There are so many traditions, like Odd/Even and Weihnachten, that make Wells one of the most unique colleges you'll find. 

Almost all of the professors are great here. Most of them respond to their students quickly, and are willing to make accommodations, especially during the current pandemic. 

Overall, and in spite of the issues that it has, I'm very glad that I picked Wells College. It's definitely become my home away from home during the school year."
Sophomore,5,"Wells College is a little university right on Cayuga lake. Its small, quaint, homey friendly and the perfect spot for people looking to make friends and take full responsibility for your career. The have an incredible and supportive staff, providing every opportunity to assist you on your path. The opportunities on campus are plentiful. That goes for work opportunities post graduation and internships."
Sophomore,5,"The online part of education at Wells is new to the pandemic,but the school has adapted very well to the new conditions. Lectures have been shifted to online, labs split the class in half and alternate days of face to face lab hours.  All classes are made available in the chance you can not come to class due the virus.Overall a pleasant experience, during trying times."
Sophomore,5,Although I prefer in class. Online was the only option this past spring. All of my professors understood the circumstances and tried to help in any way. All in all everybody who I talked to feels Wells handled online learning the best they could.
Sophomore,5,"Wells is a small college, but perfect if your looking for a school where you truly matter, and aren’t just a number. As an athlete, it is great being part of a team. The professors truly care and help in any way. Wells is a tight knit community where relationships truly matter and I feel the ones that I’ve made will last a lifetime. I can’t wait to get back to campus"
Senior,5,"Honestly, I have loved being at Wells all four years. If you are looking for more of a large campus and such, then Wells probably won't be the right fit for you. However, I was only looking at small schools. I love the fact that I have been able to have close relationships with all my professors as well as the staff members. Wells also has the cutest, quirky traditions that bring the whole campus together as well as making the school that much more unique. Wells has been my home for four years and I wouldn't trade any of my experiences there for the world. Additionally,  I was incredibly shy before coming to Wells and throughout my time here I was able to break out of my shell. I now can leave Wells confidently knowing I've gained valuable skills that I can use to carry me into my future."
Freshman,5,"Wells College is a small hidden gem in Aurora, NY. As a first year at this college, I feel like the academics I am being taught will actually help me after this. Overall professor are extremely kind and want whats best for you along with the rest of the faculty."
Freshman,5,When I first visited Wells I thought this is not for me!!!  Then after visiting again and staying on campus and meeting the other students and interacting with some professors a feeling of belonging overcame me.  I was accepted to over 10 colleges all well known but I felt like a number.  So far I love the college and am very pleased with my decision.
Sophomore,5,Wells is a perfect campus for someone who likes the small town atmosphere like myself. I love that I receive one on one help with my professors and that I have a personal connection with them all. It is like my second home.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Wells college, and I have never been one to go out of my way to make friends. Here at Wells, it is very easy to meet new people and develop relationships with them, within the first week, I already joined a club and grew my friend circle a bunch."
Alum,5,"Wells is the best college! I loved the smallness, the professors were excellent, the buildings are historic."
Freshman,5,"Wells is a good school. They make sure you're okay in all forms and everyone is really welcoming. Also, the teachers are really nice!"
Freshman,5,"Wells College is everything I've expected it to be and more! Everyone here is extremely welcoming and enthusiastic. The campus is gorgeous, set right on the lake. There is never a shortage of things to do here. Its truly a Wells Family!"
Senior,5,"As a current student at Wells College I could not have picked a better school to attend. Wells is a tight-knit community. It is so easy to get involved on campus through different clubs, sports, or activities that are happening. Although Wells College is particularly small, it is rare to walk around campus and not see a familiar face. This also makes it really easy for all of your professors to get to know your name and to actually take the time to get to know you as a person and as a student. Most classes are held in a discussion based setting, as professors here at Wells really encourage students to learn alongside each other rather than just holding lecture classes. There are also tons of traditions here that make Wells such a unique place. Wells is located in the small town of Aurora, NY.  Although Aurora is a small and quite place, places such as Ithaca, Syracuse, and Cortland are all within driving distance. Wells College could not have been a better fit for me!"
Freshman,5,"Wells College sits on Cayuga lake in Aurora, NY.  Wells College recognizes how secluded its campus is and has developed shuttle services that allow students to be able to travel to surrounding cities in order for the students to shop, get groceries, and to be able to travel outside the town limits of Aurora. This shuttle service also provides weekend trips around New York to allow student to experience Niagara Falls, Watkins, Glen, and many more unique experiences that aren't found in other areas. The professors work to create a relationship with their students. Because of this, it is hard to fail at Wells. Everyone wants you to succeed. There's always a large variety of food in the dining hall, which has newly expanded its hours from 7am-8pm to accommodate all students' schedules. There are tons of wacky, fun traditions like Odd Even that really make your college experience special and worth while. Wells is definitely unique, but that uniqueness is what makes it a 5 star school."
Senior,5,Wells College is a great family-oriented environment great for learning and getting a jumpstart on your career. The dining is top of the line considering it being a small school. The town of Aurora is a great environment to go to school in with access to The Fargo the best restaurant in the Cayuga Lake area.
Junior,5,"So far Wells College has gone above my expectations of satisfaction as a current student. The campus itself is beautiful and the view of Cayuga Lake everyday is magical! Life around here is pretty soothing, in 3 years of attending and living on campus I have had no complaint whatsoever. There's always something to do at any given moment so you can always find ways to procrastinate from your studies. Overall choosing to attend Wells College has proven to be the best decision so far for my academic and social life. It is a campus where I am constantly learning every day and I cannot wait to see what my next 2 years here have in store!"
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Wells. It's a great school for those students who want a smaller, more intimate college experience. The professors here are great, and they work really hard making sure the students understand the material. I come from a large city, and I actually enjoy the small village of Aurora. It is peaceful, but there's enough going on at the college (athletic events, traditions, dances, activities, etc.) that I don't feel bored. We also have a new dining service which is way better than the previous. 10/10 recommend!"
Freshman,5,"Wells College for me is one of the best colleges I've ever seen. The professors actually care about their students and have great relationships with all of them. The campus is small so that allows everyone to know everyone and you're bound to make friends. The campus is also beautiful and right across from Cayuga lake is you ever need to take a break. The classes are also very small and intimate, plus the food is reallllly good."
Alum,5,"One of the best decisions I ever made was to choose Wells. I was accepted at University if Pennsylvania, Mount Holyoke, and Keuka College, but I knew Wells was the place for me after sitting in on classes, staying overnight in the form and just meeting the people. The campus is the right size without being overwhelming, excellent professors and facilities, dorms that become a close neighborhood and friends who will last a lifetime. Want an average college, go to wherever......want a college experience that will launch you prepared for the world, choose Wells. You won't be disappointed."
Niche User,5,I have received a ton of financial aid from wells. Their campus is lovely and their Henry Wells Scholar Celebration was a great experience.
Freshman,5,"I love Wells College. The faculty, the staff, and fellow students are all generous and the most helpful people I have ever met. The campus is beautiful in any weather, classes are challenging but exciting, the food is excellent, and student life offers many activities for students."
Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for individualized learning look no further. The best thing about Wells are the professors. They are invested in you and see you as an individual and not as a number. If you're not doing particularly well, they can set up time for you to review the material because they want you to succeed. Most professors also send out internship opportunities so students can immerse themselves in that particular field.  Clubs like Querencia and Umoja, try to make the school as inclusive as possible by engaging students in hot topics like racism and segregation. They also strive on being active figures in the community, frequently hosting blood drives and potlucks. As an NCAA division 3 school, athletics are what you expect it to be, however, students on campus take their job as athletes seriously. Everyone tries to support each team by showing up to games especially for sports like Volleyball and Basketball."
Senior,5,"Wells College is a great place to get an education, especially if you need that one-on-one interaction with professors. At Wells, you're not just a number and you're treated as an individual with your own ideas and opinions. The experiences that I've had here at Wells have helped me become a confident individual and the challenges that I've faced as a student have taught me how to be a critical thinker. Everyone is extremely down to earth and the environment is so comforting and inviting. The campus reminds me of a fairytale and most students refer to Wells as a ""summer camp"" environment or say that it's like Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. 

I found that even though Wells is located in a geographically rural area, there's always something to do. Between student activities events, club events, sporting events, and theater productions there is always something to keep you busy. Wells is a great place to live and to find out who you want to become."
Junior,5,"Wells College is changing my life, one day at a time. I've made the most incredible sisters, met the most amazing people, and learned things I'd never even imagine thinking about. As a freshmen, I remember sobbing in the parking lot, begging my mom to take me home because I couldn't possibly see how I could be happy at a tiny liberal arts school in central New York. Now, as a junior, I don't see how I'm ever going to be able to leave. I've become a better, more thoughtful woman, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Aurora is small, but with a little imagination you can have a fantastic time. If you get enough people and a speaker into a room, you can have better parties than any of the bigger schools we visit, simply because you can dance wildly with the people you love. When it's warm out, dock parties are a must. ODD/EVEN is the best decision you'll ever make. Shoutout to Sister Wells for everything, basically."
Junior,5,"As a junior, I can say that coming to Wells was the best decision of my life. I could not have asked for a better college experience. Though there isn't much around Aurora, you have to create your own fun. That's why Wells offers so many different activities and leadership positions. If you don't get involved, it will be difficult to acclimate to the school. The professors care about the education they provide their students and are willing to work to the best of their ability to ensure all of their students succeed and while there is not much of a party scene or any little bit of Greek life, there are numerous events at Wells that can satiate those needs. Wells is a community driven school and it is a school that definitely requires students to be motivated and determined. Traditions like Odd/Even are unique to the school and are only some events of what makes this school truly one for the books. These traditions keep our schools community together."
Junior,5,"Overall, I enjoy being a student at Wells College. There could be some improvements in housing but other than that, everyone here is super nice and there's always something to do on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I like living on campus, the housing is close to the academic buildings and the ability to get around is easy. The atmosphere on campus is friendly and there seems to be no social problems on campus. The rooms are big and you can have a TV in your room."
College Freshman,5,"At this school there are a lot of opportunities to connect with others and they hold events to get people to talk to people you do not get to see every day. For instance we had a winter fest where there was free food, a chance to race you friends and peers on an inflatable race course and we also had the chance to print designs on cups for free."
College Freshman,5,"My professors really took time to get to know me, my likes, dislikes, things about my family. They ask about my overall wellbeing if they see I don't look okay or if they know I was having a rough day. They talk to me and give me advice on any issue I'm having even if it's not academic."
College Junior,5,I have had the most amazing professors. Our adjuncts are not the best though.
College Sophomore,5,We have an honor code so very safe.
College Sophomore,5,"People use, but there is zero pressure."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so different but gets along perfectly.
College Sophomore,5,Academics at Wells are way more difficult then most people think. A lot of people who apply to Ivy League's also apply here. The professors have the highest level degrees and many also teach at Cornell.
College Freshman,5,No problems with the admissions.  I did early decision.
College Freshman,5,"As an English major I have really good professors who are helpful and know what they are doing. As a requirement of the college, you must complete two internships and as an English major they do not have to be specifically in your field, though it is better."
College Freshman,5,They have a wide diversity of classes and all the professors are very helpful. Registration can be stressful as a freshmen but you can usually get into the classes you need.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is super nice and non-judgmental.
College Sophomore,5,"I always feel safe on campus, but that has more to do with the atmosphere than the security. Security is rarely seen unless you need something unlocked or they're giving out tickets. Because of the honor code and the community though, it's a great place."
College Sophomore,5,"The Honor Code is very strictly enforced here. We have to sign a contract freshman year stating that we will follow the honor code. It's actually wonderful. I've been able to leave my wallet, keys, laptop, phone etc in public places for hours and I return and everything is untouched. No one ever locks their doors, and everyone is very trusting. "
College Sophomore,5,"Living on campus allows you to fully experience the community feeling that encompasses Wells. The rooms in some of the dorms are kind of small, but it's a very comforting environment because of the trust and openness of all the people on campus. "
College Sophomore,5,"Wells is located in a very small town, but there are two much larger cities close by. Even if you don't have a car, Wells has vans that can drop you off and pick you up-free of charge. The local atmosphere is fantastic. It has a very small, homey feel and everyone is extremely friendly. We're right on the lake too, so during the fall semester there's a lot of swimming and boating. "
College Sophomore,5,One simply declares one's major during one's sophomore year at Wells College.
College Sophomore,5,"The English major is one of the best majors at Wells College. One can concentrate in either Creative Writing or Literature. Each concentration gives the student the unique ability to branch out. Similarly, each concentration is full of wonderful professors."
College Freshman,5,Every weekend Wells College has some sort of event going on. The library is awesome when you want some quite time or just need help with writing your papers. The traditions are amazing especially the EVEN-ODD.
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt unsafe at Wells College. The honor code is taken very seriously. As a consequence, many students leave their doors unlocked and never experience theft."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very helpful and Wells has some of the best professors around. Also the classes are usually small, around 20 students, which provides a more one on one interaction and a better understanding of the material because the professors are more available than if they had hundreds of students."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy the program I'm in because all of the professors are very welcoming and the class sizes are under 40 students.  As of right now the workload hasn't been too bad it has been quite manageable. The internships are easy to find because you can basically do any internship you interested in and and the professors are well known and have good connections which could help you in the long run for job opportunities.
College Freshman,5,"Declaring your major is rather easy but you can't declare your major until your a sophomore, which a good thing i think because it gives you time to explore your options and decide what you really want to focus on.  Getting into the biology program has been really easy but my school is so small there is a lot more opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to have done an internship but the internship opportunities here at Wells College are great, you can basically do an internship any where you're interested in.  Also, here, freshmen can do internships after their first semester."
College Freshman,5,"There are people from all over the world here. It is exciting to meet people from other places and learn about their background and different customs. Everyone is accepting of each other here; it does not matter whether one is black, white, Jewish, Muslim, or Catholic. The diversity is what makes Wells so special."
College Freshman,5,"So Many.. Most people I have met have become here because of the wonderful scholarships that Wells College gives to students ranging from 8,000 to I think about 25,000. The financial aid that is given to students is very fair but if you ever have a concern or trouble you can go to financial aid and talk to them and make an agreement."
College Freshman,5,I feel pretty safe on campus at Wells College but if you ever feel unsafe you can always call security to escort you anywhere and help you out. The campus is pretty small and super beautiful and with the Honor Code most people keep doors opened and so there is not a lot of crime or theft going on. And whenever there is it's not hard to find out who has done it since there are very few students on campus and they would have to go to community court. I would recommend locking your doors during times that there are visits from  people who don't go here since they do not know of the Honor Code.
College Sophomore,5,Wells parking is really a great deal. You can have a car on campus your freshman year and it is really cheap. It is a great deal.
College Junior,5,"Campus View – With being right across the street from Cayuga Lake, Wells College has a great view. You can see the lake from almost every building on campus. The view from the athletic fields, though, is unbeatable. We get compliments by every visiting school. We even own a boat house and docks on the lake that we like to do homework or just relax on when the weather is nice. The lake is a great place to just hang out."
College Sophomore,5,"Very good, i always feel comfortable on and around campus."
College Freshman,5,Even and Odd Battles – The school offers this tradition from the days of its founding called Even Odd. I think it's a refresher compared to average college greek things. It really brings the classes together and keeps the peace between them. The freshmen and sophomore women and men compete in games of basketball and dodge ball respectively. The women compete in sing-off's while the guys have a dance off. It's loads of fun! The girls compete in the fall while the guys battle it out in the spring! It sounds a little weird but trust me it is the best!
College Freshman,5,"Not Very Visisble – I don't notice many people using drugs, although there is some conversation and I have seen some people smoking marijuana on the weekends."
College Freshman,5,Parking for a whole year is 40 dollars and it's in a pretty easily accessible place.  I mean 40 dollars for a WHOLE YEAR who's complaining?  It's amazing.
Sophomore,4,"We've had more videos and exercises to replace the labs that we've lost but it was overall good, challenging but it went quite well. Certainly working remotely required more work but professors, instructors were very helpful and understanding of the situation."
Sophomore,4,"I am a rising sophomore at Wells. As far as I have been there, my experience was very pleasant. It is a very beautiful campus but what really made me feel good was the sense of community reigning there. Moreover Faculties are very dedicated to students and their future and that is a really good point."
Sophomore,4,"A nice, small college. Has it's grievances, but overall a quaint little place. The community feels close knit, and the professors are all very welcoming and friendly."
Freshman,4,I really liked the people at Wells. The community in general seemed as if they really cared about each other. The integrity in the school is very strong and people are very honest there. You can tell it is what the school preaches honesty and integrity. For example one student left their laptop sitting at the library table and came back the next day and it was in the exact same spot. This shows that honesty and not stealing is the culture at this school. Wells honestly is the best place to learn as well. The professors are very good at explaining things and will work just as hard as you work in the classroom.
Sophomore,4,"Wells is overall a very close-knit college. Because of its size, all of the students get to know each other and become close with their professors and coaches."
Freshman,4,I'm so happy I chose to come to Wells College! I have never felt more welcome anywhere else before. I was nervous about going to college because I am an introvert and was worried I wouldn't make friends or succeed. Wells is characterized by a great sense of community that supported me through my transition to this new phase of life. I love everyone here!
Freshman,4,"Originally when choosing colleges, I did not want to come to this school, I wanted to attend Cornell University. Of course that was a long shot, however, so I ended up at Wells. Even though this was not my first choice, I am content with my decision. Wells college is very inclusive and accepting and I love that about it here. If I would have gone to Cornell as I planned, there is no way that I would have the personal connections with my professors and peers as I do now because of the difference in size of the schools and I would not be able to focus as much. The only thing that I would like to see change at this school is the diversity."
Freshman,4,Wells College is a rather small college but is filled with great people. Do not regret my choice at all.
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experiences at Wells so far. Although the school is small, it is never lacking things to do. While my classwork keeps me plenty busy, I often go to school events, shows, or sports games. The teachers that I've had so far have been pretty good, and I'm learning a lot as a political science major . Although I am early into my experience here, I have already been exposed to life after Wells and the resources I have available to me. It makes me excited about my future."
Senior,4,"In my last year here at Wells, I can tell you that it's an amazing school. I'm used to a small class size most of my high school life and Wells is the perfect place for that type of class setting. The teachers are easy to get in contact with when you need help and easy to become friends with. The school is quite but our Student Activities group make sure we have a ton of events to go to. It's a place where you can feel at home"
Sophomore,4,"A beautiful campus, however tuition is high. Teachers are wonderful and understanding, but those in the main building for financial aid, business office, Human Resources, etc need a better understanding of what students are really going through. Hit and miss with finding someone that will take the time to listen to what you need."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman here at Wells, I feel I've made a good choice in deciding to enroll here. I found myself joining more clubs compared to my high school career, such as Henry's VIII, which is the school's co-ed a capella group. 
The small class sizes do help develop great relationships between professors and students.  Since this school is a liberal arts college, you do find yourself gaining knowledge in a lot of other fields such as Book Arts and Psychology. Not to mention that the traditions are pretty interesting as well. For example, I had to the chance to participate in Odd/Even, which is one of the school's biggest traditions. By joining the Men's Odd team, I feel like I didn't just join a team. I feel like I joined a family.  Wells is definitely a good choice for students."
Senior,4,"Wells is a beautiful school with many helpful and caring faculty/staff members, though the small size of the school and and lack of online class options makes scheduling tough."
Alum,4,"Wells is incredibly unique—great academics with passionate professors, a close-knit community, and traditions that students actually care about. 

BUT beware of the administrative problems. They are notorious for telling seniors they can’t graduate about 2 months before graduation because of things like too many credits in one area and whatnot (happened to me and several people I know). They usually sort it out but that’s the last kind of stress seniors in college need."
Sophomore,4,It is a very small school with excellent student lead small classes.  The social life is very abstract and the party scene is taken place at small dorm rooms.
Niche User,4,"Wells is one of  my top college choices for school next year. It's a beautiful campus, in a great location, and every time I've visited I've felt welcomed and right at home!"
Sophomore,4,"The college is pretty small and it's in a rural area, so it takes some getting use to, but everyone here is super friendly and the Professors are great. There could be more clubs to get into, but then again it's up to the students to start a club if they are really interested in getting involved in something. Overall, I don't regret coming here, it gets better the longer you're here and the more you get involved, so you have to make the experience worthwhile."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Support from students, not from staff."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Wells makes you a brand new person, for the better"
College Junior,4,Tight community that upholds an honor code and stays true to the traditions that have been around.
College Freshman,4,The academics are really good. The professors are friendly and very engaged in class. Registration for classes as a freshman is a hassle because we go last for registration. Therefore a lot of the classes we need are already taken and its annoying. I was able to get my classes and I'm happy about that. The workload isnt a lot since I'm a science major but its a lot of studying and reading. There are various places to study and I like the library the most.
College Freshman,4,Campus security responds to everything as quickly as possible
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the school really does push you to get involved and interact with new people. I've met a lot of people I don't think I would have had they not introduced all these clubs and programs. Wells is a small school in which the DOS and professors really do take the time to get to know you personally. The Dean and President are both very involved on campus and take time to do activities with us. I would still choose Wells all over again because they really do make it feel like a family and they're really supportive. I don't think I would have found this anywhere else."
College Freshman,4,"Safety on campus is taken very seriously. We all signed an Honor Code in the beginning of the semester preventing students from doing a lot of actions. Also, security is open late and always available to call in case of emergency. People on campus tend to return things they find weather it be a notebook or a wallet. There is a high level of behavioral expectancy from the students that Wells takes very seriously."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I really like this school because it's hard to not find help. Professors, TA's, even the president of the school are open to talk to. The staff here make more of an emphasis to get to know people better. The school has a surplus of resources to use for projects, homework, computer support, education support, medical support, everything is open to us. Class sizes are really small compared to bigger universities and classes are more engaged. Professors and staff know you by name and make themselves available as often as possible."
College Freshman,4,"There is a high quality of career aspects in this school. Wells associates themselves with other universities like Cornell and Ithaca for the convenience of the students. Setting up classes at their universality, internships, and employer recruiting. Wells has a employment center that opens opportunities to high level internships leading to experience required for students planing to go to graduate school/ My chemistry TA is a biochemistry major and did internships at Cornell involving NASA. Wells had free teachings on how to do taxes by bring representatives from the IRS to Wells. Also, most of the professors have connections to bigger employment opportunities like medical research, the United Nations, chairs in committee's like economics, Chemistry, Biology, etc... Wells offers so many opportunities and it's all available  to the students."
College Freshman,4,"I live in a single dorm and I enjoy it a lot. The for me to get a single was $500 a semester which I thought wasn't bad. Anyone with a car can park in certain areas free of charge. Everything dorm building seems so close together and it easy to see friends in other buildings. A lot of times I go to my friends dorm in another building or they come to mine. Also, I know almost everyone in my building just because the school is so small, its easier to meet people."
College Freshman,4,"People are extremely social at Wells College. When I first came there on move in day, people I didn't know would just say high and how are you? It continues on now and I think it's nice for staff and upper class students to show appreciation and respect for new students joining Wells."
College Freshman,4,"Our athletic center is called the Schwartz Athletic Center. It has a fitness center and two gym's, one recently finished construction. I go there often to get my daily workouts in, and to practice basketball or volleyball. It's a very nice convenience for students and the maintenance of it is great."
College Student,4,"Wells has many internships for photography and film. Its in a quite rural area, so I can focus on my studies. Everyone here is very friendly and outgoing"
College Freshman,4,"To be honest, Wells College is an affordable school for most students and it's highly underrated. Room & board, study abroad and so many other aspects that are included in tuition. For classes, there's an affordable way to get your textbooks if you have an issue getting them; Wells has a book loan program where you get the books you need at the bookstore and return the receipt to the Dean of Students to be signed and you have until the end of the semester to pay it off, if not it gets added to your tuition bill, which is not a lot for many students. I'm a freshman here at Wells, coming from New York City, I do appreciate the small,, close-knit community Wells college has. Also, Wells takes sustainability very seriously and strongly adheres to their honor code, which most colleges ""have"" but do not emphasize."
College Senior,4,"It makes a huge difference when you attend a smaller school as intimate as Wells. I know everyone on the campus, including faculty, staff, students and visitors. I feel very safe and accepted, and my learning experience is unique because of all that. I will be a different kind of a person in the world, because of my experience."
College Sophomore,4,"We have an honor code that is taken very seriously. Follow it, and you will have no problems. Punishments are fair and given when necessary."
College Sophomore,4,"Cost stays the same as on campus room and bored. However, you do not have a meal plan with the school. Off campus living is a very popular choice. Easy to apply for, but large competition. The closest off campus living is a 30 second walk to get on campus, the furthest being a five minute walk. Parking is available at each location. Off campus is just as safe as on campus. Our small town is a very safe place to be."
College Sophomore,4,Wells does not have an abnormal application process. The tips for admission are the same for this school as any other.
College Sophomore,4,Good variety for the size of the school.
College Sophomore,4,I would definitely branch out more.
College Sophomore,4,Awesome traditions. Everyone gets along.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty good for the size of the school.
College Sophomore,4,Better than most schools but small variety.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is accepting of different views/backgrounds.
College Sophomore,4,"There are very few of us, but the advisers are great and the classes are fun."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy Wells College.  There is an honor code which makes me feel safe and at home.  It is a smaller campus so everyone knows each other.  Student to Professor ratio is really one on one which helps with the studying and learning.
College Freshman,4,I received two scholarships which helped out with my tuition costs tremendously.  I would not have been able to attend Wells College with out these.
College Freshman,4,There is no peer pressure to drink.  There is a strict policy of getting caught if your underage.  Prior to acceptance all students are required to take an alcohol wise course.
College Freshman,4,Wells students care and support one another.  There is terrific sportsmanship among the classmates.
College Freshman,4,This school not only looks at test scores but other elements such as GPA and activities on and off campus. There are no restrictions for any programs.
College Freshman,4,The workload is pretty manageable and the professors are all nice and easy to approach.
College Freshman,4,Security is always available and there is a resource center on campus for women.
College Freshman,4,People are very supportive of the athletic teams on campus. The athletic building is also very well equipped with a gym and indoor pool.
College Freshman,4,I haven't had any issues with financial aid.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of different options, some owned by the professors at the college. There's apartments as well as the lake house. The quality depends on which off-campus house you chose. The lake house is the best, the apartments are lower quality. It's relatively easy to get permission to live off campus though."
College Sophomore,4,"They try very hard to get everyone the money they need to attend this college, but the tuition is just so expensive. They're currently giving me about half of my tuition, but it still isn't enough. I've called them and gone in to have them help me, and we're trying, but I still might not be able to go back next semester. If you have a lot of money, this won't be a problem, but lower middle class students-watch your bill closely. "
College Sophomore,4,"The weather is wonderful. A little windy at times, as we live right on a lake, but it's nice in the warmer months. It doesn't snow until late in the year, even though it does in the cities surrounding us. Class is rarely cancelled due to weather, and during the fall and spring the campus is beautiful. "
College Sophomore,4,"We have a lot of good athletes, but our sports department isn't exactly up to par. It's not a huge part of campus, but everyone at least knows whats going on with the teams, even if they don't personally attend the events (not many people do). "
College Sophomore,4,"The English program is very good here, and I'm glad I chose this college. I want to be an editor at a publishing company in NYC and hopefully I'll be interning there this summer. All creative writing majors worry about ending up homeless in a box in the big city. That's why I'm trying so hard to get internships and connections now, while I'm still in school so that I have a better chance of making it when the time comes."
College Junior,4,"I am very happy with my program.If I could go back in time and change things. The first thing I would study more and push myself hard. I end up with mostly B's or +B's in my economics classes. If I pushed myself I believe I could've ended up with a A's. I'm not really concern about finding a job with my degree. I am a management and economics major. After, researching the job market for this degree (which I highly recommend people do) I found out there are a lot of jobs."
College Sophomore,4,"Wells is located in the little, doll-house town of Aurora. It's quaint, there's a village market, an ice cream shop open for only the first few weeks of fall semester, an okay burger restaurant, a graveyard, a library, and inn, and housing.
If you really want to do something, take a van up to Ithaca. Students will complain about being in the middle of nowhere.
The campus is next to a lake, you could go swimming. There are usually activities planned every weekend on campus. We have a great three story library (which needs some repairs, as its weight is slowly crushing itself) and we have a cafe.
But the atmosphere is nice, friendly. The Wells campus and surrounding town is gorgeous. Just don't be too noisy at night in the town or be a disturbance. It's a lovely place to be."
College Sophomore,4,"It's college, where does strictness belong on a college campus? Sure, there is no underage drinking and no drugs allowed, but as long as you're not putting yourself in danger, or others in danger, you're fine. (Although I do think they need more drug and alcohol patrols, because students get away with it a lot!) They lock the academic buildings at midnight, but you can stay in them all night (at least, that's what I've been told: I did stay in our science building till 3 A.M. once, studying) as long as you turn off the lights when you leave. Mind, you can't get back in after they lock them, so make sure you have all your belongings with you before leaving. Although, if it's not too late, you can always ask security to open a door, they're very kind.
There are some places that are off limits, but they have their reasons. I honestly don't believe Wells has any type of dress code, they're not strict... as long as you're wearing something! But professors would prefer if you wore nice clothing to their classes. Speaking of professors, I hear some will lock the door on late students: it's always best to be on time.
Apart from the professors dos and don'ts, always have your school ID on you, else you're not allowed in the dinning hall."
College Sophomore,4,The people in the Financial Aid Office at Wells College are wonderful and always helpful.
Sophomore,2,"When we went to remote learning in the 2019 spring semester, a lot of the professors were just as confused at the students. 

There was no singular platform used for online lectures, with some professors using Zoom and others using Google Meet.

Most professors/instructors had already utilized Moodle for their classes when things were normal, and continued to do so during the pandemic. Some of them made the textbooks and other course materials available online for their students who may have left theirs on campus when they left for Spring Break and weren't able to retrieve them. 

I personally struggled a lot with online learning, but mostly because I learn better in person.

Other than the expected network or hardware troubles and after a reimagining of office hours and accessibility, I think that the professors/instructors handled the switch to  online learning quite well."
Sophomore,2,"Wells is honestly a waste of time. The food is bad, the atmosphere is going down, the professors are all leaving. Did you peak in high school? Then come here! They lowered tuition to get students, cut salaries, and are on probation. They treat the students like high-schoolers, which honestly, they are. This is my second year, I am transferring. The only good part about this school is the traditions and nobody participates in those anymore either. Overall, this school will probably shut down within a few years. They sell the school to you, then after first semester more than half the ""first years"" (because we can't say freshMEN) leave. Again, wanna go back to high school? Wells is perfect for you."
Freshman,2,"THIS COLLEGE LIES ABOUT THEIR MAJORS AND CLASSES. I was excited to attend Wells in the fall,  it's a very quiet and comforting campus. But shortly after I was told upon making a campus visit, and being accepted into the college,  that my major was no longer offered (even though it said it was on my application). When I looked online, the website said there was still classes I could take pertaining to my major; however when I went to make my class schedule, none of the classes were available to take."
Sophomore,2,"Wells college is located on a beautiful lake with woods behind it. The teachers and classes are amazing! Many students on campus run the school itself. RA's don't do their job and drink and smoke with the students they should be watching. Food is ok at first but the more you eat it, the less different options there are. The surrounding area doesn't have much restaurants so the food on campus should be good. Not many clubs or activities on campus. Club meetings are rarely advertised to the students."
Freshman,2,"Wells College is a different school. It has has many traditions that are fun, wacky, crazy, and a little weird. Although Wells isn't for me there are many people at the school that love it here. #KeepWellsWeird is a common hashtag used at the school. Many alums are extremely prideful to have graduated from such an institution. The down side to Wells is the food. There is little places to get food that isn't at least 20 minutes away and the dining hall is disgusting. It is in the middle of no where which can get pretty annoying. Lastly, there are some amazing professors here, however like with most things, you get the good with the bad. Lastly, the administration is a little chaotic. They can be quite disorganized and this can get frustrating especially for already stressed out college students."
College Sophomore,2,"Be prepared for hot days and cold nights because a) there are no a/c in any of the building, fans and maybe a dehumidifier are highly recommended and b) the heating system gets way too hot for comfort during the cold days. The rooms are small and there is not a lot of space for ALL of your stuff, especially if you are rooming with someone. The lottery system is a pain, and it also depends on if there is enough space for you anyways! This year, we had people waitlisted for rooms because of how many students were coming. The campus is old and so are the dorms so if you are into the ""antique"" setting of the building then you will love these houses, especially Glen Park house."
College Junior,2,We don't have any Greek life because it is such a small school there is just no room for it.
College Sophomore,2,It's only bad because I was placed on the same floor as some soccer players. Some are nice. Most are assholios. Yes I used a non word to emphasize the assholishness of the individuals
College Sophomore,2,"The athletic division is the core discrimination describes in the previous section. It consists of mostly arrogant individuals who create separation between themselves and normal students. This grandiose attitude, isn't addressed by the student board and is undetected by the staff. It makes me sick. I didn't pay $50000 a year for high school. I'm pretty sure I graduated. All teams relieve small turnouts for their games and usually are unsuccessful in their games. This low morale probably creates a spiral. In all honesty the teams are naturally closer together which is fine. However it's their lack of community sense outside of their teams that becomes aggravating. They act as if they're the pride of the school, place themselves on a pedistal and have little to show for it. I intend to confront this immature cliche nature as is is accepted but not right."
College Sophomore,2,"I referred to the school as tragically ironic. Although the school means well and has programs to reinforce that positive image, the student body consists of more individuals than community. The majority of students fail to connect on many levels including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual preference and orientation. The school maintains traditional biases and efforts to unify the people have small turnouts. There is covert discrimination and and intolerance to difference that makes living there very aggravating. For me the most social aspect of the campus is the smokers table because many ppl from different backgrounds have a common ground based on something that is frowned upon by the rest of the school. In all honesty it's a great school but the students themselves are the cause of any and all social injustice and I intend to change it all by the end of my senior year"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Financial aid sounds good at first, but they you realize you are paying Ivy prices for a place worse than small state schools."
Recent Alumnus,2,"College puts much money into athletics as a way to recruit more students, but this is div 3 sports, so athletes are those who can't compete at better levels but come to Wells so they can play, but have no idea why they are at a once all women's liberal arts school."
Recent Alumnus,2,Mostly sad people drinking to prevent boredom.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most residence buildings would be amazing if taken care of, but the school is bankrupt, so there's no maintenance."
College Sophomore,2,"We have one dining hall, open from 7am until 7pm weekdays and 1030am until 630pm on weekends. There are not too many options, but can almost always find something to eat. A sandwich bar is offered throughout the week, along with a ""specialty"" bar which has Chinese, potato, crepe, etc. nights. Gluten free and vegetarian options are offered. Dining dollars can be used to purchase items from the café (opens in the morning, stays open late) and the backstage grill (opens at night, stays open until 12)."
College Sophomore,2,"A very small selection with some majors being obviously thrown together. Textbooks for low level business classes are things like ""Ten tricks to be a Millionaire"""
College Sophomore,2,"The administration seems to be trying very hard to up the athletic quality of the school, so much so that some athletes complain about exhaustion and not having enough time to complete their work, but very few people care about the sports."
College Sophomore,2,Dating is hard. The majority of the students are very unstable and unreliable.
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are of a nice size, especially in Main where the rooms used to be classrooms, but there's next to no rule enforcement, everything is falling apart, and there are insect infestations in most places

 Examples: RAs are the primary breakers of quiet hours. You will not get a hot shower. There's a gaping hole in one of the girl's bathrooms. In the winter you'll wake up with frost and icicles on the inside of your window. In the spring you'll find hornets and ants in the halls, ceilings, and occasionally on you when you wake up."
College Sophomore,2,"The diversity is good in a bad way, and by that I mean that the LGBT groups are rather hostile to any masculine appearing male or feminine appearing female. Differences of sexuality are very well accepted, but there is some racial hostility among some of the white students from upstate New York and nonwhites from everywhere else. Racial jokes are common. Prepare to be verbally attacked if you're heterosexual and you and your partner breath in the wrong direction."
College Sophomore,2,Small town. So one outside restaurant.
College Sophomore,2,Very nice town. But it's empty.
College Sophomore,2,Parties are usually small gatherings. There's not one every weekend.
College Freshman,2,There is not much within the Town of Aurora.   Everything that is fun usually is the campus activities.
College Freshman,2,The town of Aurora is small.  Not many options in town.  You have to travel to Auburn to have a variety of places to eat.
College Sophomore,2,"I hate the weather here. I am from California, and on top of that, I have lived near a beach my entire life. Not only am I spoiled on weather, I have never been good about being away from an ocean of some sort, let alone surrounded by tree's. Upstate New York is not for everybody, but some people really love the weather out here: ""It's great! I get to wear different clothes every season..."" I don't get it though. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Jock culture set up to attract new students, but athletes don't really fit what used to be an elite women's school."
College Freshman,2,Local weather doesnt affect classes here. Classes are not really cancelled due to bad weather
College Freshman,2,"It isn't so much drugs as it is the alcohol. There are people that smoke, but that isn't as big as all the drinking. Most people go off campus to drink. If an RA is suspicious of someone drinking and knows they are underage, he or she can report the person to the campus security, who then takes control of the situation. It isn't too obvious most of the time, though."
College Freshman,2,"There is alot that students can't do because they don't want to break the honor coode. if they break the honor code, serious consequences follow. othere than that, its pretty chill."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't alot to go to. town is almost an hour away, so if you don't have a car, you will be very limited. very community based. try to have lots of activities to do, but not many options."
College Freshman,2,"The campus shuttles are free. They take us to Ithaca to several locations. The village of aurora is very small so public transportation does not exactly exist here. The time the shuttle runs could be a little later than usually but is hard to because things close early around this way. They only go to Ithaca and they do not travel to other locations. They also run Wednesday- Sunday, times varies."
College Sophomore,2,"There really aren't that many off campus opportunities at Wells. You have to know someone from the area to get an apartment or try to get a graduating senior's apartment after they leave. Wells does offer their own off campus housing, but it's not that great. Right now one of the two Wells affiliated off campus housing is closed for renovations so the options are limited. Residence life really pushed for students to live on campus because that's more money for the college."
College Sophomore,2,"Wells is located in Aurora, NY, which is a very small town located on Cayuga lake. Off-campus housing sounds pretty good, right? If it's a small town, everything is within walking distance. On top of that, you might get to live on the lake! The problem, though, is that since you're on a lake, the rent tends to be very high. A common sense solution to that problem is to live with more people. In Aurora, that doesn't work. Aurora has an old law on the books that makes it illegal for more than 3 people who aren't directly related to live with one another. This law, despite being outdated, is enforced. In the end, although you might pick up a nice house, it wil end up costing you a pretty penny."
College Sophomore,2,"This college is not much of a party school. During the weekends its more academic work. And weekends there are some parties, but not a lot. Most weekends you find yourself in your dorm doing work, watching a movie with friend or catching up on sleep. And since the campus is in the middle of now where there is nothing to do here, which makes it harder to find something to do. If you are lucky and know someone with a car on campus then you can hop a party at Cornell or Ithaca. But there isn't much to do here. But there is a bar but if your under 21 its harder."
College Sophomore,2,Here Yeah Go – well basically wells college doesn't offer a lot of choices to live off campus since its mainly a small school which is a body of 500 students and mostly everyone lives on campus. I wish they had more of a variety of campus housing but sadly they don't. The cost of living on campus is very expensive I am not sure how much is it to live off campus but i am assuming its less then what you are getting when living on campus. Parking on campus is average. And the safetyness of the college is good.
College Sophomore,2,"The professor's aren't that bad it just depends on what classes you are taking and how well the professor teaches. There are some great professors and some not. It basically goes out to any university/college. The work load isn't bad depending what you are majoring in or what classes you are taking. Popular study areas is the library, meeting up with friends, dorm lounges or preferably your dorm if you want. Getting into the college is very easy."
College Sophomore,2,I go to Wells College and there aren't really that many courses for my major. So I dont really feel that I am getting the challenge that I need because the classes are all discussion based which is good but the professors do not go further in depth about the topic of the course.
College Sophomore,2,there should be a more convenient parking lot that is not so far away from the buildings.
College Sophomore,2,the cost has sky rocketed. there are only two dormitory buildings that are worth half of the money which is Glen Park and Weld. the other two need work.
Graduate Student,1,"I didn't attend any online classes. Since i was a science major and there were labs involved, the only was to participate was to show up in class."
Sophomore,1,"This school claims to be a liberal arts college; however, the administration is doing everything in its power to make sure they get rid of all liberal arts majors. The retention rate at this school is awful because they lie about the majors and courses that they provide."
Freshman,1,"I've never seen anything like it. It values much, however, the administration and the way the school is conducted is just horrific and a disappointment. If you want to lose alot of money and time on high school level courses and a discriminatory campus, enjoy"
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life on the campus.
College Junior,1,I love my program. It's tough but rewarding.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Town needs the school but hates the students. Anything that students would like is blocked by the town and its crazy mayor who is the wife of a professor. Part of the town is dolled up and like a resort, but nothing students can afford. Leave the town and it looks like the Ozarks."
Recent Alumnus,1,Odd-Even activities seems like Greek life including the hazing and intimidation. Some traditions are just not fun.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life
College Sophomore,1,"Do not go here. Go anywhere else if you can, even a community college. At a community college you can distinguish yourself and transfer to a better place without tens of thousands of dollars of debt."
College Sophomore,1,"The buildings are old and falling apart. We lost heating for some of the winter because the system was almost as old as the school ""late 1800s."" Hot water is rare, the desks, chairs, and beds in the residence halls are at least 50 years old and broken, missing pieces, or in such low quality that no one would notice if you left a hole in them. A room check went as such: ""Wardrobe with three of the five knobs missing, check, curtain rack with one side falling out, check, bookcase with two of it's four legs, check. Alright everything seems to be in the same shape you found it in."""
College Sophomore,1,"Basically a haven for drug dealing. Lots of dealers grow their stuff in the woods around campus. Nearly all of the RAs partake in drug usage. The Honor Code is essentially a joke. People can skip half of their classes and still pass with no problem or consequences, so there's no sense in being a good student."
College Sophomore,1,"There's a bar/""restaurant"" up the road, it has burgers, sandwiches, and that's about it. A meal for two can easily hit $50 regardless of the small menu. Other than that and a small ice cream place with $7 sandwiches, the nearest places to eat are in Ithaca and Auburn."
College Sophomore,1,"The ""off campus"" houses are across a tiny street from campus, not exactly off of it. All of the same problems apply, with the added bonus that campus safety hates going out to them. Fire alarms were routinely left ringing for over an hour before anyone responded. That's an enormous problem as all, or most, of the firealarms on campus are said to be local, meaning that no alarms ring in a fire department and only the RAs and campus safety respond to an alarm."
College Sophomore,1,"A student needed to be rushed to the hospital early in the year, before the ambulance arrived they were brought into the health center where no one even knew how to use the heart monitor. I reported two rapists three times throughout the course of the year as their activities were common knowledge, the administration never acted and they are still enrolled there holding jobs on campus and playing sports."
College Sophomore,1,"You can either spend upwards of $10,000 living on campus or upwards of $10,000 living in the only off campus apartment, which is across a narrow street from the normal residence halls. There is absolutely no nightlife other than the drug and alcohol parties. The nearest grocery store, movie theater, and reasonably priced place to eat is 45 minutes away in Auburn or Ithaca. In an entire year there not a single police officer was seen, and campus safety isn't certified or legally allowed to do anything other than ask someone to calm down or make a citizen's arrest, which anyone can do. They have no self defense training, are all in pitiful physical shape, and carry around handcuffs that they can't legally use. They're also extremely rude and will refuse to help you depending upon who's on duty on a specific night. A girl a floor up from me called them because a drunk individual was in her suite threatening to rape her and her suitemates, it took them 45 minutes to arrive. If you need any sort of protection or feel unsafe for any reason you need to have a group of friends nearby or be able to wait for the police to come from Auburn."
College Sophomore,1,"Boiled potatoes next to boiled cauliflower becomes a standard meal as the semester goes on. The same, simple and bland, dishes are brought out nearly every week with little to no variety. Leftovers are reused the next day in disgusting ways. For example: Cream and corn soup. Taco ""meaning corn, salsa, and dry, cat food like, beef"" pizza. The dining hall closes at around 7, after that you'll have to either go without eating or buy something from the ""cafe"". Their are acceptable options within the dining hall, such as the sandwich station, but unless you get online an hour before dinner you can expect a line about 45 minutes long, even though the school only has 500 students."
College Freshman,1,The meat is undercooked at times.  Food variety is not healthy.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This used to be an elite school, but now they will take anyone who can pay the almost $50,000 tuition and dorms. Spending that much money might be worth it at Bard or Colgate, but Wells is definitely not worth it since the students come with few skills and many have learning issues, or just want to party. It's become a really expensive remedial school. Most Profs just give As to keep students paying the tuition. Many professors have left the school in the last few years, and because the school is small, this may mean that one person quits and a major isn't really offered anymore."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Network is pathetic, you can't even reliably stream video or audio--same for the classrooms--the teachers are often frustrated. Wifi not in all parts of campus. Off of campus Wifi is non-existent. Definitely bring your own computer or laptop, but don't expect any support. Most campus computers are about two-generations old--same for software. Seriously, there are still Mac G5s on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Hard Work Isn't Reward – I received a good scholarship from Wells, as do most students. However, they still managed to hit me with an expensive out-of-pocket tuition fee. I figured after I proved myself academically my freshmen year, I would be rewarded. That was not the case. After being the only freshmen male to make the Dean's List both semesters of that year, I still didn't get the FA I needed for my sophomore year. It turns out, it's not in their policy to give direct aid to students based on their GPA. So, word to the wise, don't work too hard if you come here unless you're planning on grad-school. You don't really matter, anyway."

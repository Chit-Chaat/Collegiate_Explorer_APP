Junior,5,"All staff are very responsive and flexible. They understand that we all have lives and families outside school. Online learning is very flexible because you can do it on your own time. Instructors are very responsive and helpful. Online learning is certainly the more effective option for students. 
In addition, Students have the freedom to juggle their careers and school because they aren't tied down to a fixed schedule. In a traditional classroom setting, class meeting times are set, and the student has no power over this, forcing them to work their schedules around these dates. Most people who choose online learning tend to have other commitments, and prefer this mode of learning as it gives them power over how they will delegate their time towards their different projects."
Junior,5,"City University is very flexible especially for full time working moms, dads or college students. Staff are very helpful, supportive and responsive.
Many people choose not to return to college because they think studying will take up valuable family time, but City University is very convenient and flexible  for all ages.
 Meeting one day a week is a great way to connect with teachers and our cohorts , as well as asking questions and reflect on our learning experiences and help each other while working together in groups  
Students have everything they need to be successful. That’s why they offer a host of student support services and resources to help them stay on track to graduation and reach their goals, including academic, career services, housing assistance, student clubs, Counseling Center and more."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent college! I high recommend their Doctoral Program in Educational Leadership. The university offers 3 different options, but I personally like the fact that they offer a specialized program in special education and I was able to choose four classes for my concentration area."
Senior,5,"The admission process and help is awesome. Was able to reapply easy after being gone for 20 years. 

I have only six classes to get my degree so after being gone that long will be able to finish this summer. 

I should have done this years ago."
Senior,5,So far it has been great but it is extremely over priced compared to others. I have found many cheaper options with other schools but simply do not want to hastle with the change needed to move.
Junior,5,"This is my fourth semester here at CityU, and I can honestly say I feel like the help I have received from my professor and fellow students is beyond the best feeling. I believe they want to see all of their students succeed and follow their dreams. I will also be looking into other programs the school has and see what catches my eyes. One program that stands out is the MBA program. I feel like that program along with the current program I’m in, which is the masters of science in health administration. I feel like education is very important, and I will continue to strive to achieve my educational goals."
Junior,5,Advisors and Instructors are extremely caring and helpful. Perfect school for those who are working full time and pursuing a degree.
Graduate Student,5,"I chose CityU for the school's program flexibility built for working adults. As a professional in business in pursuit of an MBA, I wanted to make sure the degree I pursued would pay off and be able to fit my pace with no hitches. I'm thankful I found that opportunity at CityU. I can work downtown, then book a study room on my class days before evening class begins. The advisors are understanding, patient, and eager to help work around student schedules when life events create obstacles around quarter deadlines and more. So glad for CityU!"
Sophomore,5,Teachers and staff are very communicative and supporting for students to do their best! If students need help the entire school is listening and willing to extent the help thats needed!
Graduate Student,5,"The support and encouragement from staff and faculty is truly amazing. They see you, treat you and acknowledge you as a student and human and not just a number. I feel connected, even hundreds of miles apart!"
College Senior,5,I have never felt unsafe.
College Junior,5,I love this school! The professors are always available and helpful with your next steps in the classroom and starting your career.  I was lucking to find this school !
College Senior,5,Seattle is pretty awesome and there is a lot going on here. I'm sure everyone could find something they love about seattle.
College Senior,5,Basically all dining is off-campus dining since I'm online.
College Senior,5,I'm purely in online classes-- blackboard life is it!
College Senior,5,"I didn't get any scholarships yet, so I've relied solely on financial aid. The award process was easy. I accepted what I wanted and declined what I didn't and the payouts happen fast!"
College Student,5,Seattle is one of the best cities to visit and study in.
College Junior,5,"School is in the heart of a thriving city that is full of activities, culture, events, shopping, and a diverse public."
College Junior,5,"There are lots of different race students and staff at CityU, compared to about 13 other colleges I have been to. I like it, it's different but in a good way."
College Junior,5,I don't live on campus but I have stayed with another student a couple times. It's one of the nicest campus houses I have ever seen or stead at.
College Junior,5,"I'm in MIT performance based program at CityU and it's great. The university is expanding their majors more, it what the students and community want and there are lots of jobs opportunities out there for students that are graduating."
College Junior,5,I have never had any problems with health and safety on campus and everyone I have talked to says the same thing.
College Junior,5,It's all the best. I have gone to two different colleges before this and they don't compare or come close to CityU.
College Junior,5,"In Seattle around the campus there are to many places to pick from to eat at. The cost of food at some places is higher but they are convenient, fast, and have good variety of foods. Most places around the area do offer a student discount but you have to ask about it they don't advertise it."
College Senior,5,I have my own car and i don't live on campus i go online classes
College Senior,5,I have great friends but i don't go to school on campus I go online
College Senior,5,I live with my husband and i go to school online so I don't see what guys at school looks like unless they upload a picture with their bio's in class
College Senior,5,I live  with my family and have my own car and I go online 
College Senior,5,The financial aid process was great because the lady I talked to was great at helping me get what I need
College Senior,5,it's the best because i go online classes so I have my own lap top and wireless and printers
College Senior,5,I love the program I'm in because once I'm done I should be able to get a job and start to help others as for finding a job that will be hard because most places whats people who has already know the line of work
College Junior,5,Almost every student in campus is from a different background.
College Junior,5,A security offices is always patrolling in campus.There is no place for any violation.Everything is desciplined
College Junior,5,"To increase the mobility of its students, staff, and faculty, City University of Seattle has partnered with car2go,,As the world’s first free-floating car sharing service, car2go provides a new way of car sharing that is perfect for the urban dweller and the 21st century student who wants to get around town but doesn’t want to use their own car or doesn’t own a car.

As part of this partnership, car2go will offer CityU free membership (a $35 value) and give the first 30 minutes free."
College Sophomore,5,"Tons of stuff to do in the Seattle area, good nightlife, etc."
College Sophomore,5,They have a great assortment of subjects that are interesting and desirable.
College Sophomore,5,They have a great group of instructors and a real productive environment to learn in.
College Senior,5,I am working on my teaching certification through the alternative certification route so I will be able to be in the classroom full-time and take classes on the weekend and through independent study. This is a great option for me as I have been working as a paraeducator in the classroom already.
College Junior,5,"It's is a school for working adults, so everyone is ver mature. No strictness is needed."
College Junior,5,The financial aid process is very easy. City U does a great job with keeping its students in light of what's going on. Emails are always sent right away to know if any changes were made to your account.
Junior,4,City University has been easy to work with while seeking my degree. Sometimes classes are limited and makes signing up for a particular class difficult.
Freshman,4,"So far, the communication with CityU has been phenomenal -- prompt and easy to understand. They are swift in replying to e-mails and questions and are always open to answering questions no matter how strange. The application process was also easy and quick to complete and the flexibility of their program attracted me to the university in the first place."
Graduate Student,4,Personally I was shocked to see it ranked as a C+ overall. I would give it a B/B+ personally. I first enrolled in 1995 back when HQ was in Bellevue with a main campus location in Renton. They also had classes at Northgate and Everett as well. I know they have a strong presence in Asia and Europe as well. I am in the MBA program and attended off and on from 1995-2004 while I was working in Banking and Retail Merchandising. I am about to re-enroll Spring 2017 and expect to graduate in Spring 2018. I am 95% satisfied with my current experience with them.
Graduate Student,4,Great instructors and administrative staff. Everyone is very friendly and helpful . This is my second quarter at city university of Seattle and so far I have enjoyed it. I like that the courses are offered in quarters. I feel like the classes do not drag on like other semester long courses that other colleges and universities offer.  I just wish there were more courses offered  and more locations near JBLM.
College Senior,4,The best thing about this school is it's online program.
College Senior,4,"The majority of the students are professionals with full time jobs. I like that the professors are also professionals in the real world. I also like that they have a great online program, enabling me to take classes away from the school."
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed my educational experience iys been rewarding.
College Junior,4,The advisor are extremely helpful.
College Sophomore,4,My instructors have been great.
College Sophomore,4,I love the flexibility of the online classes and the professors are very support and easy to work with.
College Senior,4,City University connects with the community that really helps with the career process.
College Senior,4,"I really like the fact that my degree can be earned through distance learning.  As a mom of 3, it's hard to find time to go to class and being able to do all my work online allows me to better my future while taking care of my family."
College Senior,4,"Seattle has a lot going on. There aren't generally a lot of things hosted at school, but there's a lot around."
College Senior,4,"I've taken solely online classes. I haven't had any problems getting registered. The variety of different classes is rather small, leaving few choices for elective classes. Classes move quickly and cover a lot of material and it is extremely hard to get good grades (94% before you can even get an A). Some teachers/classes are better than others and use the technology to their advantage. Some classes are literally just reading and writing papers."
College Senior,4,BA in Management program at CityU is different than any other management program I've seen before. I like the variety of classes in the degree and the emphasis on communication within the business world.
College Student,4,They have been very willing to work within my needs.
College Student,4,The professors are current in the fields that they study.
College Student,4,"Decent for working professionals, but the variety is not large."
College Student,4,I am just starting my courses since getting my Associates. I will find out soon.
College Student,4,I work with others an alone to complete projects and work.
College Student,4,I work with others an alone to complete projects and work.
College Student,4,"I attend City University of Seattle through their online courses. Most of these questions do not apply to me, but they have been very gracious with my deployments as I am an Active Duty Veteran."
College Junior,4,Classes were great. Workload was acceptable.
College Junior,4,"Instructors were understanding, knowledgeable, and caring."
College Junior,4,"There are many different nationalities, religions, economic backgrounds, and people with different sexual orientations."
College Junior,4,"Overall, I enjoy the classes. They are structured but easy to follow. The instructors are knowledgeable and I am glad to be a student at the school."
College Junior,4,Campus feels safe. Housing is secure as I'm told.
College Junior,4,"I would recommend talking to your advisor or financial aid advisor about the process, it makes it a lot easier."
College Junior,4,Same as most schools I have been too.
College Junior,4,I'm not sure which is the most popular area of study but the professors seem to have answers to questions and know what they are teaching. Also the workload is not that bad for grad school and the registration process is easy and online.
College Junior,4,"Off-campus housing availability is the only problem at CityU because it fills up fast, but most people just like living on campus anyway."
College Junior,4,"The university is in a great part of the city near the Seattle space needle, shopping mall, safe area, and a short train or bus ride to the sports stadiums."
College Junior,4,Just wish there was more green space.
College Junior,4,Don't talk to people on campus that much because most of my classes are online.
College Senior,4,I go online so I can eat anytime I want to and I can go to the store and get what I want or need
College Senior,4,it's great because no matter how bad or good the weather is I can still go to class because I go online for my classes
College Junior,4,There is no difference with any one in the university campus
College Junior,4,It is good.Professors are good nice experienced.Their experience is very helpful
College Senior,4,"I am an accounting major taking online courses, and I have found the overall program to be challenging, but not so difficult that I find myself struggling in my courses. The instructors are always available to help, as long as you plan ahead and give them time to respond to emailed questions. This is the primary method of communication with faculty in the online setting, but some instructors do provide phone numbers to reach them in an emergency situation. 

There is great balance in the coursework, amply covering all of the topic areas that will be addressed on the CPA exam. The course material is covered in a variety of ways, as well. A typical course requires written assignments, discussion-type assignments, projects, quizzes, and exams."
Recent Alumnus,4,This is a school or people who just need to finish their degree or get through their university studies but it doesn't have the social and community aspects many students are hoping to get out of the college experience. The facilities are very safe and provide for my learning needs.
College Junior,4,"Of all 36 hospitals in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area.City University of Seattle does not have campus police or campus residences. It does, however, have persons on duty wherever classes are held, who are prepared to contact the local police immediately if needed. The local police would investigate any suspected criminal activity, and determine whether the report was unfounded, false, or a reported crime. The University has direct electronic monitoring burglar alarm systems.
1.University do not let the student to re-enter the classroom or allow students to re-enter the classroom until express permission is granted by the City University of Seattle site person in charge or the police.

2.City University of Seattle is required to prepare and submit an annual report of Campus Crime Statistics, under Sections 485(f) (1) (F) and 485(f) (1) (H) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Submission of the Register of Incidents/Offenses will aid in the compilation of the annual report."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was part of the Masters in Teaching program.  The professors were excellent.  I haven't had a bad class.  The workload was manageable.  We had to do four internships and student teaching, which was a lot of work, but great experience.  Some of the administrators have been less than helpful.  I had to get two of my internships on my own.  All and all I've had a good experience."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I haven't been to the new facility downtown, but the labs are always empty at the Bellevue campus when I've had class.  There seem to be enough computers for the people using them. Also wifi is easily available.  I think some of the professors wish it weren't as many students were checking e-mail or Facebook during class."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Washington is a great place to raise children, school system is okay, city university is nation wide thus far. I have had a few set backs but for the most part it is my only option now."
College Senior,4,"Public transportation is reliable and frequent. Besides public transportation though, everything is within walking distance to the campus. It's a reasonably safe neighborhood and so walking around late at night isn't something to be too concerned with."
College Junior,4,"I generally feel safe on the campus.  It would be nice to see a uniform now and then, just to ward off any suspicious characters."
College Senior,4,"I've been at an internship long term, unpaid. Good."
College Senior,4,Public Transportation is an option if you really need it but I am only required to be on campus once a week and all students are commuters so I just drive my car and most of the students I know do the same.
College Junior,4,The fact that it is a really small school. The building is small and the classes are small. It gives you a better chance to know people in your cohort. You can get more familiar with those around you and there are a lot of people that can help you.
College Junior,4,"Everyone has their own, but many people are willing to carpool."
College Junior,4,Satellite campuses put you close to your neighborhood.
College Junior,4,"Inconsistent workload, but be ready to work because it is a Master's program!"
College Junior,4,I enjoy most of the professors and fellow cohort members that I am studying with.  However the lack of professional communication from City U is a serious frustration.
College Senior,4,"I have received one scholarship from the school.
I thought that there could be a little bit more offered.
The process was simple, and required only a simple phone interview, and small application!
The financial aid office has been very helpful the last couple years!"
College Junior,4,This school is mainly for working individuals. I like that classes are offered online and in-class. Times that classes are given are definitely for working people.
College Junior,4,I have been very satisfied with academics at City U. I feel like I am learning everything I need to know about my future position in business management.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Center of Seattle. I love the local atmosphere at CityU is close to downtown, we have everything we could possible need really close, as markets, libraries, Starbucks, banks, and lots of activities to do, as going to the Imax, the EMP museum, kayak, shopping, and all those places are close, I can go walking everywhere. Also about the safety, I've experience a lot of protection and help from the police officers, they are always tacking care of everyone and they are willing to help you all the time."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've seen people from different races, religion, economic status, and sexual orientation, they all coexist on the same campus and realize daily activities without problem, many students walk and talk on the buildings but the differences they might have just vanish. The University has a lot of diversity and still it has a great environment."
College Junior,4,"Check Out This University – City University not only has campuses all over the place for easy transfer if needed, including outside the United States, but the professors in the Education program really know what they are talking about. I'm in the 8 quarter program for my bachelor's degree and I only have 5 quarters left. So far, I'm impressed."
College Sophomore,4,"Other than Blackboard being down once a month for updating, speed and network reliability are great."
Graduate Student,2,"The Alt. Route program feels very much like a ""jump through these hoops"" sort of program. They do not assist in placement for student teaching. They do not have specific information for each district in the area. They do not have contacts or provide and sort of liaison with your home district. Much of the work that is required is available on line in the blackboard platform. Blackboard is not easy to access and is often down on Saturdays. They offer ""need area"" certifications however they don't have special ed or ell teachers. They don't have samples of ELL or SPED work. Overall pretty disappointing this far. Hopefully I am able to gain enough knowledge to successfully pass the edtpa which is the goal at the end of the day."
College Senior,2,okay -they move locations and classes a lot which is a pain.
College Senior,2,"There are no dining options on campus. The only thing available is Starbucks. CityU really is a working adult type of campus as opposed to the the ""just graduated from high school"" campus experience."
Graduate Student,1,"Horrible school. It's not really an actual college. The library is inefficient, small, no selection. There is no student services, activities or cafeteria. Instructors are lacking experience, knowledge and basic common courtesy. The tuition is way over priced for the quality of education. This school is a scam!. DIPLOMA MILL!!!!"
College Junior,1,There is no athletic program that I could see.
College Freshman,1,school has no greek life
College Freshman,1,we dont have sports at city u
College Junior,1,It is not possibly seen many places related to bars and clubs near campus
College Junior,1,No athletic activities are seen so far on campus
College Junior,1,Almost zero chances to get any scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,1,"City U at Bellevue didn't have any dining room.  The only thing it has is vending machines.  The vending machines weren't bad, with a pretty good selection.  I think the new downtown Seattle campus may have food service, but I don't know."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I came to City University becaue the program was suppose to be campus based, they changed it to online, and stop offereing the program in my city at the  local campus, if I had to do over again, I justed would of waited."
College Senior,1,There is only public paid parking available which is ridiculously expensive and also has time restrictions which means you have to watch the time to make sure you move your car so you won't be ticketed.
College Senior,1,"There are tons of apartments in Beltown, but definitely way out of the average student's price range. You really have to be a full-time working adult to be able to afford to live anywhere remotely close to campus."
College Senior,1,There is no on campus housing available. CityU doesn't even provide off campus housing at a discount to CityU students like Art Institute does. I think it would increase enrollment if there was campus housing available.
College Senior,1,There are no Greek fraternity or sororities advertised on campus. I'm not even sure if there is an option to join any.
College Junior,1,On this campus there are no opportunities for sports.
College Senior,1,I Have Not Found Any So Far – The school that I attend does not have campus living.

Junior,5,I am a psychology major and every single one of my professors are amazing. They plan out their weeks and it is usually clear to understand. They are caring and extremely patient. They understand that there is a lot going on right now and if you talk to them they will work with you for sure.
Senior,5,"The online experience was very different and kind of tough to figure out?l, but the teachers helped us so much to try and understand things that it turned out very well. I believe all my teachers handled everything the right way."
Senior,5,It very nice at Delta State and i would recommend others to join. I play football here and I would say it’s very lovely and that everyone was close that I knew that was the place to be.
Senior,5,"I loved my time at Delta State and even though my last year was cut short, everyone at DSU made sure we were set for success as we finished the year online. I have made many friends and felt like home while there. I am going to miss this wonderful school and its caring faculty and staff!"
Alum,5,Professors were highly engaged and enthusiastic. Class sizes were just right. Very reasonable working through any obstacles.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience was very trying in the beginning. I had to get to know my instructors and learn their expectations. During my time at DSU, I  gained so much knowledge and experience. I completed my Master's degree from  Delta State. This is a very god school. I would HIGHLY recommend it to others."
Junior,5,"I love that fact that the professors know there students by name and are willing to assist them as much as possible. Overall, I like that DSU provide family housing to students with children and married couples."
Junior,5,"All of the teachers really seem to care about their students, and they take the time to get to know all of their students. The teacher to student ratio is really low, so class sizes are relatively small.

 As for student life, they have quite a few selections of greek life, clubs, and honor societies to choose from! There is always something going on campus. From a movie night to dinners hosted by clubs, there's always something to do! 

Campus size is small, so getting to classes quickly isn't hard at all; as a matter of fact, I walk to all of my classes and can get from one side of campus to the other within 10 minutes. Downtown is also within walking distance! (If I had to estimate, I would say it takes around 15-20 minutes to walk downtown)

It's also quite affordable, and my financial aid almost completely covers the cost of attendance.

All in all, I would absolutely recommend Delta State University."
Junior,5,I love that Delta State is a University but has that home feeling to it. It is not overwhelming like most University's are.  The campus is just the right size for me to be able to get where I am going in a timely manner. I love the dorm I am in and I am so excited to start the school year in the fall!
Alum,5,"I completed a bachelors in Speech and Hearing Sciences! I loved the campus, the faculty, the community, and especially the little town of Cleveland, MS. Delta State provides high quality education at a very affordable cost."
Freshman,5,"Delta State is real close to home. The small campus makes you feel a lot closer to everyone, especially in the classroom. Teachers can have have a lot more in depth discussions because of the number of students we have. The only real problem I have with Delta State is their food. The food is not always the best stuff but if I were to see anything change it would be the cafeteria food."
Niche User,5,I went to Delta State University for year and a half. I enjoyed being the because I honestly think it is a great school. I didn’t know what I want to prusue there so I decided to transfer. I hated the food with a passion if I am being honest. I loved the teaching environment because it’s more like a high school setting. The campus is very beautiful and nice to walk around
Freshman,5,"Delta State University is a pretty good school. There are a lot of resources around campus that help you a whole bunch. The dorms here are alright. The cheapest is the best. The diversity here is okay mostly white people. The food in the cafe is nice and the salad bar is great. The work study jobs here are nice and the ones off campus pay a dollar extra. Parking here is not that great, there are limited parking for commuters."
Graduate Student,5,Great one on one classroom learning setting. A reasonable priced school with loving teachers who care about their students.
Senior,5,"Choosing to attend Delta State has been one of the best decisions that I have ever made in my life.  I attended this school for my junior and senior years of college and I am planning to attend Delta State to pursue my masters degree in Sport and Human Performance.  I have gained nothing but great knowledge choosing to go to school here, and I am looking forward to gaining even more knowledge in getting my masters degree.  It has been the college experience of a lifetime."
Freshman,5,I haven't been so I really can't tell you my experiences. I will be a college freshman. I love the campus I wouldn't want to see anything about it change.
Sophomore,5,A small college with manageable classrooms. One on One feel. Best Baseball program in any D2 college
Freshman,5,"I began researching schools, looking at their tuition costs and distances from home. After researching I found Delta State University, and scheduled a time to come visit the campus.  After seeing the campus atmosphere and meeting some of the professors in my department, I fell in love with DSU. I now am a student at Delta State University working to get my private license in aviation."
Sophomore,5,"Delta State University is a public institution providing a comprehensive undergraduate and graduate curriculum to approximately 3,500 students representing all of the states and 50 different countries. Dozens of degree programs on the undergraduate level provide educational opportunities in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education and in the Robert E. Smith School of Nursing. Graduate programs on the master’s, educational specialist, and doctoral levels provide advanced training in a broad range of disciplines."
Senior,5,"I love Delta State because of its diversity. The campus is full of students from all over the world. I'm an American student, but I've made many friends from Africa, Europe and Asia. It feels good getting to know someone that's different from you. You can learn from them all while they can learn from you. The school has done a lot for the international students to make them feel very welcomed and they seem to fit right in."
Junior,5,"Great! The classes are challenging, but very educational. There have been and continue to be a lot of work being done to the campus. There is something for everyone here; sports, fraternities, sororities, academic clubs, band, cheer, dancing... something for EVERYONE! The campus is well maintained and is always making improvements. I feel like I will definitely leave here knowing what I need to know (and more) when I go to my graduate program."
Sophomore,5,Delta is a university with a family feel. Professors care whether you are happy and successful. Great place to get a quality education.
Niche User,5,"Delta State University is a place where anybody can become somebody.  I've had family members who have attended and during their stay, I did a lot of reacting with them on and off the campus.  From the games to a few parties, Delta State University was a great experience.  I got the honor to attend Delta State University my senior year of high school for students who excel in certain subjects.  During that time, I really enjoyed the different teaching techniques.  I found that high school teaching level is almost elementary level to college teaching.  That gave me a heads up then on what I need to expect going into a university for the first time."
Freshman,5,"Delta State is a great university to get your 4-year degree. There is always fun on the campus. I'm an incoming student, but I've been waiting to go to This College ever since I was a freshmen in high school. I can't wait to attend my first day in class."
College Junior,5,Very straight forward and lets you be able to express how you feel about your current or future alma mater!
College Senior,5,I have been able to take a variety of classes that have pushed me to work hard.  My professors are amazing.
College Senior,5,DSU pre-med students have a high acceptance rate at med schools.
College Senior,5,"I am on the softball team and our fan support is awesome!  Students and the community support all of our sports and the community is so good to all athletes.  All of our facilities are very modern and safe.  As an athlete, I am accountable to the Athletic Department and the University as a whole for my actions on and off the field.  It is stressed that I am a representative of the university and this makes me proud to be a part of such a quality organization."
College Senior,5,My classes are small so I have the opportunity to get to know my professors on a personal basis.  There are so many opportunites for students to be involved.  Very friendly atmosphere!
College Freshman,5,Our athletics here at Delta State are wonderful. The Coaches encourage success on and off the field. Sports like tennis and soccer bring students from other countries and encourage diversity on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The academics at my school is very important. The professors want their students to perform well in their classes so they teach at their best and engage the students into  learning. The curriculum is straight forward and is fairly easy to understand and follow. As it relates to the workload, yes it is a lot to take on but once you are able to have good time management and study or homework time the workload wouldn't be as much. The main study option for myself was study hall. It was required that I go to study hall for 5 hours every week because I was a student athlete. This really helped a lot because I got a lot of work done and studying."
College Freshman,5,"During my first semester at Delta State there was a situation where there was an active shooter on campus. Campus police were on the scene the second they heard about it. About a few minutes later the number of police officers increase to find this person. The police was able to find this guy during this same day. So as it relates to safety on campus, I feel really safe and I know that our campus police is looking out for us and keeping us protected."
College Junior,5,"There are not too many professors in the art department teaching the same major (ex. 2 professors out of ~12 teaching graphic related arts), but every teacher will work with a student one by one and/or a group. The student and teachers will build a freindly relationship towards one another. There is usually less than 40 students in general classes, but art related classes  varies from 5 to 15 students. Every student is treated equally and fairly. Instructors provided office hours and sometimes after office hours to have conferences with students."
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. I picked DSU because of the awesome DMI program.
College Sophomore,5,"The food is really, really good. I would know, the freshman fifteen hit me hard."
College Junior,5,I interned at the Clarksdale Press Register. It was awesome. Though they didn't pay me it ga've me the experience that I needed to feel confident that journalism was for me
College Junior,5,"Although I do not partake in abusing drugs of any kind, I am not of where of abundant drug use on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Due to the warm climate, students are opened to numerous amounts of activities. "
College Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is big on sports. The fans are absolutely and 100% supportive.
College Freshman,5,The campus police do not bother you unless you are doing something you are not supposed to.
College Junior,5,they are always there when you need them and very nice
College Senior,5,The computer lab is convenient and a necessary component when living on campus.
College Senior,5,You are likely to make new friends living on campus. Freshmen need to experience dorm life so that they may develop knowledge as to how to take care of themselves. Learning how to make wise choices will help shape their outlook on the world.
College Junior,5,"They are really strict with curfews for opposite sexes in the dorms, and parking."
College Freshman,5,"Very good academic school to attend. I think DSU is very underrated. You can tell the professors are there for us and they teach their courses well. I am in the Delta Music Institute, and we are very laid back with our professors. If you're looking to be in the music industry, DSU is the place to be."
College Freshman,5,Never had any problem with safety and security at DSU. We always see cops around.
College Freshman,5,"Ive never had to use the transportation here on campus at DSU, but from what I have heard its fantastic."
College Junior,5,It a huge variety majors and minors to keep you interesting in the school
College Junior,5,"Being an art major with a concentration in graphic design is awesome here. Now It is easier to get money for it at other schools, but I believe the actual education received is priceless. We have great facilites to work in and awesome instructors. Workload and what is expected varies from major to major and prof to prof. We have a very diverse teaching staff from all over the world here; as well as, our dept head is the international president of the art fraternity Kappa Pi."
College Junior,5,"This is a very secure campus. Being a very small college town, Cleveland has more police than they really need. We always have one or two campus police on duty in addition to usually one  Cleveland or Bolivar county police riding through. I haven't seen any that abuse power as of yet. The few that I've met seem to be really good people"
College Junior,5,"Here at Delta State, we have a wide variety of people on Campus. We have tons of international students. Whether you want a southern guy or girl, or preppy boy or girl--they can be found. All of our guys and girls are intertwined. I'm thankful I can say DSU's population does not necessarily have ""cliques"". Everyone meshes together to make our own little family!"
College Junior,5,"Cleveland, MS is a small town compared to other college towns. Dining in Cleveland is great. From mexican to chinese to good home southern cooking, Cleveland has it all. It has a wide variety to pick from whether you want quick and cheap or fancy and expensive. Most restaurants offer student discounts and one is able to use their Okra-Green Kard at some places as well. My favorite restaurant to eat at in Cleveland is The Warehouse. The building is a remodeled old warehouse with tall ceilings and a down home feel to it. It is decorated with local artists artwork as well as old street and coca-cola signs. The food is amazing and the cost is average. I, personally, recommend the pan-seared parmesan crusted catfish--this is the Mississippi Delta and Cleveland is not far from the US Farm Raised Catfish Capital of the World, Belzoni. So of course, I stick to my roots and recommend the Catfish! Overall I do not think one could be dis-satisfied with the places you get to choose from in Cleveland."
College Senior,5,"Social Work – I am very happy with the Social Work program. My teachers are very helpful and understanding. If I had a chance to reapply for Delta State Social Work program I will do it again and again. My goals are finishing Delta State and moving to Jackson, Ms to further my education and find a descent job. I have no concern all I need to is go take the Social Work license exam and it is  guarantee that I find a job."
College Senior,5,Computer Lab – I enjoy each computer lab on campus because each one will always have a available computer and the labs are never pack.
College Sophomore,5,I Love Going to Games. We are ranked very high in all types of sports. It is a thrill to be a part of it.
College Junior,5,"Full Support – Varsity sports at Delta State are not only a campus wide event, but just about everyone from the community come out to support. The athletic centers on campus are superb, the athletes have their own building that houses private weight rooms, a great trainers room with at least 4 trainers at all times in it, class rooms for study halls and tutoring, and the athletic directors office. The maintenance crews maintain the stadiums for every sport really well, which creates a fantastic atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,"Education Major – I have not had a teaching internship yet, but I have heard from upperclassmen that the education program and its future opportunities are excellent."
College Freshman,5,The Fighting Okra – The Fighting Okra makes Delta State unique. They have the only aviation program in this region of the country.
College Freshman,5,2 main clubs in Cleveland if that is your scene. Thursday is the big party night
College Freshman,5,"The weather does not really impact my campus experience, but it is nice to have a pair of rain boots and an umbrella handy for those southern downpours. Winters are pretty mild, but because of this, sometimes the dorms can get rather warm due to the heater running! It is nice to have a fan in your dorm."
Junior,4,Delta State charges a bunch of random fees to their students. BUTTT the teacher to student ratio is pretty great. All the professors are friendly and are understanding. Only flaw is the extra fees and the parking could be better.
Freshman,4,"So far in my short time here, I think this school is a nice learning environment. I also think that this will be a great place to spend the next 4 years."
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience is going smoothly. Sometimes it may be difficult to understand the lessons, but the professors are very helpful."
Senior,4,"Delta State is a good college for students looking to go into teaching, aviation, nursing, or speech and hearing sciences. The school is old and going through repairs slowly, but the food in the cafeteria is good, the dorms are comfortable, and the instructors are excellent."
Senior,4,My experience at delta state university is more or less average.It mainly is a small town area so it mostly consist of older generation than younger generation.The campus is ok just not much to do on the weekends.The faculty and professor i met are very helpful and easy to communicate with.
Alum,4,I recently graduated and I highly recommend this school based solely on the cheap tuition and the professors. I was in business and I truly felt the professors were there to help me graduate. Small class sizes really help you develop relationships with fellow students and professors. The downside to DSU is the town and social/Greek life. The Greek life is kind of like clubs since they don’t have houses so not like most schools. I’ve heard the phrase “you have to make your own fun” and that’s definitely the case. If you’re a person who is interested in just the academics and not so much the social aspect of college then this place is for you. Not to say that you won’t meet great people and have good times. Overall great experience if you’re like me who was just wanting to grab a degree and start life.
Freshman,4,Delta State is a very family oriented university. I would like to see more interest in the football program.
Sophomore,4,Delta State is the perfect college for anyone looking for a small campus with a family feel. Faculty and staff are extremely helpful and personable!
Freshman,4,university focuses only on academics. Great professors for stem majors. Would be better if they add more campus events for students like on campus parties and student clubs. Campus food is good but kinda the same most of the time.
Junior,4,"Great University love have the University get you prepare and ready for your next step.  The university has set up information, people and lifeline to the University and will be the means for official communication between DSU students and the campus including Faculty, Administration, and fellow students."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people on campus. Everybody is really friendly and I see familiar faces everywhere I go. The professors are very accommodating, especially for athletes who might have to miss some classes. The classes are very small with a good student to teacher ratio, that make the learning environment so much better."
Junior,4,I've attended this school for 3 years and I will be entering my final year. Delta State is a great school. This university has great academics along with athletics.
Junior,4,"Delta State's student body is very diverse, which gives a great opportunity to meet new people from other countries and cultures! There is always something to do on campus, also many organizations to join. Although it is a small campus, everyone is friendly and we are all a family!"
Junior,4,"Overall, I like my experience at Delta State University. A few changes I would like to see is cooperative activities done on campus."
Senior,4,"Delta State University is one of the most affordable colleges in the entire country. With the PTK scholarship, your  full tuition is paid. That along with FASFA (Pell Grant) you really only need one loan. Our student body is small less than 3000 but very diverse as there is an exceptional number of foreign exchange students. It's a fun and fascinating experience to meet people from other countries and cultures! Small campus is easy to navigate and they recently repaved all the roads."
Junior,4,"I love Delta State and the people who work there try their best to make it an amazing experience for their students. It is a small town so you have to get involved to really get the college experience or you might just sit in your dorm room your whole four years. I recommend joining Greek life and getting out of your comfort zone. It can help you make new friends fast in a small town and help you get involved in the small community. It will also help you connect with teachers and staff, surprisingly. The teachers actually know your name and are willing to go out of their way to help you with something. This is a great school and quality education."
Senior,4,My experience at Delta State has been wonderful. The teachers and staff are extremely helpful and informative.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed my time at Delta State. It is a small, quiet campus. Everyone here is very friendly. Greek life is very diverse and all come together to help make that experience on campus incredibly enjoyable. Majority of the teachers are always willing to help out the student, the best way they can. The community, in which the university is located, has a lot of fine eateries and attraction, and is overall a safe, and welcoming environment. Coming to Delta State was one of the best decisions I ever made, but don’t just take my word for it, come see for yourself."
Sophomore,4,"I really love Delta State University as Cleveland is a really nice and beautiful town with great people. There is a lot of diversity in this school and everyone is really nice and the professors are great. They teach well and try to know you personally too which is really nice. One of my concerns is the student life. Most times, it gets boring and there are not really much activities during the spring semester. The fall semester is busy because of its football season but there are not a lot of things to do in Cleveland so it will be nice if we had things to do on campus. Also, the cafeteria food is not good. Sometimes it tastes good and they have a variety but other times its really not good. Dinner is always never enough and food starts to finish long before the closing time. This makes the students have to rely on the food court in the union until they run out of flex."
Freshman,4,"I love how personal you can get with everyone there, how nice everyone is, and how home-y the campus feels."
Graduate Student,4,Delta State University made the enrollment and registration process simple and efficient. Overall I am very pleased with Delta State University.
Freshman,4,"I love the small campus and that there is a close bond with everyone on campus. The academics are challenging but with the smaller classes, it is so much easier to receive help. Greek life, sports, and other organizations are very popular."
Senior,4,My experience at Delta State was excellent. It's a very hands on type of school. You will succeed in learning here. The group studies are awesome. The professor here take the time to actually work with you. 
College Junior,4,When the shooting happened on campus everyone was notified in a timely manner and campus police made everyone feel safe.
College Junior,4,Most of the dorms are conjoined bathrooms which isn't my favorite thing. But the rooms are a decent size.
College Junior,4,"The teams are pretty great all around, especially or swim teams."
College Senior,4,I feel safe.  My campus handled an active shooter situation on campus extremely well this past year.
College Senior,4,I am  a Sorority Sister and have loved it.  It has given me so many opportunties to meet people and to give back to the community and college through our events.
College Freshman,4,"There is always a Campus policeman within distance of where you are.  And while we may not like it when they crash our parties, we have to realize that it is for our safety.  They really do care about us.  September 14, 2015, a former professor came to campus and shot and killed one of our History professors.  Within minutes, the Campus Police were there trying to figure out everything and us students were put on Lockdown.  They have good relations with community first responders and the whole situation was handled in an exceptional manner."
College Freshman,4,Not many students have an issue with finding a job after getting their degree from this school.
College Freshman,4,"Our school had a shooting my first semester here where one professor was killed by another professor.  It was a pretty rough time for our school but we all stuck together to help each other through it.  Also my cousin was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and students at school were very helpful to raise money for his medical bills. One of my sorority sisters was in a car wreck where she was hit by a drunk driver, a fellow student, but everyone has come together because we are all one big family."
College Freshman,4,"Diversity on campus is very huge. One of the goals of the school is to increase the diversity on campus and it has been increasing over the years. There is no discrimination taking place. Everyone is accepted. It doesn't matter where you come from, your religion, political beliefs or your sexual orientation, you are accepted. Diversity plays a huge role on the campus making the school even more better to attend."
College Freshman,4,The courses at this school were great and the professors really showed their interest in students and what they taught. Professors made sure if you didn't understand the class material you can speak with them after or come to their office for available office hours. The class sizes were very big for some classes but small for some of them. The average class size at delta state would be about 20 which isn't that bad.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree at delta state is at large for many students here and it is very important. But the school provides many opportunities for students to find jobs related to their degrees. Delta State does this mainly through job fairs on campus which turned out to be very successful. The employers recruiting on campus are very professional and they look for the best for their company. Career services on campus is very helpful and it will help in finding a job anywhere on campus.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is a great idea because it gets us students a little more focus on our school work and allows us to perform better. Also when living on campus it allows us to feel what college life is like rather than staying in a typical home off campus. The atmosphere in the dorms is great. Everyone is happy to see one another and there is a lot of positive attitudes in the building. From what is provided in the dorms the cost is acceptable and convenient.e
College Freshman,4,Athletics plays a huge role in student life. It gives students the opportunity to see how great the athletic programs are and also allow them to use the great facilities provided by the school and athletic department. Students at delta state really support all the teams and when they do so our teams are able to turn that support and excitement into confidence and wins.
College Junior,4,Delta State provides students with many opportunities in order to pursue th provide students many opportunities in order to pursue their career and earn their degree through experience and hard work. Students have been encouraged to visit career services and a large majority of students recieved internship and work study programs that gave a posorive impact towards their degree. Every semester a business career fair is held on campus which opens various opportunities for recruiters to evaluate students and their potential. They are very friendly and are not too intimidating when you are being interviewed .
College Junior,4,The safety and security is excellent. Campus police are station on almost every block and will escort you to your destination if needed or asked. I always feel safe when I see a campus police vehicle stationed outside when I am walking at night to finish a project in one of the buildings.
College Junior,4,"Delta state is a school that makes you feel at home (students, activities, commutative services). The instructors take the time to learn each students individualities and provide counseling. They also offer many job/ intern opportunities related to every major almost every semester. With the help of my instructors,I improved my artwork and entered various art shows to promote my work. I have become a very successful student."
College Junior,4,DSU is absolutely one of the best choices in MS!
College Junior,4,"Great school, very diverse student and teacher population"
College Sophomore,4,"The friendliness, and helpfulness of the staff at this school really set it apart from any other. That was the major deciding factor for me."
College Sophomore,4,"It's much easier than commuting, but you still get the ""at-home"" feel for the school year"
College Sophomore,4,Without off-campus dining I would definitely not survive.
College Sophomore,4,Our campus is pretty strict. They say what they mean and mean what they say.
College Sophomore,4,I am a part of a Greek organization myself. I can say that Greek life is an experience that makes your college years the best experience of your life.
College Sophomore,4,The parties are great on at my school. It basically depends on who's throwing them and what day it is  thrown.
College Sophomore,4,this was easy and simple
College Sophomore,4,There is something for everyone
College Sophomore,4,There is always something to do in Cleveland.
College Junior,4,It's a lot of computers for everybody to use.
College Junior,4,Everybody loves sports at our school.

Recent Alumnus,4,They do make sure the students are in the right parking area.
College Junior,4,I beleive they have a great Athletic program and is improving.
College Freshman,4,Both the security and safety on campus are great
College Junior,4,"All together I am very satisfied with my academic education at this point. I want to be an educated influential member in society, although it is hard at times to work and pay for school.  They pay off will be worth it if I can excel academically while working during any spare time I have."
College Junior,4,A large amount of students are involved in the athletic cycle. 
College Freshman,4,We have one of the biggest football stadiums for a division 2 college.
College Student,2,Other than a shooting the past year.
College Student,2,Some teachers should not teach.
College Student,2,They come to class hungover. Also drive drunk.
College Sophomore,2,Trying to get financial aid made me feel as though I was getting the run around.  I was always being put on hold and transferred to another department. It was such a hassle.
College Freshman,2,the games suck and student involvement is bad
College Freshman,2,I don't like the hands on Delta state has to offer.
College Freshman,2,I don't like the housing I live in.
College Freshman,2,Not enough healthy options for students who are looking to stay in shape.
College Freshman,2,Many frats at the school. None of which think above the rest.
College Freshman,2,Good food at affordable costs for college students.
College Junior,2,the feeding aspect of the school is okay and the dining of the school is also in good shape and position. the structure is well organized and well structured.
College Junior,2,the computer availability is very poor as a result of students been crowding the computers for research and other works. the computers in the school environment are not enough for the work load of students because majority of the students have assignments to do and projects research. also the network system is poor and the wireless code is only shared to some people. the speed of the network is slow as a result of many users. hope this can be resolve.
College Junior,2,transportation is one of the major problem facing students and we need a proper adjustment to suit our mobility mode when going for lectures. i hope the school authority will do proper check and make resolution to the transport system in the school to improve our mobility system.
College Freshman,2,Everyone is friendly. The only problem I see at this school is all the thievery. People breaking into cars and stealing clothes out of the washers and dryers.
College Senior,2,"The dining can be better.  The Mill in the Union is wonderful.  The campus bookstore also has great dorm room friendly foods.  The cafeteria isn't the best, however.  I've heard that it's going to improve though!"
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes the meals are delicious, but other times the food is bland. There isn't much of a variety. Also, students do not get a discount."
College Junior,2,I only went to few parties and I had fun but I just didn't really enjoy myself I guess.
College Freshman,2,It is easy to find an apartment however it's Cleveland MS so all apartments are the same and they are all cheap and kinda dirty.
College Sophomore,2,The financial process was ridiculous for certain people
College Senior,2,"Not Enough – Financial aid helps alot but it is not enough to cover tution; therefore, each student recieving financial aid have take out a large amount of money which is called a student loan."
Freshman,1,"Over all terrible school. I am only here for the Aviation Flight Operations major, otherwise I would much rather a school like Southern Miss or Ole Miss. The atmosphere of the school is extremely boring. The housing is terrible. Food is terrible. Cleveland itself is boring and not very nice. If you have lived in an agricultural town before and dont mind it then Delta State may be okay for you. If you come from a nice town with lots to do then Delta State is definitely not your place. The Aviation program is also on a major downturn. They simply do not have enough instructions to accommodate people. Students may be waiting years to even be able to fly. I would definitely not recommend this school."
Junior,1,"Being at a PWI, is always a downfall for African Americans. Not only is a downfall, I have witness being treated differently by my professor that gave me the impression that it was due to my skin color. Not only does my skin color affect my opportunities, whether I'm an athlete or non-athlete affects me also. Most athletes get to attend school for free, they graduate with honors, they receive special treatment from professors, and they receive better grades than non-athletes. Athletes always pass no matter what classes they are enrolled in. Many people try to blame it on study hall, but that is not the case. They will admit that they cheat and their coaches vouch for them. Their tutors also complete their work making their life a lot better. Before you come to Delta State, be sure to weigh your options."
Niche User,1,The most snobbish place I ever stepped foot in!!!! DO NOT EVEN LAY MY BODY OUT THERE FOR VIEWING!!! NOT WORTH MY REMAINS!!!!
College Freshman,1,there is no local atmosphere
College Freshman,1,i think the academics are useless
College Freshman,1,it has no effect because the parties horrible
College Junior,1,We have no ways of transportation on campus unless people have their own cars.
College Freshman,1,They do not allow you your financial aid on time!
College Junior,1,during raining times people find it difficult to attend classes because of cold weather. 
College Junior,1,okay because most people turn up for the sport activities as away to relax the body.
College Junior,1,economics is one of the department that is a standard department in the school.
College Junior,1,well the academics per tarn is okay and organized. the lecturers are feet for the jobs.  
College Junior,1,they are not that bad but have some selfishness in them.
College Sophomore,1,"My experience with financial aid hasn't been the best. My first year was a breeze. This year though they neglected to tell me I needed to send things to a different address in addition to giving the financial aid office my paper work. This lead to me missing out on so much help I could have gotten to pay for my school. I now owe the school money, whereas last year, I was given a refund a check (which I used for books and to live off of because I didn't have a job). I am now scrambling to scrape up money so that I can pay for my school, books, and supplies I need. I wish the department would have been more thorough with all I needed to do instead of just telling me to give them my papers."
College Senior,1,There is not really a nightlife for college students beside the events that are on campus.
College Freshman,1,I do not think there is any public transportation.
College Junior,1,"I am sad to say that most of my and my fellows students' trouble come from financial aid.  The people in the office are really not willing to help students that much. They just seem to want to get you out of their faces. The lady that is over the financial aid dept is very good at what she does; however, the team she has below her need to be replaced. This is not solely my opinion, it seems to be the general consensus of the number of students I've asked. I thought it was maybe just me, but I have learned that is not the case."
College Senior,1,"There are buildings and parking areas that are being remodeled so it's impossible to find a parking space close to your class and the color marker of your parking decal. Even if you get to the campus a few hours early, you're still spending 5-10 minutes looking for a parking spot. Instead most folks are having to park at least a half mile away from the campus. The tickets that they give out seem to be unnecessary and way too expensive. Most of the students there don't have money just to give away to the money-hungry citation officers. There are some remodeling spots on campus where there are no color markers for decals and yet they still give out tickets. They have those little shuttle buses, and the ironic and stupid thing about that is that the students aren't allowed to be transported to class on them. In my opinion, the parking is VERY terrible!!!"
College Freshman,1,"Have Your Own Car – While you do not need it to get around campus, a car is necessary to get around Cleveland. There is not a good public transportation system in the area."
College Senior,1,Online Student – The online experience is good.  Interacting with the University by phone has been problematic.  Some of the departments are not in tune with the online student at all and are rude.

Graduate Student,5,South is a wonderful institution. The staff is wiling to assist the students in any way possible to achieve their goals. Along with this they are very friendly to adult learners who are pursuing their education along with jobs and a family.
Graduate Student,5,Awesome online environment. Easy to navigate. Great experience with professors and fellow peers. I obtained my bachelors and now in my masters program here at South and have been very successful while working full time and raising a family. The format is easy to follow with notifications. The assignments are due on the same day each week and the classes last six weeks long. It is even possible to manage multiple classes at once.

Freshman,5,"From the moment I had contact with Armando, I knew I had found the right college for me. He's walked me thru every step and makes sure I understand the process!!"
Freshman,5,"I attend South University as an online student.  I chose online classes for accessibility because I have a non-traditional work schedule. South University offers an array of fast track Degree programs in a wide variety of fields, at their physical campus and online. The Admissions and Financial Team were exceptional in helping me feel at ease with my decision to return to school. The Financial Team at South University was very through in exploring available payment options, taking into consideration my present financial situation and demands. 
As I have not been in school for over 15 years, I had little idea what to expect. On my first day, my Admissions Officer, Kathy O., introduced me to the online classroom setting, explaining the extensive online resources available. Overall, South University is invested in my success, as much as I am."
Freshman,5,"While my experience has been limited so far, what I have experienced in contrast to other schools is best described as finding  a pearl in my order of oysters.  I had been searching for an online school that offered what I feel called to do that was an actual college and not a technical college or trade 'university'.  South University is exactly what I had  been searching for and would recommend anyone searching for a real college degree offered online that this is the place for them."
Senior,4,Loved the 5 week classes!  Teachers were all great. Online learning can be challenging so I think they do the best they can with the resources.

Sophomore,4,I am a new student. I am very excited for the adventure. South University has been awesome. They have been so helpful with my whole process of getting me started.
Junior,4,"I like the small nursing classes, I don't like that it is really expensive and the fact that it is a private college because credits do not transfer out."
Freshman,4,South University is an okay school to go to. They try to work around you schedule. They don't a great school environment. The diversity is nice at South.
Sophomore,4,I like that all of the staff is very friendly and always involved. They will do everything in their power to help you graduate. It's a small yet very intimate college. I think smaller colleges are better only because you really have that one on one time with the professors. Overall I like the school and would recommend to anyone that asks
Freshman,4,South University is a very small school.  The instructors  and other staff members are concern about their students future and very attentive to students  needs to keep them  on track . I think I will be able to achieve my goal at this university within the next year and a half.
Sophomore,4,I love the school. The faculty is extremely  professional and the class sizes are small. This school has given me the confidence that I needed in order to start school again.
Freshman,4,"I do appreciate the help south university's faculty offers students that may need.Faculty are also shows  concerns  toward students  who may exhibit problems  attending due to external circumstances.I feel I can ask for help of my professors and they will help me or direct me to whomever may be able to assist  me.Access  to the library  is 6 days a week,that's  important. South university-columbia ask more of their students concerning academics and I'm  confident  that will better prepare  me for the work force upon completion."
Freshman,2,"The University is very expensive and the teachers are very hard to get into contact with. I went to South for my first year of college, and although I carried a 4.0, I did not feel like I learned much from this school. The finance councilor was very hard to get into contact with and my advisor never seemed to have an answer regarding my classes. Overall, the school did not preform for my expectations of what college should be."
Freshman,1,I had a bad experience with south university online and would not talk anyone into attending the school.  The teachers don't know how to teach either.  The advisors are bad too and lie to get you to attend the school. and only call you when there is a problem. Or you don't attend classes when they ask you to.  Also they really lack when trying to help you with the issue your having with the class or teachers.  I have issues that are still not fixed yet and ready to call management to get the issues fixed next week.  They call and never tell you the problem when you tell the not to call you back.  I had to block them from calling me and email only cause of there problems with not being any help.  StAy away from the school and don't listen the lies they tell you either.  Also tell your friends to do the same too.  The financial aid department sucks too and the English teachers too along with not telling you what classes you will be taking next.

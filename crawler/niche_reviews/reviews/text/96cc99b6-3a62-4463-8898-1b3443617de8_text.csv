Alum,5,"Lots of resources for students, understanding staff and great academics. Whenever you need help, there are always at least 3 faculty members waiting to help you. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly. You make friends in every class, all your classmates are very helpful and nice."
Sophomore,5,"I have had no problems at Centralia College.  Would be nice to have more ASL interpreter, but they are hard to come by.  I have had great instructors.  I wish they had more tutoring programs for students who are studying Accounting."
Freshman,5,"Centralia College’s mission of providing life-long learning is important to me because I am eager to learn. I appreciate that each class size are around twenty to twenty-five people.  The variety of degrees at Centralia College offer a career path for everyone, and I was able to find a career path that I am passionate about. The advisors are friendly, welcoming and eager to help me achieve my highest success.  I have a mentor that is very supportive, and I use the tutors in every department as much as I can.  I am also enrolled in a student success program to help me succeed in college.  I would like to see a change in the work atmosphere to become greater than how big it is now."
Freshman,5,Centralia College is a very comfortable school. The professors are kind and down to earth. I would like more options for 4-year programs at CC.
Sophomore,5,I've really enjoyed my time studying at Centralia College. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate with plenty of places to study.
Sophomore,5,"Centralia College is a wonderful school in a wonderful location. A small-town college that knows how to act big. Centralia College is a professional, academically focused, and support facility and students fairly. If you want a school that has that small-town feel and big town effect. Come and see."
Sophomore,5,A school that will connect  you with people that will help you understand career gaol.  While there was lack of diversity their are groups to connect people.
Freshman,5,Great college. I actually really really enjoy being here. All of my professors are super funny and nice.
Freshman,5,"Running Start student here! CC has been afforded me an amazing opportunity to gain a head start in my higher education in a supportive, academic environment. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and the students are likewise very dedicated and friendly. Thank you, CC!"
Sophomore,5,"As a running start student, Centralia college is the best possible place to prepare yourself for life after high school. They prepare you for university, teach you important life skills (namely being independent and responsible @ hs juniors), and can even help you get your AA while still in high school. I have no regrets about attending Centralia college for my last two years of high school."
Freshman,5,"I have only competed one quarter at Centralia College. I took two online classes during Summer Quarter. The professors that I have encountered so far, they have all been very helpful and informative. The only part that I wish was different is the tuition costs. I think that is an issue at any college, however. The campus is also very nice and updated."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Centralia College as a running start student and earned my AA and High School diploma at the same time. I served on Student Government as the Senator for Clubs and Organizations, and I loved it. I made a lot of great connections and appreciated the humility and friendliness of the atmosphere."
Alum,5,This college is growing fast but still gives special attention to each student. They offer several 4 year degrees and even have a wide variety of online classes. Easy access from the areas interstate with several outreach campus'. Centralia College is the oldest continually open college in the state of Washington. I am very proud to be an alumni!
Alum,5,This was a wonderful school to attend. The professors really care about you and want to help you succeed. There is a broad range of classes to take and that are interesting.
Alum,5,One of the best experiences of my life.  The professors were super engaging and the students were very inclusive.
Sophomore,5,"I am in my last quarter of earning my AA entirely online. Class material, interaction, and instructor facilitation have been consistently excellent. Professors challenged me, were helpful, and provided plenty of guidance and encouragement when I needed it. Overall, I would highly recommend Centralia College."
College Freshman,5,When sick or having other emergencies come up the instructors are wiling to work with students to help them still achieve there academic goals
College Freshman,5,There is an on campus technology resource center and their hours are accommodating for a variety of different schedules.
College Freshman,5,"Keep the new student in mind. Offers college transfer fairs, job fairs, and club fairs so the students have ample opportunity to get involved."
College Junior,5,I had no problems what so ever with credits that I earned from a Nevada college I attended in 1997!
College Junior,5,"Via the Canvas login for students, online courses as well as interaction with any student or professor is easy.  I myself have only taken courses in the classroom and not online. The topics of choice are almost the same as what a student would take on campus in person."
College Junior,5,"My major is Media Arts.  This includes communication via journalism, tv, video production, and radio broadcasting via the campus radio station KCED. I am studying radio broadcasting and am on the campus radio station almost daily while school is in attendance.  This will help me go into, if needed, internship with local commercial radio stations as the media instructor at Centralia College encourages all of the broadcasting students to get on the radio and develop their own style.  He makes it very easy to study this field with mostly hands on assignments and he takes into consideration our other classes, finals, etc.  The job opportunities while still a student are there for the taking and I highly recommend anyone interested in radio broadcasting to study at this college."
College Junior,5,"Centralia College is an excellent school to attend! Being the oldest continually open community college in Washington state since 1929, the faculty today are genuinely concerned how you are learning and progressing toward your final goal, whether that goal is a GED, an Associates Degree, Bachelors Degree or employment training.  The school offers daycare at no charge, endless tutoring in various forms, amongst other assistance, making sure the student is advancing academically and personally, reducing dropout rates.  Smaller class size makes it much easier to access the instructor when needed.  There is also always some kind of activity going on somewhere on campus that makes the student feel even more of an important part of the college and not just a number."
College Freshman,5,"Centralia College, although small, is a very nice place to learn and feel comfortable. As both a Freshman in college and a junior in high school the idea of running start was very daunting, but this college was very welcoming and the professors are kind. As well as very up to date technology. 

It has made my experience as a first timer a very good one and I would gladly recommend others to take part in the Centralia College learning experience."
College Junior,5,"Centralia College offers many great associate as well as a couple bachelor degrees. The staff and faculty are helpful and knowledgeable.  Sports, clubs, music, and other activities makes the campus community worth it.  Spring fest! They have a new science center and are building a new student center.  Campus is clean and lovely in the fall and spring.  And, the Centralia College Foundation offers exceptional scholarships for their students.  Centralia is affordable, educational, and located in a convenient location."
College Student,5,"The student body is always decking out for our next game, they always show their spirit and offer a lending hand when someone is in need of one. If you have a problem, it will most likely be sorted out in a reasonable time frame."
College Senior,5,"The tutoring center is a great place to get help and the people at the writing center are excellent at helping you with your essays.  Many teachers will tell you where you can find these places so that you can do the best you can possible do.  The campus actives are great as well and often have food, the library is very nice place to study or get homework done."
Recent Alumnus,5,I love online classes! There is no difference from class room to computer screen making the ease of my schedule so much better!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Our student body achieve everything we set our minds too. We all go through the motions and we know where we need to add something, take out something, improve on and how to make college campus safe, effective and perfect for our community."
College Junior,5,"Computers are available in the library, computer labs, and personal laptops connect to the wifi in any building on campus."
College Junior,5,"Always goes through quickly, never heard anyone complain about it."
College Junior,5,"The professor and associate professor at the college that teach history are two of the most knowledgeable, friendly, community-active, and helpful teachers that I have ever had to interact with. They are extremely hard-working and supportive to their students, and provide ready support and advice for anyone interested in making history their major. "
College Junior,5,"The curriculum offered in the courses that I have taken are excellent. The professors obviously are very knowledgeable of their topics and capable of teaching others as well. They have worked with me and with others on their schedules to make it work for all parties involved. Some teachers offer retakes and makeups on tests and quizzes while others don't, but for the most part it is very easy to make a workable schedule. "
College Freshman,5,We have free WiFi everywhere you go at Centralia College. 
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed the online courses I took the last 2 quarters and would highly recommend them.  I would suggest making sure your instructor is familiar with the program first however because one professor was new to the system and she deleted the entire classes final essay and peer reviews one day before they were due.  That was frustrating!  Otherwise great experience and I would do it again without a thought.
College Junior,5,"I am a art major, My classes when I started college I did not know what to expect, but since I have been a student I pretty much have gotten used to college life.  No I do not live on campus, but I go to school anywhere from 2-4 days a week.  I have had some business classes, all of my electives are full, I learned to take one maybe two hard classes and one or two lighter classes to balance out my schedule.  With having a learning dissability getting my degree has taken me a lot longer to complete than most people.  My core classes like math and english is where I struggle the most.  I have about one year left of which I am still needing, math, english and a science or two and a couple of history classes."
College Junior,5,"This is the end of my second year attending Centralia College and I've had no problems with any of the staff here. Everyone is super helpful and more than willing to help answer any questions you may have. The classes that I've been enrolled in have been very interesting and anytime I needed help with something, my instructors were very helpful."
College Junior,5,I am a criminal justice major and so far have been pleased with my classes. All the classes I have had to take have been very informational and had good teachers. I am not burryed under work but do have a hearfty pile of work.
College Senior,5,Wifi works everywhere on campus. There are 3 different computer labs on campus. If a student didn't have a computer they would be okay.
College Senior,5,Turn in application before priority dead line and everything works out great.
Freshman,4,"Lovely teachers, great environment, everyone enjoys helping you for the most part. Some professors are definitely more helpful than others, and if you find yourself struggling with a class, I would advise seeking out another professor in the same subject and get help from them instead. Cafeteria is average but the coffee shop is pretty good. Beautiful greenhouse."
Sophomore,4,"Centralia College offers a very nice and small campus. Yes it is a community college with a smaller campus but this is nothing like an ordinary community college. The buildings here a very nice inside and out, the court yards are beautiful with new additions coming each year, the small community offers a great opportunity to meet new people and create life long friends."
Freshman,4,"I just started attending Centralia College recently, and it has been great! So far, all the faculty has been very helpful and the teachers want you to succeed. The buildings are also in good repair and the classes are the perfect size, not too big!"
Freshman,4,I have had a great experience with Centralia College. I have found the process of applying and getting started with school very easy. The staff are helpful. The college offers a variety of degrees to choose from. It is a nice school that I would recommend.
Alum,4,"I had a great counselor at Centralia.  She helped pushed me everytime I felt overwhelmed so that I could complete my Associates degree.   The campus is very well laid out as well, and make sure you visit in spring, the cherry blossoms in the courtyard are gorgeous."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed the cheap tuition and scholarship help from the community since I have been given zero help at home. The students are nice but a few of the  professors have screwed a lot Students over. Mostly a decent school.
Niche User,4,Centralia College has an amazing enviornment for everyone. There is amazing professors and small class sizes giving each person an opportunity to talk with and get ti know their professors. Something I would like to see change is the counseling. My counselor doesn't always help me choose the classes I want to take that also will match my degree.
Junior,4,"I loved how all the staff is so helpful and willing to show all the options open to you. It really influenced my decision to return for my second degree. The only thing I would like to see change is that I wish they had more programs available. Due to being a community college in a small town, they can be limited. But they are hoping to add more soon!"
Graduate Student,4,I liked the small town feel and the community surrounding it. I was taught well and didn’t feel like I struggled through this college. There was also a lot of on campus help.
Freshman,4,"I like the accessibility Centralia has to offer. Not only do they offer evening and night time classes, but also online classes which makes it easy to complete the courses in a shorter amount of time. The only thing I would change is the readiness of the Centralia College admissions center. Most colleges that offer online classes generally follow up with a new student or inquirer and contact them directly; in this case, I had to go in and schedule an appointment to be seen for advisory in order to get all the information I needed. Other than that, this college suits me just fine and I enjoy my time here."
Sophomore,4,I'm a Running Start student and I am so very glad that I chose to be a part of the Centralia College program. I love the atmosphere on campus and the faculty and staff are fantastic.
Sophomore,4,"It is a nice community college. There are many good, as well as bad, teachers, and the campus is quite nice to look at."
Sophomore,4,"I started going here as a high school senior in Running Start. I had a lot of fun going to college and being in a more mature environment. This school has really grown to have a lot more Bachelor's programs, so it's affordable, and really close to home for me. The advisors are really informed to help you get the classes you need. Great and affordable college to get you started."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Centralia College has been great. I have been able to get help whenever needed, they tke care of your whatever you need. From sports to housing they constantly are doing their best job to keep your nose in the books and help you to succeed in life."
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Centralia College. Although this probably isn't the most fun place to go to school, it worked for me. I was able to work close to school and attend all my classes. I really learned a lot from most of my teachers and professors, and they were personable and easy to get help from. I ended my time at Centralia College with online classes, which were presented in a very user-friendly format. The only issue I had with CC is the parking, which I believe they have added more by this time. Centralia College was a great school to earn an AA degree at."
Niche User,4,"I'm a running start student and the college provides a wide variety of classes at the main campus, the CCEast branch, and online.  I am satisfied with my education so far."
Freshman,4,I am absolutely in love with the campus. At first it seems a little confusing but after the first week you get to know the place rather well. The professors are fantastic and the food is delicious. The kitchen staff is very nice and helpful at all hours of the day and our little coffee/donut stand is ran by a coach who makes your drinks the way you like them and always likes to know how everyone is doing!
Niche User,4,Great School small enough to where you can get quality time with the instructors yet big enough so you don't feel restricted. There is not much for housing offered by the school but other than that it is a great school with loads of fun people and a great community.
Sophomore,4,"Every professor seems to know what they're doing, and many of them make it easy to contact them and get class materials. They also make a lot of effort to make sure textbooks are affordable. Centralia also uses CANVAS, which makes it easier to make up missed days or check grades/assignments online. The campus is compact and pretty, and has built a new building since I've enrolled. It's easy to know where you're going most of the time. They offer a lot of interesting classes, and the advisors make it easy to plan your classes."
Niche User,4,"I went here for roughly two quarters in college, and while I was always surrounded by people who weren't mean, disruptive, or annoying, there also wasn't much of a student life; I got to school, went to my classes, and went back to my home. I would of also preferred to live on campus, but they only offer housing for international students. The food is acceptable, I only rarely ate there, and I couldn't find any details on the party scene.
I do think however, that it will eventually grow to become a much greater college, especially with its recent addition to the building. The professors are amazing (Minus one or two) and the diversity is not bad at all, in my opinion it is a perfect stepping stone for many in the local area, and perhaps a larger area given time."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Centralia College has been a great start to my post-secondary education. The instructors are all very knowledgeable on the subjects they teach. Also, the campus staff have been very helpful in making sure I fit right in, and helping me adjust to a new culture of learning."
Junior,4,"My experience at Centralia College has been great. This is the second time that I have been enrolled with this school. My first experience with the college was very overwhelming, but the staff was extremely helpful.  They offer on campus jobs, clubs and study groups for each subject. This year they finished a new building, and other new buildings are in the works to turn this 2 year college into a 4 year college. All of the teachers want to see their students succeed. This will always be a college I recommend to anyone who lives in the twin cities and wants to get a feel of college life."
Graduate Student,4,"Great college for an affordable price. Great selection of classes, and easy to find help with any needs."
Sophomore,4,"I like the friendly and personable teachers that are always ready and willing to go above and beyond to help their students understand and thrive. 
I also like the student government and how well they listen to the wants and needs of the student body as a whole, and students individually. 
I would like to see more access to parking, and more events dedicated to stress relief of the students. 
Parking will always be an issue, but with the addition of a new building, parking is even more hectic than ever. I have to arrive at eight am, to find parking for my nine am class. If I am “late” and arrive around 8:30, parking is scarce, and I sometimes have to walk three blocks to get to my classes. 
Even though CCC is a fun campus with amazing staff and faculty, students are still very stressed. I personally juggle going to class and homework, working, volunteering, and housework. A few more events, even simple ones, dedicated to stress relief or stress management would help immensely."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Centralia College was pleasant overall. The class sizes are small but the campus and programs are always expanding to become better. I would like to see more community involvement and a closer social system. There's not much school spirit but still, everyone is friendly there and the professors are great."
College Junior,4,"I gave my counselor my work schedule, and they immediately gave me a schedule that would still allow me time with my family, friends, and boyfriend. I was so pleased that that was available to me."
College Junior,4,I have yet to take an online course.
College Junior,4,I have not done enough at the college to say much about it yet.
College Junior,4,"I was super excited to begin my fall courses, and I haven't been disappointed yet! All the professors bring their own unique personalities to each class, yet still making everything applicable to the lives and characteristics of the students in their classes."
College Junior,4,"I will be graduating with my AA in English Education next year, and I feel very excited and prepared. The staff on campus is great, and the facilities have made it easy to get here. Everything involving the enrollment process was very straightforward and explained well to me."
College Junior,4,"The workload is more than I have ever experienced, but it has been a great challenge to me as I begin my college years and I am excited to see what I can do! The facilities make studying on campus easy, and I am already looking into job opportunities on campus."
College Junior,4,"I love the time I have already spent at my school! After meeting my professors, I knew I was going to grow in the knowledge I had already gained from my high school years. The advisers and counselors were extremely helpful in my decision of what I wanted to major in. They looked at my grades, and looked into my personal life after lots of discussion with me and helped me come to the best choice, and it is one I am very comfortable with."
College Freshman,4,There job resource center is small but it is very helpful. I have had help finding employment when needed.
College Freshman,4,Class size is moderate for the size of the college. The professors are strong in dumbing the information down for those who need it and keeping the more advanced kids challenged.
College Freshman,4,"The resources they have for nursing students really help them learn the material, and hold them to a high standard. A strict application process."
College Freshman,4,I really appreciate the small town atmosphere. It is easy to make friends and build a strong support system. The instructors are down to earth and very helpful.
College Senior,4,"All of my professors have been friendly and willing to help if need be. I don't feel intimidated by them, but instead I feel like they actually care about me and my opinion."
College Senior,4,"I was able to take all of my classes before noon, which worked out the best for me. Also, if the class was at a later time, there was usually an online alternative."
College Senior,4,"I went to Centralia to get my AA before heading off to a four-year school. I think that the classes are perfect for getting a two year degree. My workload was comparable to my workload in high school, so I would say that it was favorable."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I hold two jobs, a sport and school work and I was able to go to school full time without a ton of switching schedules which was nice."
Recent Alumnus,4,I found the online courses to be pretty simple to figure out and I did fine with the workload and the lack of personal interaction.
Recent Alumnus,4,The career fairs are highly informative.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are a lot of career fairs and college fairs.
Recent Alumnus,4,The teachers are great! They really understand students and try their best to make it cheaper for you by getting cheaper text books!
Recent Alumnus,4,The only hard part is finding a counselor who understands you and helps you get what you need. Really ask the important questions and don't just take one answer. Ask multiple people!
College Junior,4,"If I was going right into employment from this school, and I might, the prospects are excellent.  2 local radio stations hire right out of school and some students even get hired while still in school.  The TRIO program on campus is great for directing a student in the right way when it comes to what career they are trying to achieve after graduation."
College Freshman,4,"First off, the reason I didn't give a 5 rating is because there is always room for improvement. However, for the classes I have taken so far I have gleamed a large amount of useful information. All of which I can apply to the real world jobs that I will eventually be applying for, the professors here have even gone as far to have personal talks about colleges they suggest I go to."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My college experience has been a rewarding one this far. The instructors I have had genuinely care about their student's success and will do everything in their power to help you succeed. The advisors are very helpful in trying to show you what classes to take and when. They make sure you are not not overworked or overwhelmed and still enable you to meet your goals. 

One thing I really appreciate about my college is you can't register for classes for the next quarter until you have met with your advisor because they hold your registration pin. This reduces students accidentally taking classes they don't really need or getting off track from their educational goals."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My time so far at Centralia has been great. The professors are awesome and are always willing to help you when you need it. I love how there are always different events on campus it makes for a great time for everyone and an opportunity to meet new people. Campus jobs have also really helped me at Centralia its a way for me to make extra money to contribute to paying for my tuition, and I like how everyone is helpful in helping people pick the right campus job that is suitable for them and their schedule. Since being at Centralia I have really become a more outgoing person than I was in high school."
College Senior,4,The small class sizes made it easy to get adjusted and comfortable with the transition from high school to college.
College Senior,4,Centralia College has been a great school for me. It is close to where I live so it's convenient and the program I chose has a very good reputation in the community for graduates. I feel blessed and proud to be a student here!
College Freshman,4,Many of the professors are understanding and willing to work with their students.
College Freshman,4,"The college is a very welcoming community. Movies portray college as the place to be judged, but really those that judge are the minority. Most of us accept the diversity Centralia has accumulated."
College Freshman,4,"The college is constantly doing events to get the students involved and to have fun, like laser tag or Rated R movie night. The students are also well informed of the resources on campus they can utilize to help them in any class. For example, there is a writing center in the English department any student can go to to receive help. The campus is also very neat and well kept."
College Student,4,"The tuition for myself is very reasonable considering my financial circumstances, the Financial Aid Office faculty are friendly and patient. Tips I have would be to get your FAFSA in early, so you don't have to wait to get approved. Also, take into account all of the books and other relevant expenses before you go and use it on non-education related things."
College Student,4,"The academic curriculum at CC is decent. I feel like the curriculum is well suited to my specific program.

The program covers all the basics when it comes to English, Math and the like. It also keeps me on my toes, because some days I'm fully aware of what I'm doing, and other days, I have no idea what I'm gona do, like its a surprise.

The work load is enough to keep me busy, but not too much to the point where I feel overwhelmed. Each quarter I have increased the number of classes I have taken, and the work level seems about equal because I am constantly adjusting to the new classes. The lab is very well equipped for the work we are doing, and I always feel comfortable in my own skin, so to speak. While I have been here, there have been postings about new work opportunities, and I have looked into them, but haven't applied for any yet."
College Student,4,"If my past two responses have not sufficed to the question, I feel bad. For like a second."
College Student,4,"So far while I have attended Centralia College, the program I am enrolled in has been very interesting. the facilities are fantastic and provide everything I need to complete all of my class work. The faculty are friendly and treat me as an equal, instead of just another student. I always get one on one time with my Instructors if I ask for it. My welding instructor is very good about helping me with things I struggle with. He drops what ever he's doing and tries to assist as best he can, which tells me he is very dedicated to his job. I haven't had any problems so far, and I am enjoying my time as a college student. I actually enjoy all of my classes. In my past experience with education, I often times hated going to school because I felt like I was always falling behind, failing or was in a hostile environment. Now that I have grown into my workplace, I feel that everyone is there for the same reason as myself, to further our education and learn something new almost, if not every day."
College Senior,4,"They have a lot of student jobs, the career center people really try to help you find the best job or degree for you.  The web cite for the college is very easy to use and has the dates for events, schedules, class sign ups, and more!"
College Senior,4,"Most of the classes are very reasonably priced, the teachers are amazing and try their hardest to help you succeed!  Not only do your teachers set up appointments with you but there is a free tutoring center for math and science and a free writing center to help you with english and essays!"
College Student,2,"There aren't very many options for my major, which is psychology."
College Junior,2,"Professors tend to be knowledgeable in general, not all but most. Registration is a bit unfair because running start students get to register before students who are not in running start. This school is just a stepping stone for most people because they usually just transfer to a 4 year school. I haven't had any experience transferring credits, but I understand that they make as many of their credits as possible easily transferable so you can take prerequisites for your degree here at a cheaper price before you transfer."
College Junior,2,"The only real unique thing about this campus is the clock tower. Aside from that, it looks like most other college campuses on this side of the state: green lawn and some trees. It's pretty boring. The cafeteria has good food, but it can get pretty loud and it's a bit small. Everyone pretty much sticks to their own group, it's somewhat difficult to make friends if you don't know anyone before you come."
College Senior,2,Ive applied there so many times but they do not help students very much. they are picky. so therefore i work out of the campus.
College Sophomore,2,The classes are flexible but seems kinda spendy for two classes
Recent Alumnus,1,"Strictly speaking of financial aid only, it is the worst it took me 9 times to get my financial aid and by then I was entering the last four weeks of my quarter. It was absolutely ridiculous."
College Senior,1,"I really enjoy Centralia College. The environment is nice and so are the people, but the academic flexibility is horrible. If you have a job, make sure it's flexible. Many classes are only offered at one or two times during the semester and only once a year! You can try and talk to your teacher, but most want you to be present during class, which is expected."

Freshman,5,"I really liked the university of Indianapolis when i visited, it had a great environment, and had a great set up for students."
Junior,5,"I like the smaller classes in this school. I also enjoy that the campus is small enjoy to walk to all of my classes comfortably. However, you still have the feel of a much lager school with all the perks of your teacher giving you more attention."
Junior,5,My experience in this school has been great. The staff is helpful and all of my needs have always been met. I am always directed to the right place when I need to take care of any additional paperwork for accounting or financial aid. The local area is familiar to me therefore I have no issues there.
Sophomore,5,I liked the professors and students I’ve met so far. Everyone is super nice and friendly. College is nothing like high school and everyone is willing to talk to everyone.
Junior,5,Online experience has been great overall. With the pandemic it has been a joy to be in the comforts of my own how to study and do my class work.
Sophomore,5,I took some partial online class and it was great. I will be taking online classes for next semester and I am looking forward to it. The professors are doing well making sure to give extra attention and trying put new ways to make sure our online experience is worthwhile.
Freshman,5,"I think U of Indy is a good school.The staffs are nice and counselors are nice and helpful as well.I think I will have a great experience at U of Indy.Even though i'm not in college yet,I have been talking to staffs and my counselor i'll be having,and they are really nice.So yeah,UIndy will be a great school experience for me."
Freshman,5,Even though the coronavirus has cut my first year short; I have loved every second of my time there thus far.
Senior,5,The small class size is so conducive to my learning style and allows true one-on-one interactions with the professors. The professors are so dedicated and truly care about your education. I have made so many great relationships with other students and my professors!
Freshman,5,I love how welcoming it was the first week of classes and overall the whole year. I was terrified to come to college but it really is something different than High School. University of Indianapolis is a great community to study anything and I would not have wanted to choose any where else!
Freshman,5,"I like that the professors are engaging and open to helping students learn. The closeness to which the university is to internships and the on-campus jobs prove extremely helpful. The cost for attending is quite high, but I believe the investment is more than worth it."
Freshman,5,It is a very welcoming environment that is knowledgable and caring about all learning.  The whole campus allows me to not only be myself but to grow as a person. I am a nursing major and the program is so amazing. I knew from the start that this was the right place for me.
Freshman,5,What I like about the college is that it’s not that big and you can connect with a lot of people on campus because everyone is nearby.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the atmosphere of community and engagement. The professors really show that they want to get to know you and help further you towards your future. I am on a first name basis with many professors and have their phone numbers/ emails if I ever need them outside of office hours. I have had no problem finding friends and my own little home of people on campus. Everyone is loving and amazing.
Niche User,5,I have only been on visits but the campus is large. I am a fan of the large appeal with the small size. The athletic programs are very fun to watch and are very high energy.
Freshman,5,"The campus is overall great. The professors that I have had all care about you and your success at the school. The campus is pretty and small, which for me personally is a plus. It's easy to get to class from all parts of campus. The new apartments are awesome, but the freshman buildings are kind of iffy. There's a sushi place in the new Health Pavilion that you can use your swipes for, and everyone is friendly. I have had a great experience at Uindy so far!"
Niche User,5,I loved how small the campus is. The buildings are nice and clean. All the health science classes are in one building and that is very convenient. All the admissions staff that I talked to were extremely helpful and friendly. They made sure I had my questions answered.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at this campus has been amazing, it's a nice and clean campus to live in and they have different events you can go to just to get out and have a nice time, it's been a real thrill to get the opportunity to live in a residence hall and get the experience of living on your own."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus from the moment I stepped on it. I instantly connected with everyone and I just felt as if it was a home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience at the University of Indianapolis so far! The school gives off a very homey feel, and they make it to where you feel very welcomed and comfortable during your time on campus during each semester. I would absolutely recommend attending this college to anyone who asks about it."
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming staff and students. The campus is beautiful, and I thoroughly enjoyed my first semester at the University of Indianapolis. Most of my professors were helpful. I was nervous at first, but I am so thankful for my time spent so far, and I am excited to continue furthering my education at the University of Indianapolis."
Freshman,5,"University of Indianapolis is a private school, so that means yes it is pretty small. There are about 4,000 enrolled every year. If you seek some where close and tight knitted then this is the place for you. It is so easy to get into contact with professors and see what else you can possibly do."
Sophomore,5,i walked on campus as one of the most shy incoming freshman after about a hour in orientation i was screaming and shouting with the rest of my class !. this campus has a way of connecting all kinds of cultures and diversity within itself and classrooms i am glad to be called a greyhound .
Sophomore,5,Uindy is a great private school. The classes are small so you are able to get one on one time with your professors and the campus life is always lively.
Sophomore,5,"I loved living on campus my first year of college because I really got to have a lot of opportunities to put myself out there and really get to know others. What I would say I would change is the price because it is a little expensive, but other than that not that much."
Alum,5,"The University of Indianapolis is a great place to attend college. The biggest positive aspect of this school is the quality of professors. I have never had a problem with a professor, and I have learned so much from each professor. The majority of the professors are very patient with the students. Many are also very enthusiastic about what they are teaching. There are also many great resources on campus such as the professional edge center. There is also a decent range of majors to choose from and also a nice selection of classes within those majors. One negative aspect, however, is the lack of parking spaces available for commuters. Other than that, this is a great school."
Sophomore,5,Uindy is a small campus meaning smaller classes that gets you to know more about your professors and classmates.
Freshman,5,"I love this campus everybody is so nice and helpful. It is very well kept and the staff is always willing to help with whatever you need. Also, they have a very high acceptance rate. I wish that we were about to have greek life on campus I think it would really draw more people to uindy."
Freshman,5,"So far, the University of Indianapolis has helped me academically and has helped me be who I want to be. Everyone is so accepting and kind on campus."
Junior,5,"This will be my first semester at University of Indianapolis. I've just completed my associate's degree as a registered nurse. When looking at RN to BSN programs, I had many local options. University of Indianapolis stood out with their supportive and professional staff. When I had questions, each Uindy staff person I spoke with promptly replied to me, answering all of my questions. I truly felt like they valued me and my experience enrolling in their campus. I've been very satisfied so far in my decision to choose University of Indianapolis as the college I will be receiving my bachelor's degree."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the school and I the setting of the school. I talk the school and I enjoy want they said how they can help with my education and etc.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the fact that it is a small school. The small population at the school makes it feel more home like and you make many new friends this way. The only thing I would change is the lack of parking that there is on campus.
Freshman,5,"The cheesy way that the school advertises the ""close-knit"" community is annoyingly true. I have become so close with so many people it is a little hard to believe. The professors do everything they possibly can to help you learn and achieve in their class. They do have set office hours, but I have not had a professor that is not willing to schedule more time to meet with you."
Niche User,5,I am not attending yet but have been accepted and began enrollment process.  I took a college tour and met with advisors and was very impressed with the knowledge the advisors were able to provide.  I was impressed with the layout and size of the campus.  It is approximately an 86 acre campus which will allow ample time to get from class to class without being rushed and the available resources on campus are impressive.
Niche User,5,"The people are so nice and welcoming, the school is so small and pretty all over.  The dorms are pretty nice and I enjoyed the tour I had."
Niche User,5,The people are very nice and kind. The admission counselors are able to answer any questions you have. They have a very nice campus and dorm rooms.
Graduate Student,5,Currently in the online Doctorate degree program. Program is well organized and geared toward adult learners.
Sophomore,5,This university has been challenging me to complete my degree by holding me accountable for my future in a way that has me engaged with both my school work and professors. The program I’m in is layed out in away in which I can see my progress and await my anticipated graduation date
Graduate Student,5,"I'm a distance student, pursuing my Masters of Gerontology.  I love my professors and the staff!  They've gone out of their way to help me succeed there and I feel like part of the campus from 300 miles away.  Their system of education for the distance students is easy to work within and fun.  It's a great place to go to school long-distance and earn a degree."
Sophomore,5,I am a second year student at UIndy. It is by far a great school where you will get a top education. Everyone is friendly and professors are always will to help you out. Campus is small and beautiful.
Graduate Student,5,"University of Indianapolis is great at looking at the needs of students and trying to meet those needs. The professors are super helpful, and extremely nice, and you can tell that they care about the student as a whole instead of just about what they are teaching to the students. Lots of great opportunities here!"
Sophomore,5,This school has a very encouraging and empowering environment to help any young adult to achieve their full potential. It has many cultures and diverse religions because anyone is welcome on this campus.
Junior,5,"Love the campus, the activities, the clubs, the professors, and the opportunities. This was my first choice school, and after attending, I would never go anywhere else."
Alum,5,Nearly four years post-graduation and I am appreciating my degree more than ever. Excelling in my career and to this day I am still communicating with my professors that truly want the best for me and my future.
Niche User,5,"I am still currently a senior in high school, but I would like to go to University of Indianapolis in the near future after high school. My father had went to this school and I also went on a college visit at this school. I really was intrigued with what UIndy has to offer and I especially was interested in their BUILD program for kids on the spectrum. Having this program really convinced me that this school is really good about including everyone and accepting of diversity."
Sophomore,5,I knew the University Of Indianapolis was the place I wanted to spend four years or more when I was in middle school. The two years I have been here already have been great and I wouldn't change it for anything. The people are so amazing. The staff and professors are great and help you with all of your needs. I couldn't be happier with the choice I made to attend the University Of Indianapolis!
Junior,5,I love the professors!  I love how close the school is to everything! The only negative is the cost of attendance is high.
Sophomore,5,I love the teachers. My favorite place to hang out is at the library near the Perks. I always feel at home.
Niche User,5,"I meet with my academic adviser and registered for my classes.  The campus is very nice, the staff are great, the learning experiences are fantastic! I love having a smaller class size and more 1:1 with the instructor/students."
Sophomore,5,It is very easy to get involved on campus considering how small it is. The people are friendly and always willing to help with whatever you need.
Sophomore,5,I love the University of Indianapolis. They offer some very unique classes and the professors are absolutely amazing. I have really enjoyed my time here and look forward to the next 3 years here!
Sophomore,5,"This school is overall amazing. I love how small the campus is,  making it easy to go from class to class with in 10 minutes. I also love the smaller class sizes. The teacher actually get to know their students and are all very helpful."
Sophomore,5,My experience at the University of Indianapolis has exceeded my expectations of the college experience. Uindy provides a small school feel with a large school network. Uindy provides great opportunities to become integrated in top tier companies right out of college. One thing I would like to see change are the food options at the school though.
Junior,5,"Overall I love this school, other than its terrible parking this school is great and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The professors are hit or miss which is a bit sad but when you get a good professor it is truly amazing what you can gain. They give everyone the opportunity to be a part of something, make you feel part of the community which is great."
Freshman,5,"The University of Indianapolis is a great school filled with tons of great people and opportunities. It's a smaller university but perfect for those who like being involved. The university gives a more family oriented based environment allowing you to in a sense meet/see everyone. Its very easy to reach your professors and their very good at getting back as quick as possible. The professors show care for students and the classes are small enough where if you need help during class your able to get that 1 on 1 with you professor. The athletic programs are top notch as can get for a D2 school with a great support from student body and faulty. Coaches show real interest in their athletes life and will stick their necks out for their players to help them succeed. Being a student athlete I visited a few schools who interested me out of the 12 I went to, UIndy was the only one who talked about plans of earning a degree. I would recommend this University to anyone."
Junior,5,"The staff is the best when it comes to communication. For example, my advisor is a Chemistry major which was done by accident. However, she is fantastic and I may be changing my major just to stay with her!"
Niche User,5,"University of Indianapolis is a University that I truly believe is a one-on-one academic college.  This colleges class sizes are small which makes one-on-one learning very accessible. The campus is very easy to navigate around which makes finding classes, dorm halls, and other buildings easier compared to bigger colleges. University of Indianapolis host many events for students to go to and even incoming students. The college camp-in was one of these exciting events incoming students and even students who are exploring their options are allowed to participate in for free. I personally went to this event. The students, staff, and faculty were all very greeting and willing to help others as we did fun activities and ate."
Junior,5,"I am absolutely in love with my school. While it has been difficult trying to navigate college on my own, the University has definitely tried to help in every way they possibly can."
Niche User,5,I can honestly say that the University of Indianapolis is an amazing school. I enjoyed the campus because it wasn't too large. That makes it easier to get from place to place on time. I also loved the food because it all tasted homemade. Plus there was a different variety of food so you weren't stuck with the same stuff every time. I also liked the professor to student ratio and class sizes. Since I want to be an animation major there might be 15 in the classroom maximum. And lastly I like where it's located becuase it's not too far from downtown and it's not too far from the mall. So I can go and meet up with my friends whenever I'm able too.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed the campus life and how everything seemed like it had a relaxing vibe to it. the food was great and the people are very nice. I love the small classes sizes. It makes the learning environment more manageable with less people. Our school also provides excellent access to our professors. It is easy to contact them with questions and help most of the time.
Sophomore,4,"I love the classes, but the student life is lacking. I like having small classes and the ability to connect with my professors. But, the campus is very dead on the weekends."
Sophomore,4,"University of Indianapolis is a great school. The small class sizes are great because you get to know your professors and they know you, which you wouldn't get at a bigger university. The campus is nice. There are always events going on and lots of clubs for students to be involved in."
Sophomore,4,Online classes were not too bad. Professors are always willing to help if you need it. They have meeting you can attend if you need the extra help. They stress there to help you so don’t be screws to ask for help if you need it.
Sophomore,4,"Great school, very nice professors, and a good overall smaller school to attend. As a commuter student, I still feel very involved on campus and connected with other students."
Sophomore,4,Classes online were more independent. Rarely did I have to attend a Zoom lecture but professors provided good help sessions if people needed it and worked very well with student's schedules.
Junior,4,I thoroughly enjoy attending UIndy! It’s convenient location help tremendously! The class sizes are nice and small which helps me a great deal! The one thing that I would change is for it to be more affordable and for them to offer more grants and scholarships to current students and not just incoming freshmen especially when they have proven yourself grade worthy and a great student!
Niche User,4,"I like that it is about a 30 minute drive from my home but I really hate parking. It’s a private school, so it’s going to be more expensive but they should work on their parking area for those who commute."
Sophomore,4,I love the small size and how you get to know your professors and how they know their students. The small size made it possible for one to get quality attention to succeed.
Sophomore,4,UIndy is a great school! It’s full of diversity with a general mindset of the students and how to best serve them. One thing I would change is updated dorms and better/more food options.
Sophomore,4,"Every professor I have had, excels at their job. Whether it was using office hours to help student more or doing whatever they could in class until the students understood."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman currently at UINDY, and so far my experiences have been pretty good. The food on is not much to be desired, but it is edible. The freshman dorms are pretty tight especially if you have three to one room, but it is also doable. The professors I have had so far have been very accommodating and knowledgeable, other than one specific chemistry teacher. Overall though it is a very nice school and I love going here, especially with all the friends and teammates I have been able to meet."
Junior,4,"I like this university a lot, and everyone is always willing to help out. This university also has the BUILD program is very helpful as well."
Senior,4,"University of Indianapolis is a great place for people who feel like they do not want to be thrown to the wolves when it comes to college. Uindy's small class sizes makes knowing your professors easy, and holds a student accountable."
Freshman,4,I absolutely love the professors and classes offered. Since the classes are smaller you get a chance to really learn and dig deeper.
Sophomore,4,The University of Indianapolis is a great school. It's a decent size and the professors know you by name. The athletics are good and it's a really fun place to be.
Senior,4,"University of Indianapolis is great opportunity to expand a students capacity for learning. I enjoy the size of the university, the staff, and professors, and the student engagement. The closeness of the university allows me to establish a great relationship with peers, faculty staff, professors, etc.  I would like to see more diversity as well as new places and improvements for financial aid."
Sophomore,4,"I've had a good experience so far, everything has been going great this semester. I like that they have a great pre-medicine program."
Freshman,4,"University of Indianapolis provides the perfect small-campus experience for those who don't want to go to a huge campus. Everything is nearby and easy to access, and the campus just feels like home. The professors truly care about your success, and you will graduate with a very respectable degree."
Junior,4,"What I enjoy about this institute in most of the faculty that I've come across. Whether it is in a class, one of the buildings on campus, or my apartment staff, everyone is mostly helpful and shows their interest in wanting you to succeed. The only thing I honestly want to see change is their parking, which they are working on every year."
Freshman,4,I think it’s a beautiful campus. The people here are nice. Lots of different resources on campus. Pretty good living areas.
Graduate Student,4,"This school has great graduate programs! The staff/faculty are very welcoming. The students are also extremely friendly and helpful, especially to newcomers."
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity at UIndy.  We have over 40 states and 80 countries represented in our student body.  The professors know you by name and want you to get the best education possible.  Service learning is also a big highlight at UIndy.  Our motto ""education for service"" is embodied day in and day out by the university."
Sophomore,4,"The student to staff ratio is fantastic. You feel like a person at the institution instead of a number at a big state university. Everything about this school is great, but the food could be better."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a transfer student and this is my first semester here. I previously attended Ball State and Ivy Tech. So far I really enjoy this school. When it comes to colleges in Indiana this particular school gets overlooked. I personally didn't even know anything about the school until this year, I really like their communication program. This school is very hands on and engaging when it comes to learning, the professor seem to care about their students. The students for the most part are pretty awesome as well. There's TONS of opportunities available to you if you if you're willing to work for them."
Freshman,4,I really like the staff and the patience every professor seemingly has. The only thing I would personally change is the staff providing more information about the things that most freshmen would not know already.
Sophomore,4,"By going to such a small school, you are able to have wonderful connections with your professors and easily get one on one help. The tutor labs are also extremely helpful and should be taken advantage of-they have free tutoring for just about any subject. One of the only downsides to Uindy/Uindy being a small, but growing campus, is that classes fill up very quickly which makes it difficult to get into required courses."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the University of Indianapolis is a great school. It is a smaller school, which is very useful in creating relationships with your professors which I have found very useful. The canal in the middle of campus that mimics the one of downtown Indy is very pretty. As an out of state student I really enjoy the school from an academic as well as a social viewpoint!They made me feel like I was at home and I can not wait to go back!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Indianapolis is a small campus that offers a lot. The diversity is present and the engagement  level is high. Over UIndy is a great university, and I very much recommend attending."
Junior,4,"I am greatly enjoying my time at UIndy. The classes are amazing and challenge students to truly learn the material. The professors are kind and provide multiple opportunities for students to get one-on-one or extra help if they need it. The campus environment is very inclusive, safe and lively. There's always something fun going on somewhere on campus and amazing ways to meet new people through clubs or events. The only major problem students complain about every year are limited parking (but it's free, so they can't complain too much) and resident students always have too many meal swipes at the end of the semester."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy how small it is you get to build a good relationship with your classmates and professors. One thing I don’t like is the food.
Senior,4,"It's a very small school, which I think is a good thing because it's an easy transition from high school and you can really get to know your professors."
Freshman,4,I love how easy the application was. I haven't even been there as a student and I already feel welcomed and like they really care about me and want to see me succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that the campus was not too big. I liked the small class sizes, it helped me learn very well. I liked the food options."
Freshman,4,It’s a smaller university and professors are willing to work with you in anyway to make sure you succeed. The one downside would just be tuition costs since it’s on the high side.
Graduate Student,4,This is an excellent school with excellent programs and faculty. The school has many different majors and professors that genuinely care about each individual student. The professors make students feel like individuals rather than just numbers and class sizes are small. My only complaint is how many individuals are in each dorm room for their first year due to the increasing class sizes.
Freshman,4,The admissions process has been very easy and I am confident I will enjoy attending UINDY in the fall. The counselors have been very helpful and understanding.
Sophomore,4,Everyone is really nice and the teachers for the most part are very good at explaining the material well.
Freshman,4,"I like that it has small class sizes. There are not frats or anything, just dorms and on campus apartments which are nice."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the class sizes and all the professors I have had are super nice and helpful whenever needed.
Junior,4,"The smaller-sized classes make learning straightforward and easier as opposed to how they are at larger universities. Every professor I've had is 110% dedicated to seeing their students succeed & never pass up a one-on-one opportunity to help you if you're struggling. Being 10 minutes from downtown, Indianapolis makes it easy to grab a quick bite, see a last-minute concert, or just go exploring. While the university grounds are safe as can be, you should never venture off campus alone, especially at night. The friends I've made here are second-to-none and I love being able to see familiar faces around the small size university. I have had a great experience at UIndy thus far, and am overall happy with my decision to attend."
Sophomore,4,"It is far way from the ""city"" life.  It is hard to make friends with limited gatherings.  I feel safe and secure here.  I am disappointed with the cafeteria.  I am thankful for my RA."
Niche User,4,This university was a very fun place to visit so many stuff to see and learn. Everyone was very nice and very helpful.
Alum,4,A great undergraduate experience! Scholarships granted to 96% or more students. A growning campus. Several new buildings for student housing. Competitive atheletic teams!
Freshman,4,I like the University of Indianapolis because of it’s location.  You are close to Greenwood and Indianapolis.  There are plenty of places to go and things to do.  UIndy offers a variety of courses and flexibility of times for classes.  The professors have been great and very accommodating to a college athlete.
Freshman,4,I love UIndy. I love the community and all of the opportunities given. I feel like the science courses offered are very tough and require a lot of studying. At Uindy everyone is involved in something.
Alum,4,"The class sizes were small and the professors really seemed to care about student progress! As a commuter, parking was terrible and has only gotten worse each year."
Niche User,4,My experiences with the University of Indianapolis have been great with several different college tours/visits because everyone seemed to be really nice and for a small campus I've heard from graduates from that university that you can get lot's of help from the professors due to some classes being smaller than other universities.
Freshman,4,"I like the Lecture and Performances that they have at the University which provides knowledge and experience for new prospective students to learn from.  I would like to see bigger events that every one at the campus can participate in, including helping new students getting to meet people with the same likes and interests. They have free mental health counseling for students who develop loneliness and depression at the beginning of the school year as a freshman which has helped me a lot."
Freshman,4,Overall I have had a very positive experience. The only reason I gave less than 5 stars is that I have had some problems scheduling classes that I need and have had various miscommunications with different administrative departments.
Junior,4,"I would like more communication and activities of staff and students! Love that the school strives to make the best out of yourself, just want more for it."
Sophomore,4,"I really like campus life but the location where the campus is located is too empty and boring. There is nothing to do around the campus and it makes people bored. If there was a chance to change the location of campus I would do that! On the other hand, education of the school and the instructors are really great."
Sophomore,4,The University of Indianapolis is a great school. The staff cares about where you are academically and mentally. The overall energy of the campus is great.
Graduate Student,4,The University of Indianapolis has a fairly small and beautiful campus. The city of Indianapolis is beautiful!
Sophomore,4,"I like the class sizes offered at UIndy, the amount of diversity in the student population and faculty, we need more parking, and the food gets repetitive."
Sophomore,4,"I am second year student here at the University of Indianapolis. Attending this University, has opened me to a lot of new opportunities and new experiences. The classroom experience and atmosphere is the best part of UIndy as well as the diversity on campus."
Graduate Student,4,"I liked how some teachers treat students, they always help with everything, Also, they are making the school better, buliding new buildings and opening new places."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the University of Indianapolis! The campus felt very safe at all times and I knew the campus police would walk me back to my dorm when I had my late nights at the library. The classes being small where a huge bonus for me and the professors were always there to help and make sure you understood your work.
Senior,4,I love being the atmosphere of UIndy! It is large enough that you do not know everyone but it is small enough that everyone on campus feels like family. Everyone has each others backs! The only thing I would change is the food in the dining hall!
Senior,4,"The University of Indianapolis has a small school feel. The smaller classes keep you accountable in your work and attendance. The facilities are overall updated. The Health Pavilion is a great place to take classes. The faculty is overall very willing to go out of their way to help. Internships are a big focus of the school, and they have excellent resources available for students searching for the next step."
Sophomore,4,The first semester was very hard to adjust to. I like the people and the resident assistants. One thing that I would like to see more support and involvement with the administration and student organizations.
Junior,2,"Sub Par in every way. The only reason I may see for someone to attend is either the good athletics or they live around the school locally, because if you are moving a distance to attend here, trust me, the school doesn't have anything special to offer, even for someone who wants a small school. I have had far more bad professors than good, and I truly mean bad, plenty of lazy part time professors that will teach poorly, grade unfairly, and not respond to communication. I have had too many classes that fell into this cycle here, and it costs too much money to go here for a professor not to respond to a freaking email. Aside from that, do not come here looking for parties, or fun campus life, or friends, because it is very much a commuter lifestyle. Dont be fooled by how many live on campus, most go home every weekend. To talk about campus living, the housing is generally pretty good, but the freshman dorms are very poor. Lastly, the food here is as bad as everyone says."
Junior,2,"This school seems so focused on money than the students, and their well being. The finical aid department is terrible. They don't try to help students find the best way to pay for school, or explain what you bill actually means. The food on campus is not good. Most colleges has real resturants, but UIndy has food from GFS that isn't cooked good. The dorms are decent, but not worth the cost. The dorms are very old and out of date, so they should not be so expensive. The meal plans are a waste of money. The school only allows six meal swipes a day, which is a rip off if you have the 19 meal plan. You will not be able to use all your meal swipes before the semester ends. And the meal swipes do not roll over."
College Freshman,2,"After having visited other residence halls at IU, Xavier, and Purdue, this dorms (freshman/underclassmen) need some serious renovation. They get cleaned often, but cleaning doesnt make up for something being incredibly outdated. Where is all my tuition money going??"
College Freshman,2,Cery poor for the average student
College Freshman,2,"Uindy was one of my top choices for colleges, but after a semester of being here, I deeply regret making the decision to come here. The sense of belonging is very sparse/rough here, and I know that many students feel as though they do not fit in if they are not involved in sports."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, many of the dorms (excluding the upperclassmen ones) are not well maintained and not very comfortable. They have an okay amount of space, but alot of things could be done to make them better. The social life here is a dump, and many will agree"
College Freshman,2,"Overall, the academic programs are great. However, if youre searching for a ""traditional"" college experience with greek life, good parties, etc. this is not the school for you. Campus is a desert on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,I chose to purchase a home because the rental options were not desirable to me. I likely would have felt differently if I were a little younger and had no pets. I felt that the rental properties treated me poorly.
College Junior,2,"We had to resend things and continue to add things that they didn't ask for on the application, which caused me to receive less money because by the time it was finally processed, so many others had already gotten theirs in."
College Junior,2,"There  really isn't anything besides McDonalds, Taco Bell, and Subway. Need I say more?"
College Freshman,2,"This is a great school, but by no means a party college. Most student's simply head off campus for that type of scene, which works great for those who don't."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't any to speak of outside of IndyGo, which rarely goes anywhere college students are looking to get out to. The only time any real transportation is available is during events, and even then its mediocre."
College Freshman,2,"UIndy is in the middle of the aging part of the city, full of decaying roads and old neighborhoods. The area had amazing potential, and its perfect for a service based university who focuses on improving lives. I would live near the university if the city would supply any money to help improve the area, which they will never do."
College Sophomore,2,The health center is never open when it needs to be and it's really dark on campus at night
College Sophomore,2,Even the Resident Assistants party.They actually invite their residents to parties sometimes
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do.
College Freshman,2,There isn't anything to do here at night.
College Freshman,2,I did not qualify for financial aid.
College Freshman,2,We do not have Greek life on campus. If students want Greek life they must create their own group. 
College Sophomore,2,"Well, I go to a dry campus, so there is no drinking or drugs regardless of age. Campus police can be really hard on people that they find intoxicated. As far as life on campus,  as long as you do not drive, they do not bother you or talk to you as much."
Junior,1,"Took online classes here this semester with Coronavirus situation. I would not be surprised if UIndy was one of the worst schools in adapting to new learning styles. Absolutely no consistency on education platform across classes, and most classes use multiple platforms, making it hard to track and organize, because the class itself is unorganized. I have 5 classes and have probably 15 different study/textbook/assignment online platforms to navigate through because the University's own online system is abismal and have tried to replace it unsuccessfully several times."
Freshman,1,"This school is a waste of time and money. There is mold in the dorm room AC units, rats in the cafe and bugs in the food. Would not recommend attending."
Freshman,1,"Honestly, this school is the most boring to place in the world to go to college. When you start your freshman year, you are expecting to be meeting tons of new people and making so many new friends. You definitely aren't expecting to be bored out of your mind. There is nothing to do, and 50% of the people here go home every weekend. The ""party scene"" is non existent. My residence hall is dead all the time, nobody hangs out or does anything at all. Our lounge is in the basement where the guys live, and the girls aren't even allowed in our own lounge without a guy to ""escort"" us. It feels like preschool, where you are given rules on where in the building you're allowed to go. Also, the professors are completely unorganized- they've been hired 2 weeks before classes started and don't have good lesson plans. To conclude, if you're looking for fun in college, and even a good education, do not go here."
Freshman,1,This school isn't made for everyone. If you want to have fun this is not the place to go. There is no such thing as partying here and a majority of the people seem stuck up. Not to mention they don't have the best administration. The administration doesn't want to help as much as they say they do and communication between professor and students is awful. The professors don't seem like they truly want to help the students succeed in their class. Campus hours are awful as well; It's very confusing knowing what is open when and when things close.  25% of Freshmen don't return to this school after their first year and it is clear as crystals to me on why that is. I will definitely be transferring next year.
College Senior,1,We do not have greek life at this university currently. The president has expressed his opinion of trying to get his fraternity on campus one day though but nothing right now.
College Freshman,1,Doesn't exist so my answers dont apply
College Freshman,1,Poor.  My high school stadium is better than the one here.
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for opportunities and looking to grow, this is not the school for you.  A very small school with a limited amount of resources.  There is a lack of diversity here on campus.  When the weekends come, the campus is like a desert.  Too many students commute here and the school is so small that I see the same people everyday.  There are no new faces at all.  The activities and programming are horrible.  The clubs are not the best here.  If you are looking to go big and do bigger stuff...do not come here.  Definitely not worth the price."
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life at my university therefore, my answers are invalid."
College Freshman,1,"No fun at all, this schools party life is almost nonexistent. Nothing really goes on outside or on campus."
College Sophomore,1,There are never enough spots
College Sophomore,1,The building are so old they don't even have overhead lighting. The cleaning people never clean they just sit on their phones. Everyone just hides in their rooms. The RAs are never here and when they are they are getting ready to go out to parties
College Sophomore,1,The campus is in the middle of nowhere and the bus only takes you to certain places
College Senior,1,If you do not have a car you can get to all of your classes however the neighborhoods surrounding campus are not the safest.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life on campus and I'm glad we don't. To clicky for me and I like the fact that there are no clicks on campus.
College Junior,1,I live off campus. So driving to campus in terrible weather sucks. Thankfully all of the buildings classes are in are less than a 5 minute walk and that is the best thing about this campus.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have any greek life here, and the students are just fine about that."
College Junior,1,The majority of the campus is caucasian and affluent.  There is very little diversity in religion or background.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no traditional Greek Life. There are a few academic organizations you can be nominated into but there is no ""real"" Greek Life."
College Senior,1,"Residential parking isn't too bad, but commuter parking is dismal at best. It really encourages people to be early."

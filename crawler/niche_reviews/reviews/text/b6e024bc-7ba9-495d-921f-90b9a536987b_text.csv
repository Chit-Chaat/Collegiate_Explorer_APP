Freshman,5,The Camden Center and the Brunswick buildings are beautiful and the staff are quick to help. The assignments are rather easy once you get the hang of them.
Junior,5,I transferred Fall 2019 and I have been nothing but impressed with the staff and college as a whole. I have great professors and my team of advisors and support system seems to be strong!
Senior,5,"Very Focused on trying to get you to graduate, great staff and very affordable. Definitely recommend"
Niche User,5,Eagerness & better on tutoring because I feel college you feel alone really & like they can’t get no help
Freshman,5,"It's a small, well-structured college. Easy to get around. You will find very friendly people overall who will help you get familiar with the college and will make your transition from high school go smoothly."
Freshman,5,"The admissions staff is super helpful and encouraging,  financial aid team works with you to ensure you don't borrow more than you need, and campus is clean."
Freshman,5,"Love love love everything about this school! Definetly going to be the best 4 years of my life! The professors really care about you, the food is amazing, the student to teacher ratio is perfect, and the overall atmosphere is perfect for me!"
Freshman,5,"From the first moment I set foot on campus I felt welcomed. Students, faculty and staff are very open and honest about the day to day operations and college experiences. I knew I would be faced with a challenge but I also knew a variety of tutoring programs / professor's guidance would support me. ""Go MARINERS""!"
Freshman,5,It's a great affordable college with super friendly staff.  They answer all your questions super fast.  They have multiple times that you can go and visit the campus as an incoming freshman.   The tour was very informative and the staff they had talking with students and parents really were a joy.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the staff and the atmosphere of Coastal. Everyone is so friendly and caring of others.
Sophomore,5,"The College of Coastal Georgia is great if you want the small college experience. They care about their students, and make sure every student has the best college experience inside and outside the class room."
Freshman,5,"The College Is A Very Nice Campus, Very clean I the food is great I get along with a lot of people here they are very understanding, caring, loving. The people here will make you feel loving, I'm from FL and its different up here then down there because at first I was scared to move because im so use to being home and being to myself, so for me to move to a different state it make me feel welcome here and also clear my mind away from home. this college have a a lot of things to do playing games, pool, and other fun things to do on your free time."
Niche User,5,My 3rd campus tour and I feel in love with coastal. The campus is everything and more. I really like the classroom and how students are separated by cohorts. The free laundry and free visits to the island is great for college students.
Freshman,5,"This year was my first year in college straight out of high school. The college is a tight knit college that is very small but a good kinda small. You have more of a connection with your professor and the other students. The classes are not as crowded . They offer once in a lifetime opportunities, and make the you feel comfortable. This college may be small but feels like home and a great opportunity to be close to home for me."
Freshman,5,"At College of Coastal Georgia they have plenty of campus locations to fit your needs, including online also. They are very hands on as far as getting you enrolled and walking you thru your first time into college. The current campus I'm at has no party scene and its in a slow town. It's very affordable and really easy to get enrolled. They do offer the option at another campus close by to join frats and sororities. They only offer campus housing at the Brunswick location, which is difficult when you want it a little closer. Overall I would rate the college as a whole a 4 star out of 5 rating because only a few things would really need to be changed."
Niche User,5,The professors were always happy to answer any questions I had. The students were very friendly and helped my get around campus during my first week. The college cafeteria has delicous and diverse meals for students to choose from.
Sophomore,5,"College of Coastal Georgia is my home right now, and the staff and professors really make it seem that way. They're really caring and help a lot one-on-one so that I, and students around me, understand the material and what's going on around campus."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my education at college, and I was blessed that it was located in my home town. I believe I received the same level of achievement that I would have at a more well-known university."
Freshman,5,The College of Coastal Georgia is great for any student who isn't clear on their future yet. The staff and admissions are amazing and have helped me and my peers in so many ways. CCGA offers a variety of different courses and the professors are absolutely amazing! And did I mention that the nursing program is one of the best in the state?!
Freshman,5,College of Coastal Georgia advisers have helped me in choosing my classes and major. The online college portal offers a survey-like test that aides you in discovering what major would be most practical for you. The counselors help you understand the scores and will even help you figure out what career path you may enjoy taking.
Freshman,5,The school is pretty and up to date. The teachers are helpful and really easy to talk to. The office hours for the teachers are very helpful. There is a lot of activities on campus and a lot of involvement with the students. There is a lot of clubs for everyone to join and to find people like them.
Junior,5,"The College of Coastal Georiga has expanded tremendously. The campus is new and the professors are highly qualified! The tuition is very cheap, which is great because students can get a high-quality education with low tuition! The college is not a party school, so if you are looking for a big college to party, this isn't for you, however, if you are looking for an affordable college, with great professors, in a nice, clean, and safe place this is for you! ( the beach is only 20 minutes away)"
Junior,5,Coastal is a great place to go to college. The professors are awesome and they help in any way they possibly can.
Junior,5,"Between small class sizes and instructors/Administration that cares, CCGA is the college i always wanted in a place I'd have never thought possible, HOME ! Born and raised in Camden County, GA I always dreamed of going off to college in the big city, but staying home I got to experience the #1 Nursing program in America and the beautiful St. Simon's island. #ProudToBeAMariner"
Sophomore,5,College of Coastal Georgia is an excellent school. They truly believe in all of their teachers & staff knowing our names. The school itself is full of friendly and heartwarming people. Who are all willing to help at any given moment I love my school
Sophomore,5,This college is an excellent college to go to because of the amount of professors and students that WANT you to succeed in your life goal. They stop at nothing to ensure that you are learning and engaging in the material.
Sophomore,5,"The College of Coastal Georgia is a family orientated campus that is 15 to 20 minutes away from the beach. Since the population is small it makes it easy to contact and ask your professors questions. There are many activities provided by student life, diversity and inclusion, the student health center, and many more clubs and organizations. Your experiences at Coastal is what you make it. We learn where you vacation!"
Junior,5,"The College of Coastal Georgia has been my ""home"" since I started my college journey in the Fall of 2015. I really enjoy how welcoming the professors are. I also enjoy the smaller class size because it allows the professors to get to know students on a more personal level and give that one-on-one attention that larger universities may not offer. I also really love that the campus is so diverse because everywhere you look, there is cultural diversity, which I feel is an important aspect of a university."
Freshman,5,"All of the staff and students were very welcoming and friendly, she campus is small and so are the class rooms. The campus its self is beautiful and a very short drive to the ocean."
Freshman,5,Great college for beginners  shows them how many other colleges will be like helps many learn how to study getbaround etc.
Freshman,5,"A small friendly college with more of a personal atmosphere 
Teachers willing to assist in your success Small intimate classes"
Sophomore,5,The admissions and financial aid office staff are amazing! I have enjoyed each of my classes. The professors that I have come in contact with are invested in their jobs and care about their students. There are always activities and events going on for students to participate in.
Freshman,5,I really like going to coastal because there is a campus right next to mu house so I always have easy access to the different amenities that are offered and its an easy walk so I don't have to waste gas. I also enjoy the fact that the tuition isn't as much as other colleges and as someone who is a full time student and a part time worker it really helps in saving costs.
Freshman,5,I love CCGA and I am so glad that I chose to attend this institution.  I love that my professors are so friendly and are willing to help with anything that I have trouble with.  The campus is just the right size and the classroom environment allows me to learn more and be more attentive.  I also love that the college provides student jobs.  I am a student assistant at CCGA and the faculty and staff are so amazing to work with.  My experience at College of Coastal Georgia has been far greater than I expected.
Sophomore,5,"College of Coastal Georgia is a smaller scale college but I love it! Why? Well, because it gives a more teacher/student ratio. Everyone is so nice, and willing to help whenver you need it. The professors are great, and the tution is cheap for how good of a school it is."
Freshman,5,Good school and it is nice with Very nice staff members and very helpful when I have questions that need answers.
Freshman,5,I liked that you have small classes and more one on one with the professors. There new dorm Mariner Village had the most fire alarm go off all fall in it's first semester open to the college. I did like that every floor had a washer and dryer to uses. The food was good only on certain days. Thier is no Greek life yet on campus.
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time so far at CCGA. All of the buildings on campus are new and clean, and it's great if you are interested in a small school. I personally wanted a small college, so this is a great fit for me! I lived in the dorms my first year, but then moved to St. Simons Island. The school is extremely affordable and there are so many scholarships available! The professors have overall been great. I would definitely recommend CCGA to anyone - I mean, who wouldn't want to go to a college 10 minutes from the beach!?"
Freshman,5,"College of Coastal Georgia is a great college. Coming from the city, where many colleges were too overcrowded or it was just hard to get to, Coastal has great, knowledgeable professors, a spacious and well kept campus, and keeps room for a larger learning capacity."
College Freshman,5,Uses blackboard and user friendly. Love it!
College Freshman,5,Professors want you to be successful!
College Freshman,5,Great value!  Everyone here has great things to say
College Freshman,5,The students can talk to the on campus job councilors that will help students complete resumes along with getting them ready for interviews for their program of study.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are smaller therefore students can benefit from the one on one interactions with the professors.
College Freshman,5,"The work load is challenging, but manageable with studying, and other efforts to learn the material."

College Freshman,5,Professors have a very great reationship with the students. They are always availale to help when students need it.
College Freshman,5,Many of the post-graduates find jobs easily within the first year of graduating which is phenomenal.
College Freshman,5,Employers are constanly recruiting on campus. We have serveral job opportunities and job fairs that many students go to.
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are perfect. They are not too big, and not too small. It gives you enough one on one with the professor and it is easier to find students in your class to study with."
Sophomore,4,"I really liked Coastal while I attended, but ultimately chose to move to a bigger school after a few years. Coastal was a great place to start, though, and I made lots of friends and learned quite a bit in my core classes."
Sophomore,4,"The courses that I took online were pretty good, but I took most of my classes in person to be honest."
Junior,4,I personally enjoyed my time at CCGA. I loved all of my classes and my teachers helped me improve academically as well as intellectually.
Junior,4,The College of Coastal Georgia is a very good institution. The classes are interactive and the instructors are stellar. The faculty and staff are accommodating and generous. The Alumni is also excellent. The cost of attendance isn’t too much either.
Freshman,4,"It's pretty good, the offerings are good, the teachers for the most part are well taught. It's mostly a 4-year transfer school."
Senior,4,Professors are good teachers and willing to work with students outside of classroom hours. The different offices need to work together and communicate better. Too many mistakes that students have to stress over and go get fixed.
Sophomore,4,I love how the college is small and it’s not to big. It’s the perfect size. All the professors here are very helpful. They have great tutors who are always their to help you as well.
Senior,4,College of Coastal Georgia is a great school. Most of the professors I have had really care about the students and want us to succeed. The Nursing school is extremely challenging but I believe that it will make me a fantastic nurse. I have learned so much being in it. Plus cost is reasonable with many scholarship opportunities.
Sophomore,4,It is a small school so when you are in classes you're not just a number. Plus you are right by the beach.
Freshman,4,Class sizes are small. Everyone is friendly. More one on one help from the professor due to smaller class sizes. Professors are very helpful as far as meeting with you about trouble in the class or anything regarding the course.
Niche User,4,"I am a dual enrollment student and i am attending this college currently so that when i go to Georgia Southern, i may have credits for classes that i have already taken in high school. My favorite part of the college is the SAC (student activity center). There are massage chairs and reading/ sleeping pods. There is an abundance of computers that are available all day for student use. My favorite class is Anthropology since i plan to major in that field of study."
Niche User,4,"College is nice and open with small classes and classrooms to help students learn better. Easy to find, and right in the middle of town with access to the beach near by and multiple food locations."
Junior,4,This is my second year attending this college & I absolutely love it. The teachers are helpful and nice. I can’t forget about my wonderful advisor!
Freshman,4,"For the most part I love CCGa! I am in my second semester here as a freshman coming from Orlando Florida, the scene is much different but I enjoy it here as well as the people. I also work with Recreation and Wellness at Coastal which is with sports/intramurals, the gym/workout room and game room and love it!"
Freshman,4,"This college is pretty small, but if you are interested in really learning and getting a little more one on one time with professors, this is the school for you!!! Every teacher is willing to help students, and the school even offers several different tutoring programs! The campus is small but cozy, people are great! Only complaint, not too many courses offered."
Freshman,4,I like College of Coastal Georgia due to the location. I love the beach and the atmosphere of the campus. The dorms are very nice and well put together. I love the fact of small classroom to allow the teachers to have more one on one conversations with the students. I too love my job that I have at the school. I work in the career services and academic advising building were i direct students to their right councilors and work with the students to direct them to their career of choice.
Sophomore,4,"Over the past two years at Coastal it has been a great experience overall dealing with the classes, environment, activities, & the teachers. I would say the best thing about Coastal is staying on campus. They are very lenient when it comes to us students and gives us a grand amount of responsibility! There's not one thing I would change about this schoool because everything seems perfect here. Thank you Coastal !!"
Junior,4,The class sizes are just right and every professor I’ve had has been amazing! Everyone is super helpful and the campus is beautiful. Coastal is also very affordable if you are paying out-of-pocket.
Sophomore,4,"The College overall is great. The best thing about it is the customer service. I can always know that my questions will be answered. The student Life is extremely involving. The food is great. I live in the dorms and they are very up to date and nice to live in. The Campus is beautiful and so is the community around it. I didn't particularly like my professors this semester, but hope for the best next semester. As I said in my opening, the college is overall a great school."
Niche User,4,"This college feels like home! if you stand in the middle of the campus, you can see all of the academic buildings, making it easy to get around for class. The students and faculty are friendly, they have good on campus job opportunities that both help pay for your school and/or pay you! The tuition is very low and you will most likely end school with not much debt if you take on an on campus job and have scholarships. The dorms are nice, not beautiful but livable! the new dorms have nicer furniture. Although it is nice to be on the beach and you get a free year pass to jekyll (never having to pay to get on the island), you will have to evacuate for hurricanes. Classes are very small so your professor can focus more on you and how you are doing in class, and I dont know about others specifically but their nursing program has a 100% passing rate. As far as athletics, they have a few sport but no football team!"
Freshman,4,"This is my freshman year, but I was very impressed with the campus and how I have been treated by everyone so far."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore at the College of Coastal Georgia and I must say that my first year was smooth. The professors were hard but they were willing to help you in any area as long as you put forth the effort.
Freshman,4,its a great school with very cheerful people who just want to help you have the  best experience you can have.
Freshman,4,"I like how small the college is and how your professors teach at pace you can keep up with. The environment is nice and the people here are friendly and welcoming. The dorms are nice, but some dorms you have to share a room with another person. Overall the campus is safe and good size college for anyone who is looking for something small."
Niche User,4,Beautiful campus located in the Golden Isles where the back yard can become your classroom. The dorms are very reasonable and clean.
Freshman,4,"CCGA is a very nice campus with great people to hang out with and helpful professors. There are many fun activities to do there, and it is always nice to be on campus. It is kept clean and offers great service in tutoring and food."
College Freshman,4,No problems and flexibility was great!
College Freshman,4,Graduates of Coastal have great things to report
College Freshman,4,Early childhood education is a great here!
College Freshman,4,"Although I just started last month, it is wonderful"
College Freshman,4,The College of Coastal Georgia is very convenient because it is nearby and the professor's office hours are incredibly open for tutoring or help on assignments.
College Freshman,4,"Online classes with the College of Coastal Georgia are difficult, but also helps students problem solve and manage their time."
College Freshman,4,The college offers on campus jobs that will help students get experience and money while working around their school schedule.
College Freshman,4,So far I have not had any difficulties scheduling classes around my personal schedule.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors actually care about you getting your degree, and will do their best to help you pass their class, as long as you show up and make an effort."
College Freshman,4,"Every month there is a day where the college has a ""job fair."" Employers are brought from all over the county, and from the campus itself."
College Freshman,4,"What I like about this school is the options. If you want a quite place to study, you can find one. If you want to find a group to play cards with, you can find it. If you want to change up your exercise habits, they have several places where anyone can get started."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes aren't too large or too small. Even for lecture classes that are intended to seat a large capacity of students. Most professors make class very easy for you or give you the resources to make the class easy. I recommend joining the Honors Club/Society, so you can be around like-minded individuals who can further your education by being great help with studying or support."
College Freshman,4,"The workload is a lot, but its great."
College Freshman,4,"Haven't had experience yet, but will soon."
College Freshman,4,The major program at my school is great
College Freshman,4,The teachers do there best to help us
College Junior,4,the college has been good for me. i have never had to transfer credits.
College Junior,4,"as stated previously, i believe it would be helpful if future employers visited the school more often. the service learning department does a great job."
College Junior,4,"The service learning department at CCGA really strives to provide opportunities for student to share their voice in the community. I believe there could be more possible employers to give presentations on campus, to help students along or decide on their majors/future."
College Junior,4,The nursing program is one of the best around. The faculty is very dedicated to nursing and it shows in their work. I wouldn't change programs given the chance. They have an excellent board pass rate & a great graduation rate.
College Junior,4,"This school has grown so much just in the 5 years I've been a student. It is appealing because it isn't AS expensive as some other colleges. It has an excellent RN program (my major). If I were to do it again, I would possibly go off to a bit larger school for my core classes, but would return for the nursing program."
College Student,4,Having professors who have many years of experience in the career you want to go into and being able to hear first-hand how it is and the advice they give--it's all invaluable. Also being so close to FLETC is a huge perk.
College Student,4,"So far, many of the professors genuinely care and show a strong interest in every student's success. The staff here is always helpful and ready to assist and near round-the-clock tutoring is a big plus in my books."
College Sophomore,4,Nursing seems secretive. If you aren't in the program they don't give out much information about scheduling.
College Sophomore,4,Options to take classes with your school or other schools.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small. I love small classes.
College Sophomore,4,100% NClex passing rate for all nursing students.
College Sophomore,4,So far everyone really cares about my success.
College Sophomore,4,The administration is very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,very convenient and very well placed. enjoying every aspect of the school
College Sophomore,4,It is a challenging type of class but i alway learn new things that i will use in the future
College Sophomore,4,everyone knows what they want and are constantly working to help each other
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are excellent and the professors are very well prepared, thorough and dedicated"
College Sophomore,4,Excellent professors and very easy study habits are developed
Sophomore,2,"Very poor school, WiFi is nonexistent, dorms small, and people are not as friendly as you think. Safety needs to be updated for an open campus."
Freshman,2,"While the College of Coastal Georgia does have a nice location and has a smaller class sizes, the college itself is not that great in my opinion. CCGA does not provide many social events and does not provide many clubs or activities for students. The financial Aid office can be difficult to deal with as you will get several different answers to your questions. I would recommend this school to someone who is looking for a good place to start and then transfer to another college."
College Sophomore,2,It was very hard for me to know how the online classes work. We did not meet with or teacher at all to do a course overview and how to operate the online site.
College Sophomore,2,did not receive the help or information needed to continue each term. I had to figure it out.
College Junior,2,"Academic-wise it's ok, its what your sent off for but honestly this school is just boring. Prepare yourself to eat food no one enjoys and spend your off time doing dumb things for entertainment. No Greek Life, and almost all activities are organized by nerdy people. Sports-wise, basketball teams are decent while volleyball is wonderful. DONT BE FOOLED BY THE BEACH TALK, that's how they get alot of people to come as well as how cheap it is to attend. Graduation Rate is low. CCGA is honestly a school to go to if you have no other choice and/or want to transfer later in life, a free ride (scholarship), or if you just a boring person"
College Freshman,2,"You're required to have a meal plan, even if you are a commuter student, which hikes up your fees."
College Freshman,2,"I only attend this school because I live in town and it's cheap. This was never, nor will it ever be my first choice for a school. I don't like the limited number of activities offered and there's not really anything to get involved in."
College Freshman,2,The orientation was very unorganized. Everyone had different information and there was lots of confusion. My advisor met with me but wasn't very personable to help me decide on a major or classes. As soon as I mentioned an idea she took that as my life plan and signed me up for everything. I didn't feel comfortable talking with her because she didn't really seem to care. She wanted me to pick a major and move on with her schedule.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Academically, I learned a lot while attending the College of Coastal Georgia. As a non-traditional student, I did not participate in extra curricular activities as often as I would have liked. 

   My professors were knowledgeable and passionate about the subjects they were teaching. I have a great relationship with most of them. The administration was terrible. I got a different answer to my questions each time I spoke with someone different. My advisor was not helpful. She did not respond to emails or phone calls. Quite often, I was confused about school policies."
College Junior,2,Can't really give a proper review about the alumni network due to the fact I'm not an alumni yet. The job/internship opportunities are rare and few and usually are more oriented towards Business majors. Poor advertisement for the career center/services but makes up for the flaw by having a large amount of services available to the students once they finally seek the help from the career center/services.
College Junior,2,I took the computer concepts class online and it was very challenging. There were times I did the work and went to submit it and it did not go through. However it was convenient not having to show up for the class.
College Senior,2,"I'm currently in the BSN nursing program and it is not good. The program is so unorganized. One positive thing is that we have excellent classrooms and our ""lab"" rooms are also good. We have access to SIM people for practice, but we don't use them much. Our clinical sites and opportunities are average in comparison to other schools. I do like the fact that our instructors come from a lot of different nursing backgrounds, and they are nice people and are trying their best to make the program good."
College Senior,2,"I guess my rating is reflecting on the School of Nursing rather than the actual college. As a student in the nursing program I rarely have any contact with college affiliated things, other than the nursing school. The program is totally unorganized and it has been disappointing. But, I do hear good things about the college from students that are not in the program."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is not helpful. Most people working there, don't know what they are talking about. If you need something done, go to the top."
College Sophomore,2,"I took two online courses last semester and I refuse to take any more for the rest of my college career. The professors wouldn't respond to emails and were unclear of what they wanted for assignments. They left me to interpret their mess and if I interpreted it wrong, I would be penalized."
College Junior,2,The computer network would go out more often than it should.
College Sophomore,2,"Im an education major, and some of my classes are difficult and some are okay. For my first year of college I decided to take the more difficult classes first so that I wouldn't have to take them my second year. These particular classes has a heavy work load and requires a lot of studying. But overall the classes are wonderful"
College Junior,2,Network Has Issues – I am very disappointed with their network. It is contastly offline and sometimes you have to wait hours to get back online.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Is Dull – Since the college is very new to campus life, it has been hard to get students to stay on the weekends. Most go home or to visit friends at other schools, leaving only about 100 students on campus making it impossible to hold events or programs on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had many problems with the financial aid assistance at the college. It has been really quick and smooth to trying to just figure things out. When the office is busy, they seem to take not enough time to thoroughly be with everyone but try to just ""get through"" the process."
Freshman,1,"College of Coastal Georgia was not the school for me. At first it seemed nice, but as months went passed its not the best. Kinda hard to make friends, especially since everyone knows each other or very closed off. Basically another high school. Location is not the best, right across from the high school, random older people (30-50s)will walk on and campus police do nothing about it. The only cool thing is the beach but that gets repetitive. There nothing to do, if you want that freshman experience. Food is not good the dining hall has limited options,Staff is rude. the only good thing i can say about this school is tuition as its not super expensive and housing is cheaper compared to other schools."
College Freshman,1,There are only a few majors and mine is not one of them
College Junior,1,"I have been getting the ""run-around"" for over 6 months, classes start on Monday, and they still have not entered my information so that I can get my books."
College Sophomore,1,"Online courses are hard and time consuming. I believe that I spent more time trying to do work for my online class than I did trying to attend class and do the homework for it. It was very hard for me, but it's not like that for everyone."
College Junior,1,"Our school is barely a 4 year college. There aren't any post-grad options available. But that is ok, we need to work on more 4 year degrees first!"

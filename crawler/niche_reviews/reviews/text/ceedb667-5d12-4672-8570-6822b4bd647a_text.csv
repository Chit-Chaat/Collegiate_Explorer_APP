Senior,5,Online learning has been great. Easy to understand instruction and available professors. I love it. A few hiccups with technology but they have chromebooks available to students and it has been going really well.
Freshman,5,I genuinely feel like they are doing the best they can with the current situation. The online resources are very organized and I constantly have people reaching out and providing help or new information.
Junior,5,"I have loved every single year at WSU! From the fun of Cougar Football Saturdays to the stress studying during dead week, I have found my home away from home and I love my fellow cougs."
Junior,5,"Honestly, my professors have done everything in their power to make the online learning format manageable. I get so much support from everyone around me, and I could not do it without my classmates and professors."
Senior,5,"I transferred here in January 2019, I came in with a large amount of credits, but I was not able to use all of them due to my prior university not being honest in regards to what WSU would accept. Despite this, I was still able to graduate in under 4 years. 
 
Anyways, WSU is what you make of it-- if you want to go to a ""good"" school, it is here; if you want to go to a ""party"" school it is here; WSU will be what you want -- however it up to you to apply yourself. Sure, almost anyone can be accepted, but it's really not about getting in here, it's about whether you're a strong enough student to stay. 

WSU gives its students wonderful resources, Pullman is beautiful, and the sense of community during and after graduation is undeniable. I have heard ""Cougs help Cougs"" all my life, and I'll tell you, I see it. 

My entire family has gone here, and not one has been unsuccessful in their professional fields. What you do with your time here, reflects in the grades you get. 

Go cougs!"
Freshman,5,WSU is a very good school. I have enjoyed working with the people and getting a good education. This school is fun and allows for great opportunities for its students.
Junior,5,"With the whole pandemic occurring, WSU transitioned to be an online university for the remainder of the year. Professors we're more than accommodating, and gave ample time for students to adjust navigating new sites and protocols. An amazing experience to ensure the safety of their students, and worthwhile."
Sophomore,5,I love the community within WSU. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I never had the best family experience but I found the best people and community within Pullman. I will be a Coug for my entire life and be proud of it. I love the major of communications that I am pursuing there as well.
Senior,5,"Love this school! The campus is beautiful, the town is so friendly, and overall college experience expectations were exceeded. Many different types of classes offered as well as extra curricular opportunities. The involvement within the school is by far the best Iâ€™ve ever seen. Always feel safe and welcomed here. There is something to do for everyone."
Junior,5,"I'm in an online program, so I don't deal much with people on campus, but it's a great value and everyone I speak to is very helpful."
Senior,5,The online experience with Washington State University has been very good. The zoom class meetings are very easy to function and it goes well with the blackboard environment.
Senior,5,The community of the school is so unique and it will give you the best college experience. The whole town comes together for football games and that makes for great memories.
Junior,5,"It was an interesting experience due to growing up in Hawaii, it was different experiencing the four seasons. WSU has a big population of students, giving many opportunities to make new friends."
Junior,5,The transition to online was different but not difficult. Washington State used Zoom but not all classes were online because the professors were able to pre-record lectures if they pleased. The professors were very understanding and did a good job with communicating and running their class online.
Freshman,5,"I was born in Pullman, WA and lived half of my life there and the the other half in Houston, TX where I attended middle and high school. I always wanted to return to attend WSU as did my older sister and my father. It is a family legacy. I have grown to know the value of the education the university provides through a great curriculum, first-rate instructors and a vibrant campus environment."
Junior,5,Online classes have been a life saver this year! The system is easily navigated and the professors and student aids are consistent and helpful!
Junior,5,"WSU is an excellent school, and I am proud to be a student there. I have received superior assistance and had excellent interactions with professors, staff members and advisors alike."
Freshman,5,"As a person who spent my freshman year at Washington State University, I would say that my favorite thing about WSU were the enviornment and the people I met. The fact that Washington State University was in the middle of no where, I was afraid to talk to people and make new friends. However, I did not have any difficulty making new friends and talking to professors. Also, the enviornment that the school and everyone made me very comfortable as well."
Sophomore,5,"I take courses online over the summer, and they go great. You actually have more one on one with your professors (if you want it) than you may have thought. With the outbreak of COVID-19, the campus switched to only online, which went as smoothly as it possibly could. Our professors did their very best to make it a transition we could all cope with."
Sophomore,5,"WSU is an amazing place to go to college. Not only are you offered amazing opportunities and majors, you also get to experience the great community of the Palouse. You meet outstanding people and get to work with advisors and professors that truly care about your success."
Alum,5,WSU was one of my best choices to date. this school brought so many memories as well as wonderful educational practices. I would do anything to have had an extra year at this school with those people.
Alum,5,I took several online courses at this school. Each of which were wonderful and very well organized. i would take more of them in a heart beat. highly recommended
Sophomore,5,"Washington State University stands out to me for their amazing school pride, interactive labs and clubs, and passionate professors. I am in my second year of classes and have yet to find a professor I don't enjoy. My advisers are easily accessible and extremely knowledgeable in helping me choose the best classes. I've been able to gain a lot of hands on experience throughout my education in my labs and clubs. The football games are a lot of fun and the school spirit in Pullman is incredible. Go Cougs!"
Sophomore,5,"I really liked the atmosphere of WSU, it was very friendly and inviting. The education is some of the best you can ever get and truly felt that the instructors were passionate about teaching. I met some of the best people over there and when I first got on campus I knew that I belonged there. If I had to change one thing, it would be about grades. I would like to receive my grades earlier."
Sophomore,5,"I had to take classes online due to Covid-19 and honestly I liked it a lot more because I got to do my assignments on my own time and not feel so rushed. Sometimes I dislike going to class because everything we learned in there, we could've learned outside of class since everything was on a powerpoint. My favorite thing about online learning was having my assignments given at the start of the week just so I know what to expect."
Sophomore,5,"The environment of the school is very welcoming. As you walk down the ""mall"" to any of your classes you see so many of your friends and everyone seems to have a friendly face. When I went to visit as a senior in high school my tour group was greeted with what felt like thousands of ""GO COUGS"". MY professors have been very understanding. I have faced a lot of tragedy and struggle since beginning school but my teachers never punished me for turning in late assignments because they were aware of what was going on in my life. I love my university and I love my coug family."
Sophomore,5,With covid-19 cutting in person classes short all of my spring classes went to online instructing. It was very difficult at first but as I asked more question and trusted my professors things got a lot easier. My grades were the best they ever had been this semester with the help of the Professors.
Freshman,5,"My online experience with WSU was challenging at first, but as long as you have the motivation and a routine to help you with managing school and home life, it became easier to do."
Freshman,5,"Overall I had a positive first year experience. I loved being involved with the community and extracurricular activities the most, it gave me an opportunity to meet new people."
Junior,5,"Washington State if a fantastic university. The greek life, sports, academics, are all exceptional for a state school. Living in a college town also brings you very close to people in the community."
Sophomore,5,WSU has so much options and opportunities provided for it's students. Students and staff are also friendly. Great campus and there are lots that you could do around campus. It's academics are top-notched and state-of-the-art. No regrets coming to WSU.
Senior,5,Amazing University. I felt welcome from the first moment I was accepted. I was very involved in my community college and was sad to leave that campus. What I've told people when they've asked about my transition is. I entered orientation a penguin (community college mascot) and left a WSU cougar without any questions asked. That's how inspiring they are.
Senior,5,I am a global student currently and the online experience is great. Set up for success in each class I've taken.
Sophomore,5,"WSU has such a unique and dynamic environment. You are in such a small town, you are surrounded by 25,000 other students experiencing the same thing. WSU is very inclusive, and has so many different areas of study. Whether you want to be a mechanical engineer or a sports broadcaster there is a place for you at WSU. Not only are the academics great, but there are so many extra circulars to join as well. Overall, WSU is a place where you can be yourself and find a grouo0of people who relate to you."
Sophomore,5,"The Coug pride on campus is unlike any other college community I have seen. The phrase ""Cougs help Cougs"" is truly one of the main drivers for everyone in the community. From finding rides in and out of pullman help on different academic assignments and different aspects of life. As a multicultural student we are given mentors and these mentors truly make the difference in adjusting to college life. If I could change one thing I would like to see the city of Pullman grow."
Sophomore,5,"WSU has a unique atmosphere. You can be from anywhere in the world and Pullman will feel like home. There's nothing like going somewhere and hearing ""go Cougs"" when wearing WSU apparel. The education is amazing as well as the professors. It really is the best school out there."
Freshman,5,The community is amazing. Every time you walk down the street there is a huge smile on someones face as they wave and say hello.
Freshman,5,I really love the on-campus atmosphere and how everyone is always so friendly. Cougs help cougs and it really shows!
Senior,5,The best decision i have ever made. Hands on learning program really allowed me to get the most out of my education. The teachers truly care about you ad what you are are doing. The Coug community is like no other
Junior,5,"Before attending Washington State University, I had only visited the campus once. So, I really didn't know my way around the campus. As soon as I got to campus when fall semester started other students would reach out to help me find my way around campus. My classes have been amazing! Every professor that I've had so far are very approachable, are open to help you after class, and teach with enthusiasm."
Junior,5,WSU is a home away from home where the school pride will overwhelm you and create an unforgettable experience. I have had great luck with my professors and the relationships I have built here.
Senior,5,I love Washington State University. When you step on campus you really feel like you are at home. Everyone is super sweet. I have been there a few times and all the times I have visited it has been a great experience. I am so glad to attend wazzu this upcoming fall. GO COUGS!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,"Even during quarantine, I am loving Pullman. The majority of the people went home and won't be returning this semester because classes are online, but I am here! I genuinely love (almost) all of the people here, it has a wide range of different humans from all over the world. I have met some of my best friends here through my sorority, two of which I live with currently! As a FOURTH GENERATION COUG, I can confidently say that Washington State University can absolutely change lives for the better."
Niche User,5,"WSU is a beautiful school, built around being a Coug. Students, staff, and alum all have a great passion for the school and the community it harbors. From academics to sports to extracurriculars WSU is a school that has a place for everyone."
Niche User,5,"My experience at WSU so far has been great! Everyone on the campus is very welcoming and super helpful. They offer a huge variety of majors and courses, so there's something for everyone."
Freshman,5,"I appreciate the amount of on campus resources. Living in a more rural town makes this as well as the active campus especially appealing. There are an endless number of clubs, organizations and sport activities that are easy to get involved in. I also enjoy the wide variety of majors offered as well as the simplicity within declaring or switching majors."
Freshman,5,I can't say anything but good things from the first time I walked on campus I was welcomed with genuine smiles that put me at ease.
Alum,5,WSU is a special place. It is a learning community with excellent academics and  school spirit. Being in a college town makes for an incredible college experience.
Senior,5,Great academically supportive community. Many tutoring opportunities and student-led events.  CAHNRS department tries hard to encourage networking and discovering new interests especially involving animal science.
Niche User,5,"This university is full of loving people that are very respectful, wonderful staff and a beautiful school overall."
Junior,5,"I love how close the community is. It really is true that cougs help cougs! Everyone is friendly and helpful here. I love it. Itâ€™s just chilly, thatâ€™s my only problem."
Freshman,5,Washington State University is very involved with their students and provides some of the best opportunities for education including studying abroad. All the staff I have encountered have been extremely helpful and the campus is beautiful!
Sophomore,5,I honestly feel very welcomed here. The campus is beautiful and I enjoy the people I am around. The administration is helpful to the students and I have always received help when needed.
Niche User,5,I loved how safe the campus made me feel and how friendly the students and faculty are. Everyone was such a joy to be around and the football games are spectacular and greatly spirited. I am attending Washington state university fall of 2020 and canâ€™t wait to experience the atmosphere and explore new places and the campus. Next year is going to be very exciting and a new and improved change of pace to adapt to.
Niche User,5,Washington State University is an amazing school that creates and at home atmosphere where everyone can feel comfortable in their own skin.
Junior,5,"I love my experience here at Washington State University. I could not be happier. I came to WSU as an out-of-state student in hopes of gaining a different experience living in a completely different climate than what I was used to. My experience here has exceeded my hopes and dreams of how great college would be. It is in a great location, with wonderful professors and people. The education I have gained so far is of very high quality. One of the best parts about it is that there are so many different areas in which you can study that if you ever change your mind, as I did, there will still be exactly what you want to do. The professors have your best interest in mind. The campus and surrounding area is beautiful. The student life could not be any better in my opinion. The new experiences I have gained thus far have been extremely influential. WSU, and everything that came with it, has positively impacted me beyond words."
Freshman,5,"I am currently taking Guardianship Certification, this is a certificate course, and the pace and professors and encouraging and wonderful. I am very excited about learning online and meeting in class each quarter."
Freshman,5,An absolutely incredible school! The professors are on point and everyone on-campus and in this town are kind as can be.
Junior,5,"The community here is unlike anywhere else I have ever been. The students and staff are all so welcoming, and Pullman instantly feels like home. While we may be located in the middle of wheat fields, the excellent people here ensure that there is never a dull moment. The academics here are also outstanding, and, depending on the major, the percentage of students with a job immediately after college can be very good."
Alum,5,"WSU is an amazing school that creates an atmosphere where you never want to leave. Graduation day is bittersweet because you're so excited to get your degree, yet so sad to be leaving Pullman behind. Special place and special alumni group that always makes room for another coug. Professors are supportive, campus is beautiful, student base is friendly and open."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the majority of my time here. I felt that they spent too much in athletics and not in the other departments like mine, animal sciences. Their agriculture department is excellent and I have learned a lot from being their and working on their dairy farm."
Alum,4,Online classes were structured fairly well. I enjoyed that it was mostly self paced and I was able to continue my regular schedule without having to miss out on working.
Freshman,4,This is my first year here but so far I have had a great experience. There are so many opportunities and everyone is very helpful. Even though it is a big university it truly feels like you are part of a community. The professors seem to genuinely care about your well-being and with COVID this year everyone has been putting in extra to make the best of an unfortunate situation.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community, the feeling of living with other students who are all in this with you, and the broad range of opportunities. The school tends to have some problems with planning, and campus itself has a lot of hills and confusing buildings. But after some time it wont take even 10 minutes to cross campus"
Senior,4,"I have taken several classes online, and now with COVID I have a full course-load of work. The experience will vary from instructor to instructor, some have been strong in their adaptation to online, but other's have understandably struggled. My most difficult experience so far, is finding guidance, but as far as difficulties go during this time, it is not the worst experience to have. 
If you have the ability to self-motivate, you will do fine. If you are someone who needs more structure to stay focused or dedicated, then online learning may not be suited for you."
Freshman,4,"Online learning is hard, but it certainly has helped to have kind professors. The school works really well with your issues and helps to give an amazing education, even though its ."
Junior,4,"The sense of community at WSU is unlike no other in Washington, the popular saying Cougs help Cougs is a testament I truly stand by. People there are so nice and friendly. Due to it's location of being in the middle of no where, strong friendships are a necessity! I know I found mine at WSU. Classes depending on what they are can range from 15 students to 130. Professors take academics very seriously and so does a lot of the students at university. WSU isn't a party school no more!"
Sophomore,4,I took one online course within my freshman year and it was laid out very organized. It didn't even feel like I was taking an online course since my resources were all there.
Senior,4,"Online has been pretty good. The course load isnâ€™t too overbearing and all the professors communicate clearly. Assignment submissions are easy to find and use, lots of resources for help if needed. You get out what you put into the experience."
Junior,4,"Haven't started yet, but so far so good. I need more words, so here they are. Words are fun, yes indeed."
Junior,4,"Once you find your people, itâ€™s an amazing experience even though thereâ€™s assignments that need to be done. I transferred here and it has been one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve ever made. I chose what felt like home."
Freshman,4,I am just beginning this Fall Semester 2020. I have been told by other students that I know who already attend that the school's efforts to continue quality instruction online was very good.
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about WSU is the community. The community is so welcoming and helpful, a wonderful atmosphere to live in and immerse yourself in. The students, professors, and staff are so nice and genuine. The setting and vibe you get from WSU is unlike other universities I have toured. Also I won't forget to mention that since WSU is in a college town, the prices in town at the nearby stores are tailored towards student budgets which makes living affordable. 

Another one of my favorite aspects of WSU is the food, specifically Ferdinand's ice cream shop and the Cougar Gold cheese. The ice cream shop has amazing flavors like Cougar Tracks (think peanut butter, chocolate, vanilla), huckleberry, and even apple pie. The shop also has a variety of house made cheeses, fresh curds, and even smoked meats. It's just something you can't beat. 

WSU is a great college, it's campus is easy to walk around (make sure you're okay with lots of hills!), and the community is wonderful. Go Cougs!"
Sophomore,4,"I only took online classes when all classes were moved online in spring of 2020 due to the covid-19 outbreak. Lectures and labs were all online. My professors made sure to give us clear instructions for our assignments and labs that were online, and gave us plenty of resources for finishing said assignments as well as study tools for exams."
Sophomore,4,"Really enjoying the coursework and lectures. The culture is nice and welcoming, only as long as you're willing to put yourself out there."
Alum,4,"Washington State University had quality educational services but its campus was not largely focused on education. I found in my time attending WSU that while they offered a variety of classes with excellent teachers and a wide range of in-depth content, most of the individuals enrolled in this school are more community/socially focused vs. educationally focused. The school itself was a good school, but the party atmosphere was always the biggest take-away from those visiting or attending."
Alum,4,"I did not attend any classes online, though I bet that it is similar to the quality of the in-person classes."
Freshman,4,"When the virus started to spread, Washington State University decided to change face to face classes to online classes. I was little worried because I learn better when I am actually in a class. However, all of my professors tried their best to give good learning experience for everyone. Few of my professors had few zoom meetings and I really appreciated how they were checking on us constantly to make sure we were on track of everything."
Sophomore,4,"I took online classes at WSU when the covid19 outbreak occurred,  I found that the online teaching format was very similar to what I experienced in person. I had multiple labs that were put online and I used various online tools and videos to help complete the full lab experience."
Sophomore,4,It's better than what I expected. All of my classes used Zoom or Panopto for lectures. Professors were also helpful in making sure students learn the curriculum as best as possible.
Junior,4,Dense online experience at Washington State University. Zoom classes were okay with the professors making accommodation to students during the pandemic for late work.
Sophomore,4,"COVID-19 definitely changed the way instruction was given at WSU. The university and the professors handled the switch to online very well though. Professors made sure they were available through Zoom and email all day. We switched to recorded lectures, and having informational videos to receive all the information we needed. Not only were the professors helpful, but also the university. The university was constantly emailing us, giving refunds where they could, and even allowed a pass/fail option for classes."
Sophomore,4,Coming back from campus and learning online was difficult for myself and my professors. Most of my professors went the extra mile to accommodate the challenges we faced.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed meeting people on campus and getting involved. As it it such a small town everyone is force to get to know each other, but the faculty are inconsistent at times and can be difficult to deal with at times. Overall they mean well but a few of them ruin the learning environment."
Freshman,4,"Washington State University is a great University, with many student outlets for help with academics and personal life. Being in the engineering department has been inspiring since you learn from some of the renown professors  who are clearly experts at engineering. There is plenty of ways for students to get involved and meet/network including clubs and student recreation centers. They handled the switch to online courses with the covid-19 pandemic to the best of their ability and continued to improve classes and keep in touch with the students."
Junior,4,I'm only just applying and going through that process. Hopefully will have more to say soon! So I will come back when I have more to add about the school hopefully.
Niche User,4,"I love the spirt at WSU! It was a bit of a change for me moving from a small town, but I loved the campus. I felt really welcomed and enjoyed my time there. I can't wait to go back and continue my education there!"
Freshman,4,"At WSU there is a great sense of school spirit that is projected by all the students and fans, whether that be in sports, special speakers, and even just tailgating. It does take a while to get used to the scenery, but once you get the hang of the campus, it makes it a lot easier to find your people."
Sophomore,4,The community is one of the strongest features of WSU. There are a variety of school organizations and groups that allow students to create a network of friends alongside possible career connections.
Senior,4,"I attended both the WSU Vancouver and WSU Spokane campuses during my undergraduate career. I found both campuses to be quite beautiful, and the advisors at both were very organized and helpful. Professors were very accommodating and well-informed on the topics they were teaching. Being a Washington resident, the price for this school is also great."
Freshman,4,I love how small and the hometown feel it has. It is a great tight knit community. Washington State University is a friendly and open campus. It has a large amount of clubs and a place for everyone! Washington State University has always been a part of my life and it is a great place to go to.
Freshman,4,I am a out of state freshman. I am majoring in neuroscience. WSU made it very easy to adjust from the friendly environment and many diverse activities for students to feel at home. The professors I have had are very understanding of students situations and make sure students do their best in the classes. There is also many free helpful resources to help students if they are struggling in a class.
Freshman,4,The college so far has been very fun. I do the online global campus and they have a lot of opportunities to get connected with the university community. They offer different reimbursements to help with exercise and community events with the college as well as offer online clubs to join
Freshman,4,"I actually like the course they have to offer as well as how helpful the community is. There are also fun, cool places to hang out with friends and things to do."
Niche User,4,I love the location. The athletics department is amazing. Lots of amazing athletes have gone there. The school embraces their culture!
Junior,4,WSU is a tight knit community of Cougs no matter where you are in the world you always feel like you are a part of the WSU family. The campus is in the middle of no where but they try their best to have events and activities to keep you busy.
Freshman,4,"During my time at WSU, I have learned a lot despite only being here for a year! I've loved all but one of my classes (I'm a Psych/Pre-Med Major and I didn't like an art history class). They also have smaller classes for freshman called First Year Focus that I have really enjoyed and thrived in! The food and dorm life is eh, though living with a lot of other freshmen have allowed me to make some friends here since I didn't really know anyone coming in."
Niche User,4,"I have family who attended, as well as currently attends, WSU, and have visited/ toured the campus multiple times and was fairly impressed. As a high school senior, I was accepted into the honors program and after touring and looking into the program I was impressed with what it had to offer and the resources that would be available to me next year."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy WSU, It is extremely welcoming and a safe environment. Since the first time I came to visit the campus as a high school senior I just had the feeling this was the school I would be attending in the upcoming school year. Making the decision of what university to attend is extremely hard, but I really believe I made the right choice picking Washington State University. All the professors are great, and always have opportunities for office hours or have information available for students who are seeking help on the material. This is something I really like. Coming to a big university you assume your professors wont really care for the students because there are just way to many, but I found this to be untrue. There are plenty of opportunities to meet your professors, and to ask questions. This leads to a more successful path for the student."
Freshman,4,It's a very welcoming campus filled with lots of diversity. Professors and staff are very nice and willing to help. It was very easy to get acquainted with the college lifestyle and making new friends.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the campus help is always available, even when you need to meet outside of class hours or office hours."
Junior,4,WSU is an extremely safe college. I have been able to have fun while also being academically challenged. Professors do what they can to ensure that students succeed.
Freshman,4,"It is a good, accredited institution with lots of opportunities for student involvement. One downside is the campus is very hilly and the Student Recreation Center is further away from the rest of campus."
Junior,4,"Washington has a great campus and includes everyone! They are very helpful in guiding you through your college experience! I am located at the Vancouver campus, and I love how ""homey"" it feels. There are smaller class sizes, so its easy to make friends and to ask your professors for help! The food on campus is terrific. There aren't parties because it's not a campus you can live on, but that makes it so much easier to focus on school!"
Niche User,4,"Campus is beautiful! Loved the people and the college town feel! However, job opportunities are limited in the area after graduation, especially for STEAM students."
Freshman,4,i really like WSU because its a great school i love the community because they all help with everything they are very nice people and i love the campus it makes you feel safe and welcomed overall. they for sure make sure you get the best education you can possible get at WSU. They have tons of resources to make sure you are on track to get your grades up and make sure your on track for your future.
Junior,4,"One thing I like the most about WSU is the tremendous amount of resources that are always there for students. For my specific major, my advisors are always available and open to questions. My professors among a variety of subjects have always been easy to talk to and easy to understand."
Junior,4,The community here is like no other I've experienced. The students here are truly all here to support each other. There is no way no one will take you under their wing and help you out. This is truly a great environment. The only downside is that some instructors here are known to not be great and students may often find themselves teaching the material to themselves if they're unlucky and get a terrible instructor. This school also has a long of work to do when it comes to mental health and understanding this big issue.
Junior,4,Good atmosphere for school spirit. Pretty wild greek life. Good queer centers. Has a lot of organizations and clubs. Lots of good places to study.
Sophomore,4,"The campus as well as what the school has to offer in its entirety is lovely. The various opportunities for students are abundant as their are many options to choose from. Although its location is in the middle of nowhere, you can always find something to do within the school's campus. The teachers are decent. Some are amazing, while some are adequate or less than adequate, depending on the specific class and the subject which is being taught. Overall, the school is very nice."
Sophomore,4,"One thing that I really enjoy about Washington State University is the diversity of clubs for many different interests. My favorite is Raptor Club, in which I have learned how to handle birds of prey such as a Pygmy Owl and a Kestrel. The people on campus are friendly. The professors are nice and willing to help students in need. There are also lots of programs for students to take advantage of, such as tutoring services, homework help centers, and counselors. Overall, I am glad that I chose to come to Washington State University."
Freshman,4,"The culture and community on-campus are thriving, since the Pullman campus is obviously within a small town. There's always something happening, but of course its more fun to be involved (which is easy when there are over 500 registered student organizations). I love the environment and the laid-back attitude that the majority of the student population has, but this is only after taking care of responsibilities relating to your college experience. Some aspects of financial aid, your finances in general, and what you need to send to the school are not made explicitly clear - like what types of aid you apply for, and how you can find resources for this yourself. I would also love to see more diversity within the school as there is a slight disconnect in the importance of representation and the excellence of students of color, LGBTQ+ or otherwise underrepresented students."
Niche User,4,"Everytime I go on tours with my class for a trip, everyone seems kind and calm. Not crowded and people being in your way like high school."
Junior,4,"Starting as a junior at Washington State University, I have had the pleasure of working with online instructors and classes to finish my degree. Working in the first responder field with long, busy shifts the online option to complete my degree is a blessing. The instructors have been willing and able to adapt to last-minute emergencies and schedule changes. The coursework is a sufficient enough level where I am not completely overwhelmed nor do I feel like I am not expanding my knowledge and horizons. I would recommend the online degree through WSU to anyone who wishes to continue or finish their degree in their busy daily lives."
Freshman,4,"The people are really great, honestly I haven't met a bad apple. There are always events, and I enjoy the academic side of things greatly. And this school has a lot of fun that comes with it."
Sophomore,4,I am attending Washington State University on the Vancouver campus. Most of the professors are great. The professors are genuinely interested in the success of their students. There are also many resources for students.
Niche User,4,"I dont have much experience with the school but, I have gone to the campus and loved it. The people working at the institution are so nice and friendly. Plus the campus is beautiful overall. Really do recommend going to this school at least once so you can fall in love."
Sophomore,4,"WSU has given me some of the best experiences as a student as it showed/is showing me how the academic world truly is along with helping me live my overall life goals. The only real downside to the campus is the placement of it as it has an incredible amount of hills, heavy snow, and Pullman is trapped by wheat fields. For on campus housing I'd suggest only doing the required year as the dorm rooms are incredibly small, overpriced, poor furniture quality,  and just overall a mediocre living space."
Freshman,4,"It is a beautiful campus with lots of opportunities for students to get involved. However, as an out of state student I can say that the ratio of in and out of state students is not balanced. If you are from out of state, most of the people you meet will be in state. The sporting events are always very fun and show what the awesome school spirt at WSU. Another thin to consider, it is removed from other towns and cities. The closest major city being Spokane or the town of Moscow in Idaho."
Senior,4,The school itself has plenty of resources to help you succeed. The advisors could be better help in planning a schedule that works year round.
Junior,2,The administration at WSU is quite poor. For some reason there are 5 people for every position needed resulting in much higher pay from the students. Research is the only good thing at WSU. Many of the staff and administration are illogical and unreasonable. Finally finding a normal rational human being among them is rare. I like that WSU has research opportunity for undergrads which is great when the college is actually open. Most of these programs were cancelled by the pandemic leaving little to nothing to be desired enrolling at this college. I do wish that all the upper administration cared about wasn't football (their main business); a university should care most about their learning experience not how they can maximize profits by any means necessary.
Sophomore,2,Not to the fault of the faculty as there was an abrupt switch to online due to COVID-19. But there were times where there seemed to be a lack communication between student and professors as to what was needed to be done.
Freshman,2,"Before the Coronavirus outbreak, the online software and platform Washington State University used to communicate with students was very tacky and  confusing to learn how to work. It took me days to figure out where everything was and throughout the fall semester it crashed several times. In spite of all of this, the worst thing was the very, very slow internet. The amount of times it crashed are off the charts, and I had to rely on my cellular data as my primary internet source for majority of the fall semester; basically my internet was out of pocket. Because of this, most of my zoom calls with my professors were very glitchy, the video quality no higher than 240p, and always lagging. For the most part, my online experience was very poor with Washington State University."
Junior,2,"My entire experience at WSU was plagued with the feeling of being taken advantage of. So many aspects of the university seem designed to Nickel and Dime their students. From $16 dollar jars of peanut butter in the student stores (the only place most students can get groceries without a car), a meal plan that charges per item rather than per meal unlike other universities (with most students running out of their meal plan dollars months before the predicted dates offered by the university), unsanitary dorms (people literally defecating in the laundry rooms and hallways) that go for triple the asking price of commensurate listings, and a gallimaufry of hidden fees and expenses, this university will stop at nothing to squeeze everything they can from your wallets. The academics can fluctuate from average to appalling-  I had a professor not show up to class 8 times without providing a substitute or even an email, the tutoring center had only one tutor who knew calculus). Some good clubs."
Junior,2,I took classes online Spring Term 2020 due to the virus. I was disappointed one teacher didn't know how to use the online programs. My screen was different from his and when asking a question he would get upset and annoyed. Another professor didn't use his time wisely. I know everything was put together quickly and not everyone was ready but there was a lot of misunderstandings and some professors treated students poorly.
Junior,2,"The way people act in this learning environment is very poor and unkempt. I have seen people ""protest"" this that and the other thing and never with any true intentions or emotions behind it. The staff hired only ever enables this attitude by being so soft on these superclass privileged students who don't know the first thing about the things they protest. If you have an opinion that is further right politically than a centrist you WILL be called terrible names just because you have an opinion. As far as the learning goes it is acceptable if not a little poor as far too often I get a graduate getting their doctoral as a professor instead of an actual professor who has put in the time to learn their craft. The only reason I am in this university anymore is that I NEED that degree and I can't go pay another university the same amount I have been paying and take the gamble just to find out it's worse."
Niche User,2,"I attended Washington State University for two and a half years. My experiences trying to navigate the logistics of applying, looking at my student account, and using their computer interface system were particularly negative. I have spent countless hours trying to teach myself how to use their programs but every semester a new course was accompanied by a new set of issues. The school is a haven for those who overcome these obstacles. But on the whole, the atmosphere, culture, and lack of ease in regards to maintaining some sort of consistency made for a less than ideal experience."
College Sophomore,2,I live below Greek row and watch as drunk people walk down.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not in the Greek life, but there is a lot of drama between the Greeks and Non-Greeks. I stay out of it and focus on my studies and clubs."
College Junior,2,"Can't stand greek life. Guys join it for the ""brotherhood"" but mostly so that they can get into parties and girls are still living in high school.

No thanks."
College Senior,2,Green life has a very negative connotation that goes along with it and not just because people are jealous of those that get in but because of the people that compose the majority of Greek life.
College Junior,2,"Noisy, rooms are small and prices are not that great considering what you can get off campus for the same price."
College Junior,2,Way too many greek orgs on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I disliked the mandatory floor meetings for the dorm halls because I found them pointless. In addition, they seem to be just a money-making scheme by the school because it requires that all Freshmen live in one for a year."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are fine, just too expensive."
College Senior,2,"It's a predominantly white institution, meaning there is not much diversity, just enough to look good on a pamphlet."
College Sophomore,2,Some majors can be difficult to get into and jobs do require that you be in a certain major to apply which is not helpful when looking for a job.
College Freshman,2,Very unfair system that is plagued by old traditon
College Junior,2,Greek life tends to be hazardous when it comes to the party scene...
College Freshman,2,Housing costs an arm and a leg for alright quality.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is everywhere, whether you enjoy or partake in the parties you see so the presence of the sorority or frat life. The people with their greek letters on their sweaters pushing flyers and talking about the houses they're going to party in over the weekend. By non-greeks greek students are viewed as snobby and also as a bit of druggies. The greek houses are nice though."
College Sophomore,2,The system does not work
College Freshman,2,The fact that we're forced to live on campus as freshmen made my first semester at WSU difficult
College Sophomore,2,"A degree from WSU is valued, but I haven't heard of any job/internship recruitment."
College Sophomore,2,I would choose another school which considers my financial problems.
College Sophomore,2,"I arrived at Washington State University with high expectations in response to my older sister's exciting stories. Needless to say, I did not share the Coug passion she had. I struggled with adjusting to the isolated campus along with classes as they require much more responsibility than high school. I joined a sorority which gave me an incredible support system to help with difficult courses and discussing feelings of doubt for the university. The romanticized party culture that consumes the mostly freshman and sophomore's free time made it difficult for me to make new friends; as I am not very fond of going out on the weekends. The major I chose, hospitality business management, has opened many networking opportunities that have given me a chance to expand my professional network and learn more about the different industries that will be open to me. This and the sorority are keeping me at this university."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I had a hard time recieving my financial aid and it took me many months for paperwork to be processed and confirmed."
College Sophomore,2,Stay away from the dining halls. The food there is mediocre at best.
College Freshman,2,"There are literally no options when you are hungry, especially late night. Unlike the Ave at UW, you are limited to very few places close enough for you to even consider eating at in Pullman."
College Freshman,2,I think in a way it was a blessing when I ran out of RDA. I started cooking for myself and my digestive track returned to normal.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't receive much financial aid at all, and I don't know how to pay for the uncovered tuition costs."
College Junior,2,"There are some nice restaurants, other than that it is mostly fast food places. If you're trying to get food at 2 am on a weekend mcdonalds or taco bell is your only option pretty much."
College Junior,2,It is kind of ridiculous sometimes how stupid crazy some of greek row can get on weekends and how... interesting some students can decide to be on the weekend
College Freshman,2,"The girl who helped me yelled at me, made me cry and made disrespectful remarks about my mother. Since this is a large school maybe get employees who are personable and care about the people they are talking to."
College Sophomore,2,"WSU takes an extremely long time to award financial aid so you are unsure how much you will be able to receive until after the deadline to enroll in school. There are also very few scholarships offered to out-of-state students. I recently lost access to my private loans and when meeting with Financial Aid about other options to pay for my education, they simply listed the scholarships and grants available (none of which I qualified for because I am an out-of-state student) and told me that I'll only have to find another few thousand dollars and that I'm not that bad off."
College Freshman,2,Some nice options but disappointingly low variety
College Freshman,2,I come from a very poor family who cannot help me with payments at all. Financial aid was difficult to fill out and I essentially got nothing. I had to pay for my schooling through outside loans.
College Freshman,2,"I worked in food supply once, so I know its not the easiest job. However, the food service at Washington State University is pathetic. The food is zero flavor and is a touch above cold whenever you get it. The serving staff is rude and can't answer simple questions."
College Junior,2,I never see cops around and when they are needed they take forever to respond.
College Freshman,2,"Washington State University is a big party school, however if you maintain a decent moral then it is easy to stay focused in school work. So parties are not a big part of my life, but I do hear a lot about them."
College Freshman,2,"Most students I had associated with had very little problems with financial aid. However, I had a very difficult time receiving mine with my bank account and it was just a struggle."
College Freshman,2,I would like to see more off campus dining.
College Sophomore,2,EXPENSIVE AND NOT WORTH THE PRICE AT ALL
College Junior,2,I'd say most Non-Greeks do not like Greeks. There Greeks may seem to have some sort of entitlement. Recent Greek incidents have put them in bad light.
College Junior,2,"The food itself isn't terrible, but the meal plan system is pretty awful. Its overpriced and really not worth it. If you're living on campus and can forgo the meal plan, use cougar cash instead, its a better value."
College Senior,2,"Our athletic teams are terrible, WAY too overfunded for the crap that we receive to watch as students, but at least the non-athlete facilities for training are quite adequate."
College Freshman,2,I was attacked and punched in the face by a fellow student my first week on campus.
College Freshman,2,Pullman is a small town. There needs to be a mall around here or more shops. There's too little to do.
College Junior,2,It took over a week past the date of which I was suppose to get my financial aid and every time I asked them when it will be deposited they said it will be by tonight or tomorrow.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of fast food restaurants but not much else
College Junior,2,Not many bars near campus at all
College Junior,2,Because WSU is a state school there aren't a large amount of financial aid offerings. I haven't received anything from the school even though I get pretty good grades.
College Freshman,2,I found it difficult to meet people because on weekends the ones in my dorm would visit greek row and I have never been interested in drinking.
College Senior,2,"Just take the bus if you live off campus. ALL of the parking anywhere close to campus is permit parking, and the costs are ridiculous. There are two parking garages, but they are very spendy, I only ever use them for when I have short meetings or appointments. Seriously, the bus system is great and free for students, just use it."
College Sophomore,2,Need more parking on campus
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid was posted on my account, then taken away. I was told that it was standard to put aid on all graduate students accounts just in case someone received it."
College Senior,2,Most of the off campus living is ran by slum lords. Expensive rent for rundown places.
College Senior,2,There's just no place to eat. It's really the same 8 or 9 spots
College Senior,2,I'm always the only or one of maybe 5 non-white people in my classes
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a city with amazing public transportation, I might be biased, however the campus shuttle/town bus system is more inconvenient than not. Some buses only come around every 45 minutes and the ""express"" buses only exist during school hours and in a certain area. Taxis are expensive, and there are rarely enough zipcars."
Junior,1,During the epidemic the administration has made an overwhelming about of poor choices such as making students whom are all online (the equivalent of global students) pay 1000 more in fees for services they will never see utilized. Even their lower staff is outraged. The style of teaching at least in my experience has been poor. The only thing WSU has going for them is the opportunity for research. Teaching and administration is much more organized and overall better at a community college.
Niche User,1,I am a parent with two freshman enrolled at this college.  I hope every parent considering sending their child to this school reads this review.
Freshman,1,Wsu is the worst school iâ€™ve ever been to. I was forced to come here and it has actually driven me to almost ripping my hair out due to stress over all the extra crap im forced to do outside of learning. I paid to learn not to take selfies on campus and waste my time in these classes doing busy work. Where are the lectures? Also if youre not interested in silly time waster events or being apart of greek life expect to be treated like youre an outcast. Dont come here if you have a brain. Yeah they do spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on their football team and still have bugs in the dorm bathrooms. Coug pride? Well they must be pretty prideful of all those silverfish because they dont want to get rid of them. Maybe theyre considering a new mascot?
Alum,1,"My time at wsu over the last 12 years has beem nothing short of a waking nightmare.  Constantly being told things that are not true from advisors and counselors.   Make sure to get everything in writing, never get advice in person because it will be wrong and leave you with no proof.  The school cares nothing for the students, we are simply a source of income for the bureaucracy.  Do not go to wsu, go anywhere else, consider a trade school or community college instead."
Niche User,1,"The professors are rude and expect more than is humanly possible. The parties are ridiculous, and the overall student body is disrespectful and snooty."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is for those who want to party.
College Junior,1,"Our piss poor Greek system is the life of this school. A ridiculous amount of money goes into letting the snobs drink their time at school away. They don't do entrepreneurial or community events but like once a year, and a sorority just got busted for dealing cocaine. They are insanely rude to GDI's."
College Senior,1,WSU Vancouver is a commuter-only school. No Athletics are available on campus.
College Freshman,1,"I am not involved in greek life, and because of that, I can't go to 85% of the parties here at WSU. The other 15% of parties are scattered and the ratios are horrible. Not to mention the cops always shut these down first."
College Junior,1,"The WORST experience i have ever had. Not only does it take forever but its like they have never done it before. On multiple occasions i have been two months into school and did not have any money to buy books, food, or pay rent. Disgraceful. Financial aid is the one thing i tell people about when they ask about Wsu. It is a great school but i wouldnt have transferred if i knew it would be so hard to finance my schooling."
College Freshman,1,"Theres really nowhere to eat in Pullman besides Jimmy Johns, Dominos, Red Bento, and fast food. I never really leave campus to get food because theres basically nowhere to go."
College Junior,1,I am trying to get into a physical therapy program after I earn my bachelor's degree. The classes and requirements are extremely hard to do. It helps when professors work with you and are willing to take the extra time to do so
College Senior,1,"Just be patient, that's the best advice. Last year they had to extend the tuition due date by almost a month because no one was getting their financial aid on time. The school is pretty understanding when it comes to hold ups like that."
College Senior,1,It is very difficult to find a spot so I just walk everywhere on campus it's a lot easier
College Senior,1,"Financial aid is the worst thing on this campus. The people are not helpful and not friendly. Also there is always a wait and a line out the door, due to the fact there is always only one or two people working. I feel like I can write an essay about how bad fin aid is."
College Senior,1,I pay to attend why do I have to pay for printing
College Freshman,1,They do not give much time for anyone to revive their aid before starting the semester.
College Senior,1,it seems very difficult for financial aid to process
College Junior,1,Sucks to be a GDI
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, financial aid did nothing for me at WSU"
College Freshman,1,It's really hard to find spots and it's expensive.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Winters are THE WORST. I come from sunny Nevada, so I am not tolerating the snow very well! Be sure to bring some boots because sun or snow you will be going to class!"
College Junior,1,From talking to other students parking is a hassle
College Sophomore,1,The parking lots are always full and the price is ridiculously high for what you get. The cheapest lot is over $200 and has no security. It is very dangerous having to walk to and from the dorms to the parking lot at night. Always bring a buddy with you.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is such a hassle and it really isn't very convenient. The parking rules are enforced greatly, if you are in the wrong spot even five minutes before you're allowed to you ost likely already have a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough man power to stop all of the drugs and alcohol abuse on campus. The police do work very hard to keep it down but people still do it and don't seem to care about the consequences.
College Freshman,1,"The weather is very wet and rainy in the fall and spring. In the winter we get a lot of snow, but so far classes haven't been cancelled because of it."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life seems to be a pretty big part of social life at Washington State.  I have met some people in sororities and fraternities that are pretty cool, but for the most part the guys are jerks and the girls are stuck-up, and thay all love to party a little bit too much.  I live in a dorm but am surrounded by freshmen sorority girls.  They come home to the dorm at 2 or 3 in the morning and are extremely loud, annoying, and drunk.  Several times, I have been woken up by them screaming, laughing, running up and down the hall, and banging on people's doors in the middle of the night.  Once, a drunk sorority girl walked into my room at 3 in the morning.  Greek life negatively affects people's educations, whether they are a part of it or not."
College Freshman,1,Cops don't do anything. If someone is drunk and walking home alone they leave them to themselves and do not care. There are no campus policies or anything
College Sophomore,1,they are really old and slow. this makes it difficult to get things done in physics
College Sophomore,1,Greeks party too much and are annoying most of the time.
College Sophomore,1,Being a small campus with no dorms the nightlife is virtually nonexistent.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not very good, not very much variety and extremely expensive. The markets double the price of most food also."
College Sophomore,1,"I feel that too little is done to keep students safe. Student workers don't get the same rights as other workers, and the Director of Residence Life stated to me if he held his workers to federal and state laws, half of his workers would be fired."
College Sophomore,1,"Everywhere you go, you hear racist, sexist remarks"
College Senior,1,Small town.  Handful of bars that are always empty.. maybe 15%-25% capacity on weekends.
College Freshman,1,"Convenient, but Late â€“ The bus system is how a majority of students arrive to campus, taking the express buses take you from campus and around to apartment land as well as other places. The bus pass is a fixed fee, so all you have to do is show your card to the driver. Using one of the letter buses, I have found, are usually somewhat off schedule, but the school is working on creating a new route for the more popular stops."
College Freshman,1,"There are so many different parking lots all labeled with different colors which means even if you purchase one of their incredibly high priced parking passes, if you park in the wrong color you will still get a hefty ticket.  And believe me, they WILL catch you.  Once I got a ticket for parking where in a mostly empty parking lot for 15 minutes.  I looked at the time stamp on the ticket and it was written only 2 minutes after getting there.  I swear the parking police just sit there and wait for people to write tickets."
College Junior,1,"Parking in Pullman sucks! They are building a new dorm, which is taking away some of the little parking we had. Parking on College Hill is a death sentence for your car...every car I walk by on my way to class has dents, scratches or broken side mirrors. Parking in downtown is terrible as well. They are also very strict in university parking lots and will ticket you."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Finally, a Mike Leach â€“ As shallow as it sounds, schools get associated with football and with that the school's 'history'..a system that feeds on itself..wazzu's inability to attract top tier talent has everything to do with it's location. With the new league reform we finally got a top tier coach and have hope!!"

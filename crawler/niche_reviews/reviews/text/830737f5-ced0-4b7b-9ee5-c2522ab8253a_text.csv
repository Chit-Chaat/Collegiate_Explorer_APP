Freshman,5,The Ratline is a unique system in this school that definitely sucks in a lot of ways but everyone is equal and everyone earns their place here.
Sophomore,5,"You learn things that you cannot learn from books like discipline, honor, and integrity and uphold higher standards than any student at another school. Yes, it is very very strict, but you will be more prepared than any other person that did not attend. FANTASTIC Alumni connection as well! 100% sets you up for the future."
Graduate Student,5,I did not take any online classes. When I attended everything was in person and there is a 12:1 ratio of student to teacher.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful school and strong Alumni association.  A true brotherhood of learning, discipline. Complete self control and strong bonding.  Strong academic life"
Freshman,5,"The Virginia Military Institute is a military college who's goal is to create better men and women who will hopefully go on to commission in the military. It is a very demanding school, essentially consuming most of the time out of your day to learn military bearing and tradition, taking your college courses, and becoming exceptionally fit in order to make the prerequisites to become an officer. ""No ordinary college, no ordinary life"". So far I love VMI, and only being here five months I've acquired skills that will stay with me for the rest of my life."
Junior,5,"This school should be rated on the of the best schools in the United States. It is extremely difficult to make it through, but the lessons and opportunities that you have here are one hundred percent worth it. The best part about the school is that it is so small. It is a close knit community even including the faculty. There is room for persona one on one with teachers and the biggest class I have ever been in was 25. The food is by far not the best, but they do offer health conscious options and options for people with specific eating conrestraints."
Sophomore,5,"VMI offers an experience unlike any other. While the school is challenging both mentally and physically, the rewards are worth the long nights staying up to study and early mornings waking up to workout. VMI gives students many opportunities to become leaders and teaches young men and women the importance of teamwork and a strong work-ethic."
Freshman,5,College is great with academics and athletics. Builds character and classes are small so learning is first priority.  Rooms are what you expect in a military school and food is not good.
Sophomore,5,This school is great for aspiring leaders in both the civilian word and military world. It creates life  long friendship as well as develops a strong sense of honor. The faculty and staff are extremely helpful and with it being such a small school they really get to know you as a person.
Junior,5,"VMI is an academic experience like no other.  It puts cadets through intense physical, mental, and academic rigor while maintaining a sharp eye for professionalism and military bearing."
Freshman,5,"Attending the Virginia Military Institute is a difficult, but rewarding journey. You will have to deal with a system that pushes you down, while instilling you with the fortitude to get back up. While this school produces officers, the alumni association will give any VMI alumni a job on the spot. This is what separates this school from others. Given that the alumni run this school, they will make sure the graduates will be taken care of in the future."
Alum,5,"If you’d like to become a member of one of the most outstanding alumni networks in the US, gain admission to VMI.  The brotherhood is lifelong and worth the struggle. Ordinary college grads will always take a back seat to a VMI grad in just about any career.  Dig deep and put on those big boy pants and you’ll make it through the long grey line."
Junior,5,"This school is great for the right people. The daily lifestyle here sucks, but in the end, I wouldn't want ot be anywhere else. The camaraderie is second to none and you come out of here prepared for life."
Alum,5,"The four years of this gauntlet will be worth every minute once you've graduated.  VMI students are sought out by employers all over the country.  You will not regret the time you spend at the ""I"" if you're looking for a return on college investment."
Junior,5,"It kinda sucks, but isn't that the point of military school? The academics are challenging, the pt hard, and the schools system in general just a fight. By far just a good choice and a hard fought degree."
Freshman,5,"A bonding experience. Not a place for everyone, but if you're seeking the unordinary lifestyle, this may be the place for you."
College Sophomore,5,"The alumni network is simply amazing. There is not a more dedicated alumni base than VMI. We get alumni visits every single day, and VMI alum can be found in every single major industry from teach to business to engineering, and are very good for helping recent graduates establish themselves. Additionally, the heavy military atmosphere of the school offers a number of ROTC scholarships and commissions each year in all branches of service."
College Sophomore,5,"One of the most interesting things is I can leave me $1,000 laptop computer sitting open in a building, walk out to go get lunch, return, and it has not been touched. The combination of the strict, single-sanction honor system (""A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do"") and the level of mutual respect and brotherhood makes VMI one of the safest campuses in the country. Campus crime is virtually nonexistent, and I have never once felt like my person was in danger. That being said, the close quarters and lifestyle of VMI has led to some animosity between certain individuals, and although it has never caused a violent physical altercation, it has led to some fairly mean pranks and practical jokes between people."
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small which is great. Proffessors are invested in you, and want you to succeed. The courses are pretty good, some courses are over the top."
College Sophomore,5,"The alumni network is one of the best in the country, and if you want a job after graduating you will get one."
College Sophomore,5,"The honor code makes most crime/sexual assault not heard of. There are a few cases of theft, but that is the worst I have heard of before."
College Sophomore,5,"For a military environment it is perfect. You live with 3-6 roommates in very small rooms. You always have people coming in and going out. You live right next to everyone else, and there is realy no such thing as privacy. It's great."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, you always hear about how hard VMI is, and how miserable life their is.It's true in one sense it is hard and it does suck, but if you remember that you chose this life then its an awesome experience. It shows students that you can go far beyond ""normal"" limits that society places on people, and gives you a drive to succeed. I would not have chosen to go anywhere else if given the opportunity."
College Junior,5,We have the best alumni network.
College Sophomore,5,Graduate from VMI= any job you want if you work hard
College Sophomore,5,"It is a challenging and grueling experience as we, cadets, are pushed far beyond our limits. We have learned to manage time so well that without it, we would be failing or be close to failing. Appreciation for almost everything in life such as, food, free time, physical activity, and much more has been realized by many of us here. The brotherhood spirit that is formed during the initial portion of the college, called the ""Ratline"", is eternal and unforgettable. I sometimes regret coming here, but only because of how difficult it can be. However, in overall, I love it here."
College Sophomore,5,"This school is incredibly safe. Accountability for all students is taken twice a day, and there is even a guard team led by cadets and headed by different officers serving on the Commandant's staff. Safety is taken very seriously at VMI."
College Sophomore,5,"Classes are small, professors are professional, and cadets are respectful. This is the best college in the nation and certainly the hardest. Cadets must learn to manage time effectively, because there is almost never any free time due to rat line events, extra-curricular activities, and mandatory inspections and formations. It is impossible to graduate from VMI by yourself, you need to rely on your brother rats and push through together."
College Sophomore,5,A degree from the Virginia Military Institute means the world to any graduate. The alumni connections from this small school are some of the best and strongest in the country. It can truly get you many jobs in multiple fields. This degree means something.
College Sophomore,5,"The Virginia Military Institute is the toughest and most rewarding school in the nation. VMI trains and develops future leaders in a spartan atmosphere and cultivates teamwork and leadership from all who attend. You cannot make it through VMI alone, you need to rely on your brothers around you in order to finish the rat line, get your ring, and get the prestigious degree."
College Junior,5,"Safety is key at VMI, it's very safe at VMI. Sexual Assault is taken seriously if it ever happens, which it doesn't often."
College Junior,5,"A degree from VMI is golden, very prestigious."
College Junior,5,"All professors care about your success, they will go out of their way to help."
College Sophomore,5,"VMI is a very unique school filled with many traditions and is very set in its ways. People keep trying to change it to make it easier to try and include everyone, to fit that ""everyone deserves a trophy"" BS, but luckily I don't think it will actually happen. VMI has a vast and dedicated system of alumni that would be the first to speak against any drastic changes. I hope the Ratline will endure as it has the past 100 years because of the great men and women it continues to produce every year."
College Freshman,5,Your Brother Rats will motivate you like none other.
College Freshman,5,"Its strict, but that's just the sort of environment I need for success."
College Senior,5,The engineering program here is the best possible. The student/teacher ratio is really good. I've learned more here that I thought possible.
College Senior,5,It's a great place to be from but not at
College Senior,5,engineering programs at VMI are the best.  You can't hide from learning the material because of the student to professor ratio.  They make sure you know the material or you will fail.  There are no curves on grades so be prepared to have a lower GPA than high school.  I know under grad schools like VA Tech who have curves throughout their programs so don't expect the same.  You will also get a job if you graduate
College Senior,5,There is always something for cadets to do... sleep is probably my favorite but I don't really get time for that.
Freshman,4,They were very responsive and used Zoom and other tools in a productive manner. Classes are not supposed to be online at VMI but they have adapted.
Sophomore,4,"For online, all professors tried their best to help, but you gotta understand that it was new for everyone. My gpa stayed close to the same than what I had before going online, mostly because of our honor code and integrity. Would have loved a little more organization though."
Graduate Student,4,"As expected the first year here is always the worst. But, going through it with your fellow Keydets makes it a little bit easier. I built tremendous friendships that I still have today. The atmosphere is amazing from professors to student life after the 1st year."
Sophomore,4,"I like how close we are with one another at the school. It is definitely a unique experience from other universities and colleges.  Everyone at the school lives on post in barracks and we have two formations a day.  I enjoy the climate of the enjoy and believe that most teachers care about students and want us to do well in life and succeed in what we put our mind and hearts into.  It is difficult at times, but they do not give us anything that we cannot handle.  The only concerns that arise is the tension between athletes and non athletes, but it is an understandable situation considering that athletes have to travel with their team to compete and miss military duty for those competitions and practice.  Overall, I would not want to be anywhere else because in the end it is worth the time and hard work that you put in.  I have also made some of my closest friends here that I can count on whenever needed."
Sophomore,4,"It is an overall great school, however, most definitely not for everyone. It is east to struggle there so you must have a strong drive and a strong desire to succeed there. The issues with the school are part of its process into shaping its cadets into respected, model citizens."
Senior,4,"I love how close you become with not only your own class, but also with the classes surrounding you. VMI is a very tight nit community."
Freshman,4,Tough but fulfilling lifestyle. Learn a lot and make great friends along the way. Challenging day be day process and you have a lot of things taking time from your day but it is a place you fall in love with.
Niche User,4,"The Ratline of VMI is a defining point for the Institute. As a current Rat, the Institute has provided a great balance between academics, ROTC, and the Ratline. If you want No Ordinary Life, this is the place."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are very easy to get in contact with and have an actual interest in the success of their students. I have never once felt like I couldn't go to a professor for help with something, and even if I couldn't, there are multiple organizations and areas to receive help in all my classes. VMI has excellent major-related and Gen Ed. classes, especially in the STEM fields. That being said, there aren't many elective classes, and there are virtually no art-type classes (art history, music, etc). Classes are all pretty small, with the largest I've seen being about 24 students. Given the school only has about 1,700 students at any given time, this is understandable. Class styles are all pretty similar, with classrooms generally being of the same design across the board, with obvious variations for labs."
College Sophomore,4,Nothing bad happens here. Like... nothing bad.
College Sophomore,4,Small-size classroom provides close relationship
College Sophomore,4,"All cadets live in barracks, there is no other choice. It is very cramped and cadets do not even get beds really, they have small mattress pads they roll every morning and wooden racks they place the pads on. Barracks rooms do not have air-conditioning, but cadets are required to keep and maintain very clean rooms with inspections two to three times a week."
College Sophomore,4,"The teams themselves may not always preform the best, however, school spirit and attendance by the corps of cadets is hard to beat. The gyms are brand new and all cadets use them."
College Freshman,4,Pretty good overall. Most club teams are better than the varsity.
College Freshman,4,It is a great school with great connections. you have to work hard and earn everything you receive. Well worth the work though.
College Junior,4,"I love the school, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. The bonds that I make with my classmates are everlasting. Our classes are very small, an average of 11:1 student to teacher ratio. The professor gets to know you, ad is very interested in your success. Professors are always available for help, and often come in to school in the evening to help students."
College Sophomore,4,"Virginia Military Institute has the reputation for being the toughest school in the nation, and that reputation is well earned.  Students who choose to take on this academically, physically and mentally challenging environment will immerse themselves in something that no other college will offer them. The Ratline is an integral part of this school, and it is one of the greatest accomplishments of my life.  I have endured the Ratline, and now I am proud to be part of the prestigious VMI brotherhood.  I now look forward to challenging myself in other ways over the next three years, and walking away a better man for it.  If you are up for the challenge, you will not be sorry."
College Freshman,4,"Its decent housing, just old and crowded."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the Corps of Cadets participates, so the rest of the students support the athletes."
College Senior,4,The Economics and Business department is composed of many good professors that are willing to help out students.
College Sophomore,4,VMI is pretty darn safe.
College Sophomore,4,I've received various scholarships that have really helped out.
College Sophomore,4,"Drugs aren't usually a problem here, but if you fail a drug test you're out."
College Sophomore,4,VMI has a hard academic curriculum that has to be balanced with our other duties such as military and athletic duties.
College Senior,4,academic buildings are great.  barracks life pretty much sucks.
College Senior,4,Engineering building has the best computers and technology.  I know a lot of the liberal arts cadets complain about their computers... most of them just play video games all day so they don't need them anyways
College Freshman,4,"Don't go through Ratline, but cadetship, yes. "
College Freshman,4,"Pretty good, it's Virginia weather really"
College Freshman,4,"Good overall, but soon to be new teachers all together. "
College Freshman,4,"Good academics, not too much work, but the teachers will be retiring in a couple of years. "
College Freshman,4,"I live far away but anyone can get a ride from anyone, it's the BR spirit."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the reliability is questionable, but it's good on computers"
College Freshman,4,"9:1 Male to female ratio so not too many hot girls, but it's all about the Ratline"
College Freshman,4,"Mandatory formation so everyone goes to the games, but we're not the best"
College Freshman,4,There is practically no change in weather throughout the year. It is always temperate.
College Junior,4,I am a double major in Biology and Spanish. This is a very unique combination. It has not been easy but my academic advisors are very supportive. I have a very bright career outlook towards the medical field and being bilingual will make me a more valuable asset.
College Senior,4,"The Ratline. No other school has it and it is a system unlike any other. It's long, hard, and sets the stage for one of the most difficult schools in the country."
Recent Alumnus,4,Getting help to pay for school wasn't too difficult.  Half of my tuition was paid for through financial aid and the rest was through student loans.  Most of the financial aid was through an alumni who had set up a grant fund for cadets that were from out of state.
College Freshman,4,"VMI offers an exellent opportunity to really exeed all your expectations as far as education is concerned. They have an amazing selection of professors that not only provide amaing insight in the classroom, but are readily available outside the classroom as well. There are many quiet places to study and ther are great resources ar your disposal."
College Freshman,4,"We at VMI are very proud of our sports team and it is a huge part of campus life. Team Spirit is a major factor and it couldnt be high. Win or lose the Keydet give it 110%, both on the field and in the stands."
College Senior,2,Good experience for some. Definitely not for all
College Sophomore,2,This school is very strict.
College Sophomore,2,"You can see a storm coming, but that doesn't mean formations or classes will get cancelled."
College Senior,2,You have to leave Lexington and go to other colleges
College Senior,2,Crozet food sucks.  it is a military school though
College Junior,2,Because of the academic and military demands of the institute it makes it very hard for us to have good division one sports teams. Our basketball team is pretty popular because they are by far the best team we have.
College Junior,2,Lexington is a small town. If you are an senior you are allowed to have your car so that gives you a lot more freedom to explore. If you are younger you are limited to restaurants and other attractions that are within walking distance.
College Senior,2,Most of the scholarships go to athletes even though the athletes don't participate in most of the activities that make the VMI experience what it is.
College Senior,2,"There is generally a large variety on a day-to-day basis, but the quality isn't good. On occasion something will be really good, but it's a rare event and usually happens on holidays. The staff should keep the conditions cleaner in the kitchen and do more recipes themselves instead of company recipes the former has turned out better dishes."
College Freshman,2,"No variety in majors, and teachers are very intelligent but cannot relay the information they know in a very understandable way."
College Freshman,2,"Difficult for military scholarships, easy for athletes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"First, VMI was a military institution, therefore you had to live on campus, or what we called post.  There was no other option for us.  We lived in a barracks where we did everything except for classes and eating our meals.  The style of living takes some getting used to because you do not have your typical amenities and must learn how to live with out them."
College Sophomore,2,The campus dining is nothing special.  People often complain and it is not as good as most large universities.
College Sophomore,2,Most computers at VMI do not have a fast connection and therefore it becomes frustrating when trying to work online.
College Junior,2,"At the moment (winter 2011) only seniors can have cars on campus.  It is, however, easy enough to conceal a car in the city of Lexington somewhere."
College Freshman,2,Non Existant – Transportation doesn't exist here. There is a one van shuttle that takes people into town on sunday but not much more than that
College Freshman,2,All the Same – All of the cadets here are pretty much the same. It is a military lifestyle and it was only until recently that women were admitted.
Niche User,1,"No participation of online learning was done on the student’s part. Thankfully, they will not be participating in online learning at this institution since they will no longer be attending in the fall."
Niche User,1,This institute is not worth your time or money. You are better off going to a different school that offers better learning overall. 100/10 don’t recommend. Disgusted.
College Senior,1,"There is no Greek life anymore. Although, Sigma Nu and Alpha Tau Omega were founded here."
College Senior,1,VMI is the strictest college in the country.  You will learn when and where to break the rules... then again I've marched a lot of PTs
College Senior,1,There is no greek life.  It's VMI
College Junior,1,Military school so a lot of rules obviously. Drug use or alcohol on campus is not tolerated. If you get good grades you receive academic days which allow you to leave during the school week but other than that cadets that are not in trouble are usually permitted to leave on the weekend.
College Senior,1,It's a flat rate across the board and luck determines whether or not you car is 100 yards away or a quarter mile or more.
College Freshman,1,No freedom. No fun. Everything about it is horrible.
College Freshman,1,There are not many scholarship opportunities to be had here.
College Junior,1,"It's obviously strict. My review is not about the barracks, but the Police in the area.
On Campus, State Troopers assigned to VMI are in charge. When it comes to parking tickets, there is no place on earth where you will get nailed faster. However, if you are a cadet and get into trouble, the ones I have met will help you out and usually act in your best interest. One of them I know personally, and they seem like a good group. They drive white Chargers.
County Police are also very good, and usually asked by the school to watch when VMI Cadets have hotel parties (You'll understand why this is good once I get to town police). I have had little interaction with them, but they don't tend to bother people and tolerated drinking (some underage) at hotel parties as long as people are not being belligerent. They drive brown and yellow Crown Vics.
Lexington Police is the worst department I have ever dealt with. They will not let you off or even not screw you over, no matter if you're a firefighter/EMS, Military, Veteran, or what have you. While W&L students probably get much more experience with this, but drinking age Cadets (me included) have been arrested for simply leaving a bar with alcohol in the blood. They have no interest in helping you, and are always driving around in state of the art blue Chargers. Avoid them like the plague. When they get you, they will try and tack on every charge they can, and would just love to see the military pull your commission. Know your rights before you get mixed up with them, don't try to appease them by being too agreeable, they'll use it against you.
Other reasons for giving it an F not related to Police include the over the top punishment system (PT's), even a minor offense (being late, dirty uniform, etc, etc) will start with five hours and it goes up. Drinking in barracks is sixty, which is a bit excessive."
College Sophomore,1,"Getting financial aid is tough, especially if you are a white male with a middle class family income. The tuition is very high and the financial aid you do receive is minuscule."
College Senior,1,Don't Eat It – We eat the same meal everyday all day.  By far the worst dining experience around.
College Junior,1,I Miss Freedom – This is a military school. EVERYTHING affects student life. I need permission to leave for a weekend.
College Junior,1,"What Dining Options? The one mess hall, Crozet Hall, has the same poor to decent food year round with the only possible variety being the 4 fast food like places in the PX. Those are terribly overpriced though and I cannot think of a single cadet that can honestly use them as a regular source of food."
College Freshman,1,"Seniors Only. Only Seniors are allowed to have cars at VMI, and even then the parking situation is crammed. There simply isn't enough room."
College Freshman,1,"Not Alot – the school is a military school and probably one of the dullest at best. it doesnt offer a high quality of living and you will be depressed for 4 years, dont come here."
College Freshman,1,it sucks. plain and simple. the food is produced by aramark. the same company that provides meals for all virginia state prisons.
College Freshman,1,Get Your Own – The only real way to get a scholarship is to go through one of the highly competitive ROTC programs. Not worth it.
College Freshman,1,The atmosphere in barracks is usually gloomy and depressing. I don't know why anyone sticks around. All the upperclassmen will tell the freshman that they themselves made a mistake in attending but do not have the courage to change.

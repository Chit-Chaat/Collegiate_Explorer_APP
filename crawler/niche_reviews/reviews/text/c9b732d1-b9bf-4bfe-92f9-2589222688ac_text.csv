Freshman,5,The online experience wasn't as hard as I thought they were very understanding and helpful. They explained how to do things and walked you through it.
Freshman,5,"They are so helpful, especially in your first year. All of my professors are pretty nice and they are very helpful. The campus is absolutely gorgeous. Walking around to your classes isn't that bad because they are all kinda close to each other."
Freshman,5,"I’m a full time freshman at Francis Marion. I have 6 classes and a lab ands two of those are online. Being that I’ve taken a gap year, my online classes are a little difficult, but my teachers offer a lot of help."
Freshman,5,"I love Francis Marion University, and the campus stuff. I am truly grateful that they accepted me, into their wonderful school."
Freshman,5,All my Professors has really help me with my lessons the best way they can. And has really been understanding and patience with me.
Senior,5,"I strongly believe that the professors at Francis Marion actually care about their students. With the current pandemic, and the transition to online learning, I am able to email my professors at any time of the day with any questions that I may have content-related, and they will be willing to help in any way that they can. The transition from classroom-based learning to online learning has not been the easiest, but I feel as though the professors are doing everything in their power to assist the students. Zoom sessions, emails, PowerPoints, etc., are all ways that our professors at FMU have been able to assist us in making the transition easier. I feel strongly that my overall time at Francis Marion, including online learning, has been able to help shape me to be as great as I possibly can be in my future career endeavors."
Sophomore,5,Francis Marion is really a good school also affordable then the rest of the university that’s in South Carolina
Junior,5,This college is such a home to me. I have made friends that will last a life time. Had professors that really have helped me become a better student and young adult. And an atmosphere that is always comforting. So happy I chose to pursue my degree here and can’t wait to make this university proud! Future RN in the making!
Senior,5,Francis Marion is a great 4 year university. I am a senior nursing student and every professor I have ever had has always been available or made themselves available when they were needed. They are each there to watch each of their student succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I love how the classes are small so everything almost feels as though it is one on one. They have amazing professors who actually help you out when needed. I also love how they have so many clubs to join and how beautiful the campus is. This school pushed me in ways that I never thought I would be pushed. I learned so many things and it really changed my perspective on learning and life. I believe that going here was one of the best choices I made in my life. Since the school is not easy, I feel as thought it is more awarding when I pass and when I fail, I learn. Either way I believe that I am bettering myself by going here."
Freshman,5,I love this University! The professors are great and they give you extra help whenever you need it. This university offers a lot of resources for students to take advantage of.
Niche User,5,Well with the time that I visited this university for my next school i enjoyed it. The teachers seemed really excited to help us achieve our dreams. The view of the campus was beautiful. I really hope I will attend this school next year and become successful.
Junior,5,Awesome school! Love the professors! Everyone is very helpful to you. Feels like the professors are there to teacher and make thing fun to learn than just to make a paycheck.
Junior,5,"I transferred from Florence-Darlington Techinally College, and I liked FDTC but FMU was a totally different experience for me. I loved all my professors, they were extremely helpful when I didn't understand sometime, they took the time to help me succeed in the course. There's always something going on campus that keeps the students and staff entertained in a way that made you want to say on campus all day to connect with people you didn't know and meet a lot of great people here."
Freshman,5,"Francis Marion university is such a welcoming university with intelligent professors that will put you, as the student, through obstacles that will only help you in the long run. The campus has beautiful scenery that is like right out of a book. The environment is calm and safe and getting involved is so much fun!"
Freshman,5,I like everything about this school . I will recommend other students to come here. It’s the most safest university school in South Carolina. This is my first year coming but so far so good. The teacher here is nice and they will help you anyway they can. All freshman have to take study hall which I think is excellent because it help us a lot . They also offer tutoring if we needed it.
Junior,5,Francis Marion is a great school but there are some things I would like to see change. One of those major things is that there are not a lot of classes offered each semester. Other than that the university is great and full of school spirit!
Sophomore,5,"Nice campus, excellent teachers, beautiful campus. I’m a rising sophomore and cannot wait to start back in a month."
Sophomore,5,It a very beautiful campus. The classes are small enough but also not to small to allow to be able to create bonds with your professors and get to know them.
Sophomore,5,"Francis Marion University is a very bright and hard working University! They welcome all of their students with open arms and are very dedicated to making sure all students succeed in their course of study. With me being an upcoming sophomore at Francis Marion, i have been taught numerous of things. My freshman year was a difficult task simply because college was new to me , but the staff and students dedicated their free time to all of the new students who attended. I was blessed to be apart of the best organization on campus , the Francis Marion Diplomats. We are basically the face of Francis Marion. Our mission is to represent Francis Marion and make all new students feel like their at home. From the beautiful scenery on Francis Marion’s campus to the very educated staff we have, Francis Marion is by far the best college that I’ve even known of!"
Junior,5,"I like the sizes of the classes. They are always small classes, which means the students can have more attention from the professors. The professors are really great. They are always really helpful, and if they can't help you themselves then they will make sure to point you in the right direction. The one thing I would change is the food. Although the food is good, it isn't the healthiest choice. I would like if there were healthier choices."
Junior,5,"It's a wonderful university that has faculty and staff always ready to help you! This university will help you reach your goal at all costs. If you are undecided about what you want for the future, the advisors that are there are very helpful in narrowing down your options. As an added bonus, the campus is a comfortable size as to where it's easy to navigate and the scenery is beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"Francis Marion is a school where you can call your fellow classmates family. I show my patriot pride each and every day by where my favorite FMU shirt. I love to give back to my school by being an Orientation Leader, a graduate of Leadership FMU and Freshman Focus, and working as an assistant for the Vice President of Business Affairs. I have such passion for this school that it is my home."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus, and the environment there is safe. The people on campus are there to help you and I think that their helpfulness is beneficial for the transition into adulthood. The professors are also one-on-one with their students, so they do not feel like a number, and the experience is more personal."
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending as a freshman, ongoing sophomore. I love the school and have had a great time here so far. The classes are hard, and there's a reason people say it's an easy school to get into but hard to get out of. This school makes me think twice about slacking off, which I love. I enjoy the campus feel and its environment."
Niche User,5,"I'm in their dual enrollment program and I love the small class size. The professors  I have had have been very personable, helpful, and fair. So far the only thing I would add is a football team to compete with a University 60 miles away."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Francis Marion university. I was so nervous the day of orientation but when I got there my nerves went away. I was separated from my parents and my anxiety was out the roof but was quickly calmed down. The leaders that day were wonderful at calming me down and making me feel so at home! I felt like I had been there for a year already! That made my first day of class so much easier. They don’t need to change anything about their orientation process. It was wonderful!
Junior,5,"Close knit campus with wonderful professors who want all students to succeed. 
A wonderful home away from home."
Freshman,5,This is an excellent school. The school of nursing has a great success rate and FMU is truly family oriented.
Freshman,5,Francis Marion is a great school with a lovely scenery and history. We have small classes where the teachers can know you better. I love this school.
Niche User,5,Francis Marion is one of the greatest schools I've seen and everything about it seems to make it the perfect school!
Alum,5,"Francis Marion University is one of the best schools in South Carolina. The professors take pride in their to help students succeed and pursue future opportunities. During critical weather conditions such as Hurricane Florence, Francis Marion always come through to help commuting students by letting them stay in the Resident Halls. The campus has a beautiful scenery."
Junior,5,"Great family like school, the professors and academics are great! The school is very diverse and they offer a couple of really good competitive bachelors programs."
Sophomore,5,"Francis Marion University is overall amazing university. Honestly, the environment and staff are caring and very helpful if you need them to be. It’s an easy campus to move around and it is pretty easy to find every building when you get familiar with the campus."
Senior,5,The overall experience at Francis Marion was amazing. It was close to home yet was still a way for me to be independent. The professors work one on one with you and can know you by name. They are there to help!
Alum,5,"FMU is home. I spent the last four years there, and I watched others fall in love with the place so much that they stayed for seven years, eight even, as undergrads. Those are the smartest, most hardworking people I know. They’ll go on to be teachers, chemists, biologists, psychologists, researchers, and managers. FMU has taken teens whom no one believed in and has given them opportunities and dreams and degrees. They’ve housed homeless students over breaks and given second chances to students who spent time in drug rehab and jail. Everyone is loved equally there and forgiven endlessly. At FMU, students can always find help and love and home."
Senior,5,"I love the professors and the size. Francis Marion is great community and there are many ways to get involved on campus. As a senior looking back on my time there I’ve loved it and I’ve loved everything I’ve done and everyone I’ve met. I’m in a sorority I’m campus and through that and Francis Marion I’ve found my bridesmaids, sisters, and I gained a family. My experience at FMU has been a great one and I wish it didn’t have to end."
Freshman,5,"Great school, very diverse. Professors are awesome and will help you with anything. The campus is very safe and the people around are willing to help the freshman!"
Freshman,5,"I am currently a Freshman at Francis Marion university. I enjoy being here and living on the campus. There are a few hardships about living on campus. For starters, the campus is located in the country of Florence meaning there isn’t much around. If you do not have a car throughout your years living on campus then you will be very bored. Weekends are as laid back as you make them . If you have work you might get that done but for the most part there isn’t much going on during the weekends. You might see a few people here and there but not really. 
We have a great academic curriculum that’s guareenteed to have you ready for your career choice. We have a fantastic nursing program. We also have a good variety of student life actitives throughout the week to make your week a little more fun."
Freshman,5,I visited Francis Marion in the fall of 2017. It is a beautiful school and the guidance counselors are excellent. I'm attending FMU in august 2018. I'm very excited about starting my college years here because it reduces my anxiety and it makes me feel at home.
Freshman,5,"I love it at FMU! The professors are great, and the student life is cool. The dorms are fun to live in, and the food on campus is awesome."
Junior,5,I like the smaller class sizes and the fact that the professors here actually take the time to get to know you and create that unique learning experience for each student
Freshman,5,I'm proud to be in a nice Clean school and feeling safe with understanding teacher safe dorm room good food and I'm learning in Francis Marion university I'm proud to be a student
Junior,5,"Classes are a great size, which allows students and professors to get more one on one time. All professors are very helpful and students treat one another with respect."
Sophomore,5,FMU campus is close-knit like a family. From the moment I moved in I felt like I was home. I've met so many wonderful people here and made great friends. My teachers were always accessible to me and offered assistance whenever I needed it.
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, amazing professors who CARE and actually want you to succeed! Small campus, but full of people with big hearts and dreams."
Sophomore,5,"Francis Marion University RN-BSN program is a wonderful program. As a 18 year ADN Nurse I had anxiety about any BSN program! The instructors were helpful, informative, and organized!"
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the open house and the friendlyness of the staff. They made me feel at home and made me want to attend the college more.
Alum,5,"I attended Francis Marion for 3 years. The professors are amazing. Each one does everything they can to help you in your academic journey to your degree, and even onward into your career. As long as the student has the desire, these teachers are determined to help you find the way. The campus is beautiful, if a little confusing in some of the buildings' layouts, but most of the courses are centralized in one or more buildings for each major. I recommend this school to anyone & everyone looking to get a well-rounded & pleasant college experience while achieving their academic goals."
Senior,5,Francis Marion is a great university with large diversity. I would like to see student life become more active.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Francis Marion University at the beginning of my sophomore year of college as a commuter student. After having spent my first 2 semesters here, I can positively say I love it here. Everyone has been so helpful during the admission process. Registration for classes can be difficult but that is true at every college. As long as you work with your adviser, you'll be fine. But most importantly, the professors have been great so far. Tough of course, but willing to help you get the most out of this opportunity and your tuition money."
Freshman,5,Francis Marion has an outstanding campus and I enjoy every bit of it. I love it's environment because there isn't as much activity and it's quiet. I'm glad to be apart of this university because it's where I'm going to be for my next 3 years.
Sophomore,5,I love the college itself. The professors are willing to help. Living in campus housing is awesome. The college is in a small knot community. This helps find life time friendships.
Sophomore,5,Francis Marion University is a great university! The professors are not impossible to work with. There are different activities to help students meet new people and to enjoy themselves. I really like how the professors are not afraid to be transparent with the students.
Senior,5,I was very satisfied with everything. I wouldn't really change nothing. I'm new to this. So maybe once i get use to it there may be some dislike.
College Senior,5,One of the best colleges I have been to.
College Senior,5,"So much diversity, different religions, different gender identities."
College Senior,5,So glad I transferred to this college.
College Senior,5,"This is a university that i had always dreamed of going to and now it is getting close to my graduation from Francis Marion University. There were many journeys along the way, some good some bad but in the end it was with how i did things, so now, i look back on those things and i have definitely changed those things and school is great!! Im seeing improvements all the time and Francis Marion is definitely a school i am proud to say i came from!"
College Junior,5,"The quality of the courses at my school are the best! The material we go over in class, along with the textbooks are very helpful. We have a variety of classes at my school and I enjoy taking as many as I can to help with my future career. The class sizes are nice and small, which allows professors to be one on one with the students and very helpful. They are always willing to answer questions and often encourage it."
Freshman,4,The entire staff is beyond helpful in getting me applied and making sure I knew where to go on my first day. I also think the people there are so happy and content with being there. I feel like I can learn a lot from my professors.
Freshman,4,I am currently taking an online class and our first three weeks were online due to COVID. My online experience was extremely positive. I feel as though I could take my time with learning things rather than cramming it into an hour class and I definitely felt more comfort with being at home and learning at my own pace.
Freshman,4,"Francis Marion is a great school, from the staff to the students that help with tours. Would change a thing."
Senior,4,"I think that the campus at Francis Marion University is very unique, and I have enjoyed my time here. The learning is one of a kind, and the professors are always willing to help in any way possible to help further your understanding, and learning. I have been involved in student life throughout my few years at FMU, and I think this has helped to shape my experience at FMU into a great one, as well. I have never stayed on campus, so I do not know much about the dorms/housing. The area that FMU is located in helps to create the atmosphere of being outdoorsy, and to create a more ""at home"" feel. I have spent the majority of my time at FMU focused on my studies for my future career path, so I have mainly just been involved in my respective clubs, but have not gone out and necessarily partied. Nevertheless, I will say that I think my time at FMU so far has been a great one, and I would not trade this experience for anything."
Sophomore,4,Doing the pandemic we had to finish the rest of semester online and it was a little bit challenging but most of it all I got through it
Junior,4,Although covid cut my true experience of the campus short the time I had there was great. The professors are well educated and work with you to understand the material.
Senior,4,I have only had one original online class which was Nurs 306 Nursing Research. It was a great class. The professor set it up nicely on blackboard where is was easy to find information needed for each week.
Freshman,4,It’s been a great experience so far at Francis Marion. I met a lot of new people and met professors that’s are there to help me do great things.
Junior,4,"I'm currently a junior at FMU. It's a relatively quiet campus, when there isn't much going on. I've yet to run into anyone unpleasant in the years that I've been here."
Freshman,4,"Francis Marion is a very excellent college to attend it very diverse, the food is a amzing . Everyone is extremely friendly and the professor help you they have tutioring her in all subject if you need it."
Sophomore,4,"In the short amount of time I have been at Francis Marion University, it has been totally different than what I was accustomed to back at home. This university is full of wonderful clubs and great organizations. The professors are great and they really try their best to help you as much as they can. I thought from touring the campus it would be boring and have nothing for the students to do, but I have had nothing but fun since meeting new people and experiencing new things.Francis Marion University is definitely a school full of great professors and tons of opportunity."
Sophomore,4,"I’m a sophomore so my experience with Francis Marion University has been good so far. I like the fact that it’s a little challenging (in a good way). Some classes and teachers will give you so in any given day and expect you to have it done on that day and at that time. I also like all the clubs and sports it provides for its study body. Something I would like to see change though, is the library selection. The books are okay but I’m currently interested in horror novels which they provide little of."
Sophomore,4,Francis Marion is a beautiful campus filled with many trees and floral arrangements. The people there are genuinely nice and it is fairly easy to meet people and make new friends.
Sophomore,4,My freshman year experience was better than expected. I met new people and made new friends and learn things I didn't know about. Francis Marion made staying on campus fun with different activities every week. Francis Marion always gives help if you need help on anything and everything; like a Writing Center and the CASA hall. Francis Marion is also close to home.
Sophomore,4,"Typical college. FMU is really affordable, I would recommend more housing options, there are only 3 options, standard residence hall, an old apartment complex, and a new one. There aren’t many on campus restaurants to choose from you either eat at the grille with a limited menu, subway, or the cafe."
Alum,4,"It's a great university that opens up a lot of opportunities, especially if you want to stay in the area.  Many of the employment opportunities nearby know that FMU is a great university that challenges it's students."
Junior,4,"The professors are always there and very helpful with classwork. Advising is also great. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the people are exciting."
Sophomore,4,"Local area is nice, most of the teachers I have dealt with are very nice. The campus does not feel the need to put lighting around housing (which is in wooded areas with lots of trees, and gets very dark at night). And according the the student handbook we are not aloud to have any kind of self defense items on us (pepper spray, self-defense keychains) but the school is away from town, and  surrounded by woods and trees."
Freshman,4,Francis Marion has a beautiful campus with a more than generous staff. The amount of opportunity available for student success is encouraging and motivating.
Freshman,4,"When it comes to attending any college they all gave their own special signature. Here at Francis Marion everyone is very open and sweet. The teachers  have an open door policy which proves to be very resourceful and helpful. All of the teachers are willing to work with you, student involvement is very high and there have been no negative incidents on campus. The sports teams are active throughout the community and everyone at FMU supports each-other and the school provides all the resources you need."
Junior,4,Francis Marion University is great to me. The university installed security cameras so campus is much safer! The only concern I have is that some professors have hard to understand teaching styles.
Senior,4,"The experience at Francis Marion University is enjoyable. Since it is a smaller university, students are able to interact with professors to form relationships that last in and out of the classroom. Voted as one of the prettiest campuses in South Carolina, the campus offers a serene and calming atmoshpere as students walk to classes or to simply enjoy leisure time. The students are able to sit and study outside near manicured gardens, and listen to the sounds of bubbling fountains. Not only that, Francis Marion has received numerous grants for different majors as well from the community and the state. Located in the PeeDee region of South Carolina, the school provides a top notch education for students who are pursuing a bachelors, masters and doctorate degree at an affordable cost. Francis Marion takes great pride in placing their graduates in jobs that reflects on the academics and merits of the university."
Sophomore,4,"It takes a lot of work to succeed at this university, but if you can find ways to standout and interact with the professors you can go far. The campus has a nice environment and isn't too large. There are several opportunities to study if you take the initiative. There are new things happening all the time and the student body is constantly changing."
Junior,4,Some professors there are helpful. The on campus food is okay. The tution is the cheapest in the state. The on campus living apartments are nice. The classroom sizes are generally small.
Junior,4,"I am coming into my 2nd year at FMU. If you're looking for a good quality education, Francis Marion is the place to be. I love my professors in my major department (Professor Baxley, Dr. Packett, Mr. Hanson). They are helpful and are always willing to answer any questions that we have. Most of the staff at FMU are very friendly. I look at FMU as more than a school, its a small community that offers young adults great chances to be successful."
Senior,4,"I think the university is taking a step in the right direction by developing their medical facilities. I think the other buildings, including the dorms could use an update. The professors are wonderful and they truly care about the students."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see the campus security change. The attacks on my campus have not be investigated nor solved. I would hope that they would want to bring the families of the young women that the tragedy fell upon some closure. I feel like it would also bring the females on campus some closure as well.
Sophomore,4,The class sizes are small which is wonderful! I am in the honors program which is a great opportunity that allows me to take interesting classes and meet equally motivated people like myself! FMU is a fairly inexpensive university that has many scholarship options and has great housing!
Alum,4,FMU is located away from the city which feels a bit safer being so secluded. They offer a lot of major options and hold a strong name influence in the surrounding areas. Professors are friendly and there's a variety of student Life involvement opportunities.
Sophomore,4,I like the fact that Francis Marion University is a smaller populated school. It allows the falculty and students to actually connect and know of one another.
Niche User,4,"My experience with Francis Marion University has been very good so far. It was easy to enroll, and the professors are very nice and understanding. The campus itself is on the smaller side, so the classes are easy to find. The professor to student ratio is very good as well, and the class sizes get smaller and smaller as you progress. Overall, I would highly recommend this college!"
Sophomore,4,"Francis Marion University is a great school.  The campus is vibrant, beautiful, and alive. The professors there are great and easy to get in contact to. The only thing I would want to see changed is the amount of events and what type of events that goes on on campus.  It is not a lot of things students can do on their leisure time to relax."
Junior,4,Francis Marion is a great school. There’s some really great professors that above and beyond the call of duty to help you (as long as you talk to them). I personally enjoy my time here.
Freshman,4,"I like how small and pretty the campus is. I also like how the size of most of my classes and being able to get one on one time with my professors, and I also like the opportunities and resources that are available to everyone."
Senior,4,The campus is clean and everyone is very nice and professional. The professors are easy to get along with and are fair graders. I only wish some of the labs were more up-to-date.
Sophomore,4,"Francis Marion University is for chill, relaxed individuals who don't mind intense classes. Student life is moderate due to a lack of student involvement on campus but it is improving. Sororities and fraternities aren't entirely big on campus due to the lack of student involvement as well but they are in the background of most events. Our sports teams are all pretty good and are gaining support from students by the years. Francis Marion's campus is nature based and has sort of a plantation home theme to go with the university being named after a Revolutionary War hero. Overall, the university is fairly decent but could improve on its student involvement aspect."
Freshman,4,It is a nice and small campus! It is very easy to learn your way around the campus and there is usually always someone willing to help just in case you get lost.
Freshman,4,"I love FMU! If you're looking for a small school with diversity and a great location then look no further! This school is for someone who is serious but yet want to enjoy a the ""litty-ness"" of college life. Like every school it has it's ups and down with professors and the finical aid office. If you're thinking about going defiantly go to the campus and check out the area near the school. You'll enjoy it !"
Freshman,4,"Overall, FMU is a great, small university. I would recommend this to anyone who lives in South Carolina. A lot of the professors are very nice and well do anything to help you out. Francis Marion has great events outside of school and athletics are very involved."
Freshman,4,"My experience here so far, is pretty good. Most of the teachers that I've dealt with are pretty caring, although now I'm am more dedicated to doing my personal research on teachers. You have plenty of access of help right on campus, such as the tutoring and writing center. Or course there's the library, 24 hour lab, and others things for enjoyment as well which include the campus church, pool, and gym. There's also the Dinner, Starbucks and the Grille where you can eat. Some thing I would say could be improved, even though some may see it as a small thing, but for me being a freshman although I may have thought I knew everything I didn't. Here they don't assign you your advisor till about 2 months into school, I feel I needed guidance as soon as possible."
Freshman,4,"Francis Marion is a great school. The professor actually care about you succeeding, the sports are not that great. If they add a football team, more students would love to go there."
Freshman,4,"I LOVE Francis Marion University. I just finished my first semester at Francis Marion. I made a lot of great friends and I love my teachers. Francis Marion is a small school that really tries to work with their students and engage them in learning. I stayed on campus this past semester, I love my roommate, and my hall mates are very friendly. I hope to spend my next seven semesters at Francis Marion."
College Senior,4,"There are numerous study areas and study options on campus. Max load of semester hours are 17 hours, so you can still work a part-time employment. If you stay focused, getting a high grade here is highly possible, even in the pure sciences like Chemistry."
College Senior,4,"Pretty straightforward on campus. Beside a few Bud Light here and there, it is not an issue."
College Senior,4,They are active in the community and the college. Nothing crazy about them.
College Freshman,4,It's great if you feel in danger the campus police will walk you to your dorm
College Freshman,4,I had fun with my application process
College Freshman,4,I have heard they have a great althetics department
College Freshman,4,I am a new freshman and from what I have seen it looks like people are really friendly to each other and are passionate about what they what to become
Recent Alumnus,4,"Francis Marion has several measures in effect to help students feel secure, such as the emergency call lights."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall, the faculty at the school will attempt to assist you the best they can."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Francis Marion University is a smaller school compared to the surrounding colleges.  Because it is smaller, there is more one on one time with the teachers and students to create a better learning atmosphere.  I see FMU faculty outside of campus, and they do not hesistate to ask how I am doing or how classes are going."
College Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my first year at school.  Not only on campus but also the community involvement and outreach.  I have been able to enjoy a varied set of experience from volunteering at the local animal shelter as part of a course to attending different performing arts shows.  Also being given the opportunity to travel - Washington DC, New York, Myrtle Beach,North Carolina, etc. funded by the university was awesome.  It is said that it is easy to get into Francis Marion but to stay in is hard.  Professors will make you work.  Looking forward to the next school year."
College Senior,4,The professors ( some) really try to make sure you are being equipped with the best education there is here at FMU and they make sure you are the best student you can be
College Senior,4,The school always try to have career fairs and its great and really eye opening because you are able to get a feel about what you want to do with your major so thats really enjoyable. And the graduation rates are always high as well so FMU definitely takes pride in their students and alumni and even in the community
College Senior,4,Campus Police really makes sure that everyone is safe. They'll let us know if they've seen any suspicious activity and they do a great job of handling issues
College Senior,4,I never have had a problem living in campus since i have been there. I like where i stay the distance/ time it takes me ti get to class
College Senior,4,FMU has a great support for the sports and crowds are almost at every game
College Junior,4,"We have career fairs, where I understand many people get jobs from. I have not been to any yet, but have only good things about it. I have also heard that our career center is very helpful."
College Junior,4,"We recently got a new athletic complex and it is really great! I have attended baseball games, soccer games, and basketball games. Our women's basketball team made it to nationals this past year and did very well. During homecoming, the fan support is top notch! We start the homecoming day off with every club and sport at school decorating golf carts and having everyone in the clubs and sports march around campus where they end at the University Center. All throughout the day there are tons of festivities as our Men's and Women's basketball teams play the homecoming game, which we won this past year. The only thing I would like different about our athletics is a football team, we have a small school so we don't have on , bu tI wish we did."
Freshman,2,"The dining hall needs longer hours.
More student activities need to happen.
Professors need to give out more assignments for students to better understand the lessons & put in grades so students know what to look forward to."
Recent Alumnus,2,Equipment never works and equipment is mostly taken.
College Junior,2,"I feel very safe on my campus, the only reason I rated this topic as it's bad, is because of the lack of effort our campus police put forth. I have only been in contact with one police officer who seemed to actually care about his job and the well being of the students on campus. Most of the police do not try and help the students at school. I have had a few different situations where I had to go to campus police about something that was going on and they were not helpful at all and never fixed nor actually tried to solve anything. Also one of the police ladies spoke very rudely to me with an attitude when I was going to her for help, and nothing ever got done. I started out as the victim and she basically told me she could not do anything to help me and tried to turn the blame around on me. Every student I have talked with about campus police have never had anything god to say about them. I am not satisfied at all with campus police! Very disappointed."
College Sophomore,2,The whole campus smells like marijuana. I've heard the police even smoke with the students. The administration does nothing about those who smoke around the dorms. Some students have asthma and the students who smoke don't care at all about those who have asthma.
College Freshman,2,I haven't seen any options except on-campus jobs.
College Junior,2,"Sometimes at night when I'm heading back from the library, I do not feel safe in the dark. There are some places on-campus that are darker than others, and we are completely surrounded by woods that can make it dangerous for females on-campus.  Plus I don't like the fact that there are not enough police boxes to hit if something were to happen."
College Junior,2,"Greek life on campus's ones make a lot of indifference between students who are not in these clubs. Although the clubs look into target the freshman and transfers as recruiting members, one major Greek club has recently gained a bad reputation because of a vandalism incident that happened last year. Since then, Greek life is still big but more strict rulings have occurred."
College Sophomore,2,There's always something that happens when there's a party
College Sophomore,2,You have many professors that just don't care to explain or help you with anything
College Junior,2,The workload is out of this world. School has become more and more of a stress for if not all than majority of students on campus. This is due to not just the workload but the professors that either do not teach well or professors who do not go at a proper pace for all students.
College Junior,2,Most professors here are grad students which everyone knows it will reflect in their teaching methods and overall effect our grades. There are not very understanding. The older professors are fair and pretty great at what they do here.
College Junior,2,I haven't experienced anything here as far as careers. They have two career fairs every academic year. They never have them at a reasonable time for students who actually have classes on that day.
Recent Alumnus,2,if they don't offer you any aid just go somewhere else
Recent Alumnus,2,You better know them personally to receive what you need. they are not a big help
College Senior,2,Off campus housing is very cheap here but not very good quality
College Junior,2,Don't really hear about many parties except word of mouth
College Student,2,I don't there should be a general course track that students should have to follow. Students should only be able to take the classes they need for their major.
College Sophomore,2,I live on campus so I can't give my full opinion.
College Sophomore,2,It could be better with more buses.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus police sucks because they never let anyone have fun on campus literally. If you want to have some type of fun, you usually do it inside."
College Freshman,2,"It has gotten better, but as of the last week of January, we've had ice storms. Snow, hail, sleet, rain. We've had it all in 3 short weeks."
College Sophomore,2,Its really hard to actually find someone to talk to about your financial aid!
College Junior,2,A lot of violence occurs here at the clubs so I do not attend.
College Sophomore,2,not a lot of joining 
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall is ok but not all that good. You get tired of having the same thing over and over again. The only other on campus place to eat is the grille and its kind of expensive.
College Sophomore,2,Im at FMU the freshmen dorms are so small i  seen smaller but these are small. Be grateful that you just got to share a room with four people
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is not good at all good luck on trying to get a good park you will definitely be all the way in the back, unless you get to campus early"
College Sophomore,2,I had a lot of trouble with my financial aid!! I also am on a athletic scholarship at FMU.
College Freshman,2,"Francis Marion is in a very small town. They do have a mall, a shopping center, and downtown. The mall is very small and don't have many stores. The shopping center is pretty good, a lot of different stores and resturantes. Downtown, Five Points, is good and a good place to hang out because that is where the movie theatre is located along with clubs and more resturantes. There isn't much of a rivary because we are the only college in Florene, but we do have competion with CCU, Coastal Carolina, Morris College, and Coker College. Those are all schools in nearby towns."
College Freshman,2,It could be way better. There isn't much to do. The student services/organizations try to host events but it's not often. Could be way better.
College Sophomore,2,It is tough to get my major in business.  It is very confusing and a lot of information to take in. There is no short cut you have to learn all the different processes and possible answers. I thank God for how far I gotten. It is definitely tough but if you set your mind to it you can do it.
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part many people are of a different race and religions.  The most common races out there is African - American and Caucasian.  A lot of these students do not act like they care about school and are just wasting their money by flunking out of classes instead of trying to pass and succeed to graduate from college. I really wish sometimes that I could afford school like them because I would not take it for granted. I would do what I have to do to get through school. A lot of people there play around too much instead of focus on graduating. There is a small group  from what I am told, of people who struggle to pay for school such as myself who try hard to do what we can to get to graduation even though the funds are not there."
College Junior,2,"There honestly isn't much to do at all in Florence. Most students have parties at the apartments where they live across the street from campus. Or they may go to the few clubs we have around, and you only have to 18 to get in. There's plenty of underage drinking that occurs as well."
College Freshman,2,If you live off campus there is one big parking area for you to park. If you live on campus you only can park by the dorms or apartments unless it's after hours.
College Junior,2,"The best majors at FMU is the nursing and education program. Everything else doesn't quite meet the standard of a good education for other specific degrees such as history, English, Political Science etc... I am trying to leave FMU that I can get a better education."
College Freshman,2,"We have our quirky professors that allow for entertaining 8:30 classes, but unfortunately, there isn't much that sets FMU apart from other schools. The best thing about FMU is the study abroad program because you can get away from FMU for a semester."
College Freshman,2,"The computers on campus, mainly in the library, are slower than molasses on a cold winter day. Printing in the library is free, but only in black and white. It always seems that when you have something to print off there is someone goofing around on the computer rather than doing educational work. Network reliability is iffy at best, and the speed is even less. The only wireless internet is in the main campus buildings; there is none in the residence halls. If a student wants to get on the internet, they have to purchase an ethernet cable and download a shoddy program that conflicts with most antivirus software, yet requires antivirus software to function. Having a personal printer is a good idea if you're a science student..."
College Freshman,2,"The newest building on campus is our nursing building...yet the fanciest thing about it is that it has a fountain. Most of the buildings on campus are the originals from when the school was established in the 70's. The University Center, has a 25m pool, and a weight room. There is the outdoor pool...but no one goes to it. Our library is large, and no one ever goes upstairs (because it's so creepy). There really aren't campus events nor is there a student hang out...FMU's campus is very small."
College Freshman,2,"On campus living is pretty limited. There are fairly new apartments, old apartments and old dorms. Spiders and other creepy crawly's run rampant throughout campus. You're lucky if you don't run into a web walking to class in the morning...at least the walk isn't far. As for the professors, some are completely insane, and others are some of the greatest people you'll ever meet. School spirit is pretty high, you can't go through a day with out seeing someone wearing something with FMU plastered on it. I wish there were more sports on campus though, all we have is baseball and soccer. The students on campus though, are the worst. Very few students actually care about their classes, and most sit in class and talk and text and are very disruptive."
College Senior,2,"My school has about 50% white people and 50% black people give or take some. My school is lacking in other races including Hispanics, Asians, and other minorities.The challenges they face with this is that most of the people who attend my school live in the same county as my school. There are not very many minorities besides African Americans in the area. The school needs to be more active in other states and areas of the country in attracting minorities of different backgrounds to attend."
Alum,1,"Go somewhere else to get the exposure and diversity you need.  Very backwards, good ole boy system.   Professors are racist and probably could’ve get a job elsewhere"
Senior,1,"The nursing program here sucks. The teachers do not help the students understand the material the way it is taught. When a teacher stands in front of class and tells the students no one passed the exam out of 50 students, something is wrong. Some students had a test bank for another class and the instructors including the Dean of Nursing knew about it and told the class they do not care. This program is also unorganized. If I knew then what I know now, I would have taken my time and my money somewhere else. Think twice before applying to the nursing school. My other instructors were great. It seemed the nursing teachers ran that part of the university like they want. I am very upset with my experience. I had higher expectations for the program and was sorely disappointed."
College Junior,1,Let me just say we have an EMS building on campus and whenever my friends or I have knocked for them it takes a average of 10 minutes for them to open the door to see what the problem is.
College Junior,1,This is the worst housing I have ever encountered. The people in charge are very disrespectful and the director uses her power to treat others a certain way. Everyone I talk to cannot wait to move off campus.
College Freshman,1,"The school is small, and the people here are very anti-social which I am not use to. I wouldn't advise anyone to attend, I'm transferring from here my second semester of freshman year."
Recent Alumnus,1,I did not enjoy FMU. Most of my friends experienced so many things at their colleges. I feel as if I did not have  a true college expereicne
Recent Alumnus,1,The alphas and kappas are suspended and we barely have any omegas. the sororities (main two) are very snobby and self centered.
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't even have a football team.
Recent Alumnus,1,The pricing is horrible. most apartments don't include anything but water! it sucks
College Junior,1,There is no sense of Greek Life on campus AT ALL
College Sophomore,1,I'm more for the city life where everything is closer.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Getting financial aid was awful! The emails and instructions are unclear. And that's only IF they give them to you. Undergrad was never this hard. Towards the end of this semester, I still hadn't heard anything and I was getting nervous so I went to the FA office to check it out. Apparently, I was suppose to accept an offer I didn't even receive any information about. I was aggravated at the time, but just happy to get it handled. "
College Sophomore,1,This school has lots of people of different back grounds its mostly white and black people. But its sad how black and white people really dont converse with each other like that. Im black and i talk to everyone black and white but i just a shame.
College Sophomore,1,Most of the greeks are is not on campus because of  dumb thing done on campus. They will not be back until 2015. Sad
Recent Alumnus,1,Computers are awful. The printers are usually broken. The art dept had the best computers.
College Senior,1,Their is really no nightlife in Florence. Their is only a few rundown bars and clubs to go to.
College Freshman,1,Sometimes you have to wait with a few other people just to use the computer. It's very frustrating and at the moment the only places with wireless internet are the university buildings and the freshman dorms.  It would be a must to have your own laptop or you might end up completing an assignment late.
College Sophomore,1,Don't Live on Campus Until You're an Upperclassmen – Only the new apartments are worth living in. All other housing is mediocre.
College Sophomore,1,"Teams on the Fmu campus are mediocre at best, and there are never big crowds that come out to support them. There is also the problem of not having a football team, which is a big deal to a vast majority of students on campus."
College Senior,1,"There is no specific Greek housing available on campus. Greek members are housed along with other residents.  Greek members at Francis Marion University are viewed as lively and socialable individuals who are very well respected. They host alot of on-campus events and socials for FMU students. However, recently several individuals were charge for hazing an individual who was beaten severly and into kidney failure during an initiation process."

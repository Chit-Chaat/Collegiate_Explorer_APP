South Seattle made everything extremely easy to achieve my goals and graduate without added stress. The classes were fantastic and the professors were amazing. I would highly recommend South Seattle to any students wishing to further their education.

Sophomore,5,"South Seattle College is the best college I have attended so far. The programs and student life opportunities are amazing and I really love the disability center, tutoring and computer labs, the library and the six-acre outdoor classroom otherwise known as the arboretum. South also has the best two-year horticulture program in the Puget Sound and I am looking forward to returning to this amazing college."
Freshman,5,The campus gives off a very warming vibe. Everyone is always so friendly and welcome to help with whatever you need.
Freshman,5,This is my first year in the US as an international student and the experience so far has been quite satisfying. I have made a lot of new friends and have developed a lot of new skills. The atmosphere is wonderful and lifechaging as well. It can be even better if there are more clubs and and big events.
Freshman,5,"This school is great! I never ran Into any problems, the diversity is something spectacular. College life on campus has always been fun for me, everyone is very involved with the school and that’s cool. I haven’t been disappointed at all. I have nothing bad to say about this school at all. Although, bringing athletics to the school would be awesome."
Sophomore,5,"Very good learning environment, teachers want you to learn and succeed. South Seattle College has a very good student life, and wants students to be involved."
Sophomore,5,I like south Seattle college campus because is a small campus with a variate or ethnicities. Everyone is willing to help each other on campus and outside. Professors take care of their students by helping them in how to succeed in life
Niche User,5,Awesome professors that help with anything you need. I've felt comfortable talking to them about issues. The location is nice and there is parking available. Its even affordable. There are some places to eat as well as a nice library and hanging out place for between or after class.
Junior,5,"I had a great experience here at South. I gained skills in leaderships and my major as well. I like South Seattle College because the instructors are really friendly, helpful, and willing to help students to achieve the goal of their career."

Graduate Student,5,"Overall, it's a great campus and a great experience. Very diverse and the teachers are great. Teachers here have taught me a lot and class sizes are small."
Junior,5,"South Seattle College has been a wonderful experience for me. The school's great diversity in students and classes really got me to enjoy my time here in South. I can tell you that I have never had a bad experience; semi-bad quarters, but thats totally due to my own doing. In college, people will see that you are the one in charge of your future, and of your education. At South, you will be provided with the necessary knowledge and resources needed to strive in your future. Go south!"
Sophomore,5,I have been attending South Seattle College ever since I was a junior in high school so it has been four years and I feel very comfortable here. There are many resources and people that are willing to help students if they need and the staffs are friendly. The instructors I have had are always really supporting as well and I'm thankful.
Sophomore,5,It was Challenging at first on how I can be the best student I can be in my Mathematics. Despite how hard I worked through my courses I yet failed. I wish there was more support for students who need support in financial assistance and a financial coach. At this point I am on academic suspension but with my ambition and drive to succeed has made more desired to becoming re-admitted back to college. 
College Freshman,5,"Throughout the last three quarters that I have been attending this school, I have encountered lots of positivity. Each professor I've had was always prepared and well organized with their lesson plan. They also encourage each student to participate and they make it a safe environment for anyone to speak up and personally I think thats very important in any environment so people could feel comfortable. The school campus is also very appealing and the student body is very friendly. If i could choose schools all over again, I would still attend South Seattle College."
College Sophomore,5,South is the best to me because there are lots of useful resources available on campus.
College Senior,5,They have variety with the classroom hours which help a lot
College Senior,5,Great option on what you can do and lead you to become success
College Senior,5,The classroom is not too big not too small. It just right for my learning enviroment
College Senior,5,helping center always available but sometime there my be a long wait or until the next day
College Senior,5,College provide great help for students and help them as much as possible
College Senior,5,I am at South so I can get my AA and transfer to a bigger university when I can major in social work.  The AA track at south is great and the councilors are very familiar with it and can help me find internships and scholarships to help pay for school or fill my schedule. I have found that TRiO on our campus is some of the best conversations and support you can find and thy are just one of the many places I will be sad to leave behind when i transfer.
College Senior,5,"I love south Seattle and i think it's a hidden gem that a lot of people don't think about when applying to schools in Seattle.  Our school is always changing and the students have a voice, weather they know it or not.  i will be here until i get my AA but even when i leave i will never forget the fun classes I've taken and the great people I've met here."
College Sophomore,5,"At South Seattle College in Seattle, Washington they offer many programs. I am currently a freshman in college and my college experience has been great so far. One of my favorite experiences at this college is that  all my professor are very helpful, and supporting to the students. I would definitely choose this school again. The environment and staff are very welcoming. The only like I dislike is that some people be smoking right in front of your face which I find pretty distributing."
College Junior,5,"the teacher and staff are friendly, helping and caring all students."
College Freshman,5,Best Financial Aid Support EVER
College Freshman,5,Professors are willing to help because it a small class
College Freshman,5,Everything is organize so it easy to find things on the school website
College Junior,5,Class sizes were small so it was great having to talk with my teachers about one on one.
College Junior,5,because of the merit based scholarship and the financial aid package I was able to pay for tuition and other resources.
College Junior,5,The students are very involved and because it's a small campus everyone pretty much knows everyone.
College Freshman,5,"I've taken on-line courses before and personally I do not like it because I'd rather spend time in class to have the interaction with a teacher and engage physically in learning. Teacher's do increase interaction by giving out phone numbers when you do take an on-line course, which is great."
College Freshman,5,"In the library you sign into your school account, and within that account you get 300 free papers to print out lectures for class.  This is both helpful in that this will save us time and money."
College Freshman,5,The library is closed late to accommodate evening classes and people who work during the day.
College Freshman,5,We have a horticulture section on our campus along with the largest Chinese garden in Seattle ( and its still growing!) The garden is a great landscape where you can escape to study and or learn about the many endangered plants grown there.
College Freshman,5,We are a very diverse college who are kind to each other in both academically and socially.
College Freshman,5,"If you need financial aid, the advisers counsel on you what you need before the deadline. The amount of cost per class is average and similar to other colleges, not private ones."
College Freshman,5,Their websites are easy to follow. We get text messages on what event is going for the week.
College Freshman,5,The teachers I've taken are all enthusiastic about teaching and making sure that we understand concepts. They truly want to share their knowledge with us.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity, people from all over the world attend my school and everyone gets along I have never witnessed any issues between races or religions it is a bit of a utopia."
College Sophomore,5,They keep all job postings updated. Great for referrals.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Alot of support of student academic help. I have support from more than 4 departments that help me with tutoring, academic planning, advising, and mentoring."
College Senior,5,My experience has been great. I chose this school because I have heard from employees in the career I chose said this school had a excellent culinary program.
College Junior,5,"I love the campus resources. I always use the wi-fi to connect to my itouch, it's convenient to research things when I'm at a desk and need to find some information or check some information. The computer lab is open upstairs and there's the library lab available downstairs. The computers usually get taken up pretty quickly but it's easy enough to find an available computer. I have a page limit for printing, but I normally don't reach my maximum."
College Junior,5,The library is very useful. I always go there in the morning to work on my homework before classes. The student life center is there where people can get actively involved in clubs and activities.
College Sophomore,5,"everyones really nice and helpfull, teacher are great and the learning is fun"
College Sophomore,5,I am happy that i am attending this school. I like waking up everyday and knowing that i am going to learn something new every time i walk inside a classroom.
College Freshman,5,"Game Room, Library, and Wight Room! A great plus about having a great library is the fact that you can find a nice place to study and get stuff done so you can go workout and play ping pong!"
College Senior,5,"This school caters to many immigrants and foreign students, so you see a lot of diversity in the student body.  Also, it has many non-traditional students of many ages.  If you want to find someone like you, you can.  Or, you can meet a bunch of people from all over with some very interesting new viewpoints.  I like it."
College Sophomore,5,"I was on top of everything I got everything done and it went smooth, got my finacial aid check the first day we could."
College Sophomore,5,"It is very easy to find your crowed the people here are amazing, everybody is so friendly."
College Junior,5,"Student Services-CLIC – SSCC has an excellent Student Services program. It provides the most updated resources for students, has a gym, and provides an abundance of extracurrium actives off campus that help broaden student's life experiences and contributes to whatever their course of study might be."
College Senior,5,VA Program – The VA program here at South is constantly staffed by professional individuals who have made my time at South memorable. Whenever I had a problem with degree requirements they made sure that I found a class that would qualify as a class I needed.
Graduate Student,4,"Online learning at South Seattle is very smooth with most professors, and has been integrated into many courses well."
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers are very supportive. Most of the administrative staff is very supportive. Where teacher support was lacking I have consistently found wonderful help within the student body itself.
Sophomore,4,"The basic GE classes were so easy I was uncomfortable.  The more advanced classes were reasonably challenging. There is a lot of interest in supporting students,  including making sure they have enough food and resources to balance their life."
Junior,4,"I'm currently attending this college. Considering my previous history with it (this is during COVID) it had some very excellent professors and a decent campus. A different taco truck would come to campus every day but on a schedule, so on Fridays X taco truck would come. Other than that the recreational activites are minimal but there's more than enough support for educational support."
Sophomore,4,At south Seattle college every stuff is very helpful and easy to contact. Baby est community college I been to so far.
Alum,4,Small campus and some buildings are very old but some are brand new. I was sad that they took away the bakery because the pastries are delicious and freshly made by culinary students. Lots international students and local students as well.
Niche User,4,"Based on what I witnessed at South Seattle College, I can say it is an above average school, thought not everything is perfect within itself. What I would most like to see improved is the campus food, athletics, and the housing. This way, the school can be brighter and better than ever for future students and year to come. Overall, it's still good on average. It isn't perfect, but its flaws are not what defines it. It still remains and above average and a pleasant school for students and staff."
Sophomore,4,It’s pretty good one of the best schools I’ve attended. The teachers are good and the learning is good.
Niche User,4,"I've been studying here for a year so far as an international student and I really like the education I've received as well as the people I've met. The instructors I've had so far ranged from ""good"" to ""amazing and inspirational,"" being dedicated to their work and supportive of students; I’ve had some great office hour conversations with a few of the tenured instructors. The tutors, counselors, and other staff members such as student life organizers and those who work at the Center for International Education have also been very friendly and helpful. The student body is very diverse and I've made friends with people from different ethnic groups. The campus is beautiful, too!

It would be great if the student clubs were more active and if the cafeteria can offer more food options during non-lunch hours. Others have also said they wish there are fewer high school students attending classes here (via a dual enrollment program). Overall, though, I've really enjoyed my experience here."
Niche User,4,"The professors here are great . And the school is cultures diversity , you will easily making friend here. And the campus are beautiful , they’re have a Chinese garden next to the College parking that you can actually do a picnics."
Senior,4,"The time I have been in U.S. is the time I have studied in South Seattle College. Three years, it is not too long or too short to get many experience in SSC. I like the way CIE office supports any international student like me, and opens many event to help us learn more about American culture. My major is Business, so I have taken some business class with awesome instructors. I could see how enthusiasm they are when they lecture us. Otherwise, there are a few things I want they change to help us study better. I love doing my homework, quiz in library, but there is limited time. They close the library at 7:30 pm from Monday to Thursday, and at 4:00 pm on Friday in Fall quarter. I think I need more time in library to complete my homework. Besides, I got some classes end at 9 pm., but I do not know why they did not allow me to stand there to wait for the bus come. Actually, I did not want to go outside because there were too cold. Hopefully, some people will have the opinions like me."
Sophomore,4,"My only qualm with this college is that there should be sports clubs or teams, the only one I've ever heard of here is the boy's soccer club. There should be more opportunity to become involved in sports. Also! A choir club or a singing group would be fabulous as well, since I'm a singer myself, I'm sure other people who love music and love singing will love a club like that. Other than that I really enjoy coming to classes here, it's a peaceful campus that is very close to my home."
Sophomore,4,"South always welcomes students from everywhere around the world. At South, students can freely express themselves regardless of races, sex, religions,.. The Center of International office holds many activities during the quarters, from volunteering to playing games. South campus is the largest campus in the Seattle Colleges. My instructors here at South are really friendly. They always smile to their students while walking around the campus. 
I've learned many different cultures from my friends here. They are from Mongolia, Korea, Japan, China, Bangladesh, America,..
To me, South is the great place!"
Freshman,4,"South Seattle College has a great amount of diversity from all around the world and has a great welcoming when you come to study here. The advisors are very friendly and were always willing to help me with picking classes. I enjoyed most of the classes that I took here, but still think there could be more added to increase the variety of courses to choose from. Overall, I believe that this is a good college for people looking at two year degrees before pursuing a four year university because it has smaller classroom sizes with professors willing to spend extra time to teach you the material outside of class to help you succeed."
Sophomore,4,I love south seattle. It's a great place to start off your college career or even get a bachelor's degree in many different subjects. The campus is beautiful and full of diverse and interesting people. The neighborhood it is in is amazing. Its really close to Alki beach and the Alaska Junction. There is tons of parking and alternative transportation options.
Sophomore,4,"South is a small local college great for running start students or returning students. I think that this college is a great option for all. There are many opportunities for people to get involved in campus life including; politics, clubs, events, committees and much more. It's a very diverse school with people from all around the world and many different backgrounds. I particularly recommend talking with the advising center for scheduling classes and also finding out more info about the services the college offers. I high recommend going to the MAST studying center, lots of tutors and other fellow students ready to help."
Sophomore,4,"I like the programs provided at my college, there are many programs students can pick from. I just wish that they would stay on top of their programs. What I mean by that is that my program was almost taken away since the school was low on requirements, funding, professors, students, etc. However, the teachers and advisors worked hard to keep me in school and within my program. I've appreciated the help that they have given me with the program, financial needs and more."
Sophomore,4,"I attended this college for my freshman year on a all tuition paid scholarship called the 13th Year Scholarship that South Seattle College provided. Without their generosity, I would have had a much harder time trying to attend college. The professors and staff are extremely helpful and will do what they can to help its students. I got the pleasure of working with the Foundation Board and got to see how the college staff worked to support its students. Overall, I had a great time attending South Seattle because of how supportive they were and how well I worked with them."
Junior,4,"South is a great place to start off your transfer degree or learn a trade. They are very focused on making people comfortable no matter your gender, religious beliefs, or ethnicity. They have many good tutoring services avalible. I have overall enjoyed my time there. Of course there are some teachers that i didn't learn well from, but I also encountered some really amazing teachers as well."
Freshman,4,"I have not been at south for very long, but I love it! The campus is small but very beautiful. Almost everywhere you go there are fun plants and interesting student artwork for display. across the South parking lot, there is a Chinese garden, with many paths and plants, the students in the horticulture program work to make it a very beautiful little park! The only problem I've ever come across at south is the Financial Aid office, I have spent a long time waiting to receive an award letter, however besides some office problems, South is a small and amazing school to attend!"
College Sophomore,4,Many classes are available for students who need transferring classes.
College Sophomore,4,We can be connected from far distance as long as we are at home.
College Sophomore,4,"At South, there are many advisers available to help looking for job, careers and transferring."
College Sophomore,4,The services at South are awesome. They always keep school clean and clear.
College Sophomore,4,I have attended South Seattle College for almost 2 quarters. The courses at South are really helpful for me to build my foundation before my transferring to University of Washington which is my ideal school. The professors at South are really patient and devoting to students. They are always pleased to help me when I got stuck.
College Sophomore,4,"My school has a variety of rooms which help us improve our science subjects for computer science. There are many modern rooms which are lab rooms, chemistry room, and computer rooms."
College Sophomore,4,My school is a impressive school in West Seattle. It was built on a high top of a hill which used to be a big trash dump. South Seattle College is 87-acre campus that offers students students a lot of vacant parking. There are mountains surrounding my school which lets us admire a beautiful view to downtown Seattle up to the skyline. These unique things about my school make me unforgettable.
College Senior,4,It help me to learn my new thing in life. The professor have great knowledge toward real life topic to tell the student
College Senior,4,I haven't switched to any other schools so i don't know how the transfer process is at South but i can speak to the class set up and times.  I like putting my classes in order by the hour so i don't have a break in between so i stay awake. Sometimes the classes I want are a the same time and that's kind of annoying but it always works out in the end.
College Senior,4,I have never done a class that was online completely because i love the in class conversations that spring up but the hybrid classes i have had were good.  We use Canvas on our campus and it's usually pretty good with it's interface.  It is very easy to understand if you know how to work computers.  I sometimes miss on paper assignments because i feel like teachers can leave comments a little bit easier but i know they have a lot to grade and online grading helps with that so I'm fine with it.
College Senior,4,I personally am very happy with y current job and so i haven't used the job services on campus but i have referred people there and helped plan job fairs fr them so i know they are very extensive and they are even open to the public.  I really like this about our school because it shows we can help the community around us and we aren't just i a bubble all by ourselves.
College Senior,4,I wish there was a little bit more variety all year round.  Fall has the best options but i can only do so much at once so sometimes i miss out on a class i want to take.  I really like the class sizes.  None of my classes have had more than 35 people in them and usually there are less than 25.  All of the teachers teach differently here at South and i really like that because everyone is different in the world so it gets you used to the real world in a smaller setting.
College Senior,4,They have morning and night classes that makes it convenient for people that work
College Senior,4,I had no problems with online course. Canvas is an easy method to submit assignments
College Senior,4,There are very few that are hard to comprehend whether it is the teaching methods or strong accent.
College Senior,4,There are lots of programs in the school to help you go beyond.
College Senior,4,They have enough to get you started. The first 2 years are broad and they have it all.
College Senior,4,"It is a good experience. The school is pretty small, but there are not as many courses and classes do fill up fast."
College Senior,4,"My school has the best teachers who are sociable, professional and caring. It also provides me a lot of helpful experiences, friends and necessary skills to pursue my educational goals."
College Sophomore,4,Great teachers. Loved it here. I learned a lot and love that it's more affordable than other options.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a nice, affordable alternative to pricier universities. I am able to learn a lot from great teachers. Very enjoyable experience so far."
College Senior,4,The teachers and the students  have been the most helpful! Its almost like were all family.
College Freshman,4,The program here is great
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is great it is close to my house. The teachers are always their when i need them. The tutors their are excellent.  The o ly thing I font like is the class mates they are so rude and only care about them selfs. I wish they were more helpful.
College Junior,4,The career center is very useful and helped a lot
College Junior,4,They have various internship and job opportunities that they suggest almost everyday. That also goes with daily scholarship reminders. Since there are small classrooms I can definitely learn better when the teacher is helping me one on one instead of it being a lecture in a lecture hall with five hundred other people.
College Junior,4,"The professors are very caring, the class registration process was very easy as far as I'm concerned. Off course with the help of faculty and they have various study options for incoming freshmans and many programs that they offer outside of school."
College Freshman,4,"Every college offers different classes and their own availability times. Heck from a college to South Seattle Community College because of the increase in international students. Classes were always full, while at South the classes were decent and I like the classroom size."
College Sophomore,4,I have not used any of these services but have heard from others that they are run very well.
College Sophomore,4,"My experiance has been great, my nursing asst. and english classes have been excellent I discovered a knack for writting  non fiction I didn't know I had."
College Sophomore,4,The diversity on campus is great I feel like the whole attends my school it is a very culturally balanced student body.
College Sophomore,4,"Except for one instructor all my teachers have been top rate, very caring and inspiring. "
College Sophomore,4,"I'm still taking my pre requisites so do not have experience with my major classes yet, I have given my self a heavy work load with hopes of getting into the nursing program as soon as I can. I have completed the nursing asst. program and the class was great the clinical rotation was challenging and well run."
College Sophomore,4,"computers are good once in a while it is hard to get online with there wifi,  printing is good but can get crowded, the copy machines are very affordable."
College Sophomore,4,"The fitness center is great and has a variety of equipment, I like the library and its design there are a lot of nooks to study in away from the main area, the staff is wonderful. The campus is super diverse and I have become friends with many people I most likely would not have meet in daily life outside school. I haven't spent much time in the student center but I have enjoyed the student and faculty art shows that are presented there. I like my school a great deal."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I have never used the schools computer labs. However, when I use my laptop at school I use their wireless internet connections. The signal in the campus is reliable and it is constant throughout all the buildings."
College Junior,4,"There are great places to be in school before and after class. They have facilities for studying, socializing, sports, food, and most important to relax. The rooms are well spread across the campus and are easy to locate."
College Sophomore,4,library opened for most of the day. stocked with computers
College Sophomore,4,Technology is very easy to access. saved me commuting money
College Sophomore,4,I had taken the 3 credit version of this class which gave me a good idea of what to expect. The teacher quickly responded to emails and if necessary could make a scheduled in person meeting. but it is essential to constantly check in on the website to stay up to date to keep your grade up.
College Junior,2,there are people who get paid to help you but they really dont help
College Junior,2,The computers do not work sometimes or if they do work they freeze all the time
College Sophomore,2,"I do not qualify for aid which has been hard on me, I hope that will change this quarter I miss out by a few % over on income but have dropped some work this winter."
College Junior,2,There are fees for any printing that is needed in campus and the computer labs and computers themselves are somewhat outdated.
College Junior,2,It is harder to apply and receive financial aid based on my living situation. Not very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,2,Student involvment is great area where it lacks as well as leadership. Definitely needs help and a clean up of poisoned staff that suck out the happiness of students
Recent Alumnus,2,"For night classes or online there is no one available bookstore hours are difficult for those who work late, and the response is slow if you get a response at all."
College Junior,2,i really love what i'm learning but i wish we had more time with our chefs to learn more then we do. there is a lot of standing around and waiting in lines. also a lot of mistakes are made because the chefs aren't around.
College Junior,2,"I feel that the tuition is far higher than the education deserves. I paid $1,500 dollars to take 17 credits, a number that seems pretty astronomical for the education I'm receiving."
College Freshman,2,"The school has computers in different locations. But the one thing that gets on my nerves is the WiFi. I may log on to the wifi, but then that was just for one location until you leave that day. The log-on to the SSCC wifi screen will constantly pop up ON ITS OWN whenever I check my email, look at the weather, get on the internet, use Google Maps, etc. It does it every day and sometimes it doesn't work. I cannot connect to any wireless printers so I must have a ""Thumb Drive"" and the speed of the schools wifi is faily decent but it can be very slow also."
College Freshman,2,"I am a Dance Major. I find difficutly when I try to look for classes that are transferrable to Cornish. I am not trying to waste any time or money at SSCC while I complete my final year. I am taking classes that have almost no importance to me and I am not taking any dance courses. I cannot find the ""want"" to come to class, but I attend anyway. I am not a negative person, in fact I am easily positive, and I would love school except it is not the school I wish to attend anymore."
College Junior,1,"I hate how the computers never work, when i needed a counselor to talk to there was no one there to help me. all the counselors do is sign you up for classes, they do not have enough time to help you figure out what class is best for you."

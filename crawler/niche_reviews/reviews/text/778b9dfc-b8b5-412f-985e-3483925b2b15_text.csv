Freshman,5,"Given that Long Island University has taken many precautions, I attend all classes in person. I have friends and teammates who take online classes and have heard that all teachers are flexible and understanding. The online lectures are well thought out and very organized."
Junior,5,Long Island university has a wonderful campus. The medical programs are excellent. The staff are nice and helpful
Junior,5,It was okay and good because there was no other options they made it so that students can continue their education.
Junior,5,I am begininng liu bk this fall and the school is located af a good neighborhood and the school is beautiful. I am so excited to start my academic journey in this school!
Alum,5,Professors tried their best to keep up with the curriculum during the unfortunate covid quarantine. Some of the workload was a bit much for single parents that had to take time to teach their children school work as well. It's a very diverse school with a lot of opportunities for different people if you're looking for a school with a very inviting environment. The school has a variety of clubs and sports teams to join for those interested in socializing and expanding their circle. They’re also great as extra curriculares.
Graduate Student,5,I love that the campus is located near a mall and lots of restaurants. It gives me a chance to relax when I have time In between  classes.  I also love that the campus is loaded with resources.
Graduate Student,5,"I haven’t taken any online classes with them yet but from what I hear from other students, their online classes were easy to follow and understand"
Junior,5,"I enjoy the experience the ride to the school is nice however, the area is unsafe at certain times of the day. The school is excellent and the professors are very helpful. They are willing to take out time to help you."
Graduate Student,5,"I love it! My pharmacy department is kind, and always willing to help. The campus is amazing, and the teachers really care. Only downside is that it’s very expensive!"
Freshman,5,"After moving from Brooklyn to Florida, I knew I was going to be on my own when it came to applying for colleges, doing all paper works and just having all requirements set for when I start school. But after reaching out to LIU Brooklyn, everyone I met has given me hand. I am able to do work study, and become a student ambassador. When choosing my classes and dorm, I had help from those in the promise office and enrollment office. Even the deans where so kind and helpful. I cant wait to be a part of LIU. They are the reason I was able to complete, step by step my college process."
Junior,5,LIU Brooklyn has great professors and faculty is amazing and helpful! It would be great if they worked on their campus life/housing because the dorms are very tight and not much to do on campus. We need more clubs and activities on campus for students that are commuters and also living on campus.
Sophomore,5,The faculty is very friendly and cares about your success after college.  I went to the Open House and I was very excited about continuing my college career at LIU!  The campus is very safe; it's gated and has security officers always on-duty.  The campus has affiliations with top companies that are recognized worldwide.  This university definitely helps the student think and work on a global scale rather than just helping them get a job.
Freshman,5,"I think LIU Brooklyn is a great college. I'm currently going to be attending it this fall, and I feel very welcome. Anytime I've needed help, staff has graciously gone above and beyond when assisting me. The campus is very diverse, and the major I chose (pharmacy) has a great return."
Freshman,5,Great academics. Helpful staff and diverse student body. Professors care how you are meeting your goals.Advisors take great interest in your academic success. Sports and teams are excellent.
Graduate Student,5,It is a wonderful close knit school. You feel as if you are with family and this is especially true being part of the honors program.
Graduate Student,5,"LIU is a good school, its easy to get to and very diverse. Im going for my MPA and i love my classes and the faculty."
Sophomore,5,"I love it at LIU Brooklyn. They make sure that you do the best and they see the potential in you. There are many great programs and there is a wide variety of majors and minors given. Everyone makes you feel right at home and you'll never want to leave. You create lasting memories, meet new friends and make lasting experiences."
Freshman,5,Wonderful college experience! Professors are passionate about their teaching and encourage you to do better. They encourage you to get out of your comfort zone and talk with other students.
Senior,5,"I like the diversity and how professors care for their students, I would like for them to post grades faster"
Junior,5,"Long Island University is highly accredited for its vast programs in the sciences and health care. I am a pharmacy student and I will admit that the curriculum is very educational and creative. There are many organizations that a student can be a part of. Also, the professors are kindhearted and generous in their time to assist students with help. The staff is always available for help even at the most inconvenient hours. I have been attending this university for over 2 years and would highly recommend it as a top choice when choosing where to attend college. LIU Brooklyn offers over 200 majors and many professional programs. The safety is also highly rated since there is security around every corner and the campus is gated so that only students with a valid LIU ID can enter."
Freshman,5,"My experience at LIU Brooklyn has been a great experience this summer. I've met a lot of new people from all over that are going to be incoming freshmen like myself this fall. The administrators are cool, teachers actually care for the students here in Brooklyn and actually want them to achieve and strive for excellence. One thing I'd wish they change is the tuition. That way things can be more affordable for those that aren't fortunate enough."
College Junior,5,It is in the heart of Brooklyn where there is so much diversity and new things to learn everyday. Classes are small and the teachers want to see you succeed!
College Student,5,"My English 14 professor was the best because he would help us write a better , essay , give us feedback on what needed to be change in the essay that I wrote and it was really helpful"
College Student,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Student,5,The Athletes at my college is the best because you meet new people and also you learn about a good team work
College Student,5,"Long Island Unversity is the best because your open open to a new foundation and making friends that will help you is good , also if your struggle in a certain subject area there's tutors there to assist you and also the professors are really nice"
College Junior,5,I feel safe on campus. There are active security guards and the campus is enclosed with gates.
College Freshman,5,"I actually attend Long Island University Global, which is four years abroad and it's mostly experiential learning-based, which is great."
College Junior,5,I love the yoga classes and pool!
College Junior,5,everyone can have a good time
College Junior,5,"they know the law, inside and out"
College Junior,5,the fastest way to pass your classes and also to earn extra money for tuition
College Junior,5,best area to get schoolwork done on campus
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is the greatest. Close to school. Don't need to get up early. Very social roommates and classmates. Paying for it is on the expensive side but its very convenient. Always clean. Janitors keep the bathrooms clean in addition of clueing up after myself.
College Freshman,5,"Great security, always feels safe."
College Freshman,5,everyone in the school is different and accepts minorities highly.
College Freshman,5,Accounting program is the best and people can easily find internships and have a minimal amount of work. The accounting society does its best to do the work.
College Freshman,5,"people work hard to get straight A's. the professors expect high quality work and it is very easy to complete, i am not given much work to do."
College Freshman,5,the teachers/ professors always explain the work and will help you in any chance they have with you. There is barely any work in my major but there are plenty of internship opportunities if you apply for some.
College Junior,5,There is food everywhere around campus ranging from dirt cheap to Michelin star restaurants. There are plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood that offer great food at decent prices and no matter what time it is there is always something open. The variety gives students a chance to try dishes from all over the world and experience something new.
College Sophomore,5,"As an honors student, I can honestly say that the academics is challenging to the extent that it improves you for the best. The professors are extremely helpful and the curriculum is broken down to result in our success in our prospective fields."
College Sophomore,5,"LIU Brooklyn is an excellent example of the New York's melting pot. We have students here that have roots from several parts of the world. There are several different languages spoken here, diverse dress styles, and religious opinions. We are always keen to know about one another. This has to be one of my favorite things about LIU."
College Sophomore,5,"We are a four year study abroad program that travels all around, intensely learning about the world."
College Sophomore,5,Super interesting classes taught by great professors.
College Sophomore,5,The best experience of my life.
College Sophomore,5,I wold love to go into the peace corps after college.
College Senior,5,Internships are always given to us. The pay is ok but the experience is priceless
College Senior,5,My program is great. I've learned a great deal thus far.
College Senior,5,There is a great diversity on campus.
College Senior,5,It was a very easy process and my advisor is easy to talk to.
College Senior,5,I am in a great program. I enjoy it because I have a passion for marketing. The curriculum allows me to double major with management and the workload is fair.
College Senior,5,I love marketing and am glad that it is my major. I get to meet different people being a marketing and management major.
College Senior,5,The school is located in the heart of Brooklyn. Students can easily travel to their destination because trains and busses are located nearby.
College Junior,5,"We are in NYC so every kind of club whether your gay or straight, black or white, there is a social scene for everyone."
College Student,5,"All the main subway lines are within walking distance of the school, so there's always a way to get home.  I commute through public transportation everyday and it's very easy to decide to switch over on a different route if one train is not running."
College Junior,5,"Very diverse campus. As a person that does not belong to a minority group, I actually think most students are minorities."
College Sophomore,5,Global college lets you travel the world giving you the opportunity to become a global citizen. Learning about cultures and adapting to the language and the people around you.
College Sophomore,5,Our global centers are great and the teachers are always providing us with everything that's going on right in Costa Rica.
College Freshman,5,Alot of Students have took my intended major
College Freshman,5,We have restaurants all  over near my campus so we are good on food
Junior,4,"There were glitches in the system at first but they were quickly dealt with. As for me, I prefer in-class learning because it is hard to sit and look at the computer screen will the professor lecture for 2-3 hrs. In light of the pandemic and because this online learning is new it was an adjustment. More interaction might be more effective. Overall it was good."
Freshman,4,"When I first moved in, I had an extremely difficult time with finances and you billing situation. Within 24 hours I was able to work with my school and figure out the best payment plan for me and my family. I enjoy the city of Brooklyn, my campus’s welcoming environment and my classmates. During uncertain times, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Long Island University was able to ensure safety and health regulations with the utmost care and responsibility."
Niche User,4,Online learning has been a challenge but the professors have been working diligently to ensure we're getting the best teaching that we can get. I'm currently enrolled in LIU's nursing program and it has been a struggle in terms of our online clinical but online lecture is not so bad.
Niche User,4,LIU Brooklyn has been home to me for 6 years. I was in their Honors Program and being in the program made college life so adventurous. Now I'm in their Nursing program and it has been quite the challenge but nonetheless it has been an enjoyable one.
Junior,4,LIU has a lot of different people and are always eager to help each other. Things they can improve on is more student activities.
Junior,4,LIU has a lot of different people and are always eager to help each other. Things they can improve on is more student activities.
Alum,4,Professors were great! very in tuned with the students and understood everything we had to say. very hands on with students and taught well.
Sophomore,4,Nursing professors are interested in students and providing them with the best and up to date education.
Junior,4,Beautiful campus and wonderful professors. Friendly peers and quality education. Great food and shopping choices around neighborhood. Only downside is too expensive.
Junior,4,"Some professors took longer to adjust than others but overall, most of my professors were extremely wary of the struggles students were going through. Professors were very supportive and made it easier for students."
Junior,4,It is a great university that caters to all my needs. I especially appreciate that we have help with writing if we need it.
Freshman,4,If you are pursuing a Medical degree this is your school. Nursing and Pharmacy programs are top notch. There are many security guards and staff is very helpful.
Senior,4,"Long Island University has a great location and some really strong academic programs. I am grateful I was able to make the move from California to New York so smoothly. I have achieved so much since attending college here and I'm excited for what the future holds after LIU. Although I am pleased with my experience so far, I feel every institution has areas in which they can improve."
Graduate Student,4,"One of my favorite experience in Long Island University(LIU), has been the kindness and knowledge of the Instructors. Similarly, the enthusiasm and dedication other students have helps me to keep myself motivated. However, I feel that LIU has insufficient staff. The student center offices are always full of students with just to worker to resolve student's issues."
Freshman,4,"Long Island University has variety of sports and clubs for students to participate in. The professors at LIU are very helpful and engaging with the students. I really admire LIU's 6 year Pre pharmacy program that allows student to save time and focus on the courses they really need to become Professional Pharmacists. I would appreciate if LIU offered student more scholarship and financial aid opportunities. Overall, LIU is a great school!"
Niche User,4,It's a very diverse school with a lot of opportunities for different people if you're looking for a school with a very inviting environment. I loved going there and I'm pretty
Freshman,4,"I love it here, the people are amazing, and it’s always a lot of fun, We have great professors and bad professors as well so know them well. It’s just too expensive"
Freshman,4,"The promise coaches at LIU Brooklyn are extremely helpful and accommodating. Any questions that I had going into my first semester were answered extremely clearly and quickly. For example, I had questions regarding AP classes that I took in high school and wanted to know how to send over my credit for the classes to LIU. In addition, they also helped me plan out my class schedule for my first semester. They sat down with me and showed me step by step how to navigate the system as well as broke down how to use my liu and blackboard account. They were highly accessible and accommodating to be reached as I was able to walk in and set up an appointment in class or contact them through email in which I always have an extremely fast reply. Overall, the experience was very positive, and the Promise coaches truly look to assist in any way they can."
Freshman,4,This is my first year and second semester at this school and I’m having a good time so far. I was able to get a 3.8 gpa in my first semester and I was able to meet new people.
Freshman,4,LIU Brooklyn has a great array of teachers. Some of which act like family more than educators which is a huge bonus considering the difficulty of college.
Freshman,4,Hardly ever a dull day; always an activity going on in between classes. Would like to see higher quality of lavatories considering the amount of tuition paid. Nice food selection overall.
Senior,4,"LIU Brooklyn has many great professors that are there for you and will help you succeed. The tuition is pretty high and admissions is at times very disorganized. However,  this school has a lot of programs and degrees to offer."
Freshman,4,I like that almost all professors are willing to stay behind even not during office hours to help you if you need help.  Also the class sizes are generally between 25-36 students which allows you to know your professors better.
Junior,4,"Well I’m a transfer student at LIU , the school is very big and the dorms are very nice. However, the admissions are a bit disorganized due to many students transferring. Rate for Professor is a good website to know about the reviews of the professors."
Senior,4,"I love the campus, and most of the professors are very good, however, the school can be very unorganized when it comes to scheduling for classes and clinical."
Alum,4,I had a pretty good experience here. I went for my Masters in Clinical Psychology. It was only a 2-year program so while I did make some connections I did not leave with the same community as I did from my 4 year undergrad program. The professors are nice and well informed. I don't regret attending.
Alum,4,"Long Island University in my opinion was a great choice to attend. I majored in Nursing and my advisors were helpful from my pre-professional to professional stages. However, LIU's school of nursing can be disorganized regarding clinical placement. On the other hand, we are the best advocates to our education, and Long Island University supports that,"
Senior,4,"Long Island University is in a very attractive location ( Downtown Brooklyn, New York). The persona of the university fits well with the New York lifestyle."
Junior,4,"Overall Good school, campus, teachers, location, but very very expensive! Very close to public transportation, food restaurant and stores"
Senior,4,"LIU is a good school but not a great school, it still needs to go that extra mile to become great. Though it does have good individual programs don't come here  if you don't know what your going to do, you'll just end up wasting money."
Junior,4,"LIU Global's experiential learning supplemented by in-class work is wonderful in creating well-rounded students majoring in global studies. The school's downfall is the constant changes and busy staff at the home base in Brooklyn. However, the staff at each center are eager to assist students and the small class sizes allows each student personal attention."
Junior,4,Great health professional programs. The school is obviously costly $$$. Great location in downtown area.
Junior,4,I like that there is always help readily available should I be confused on any subject. I admire the professors and can always rely on someone to help me either academically or career-wise.
Junior,4,I loved the diversity of the school and the friends that I had made. I also liked the classes offered at the college and the easiness of getting around the campus. One thing that I would have to say is that I would like it if the professors had more structure. Although I did learn a lot of useful information I did feel as if some professors were all over the place with their lectures and a little disorganized.
Graduate Student,4,The professors are helpful and knowledgeable. Tuition is high like most other private schools. It is wise to know the programs beforehand.
Junior,4,"I think the Brooklyn campus is great.  The location currently convenient to other transportation, shopping, dining, entertainment, parking, medical treatment, police assistance, etc..  The campus maintenance appearance to be a good consisted level.  Although, they do need to maintain a better cleaning environment for seating areas and eating areas.   So far, the furniture is a bit unclean."
Sophomore,4,Liu is a great college there is a lot of diversity and you will find a support system. The counsellors and the security guards are very friendly and nice. There are many different clubs and extracurricular activities on campus almost every week.
Senior,4,"In this college I find that the professors I had thus far were amazing. I think that there is a big difference between this campus and LIU Post in the sense of it being cleaner, more calmer, more computers in the library, a larger library and parking. I wish that LIU Brooklyn was the same as LIU Post but sadly it is not. The benefit of going to LIU Brooklyn is that the subway station is right across the street."
Junior,4,My experience at Long Island University has been smoothed so far. Classes were easy to register and professors have been nice and helpful. The library is a bit small and needs a better computer room with more printers.
Sophomore,4,At LIU BK I like the location! The school is located in downtown and everything is close by! This school is mostly known for the medical and business field. Every other major is basically pointless. The school is expensive but it matters on how you use you opportunities and resources wisely. Overall the dorms are pretty big than SUNY colleges and their are no parties on campus unless your on the sports team or in some way affiliated with them.
Sophomore,4,"The reason my year went well is because of the students, campus activities, and the care the staff has shown. A primary reason for my increase in studies was because of the close relation i have developed with our dean of students. In order to become a better school LIU should look into bettering their living conditions."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors are good, they work with you to give appropriate support to get your work done. People are friendly and area is booming, lots of new construction and things to do."
Freshman,4,"Very happy to attend LIU Brooklyn. Highly recommend the Honors Program, which offers smaller class sizes and great academic support. Academics is great overall. Wide range of diverse students and activities. Campus is located in convenient place, with plenty of stores and food eateries around the area. My only problem is tuition, as tuition is very expensive."
Niche User,4,I like the fluid organization and class variety that is provided. The teachers give keen background that is essential. Understanding students comprehension of topics is essential in providing excellence in majors.
Freshman,4,I loved attending at the school and the programs they offered for my major (Media Arts). The only issue I ran across was financial aid
Sophomore,4,The school is great and all but its quite tricky in terms as they have horrible professors and the advising coaches chances every semester so they have no clue what's happening and gives a lot of false information for the pre-requisites for your major so as to have u longer and spend more money in the school
Sophomore,4,"Long Island University is the place to go if you are looking to be apart of a community. By community I mean everyone knows a good amount of the people who attend the school. My favorite thing is the class sizes. I'm not sitting in lectures containing 100 students hearing a professor bark me information. I'm in classes of at most 30, having meaning full class discussions. In my opinion, the personal level of the classrooms allows for encouragement. Your professor will reach out to you if they notice you missed a class, or if they noticed you grades have been slipping. That's how teaching should be. The school is also extremely diverse and has clubs that embrace the cultures, circumstances, and religions that the school sees. Athletics are division 1. Housing is okay. The rooms are larger than any other rooms I've seen in NY. There is 24/7 security. The area is amazing. There are clothing stores, shopping centers, attractions within a few blocks."
Sophomore,4,"Long Island University is a great school, the diversity of students that are in school bring so much culture in the classrooms and new profound similarities between students. One thing I would like to see a change in school is that I hope the school take better care of their facilities."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have had a wonderful experience at LIU Brooklyn. As a dance major  my education in the arts has expanded tremendously and I have given many opportunities that can benefit my career in the future. What I specifically love about this school is the chance to study both dance and sports science. The two curriculums have a lot in common, allowing me to study both and still graduate in 4 years with 2 degrees. LIU Brooklyn is one of the only university's that would cater to those 2 specific studies. I am extremely happy at this school and highly recommend attending to anyone interested in both dance and any field of medicine/science."
Junior,4,I feel at home here. I really like how it's very diverse and their health science major are unlimited to different courses.
Niche User,4,The open house seems very nice and liked the information i received was very good. All my questions were answer.
Alum,4,"I attended as a transfer student from age 27-29. Majored in Sport Science, Minor Sport Management. Completed 6 business/sport management classes. Completed two internships Brooklyn Nets/NY Islanders Sales intern and Brooklyn Health and Performance the latter I gained through an alumni of the school.  Most important class I took at LIU BK was Intro to Entrepreneurship. The director of Entrepreneurship is a black women with an MBA from Stern and B.S. from Wharton. One of the most brilliant people I have ever come across in life. The Dean of the business school holds a PH.D. MBA. and BBA from Columbia. Take advantage of the professors and deans they're willing to help mature, driven individuals. The faculty will not plug you with their connects if you cannot demonstrate you're value (i.e hard skills and soft skills) you possess. You pay this tuition for the network and internships."
Sophomore,4,"I like professors. People working on campus, including counselors are very helpful. One of the drawbacks is a price of each credit."
Freshman,4,"Long Island University Brooklyn has a perfect size campus I was looking forward too as I entered college. Since the campus is not so big it is easy to get to one building to another, especially the fact on the third floor of every building it somehow connects to another building which is a huge advantage when the cold weather kicks in. Beside the campus there is a friendly staff, free tutoring is available for any subject you are weak at. You easily go to the tutoring center make an appointment, check your email, and then come in the day of your appointment. If I had to pick at one issue it would have to be some of the science professors are not the best to take if you are majoring in Pharmacy like me. Overall, Long Island University Brooklyn is great."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful. Don’t really know what I would change about it because haven’t really gone there for school yet to know much about it.
Junior,4,"So far I haven't really had any problem with the school personally. However, you have to push to get what you want"
Freshman,4,"Although this school is dominated by commuters, the campus life isn't that bad. 
There are clubs and organizations that you can join; you just have to look for them.  Surprisingly, the faculty is as diverse as the students.  Professors can be a hit or miss.  Overall, LIU Brooklyn has good academics, but is highly competitive for pharmacy majors."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is very open and well connected. It's easy to communicate with others as well as your professors. Although the tuition is fairly high, it can be lowered."
Freshman,4,"Long Island University is a very diverse school and it has different types of people coming from many different backgrounds.  I would like to see more dedicated faculty and success coach who were more willing to help and also a cleaner school environment would be beneficial. The tuition is too high and costly and the money is not showing in The school.  The faculty and staff members are being underpaid and  because of that they are not able to work to their full potential.  At the beginning of the 2016 school year, teachers were going on strike because they were losing their jobs and are not being paid fairly.  As an undergraduate student at Long Island University, these are some of the changes I would like to see the school work hard to fix in the near future for the betterment of everyone."
Junior,4,Wish I heard about parties. Everyone is nice here. Expensive tuition. School is in the heart of Brooklyn.
Sophomore,2,I had a professor who's lecture was copied from wikipedia. I will admit there is a slim possibility they wrote the page but that is highly unlikely because other lecture were copied directly from other sources.
Sophomore,2,"This school was very unorganized, overpriced, and lacked competent professors. It was more expensive than some ivy leagues, while providing an education resembling my high school courses. Overall, I would not recommend this school to anyone. They are preoccupied with their athletes, leaving all others to be forgotten and not given the proper education they are paying for."
Freshman,2,I love the location and the Professors were great! As for the organization and working with students financially myself and others had very poor experiences.
Freshman,2,My experience at Long Island University was a gradual let down. The reason I say this is because the actual administration doesn't care about the students themselves only the money they come with. During a worldwide pandemic they have yet to refund the students who lived on campus the dorm and meal plan fee and are ignoring parents emails addressing so. The professors are also shut out when it comes to getting in touch with important figures at the school. I may have only been here for a year but seeing what I have seen behind closed doors is astonishing and I don't plan on staying to see it any further.
Sophomore,2,"The campus isn't what you would expect from a college. The college life here is minimal to none. It's really hard to get involved in an environment like this. The buildings look like a prison, specifically the Metcalfe and Humanities buildings. There's some good professors but there are many difficult ones. The good professors almost immediately get taken, while the difficult ones remain. The school specializes in Pharmacy and Nursing so any other major should look elsewhere. Also, consider other Pharmacy or Nursing schools in the NYC area, they probably would be better and prepare you even more for the real world. Watch out because they do everything to take your money."
Senior,2,"LIU Brooklyn is a very expensive school and the dorms, classrooms, buildings are all falling apart. The dorms are not safe to live in at all. Most professors are really invested in the students and want you to succeed however there are a few professors who could care less about you. There are very limited food options on campus and the food is not good at all. The athletic games are fun to attend to as most teams at LIU are good."
Niche User,2,"The library is the place where students come to socialize, eat, drink, talk on their phones without any regard to anyone else trying to study. The ""Quiet Study"" area is a joke since students treat it like the library. Even LIU employees hold their phone conversations there as well.

The Nursing Program is disorganized. The professors didn't have access to their Blackboard accounts for weeks. Students were clueless about what textbooks to get.

Professors have full control over the quizzes they give out, but the exams are a ""collaborative"" effort where all the professors within their department create the exam. One professor will teach, while other professors will teach something else. This hurts the student since the exam is made up of more than one professor.

I've heard horror stories about LIU - Brooklyn, but their poor attempt at ""revamping"" their program is a glorious mess at best."
Junior,2,This University was better in 2013-2014 before I started attending. As the years went by and I decided to attend is Spring 2015. The University has become a dead zone. Some of the Faculty Members and Professor have been fired for helping the students. Housing and Food are unsanitary. The University needs help and are also shutting down a lot of programs that are actually great for students.
Freshman,2,Administrative staff is not very helpful and super unorganized. It is always a hassle to get help with tasks that should have been done. The staff has an unwelcoming vibe.
Sophomore,2,"If you are not coming here for pharmacy DO NOT COME HERE! you are just paying for the locations. Most of the professors are old and are not up to date. I'm a journalism major and my professor is horrible and I can't really complain to anyone because he is the dean. The buildings are a mess and don't forget the lockout! which is not over by the way. the school literally put anybody in the classrooms so we couldn't sue. The problem was you would have someone who works in the admission office teaching your class. Though now professors are working on a temporary contract the lockout will continue after the 2017 spring semester.
The school is very diverse but the students are not really any fun and do not have any school. 
President Cline does not care about this campus and is letting it go to crap! 
I wish someone told me the truth about liu but since no one did it for me I'm doing it for you. Just go to a cheaper and better school."
College Sophomore,2,I only stayed overnight in the dorms for orientation and to me it was nasty. I will never stay on campus.
College Senior,2,It is a known pattern that only certain ethnic groups get into certain programs. it is quiet sickening
College Freshman,2,"At LIU, not a lot of parties exist unless you are an athlete. And by parties, I mean pre-games."
College Freshman,2,There are dealers in the dorms and it's easy to access. No one really cares if you drink or smoke that much.
College Sophomore,2,The are sometimes rude and can never give you a straight answers.
College Sophomore,2,Their are only two greek life soro/frat at LIU.
College Freshman,2,"I lived there for 2,5 weeks and they promised us wifi which we did not have. I was not allowed to have my own coffee-maker. Facility is very unclean etc. Can be improved."
College Freshman,2,"Not good at all. As a new student, no good guidelines where to go, how to apply, who to speak to etc. People working at the school has very much of an attitude and not much helpful. I had my name misspelled, charges they didn't remove that they were supposed to, asking me for birth certificate when my passport is the most legal ID anybody carries, dragging me around about transcripts etc. Needs improvement."
Recent Alumnus,2,Didn't even know there was a sorority!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Poor class registration process, financial aid services are inadequate."
College Freshman,2,They dont treat the residents right
College Freshman,2,"No college atmosphere, pharmacy, PA/AT/PT/OT, and nursing are the only majors that are worth coming to this school for. Very diverse and downtown Brooklyn is not the safest place although campus security is very good."
College Freshman,2,Games get little to no fam attendance as it is a commuter school. Most supporters are other athletes who live on campus and family members.
College Freshman,2,"It's a commuter school, so it is not a typical college atmosphere. I would not recommend going here if you do not plan on doing honors or a health science major, there are not a lot of benefits to the other programs. Also, teachers not in the honors department are awful, especially the math department. The education is not worth the price."
College Student,2,"They try, but there are some numbers that are never explained"
College Student,2,The tuition is not affordable and the college took away the Dean's award for excellent academic performance.
College Freshman,2,there are mostly fast food chains you have to walk a distance to get to eat somewhere healthy.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I still owe 10k with the maximum aid finally but im still struggling, because its not a friendly school for students without families"
College Junior,2,"Campus security is very lenient at LIU. You can usually get away with most things as long you do not make them blatantly obvious, and even if you are obvious sometimes they just do not care. This may be beneficial for some such as the underage students who want to drink, but it does have its downsides. There was an incident on campus involving myself and security handled it poorly. A random man exposed himself to me while I was working on campus and when I informed campus security they were extremely blase about it. It was a traumatizing event and I wish they had taken it more seriously."
College Junior,2,"Although the on campus housing at LIU is very convenient it is not cost efficient or worthy of its high price tag. The building at first glance seems decent, but there are underlying problems such as mold and leaks that go unnoticed and unattended to. There is a decent social environment on the campus, but there is an obvious separation between athletes and non-athletes. It would be nicer if students blended more. Living on campus has its perks despite these flaws. You are close to all of the schools resources such as the tutoring center and extensive library, and you only have to walk a few feet to get to class. If they invested the money we spent into upgrading the housing facility it would be worth it, but until then it is hard to swallow the high cost of the less than average building."
College Junior,2,The people in financial aid can be rude and give you the run around.
College Junior,2,The Greeks are not very nice to non Greeks. They're kinda snobby.
College Student,2,"The financial aid office is very unorganized and tedious. It takes way too long to reach someone, and when you finally do you have a chance of receiving the wrong information from a person. I had to make several appointments and calls to find out my financial situation because I was being charged for aid I was supposed to receive, but it turned out that someone gave me the wrong amounts for my federal loans. This problem has also been the same for my friends who attend the school."
College Student,2,"Every weekend I can hear someone talking about drinking alcohol and my previous roommates had alcohol in the room on several occasions. Almost every day I can smell marijuana smoke in the halls or in the bathroom, and know of at least six people on campus who I have come in contact with who smoke weed."
College Student,2,"As someone who has lived on campus for almost two semesters, I find the strictness to be surprisingly lenient for the warnings we are given at the beginning of each semester. I have heard that students can receive punishments as far as fines to suspension for doing drugs or drinking alcohol in the dorms, yet almost every day I smell marijuana smoke in the halls, or on a floor on my way down to the lobby in the elevator and every weekend you can hear some party going on, or some drunk students in the halls. When the dorm security is called, they eventually manage to get the noise down to a reasonable level, and they are all strict on smoking when they catch it, but the RAs hardly ever seem interested in figuring out the source of the smells or at least keeping underage drinkers from vomiting all their alcohol up in the toilets. From what I was told at the beginning of the year, I thought it would be much more difficult to get drunk or high than I've witnessed it being."
Recent Alumnus,2,not great but sometimes fun
College Student,2,"Well there's no parking area for the students, but there is a spot across the street around Fulton were one could actually pay for parking."
College Freshman,2,"There are many places to eat. However, most of these places include fast food, which does not provide students with healthy options. So far I have not seen a dining area that suggests any type of student discounts."
College Freshman,2,"There are many cases, especially at late night parties or events, where drugs and alcohol are clearly present on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly healthy food, snacks, and drinks on campus are very expensive, which do not encourage students to maintain a well-balanced diet."
College Freshman,2,"Paying each week for public train transportation is not very convenient, but it must be done to get to school on time. About an hour is spent to travel to school and another hour to return home. The travel is not too bad, however it can be very tiring."
College Sophomore,2,I don't drive to school. I'm far off better with using the transportation. Getting to campus on car is a hassle because downtown traffic is  a headache. There is no guarantee that you will get a parking spot right away. 
College Freshman,2,"My school is pretty expensive to attend and dealing with the financial aid office can be a hassle most of the time. But as long as you are constantly on top of it, you should be able to receive a good amount of financial aid."
College Freshman,2,It is not really a significant part of campus life.
College Sophomore,2,"On campus, students are allowed to smoke cigarettes in between classes without any of the security guards intervening. With that being said, students also take the liberty to smoke marijuana, much to the displeasure of other individuals who don't partake in those activities. I feel more should be done to crack down on the illegal use of those products on campus and in such an open environment."
College Junior,2,The nursing curriculum at Long Island university is very intense.
College Student,2,"To be completely honest, I wouldn't apply to anything other then health science related at this school. Not because the math and science department is better then the others, but you can get a similar business/art/writing education from another school for half the price."
College Junior,2,"Yes, I like the school education quality.  Very expensive to attend without financial aid, student loans, and special grants/scholarships.  Should research for financial help before getting involved with this school."
College Sophomore,2,The security guards don't seem to really take interest in their job and they don't seem alert at all.
College Junior,2,Sorry to say but the food on campus is awful. There isn't much choice.
College Junior,2,Nursing classes are always closed & you end up with classes that aren't flexible.
College Junior,2,During midterm and finals computer labs are packed.
College Senior,2,"There are Muni-meters on Ashland up to 6 hours, and hour spots on Flatbush,  but traffic agent abound, so make sure your meter is fed if you don't want a ticket."
College Freshman,2,"Here at LIU Brooklyn, they don't really encourage Off-Campus Housing. They will direct you towards the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,Need Updates – They are okay. They are available most of the time but some of them are missing plug ins you need to see notes and you have to switch around to different computers to get one that has adobe. I think that's ridiculous and our tuition should be enough to have this problem solved seeing that adobe is a free program.
College Junior,2,it's about to be 1100 a credit and very little class choices. They are trying to change but the graduation rate is 44% and that's scary.
College Junior,2,Very Dirty and Not Spacious – the rooms are really small and there are roaches in the main dorm room.
College Student,2,"There are so many restrictions inside the school. Therefore, if you want a fun night, you have to go to to the city. Thank God for the easy access transportations. You can get to the city within 20 mins from my school!"
College Freshman,2,If you know anything about NYC buses and trains than I need not say more...
College Freshman,2,"Whereas the wifi may be lacking efficiency throughout the university, the computers in the Honors lounge are somewhat more dependable when students have to complete their homework. However, these computers are old - keyboards are sticky and a few keys are missing. The internet may be slow, but at least it works, I suppose. The printer has not been available for students' use since the start of the year - a rather discouraging welcome to us freshmen who expect college to be grand and wonderful."
Sophomore,1,"The other reviews are spot on. They tuition does not justify the value. They do not provide access to necessary resources such as NCBI-pubmed and you have to email the librarians who sometimes also cant access the literature. Once we went online they required us to download a testing resource that my computer labeled as malware on my personal computer. They require 75$ for ""dinning dollars"" each semester which is a non refundable fee that also does not transfer from semester to semester. There is lack of financial aide support. Not once has my financial aide been distributed in a manner that makes any sense at all.  They set tuition payment date before drop/add dates, and before financial aide distribution which causes high anxiety. Overall this school is run like a corner store, not an academic institution concerned for the knowledge of their students. Also their University fee went up rather than down following the pandemic."
Senior,1,"LIU Brooklyn is a joke. LIU Global is more of a joke. They preach understanding and having a strong community ethos yet treat the students like garbage. We pay thousands of dollars to attend this institution yet it always tries to cheat us out of our money. Thousands were budgeted for trips including transportation to and from Montana and Washington DC, hotel stays, and food. They have not given any of that money back and they do not intend to. The biggest let down is knowing that they don't care about you. They care about enrollment and digging themselves out of the 40 million dollar hole they dug themselves into. Don't come here folks."
Niche User,1,"Experienced the WORST thing ever! A few months ago I got a denial letter in the mail. I received an email on Monday accepting me into the program for Fall 2019, with links to complete my enrollment to secure my spot, along with a FASFA link; it seemed legitimate. I emailed graduate admissions to let them know I was going elsewhere for my education. After, received an email from somebody completely different telling me that the acceptance email I received was sent in error and to ""kindly disregard this communication."" This is EXTREMELY unprofessional! I emailed back expressing my frustration. To continue the unprofessionalism, I received a missed call at 10 at night. I was nagged the next day for them to explain why this happened. This should've NEVER happened in the first place. I hope this is a lessen to the University to have this not happen to another potential student, because it is EXTREMELY devastating news to hear."
Freshman,1,Worst college tour I’ve been on.  most of the time these people never answered. Finally I was able to schedule a tour. I traveled 3 hours to get there and once I arrived the lady at the front desk told me they were not doing tours. After about an hour of sitting outside the campus I received really bad service like they didn’t even want me there. Here’s the worst part. When I was on the tour my tour guide took me to go see the dorms. The lady at the front desk screamed “EXCUSE ME” at me. I then turned around and my tour guide said “they are with me”. The lady at the desk then goes “what is she looking at” referring to me turning around. I was so shocked at the rude staff. After that I was basically done and never wanted to see this campus again. All the other campus tours I’ve been on for other schools (I’ve been on 12) this by far had to be the worst. They acted as if I had no business being there I can’t even imagine how they treat their actual students.
Graduate Student,1,"Wow. Do not apply or come to this university.

I am in a graduate program taking classes in a small room with small desks that barely fit students comfortably. The classrooms next to each other get noisy, making it hard to concentrate. The deans have not done anything about changing our room into a better location. 

Professors- some have the intention of helping you. Others are just waiting to retire. Most do not utilize Blackboard. Some are using Google, Dropbox, or other websites for communication and archiving information. It is very unorganized. Blackboard is a part of a system that is regulated.

The school is in a good location; that is the only plus. The library is AWFUL. It's very loud, dirty, and not conducive for studying. It's a party hall."
Senior,1,"I would like to see pest control. I would like to see adequate plumbing. I would like to see rooms without holes in the walls. There's a lot I would like to see from  a private university that costs 20k a semester- cosmetically. But mostly, I'd like them to find teachers who can teach instead of download slides from text books, read them verbatim and use test banks from those books for tests. I'm all for an A+ but I'm more for learning, especially with the price tag this school has. Their school of nursing has simulation labs they brag about and reel you in with mentioning upon enrollment but they DO NOT use them. If you ask current students 99/100 would suggest you go elsewhere. I'm one of those 99 who is at the top of their class and would still say- GO ELSEWHERE."
Niche User,1,"The experience I had at LIU-Brooklyn was very short and not very sweet. What I liked about this school was how small and pretty the campus was on the outside.  On the inside, this school was small but far from pretty.  The dorms, even on the 15th floor, had RATS, ants and cockroaches.  This school is not very sanitary and needs an exterminator-ASAP.  The dorm halls always reeked of illegal substances.  The staff in the dorm/dining hall was always rude and clearly didn't want to be working there.  Regarding the staff on the academic side, would either not return emails or phone calls, or would take 3 weeks to a month and a half to respond-in the summer.  Due to athletic complications, what was mentioned above, and other reasons, I left the school and I am very happy I did."
Recent Alumnus,1,for the price students pay not the best
Recent Alumnus,1,we don't have a greek life
College Sophomore,1,I have never known there was a nightlife
College Sophomore,1,I have never been under the influence of drugs or alcohol and I would not approve.
Recent Alumnus,1,I did not dorm on campus.  I had to commute everyday.
Recent Alumnus,1,"LIU Brooklyn is a good school but honestly I did not enjoy my college experience like I wanted to,"
College Senior,1,People smoke marijuana ON campus out in the open and nothing is said or done about it
College Senior,1,"Safety at long island university is horrible. People can get in with a gift card that LOOKS like an ID card at some entrances. I asked a security guard if I could call my mother to let her know i was safe and he replied with ""I cannot do that"" seriously SO unprofessional and most definitely not safe"
College Freshman,1,"DO NOT COME TO LIU!!!! 

I am a freshman and I am transferring next year. I thought that LIU was the best college ever. When I came to visit, they lied to me and kept a lot of things away from me. The food is bad. We got our Cafe shut down 3 times due to the fact we had food flies and our kitchen is very unsanitary. You have to pay for laundry and it's so expensive and you most likely will get your clothes stolen. By the way we had maggots inside our washer machines. The teachers here suck, they do not care about you at all, neither do they care if your are learning. The Residence Halls here are gross, we have rats, cockroaches, ants and much more. Our bathrooms are nasty and they barely clean anything. The only good thing is that the dorms here are really big and spacious. The elevators break all the time!!!! If you are not coming to this school for the Pharmacy program or to be in the Basketball team or Soccer team, do not attend LIU. It is a waste of time. This school is so expensive and you would think that you it's worth it but it's not. If you are also looking for a party school this is definitely not the one. There are no parties here. Only the first 3 weeks of school and a week or two before christmas break. I should've listened to what other people were saying to me about this school. Now, you should listen to me."
College Senior,1,"It is the absolute worst. 

The professors are terrible, once in a while, you actually have a professor that teaches.

The academics are a teach yourself basis.

The campus, although nice floods when it rains heavily. 

The wait for help in any sense of the word is non-existent.

DO NOT GO TO LIU."
College Student,1,The people who working in the financial aid are not respect the students
College Senior,1,"Our financial aide office is chaos. No one in the office knows what they are doing and it is a struggle to see your bill, the amount you have to change is constantly changing, and going up and down. Receiving aide is nearly impossible and then there is the possibility that they will take it away."
College Freshman,1,"It's hard to make appointments with financial aid, and even when you can it's hard to make amends with payments and other expenses we all have to pay for someone doing stupid acts (ex: elevator)"
College Junior,1,"Practically every student who dorms has an issue with the dining on campus. In the dining hall in the dorm the food is atrocious. There are not many options to choose from, and it is neither tasty nor healthy. It is extremely rare that there is something decent in the cafeteria, and the staff often handles the food poorly. They wont change gloves, clean knives before cutting, or wipe down dirty surfaces before placing your food on them. The A la carte meal plan, which is basically the only one the school offers, costs a whopping $2,500, which is a ridiculous amount for the quality of food we receive. You end up spending half of that eating off campus when the cafeteria has nothing to offer. Any other options on campus are only slightly better, and pretty costly."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have fraternities nor sororities.
College Senior,1,A lot of financial aid programs have been discontinued.
College Junior,1,"Fjinancial aid employees are rude and uninformed.  No help with scholarships.  Not good with numbers either.  There has been a continuing problem with applying my financial aid to my student account.  Went to financial aid for questions.  No one knew what I was talking about, even though I had printouts of the different student account activities posted on my student account.  One year later, problem has not been resolved.  Very dissapointing and frustrating experience!  Beware."
College Student,1,I've had a headache the whole process. But once you familiarize yourself with how the system works it's much less stressful.
College Junior,1,"I dont really ever hear about any of the Greek Life. Sometimes there might be paper postings on the hallway walls, but other than that, Greek Life isnt very popular at our school. I wish it was!"
College Sophomore,1,"The housing at LIU needs to be re done. Not only are the bathrooms bad but they don't get cleaned often and the rules need to be enforced and it would be helpful if there was a telephone to call security in every room, also to call the residence assistant when something is afloat."
College Junior,1,"there aren't many dinning options, the is very distasteful and overpriced."
College Freshman,1,There is mainly African Americans and Muslims at this school.  The only white people are athletes and only associate with each other.  The studies here aren't even that challenging.  The only time they are is when you have to teach yourself which is most of the time.
College Sophomore,1,"This is my first year at LIU and their transfer program helped a great deal with shedding light on all of the extracurricular activities that it has to offer.  I am going to assume that their Greek Community is a huge part of the school because I have barely heard about it.  In fact, I tried email them but never got a response.  I will have to try again."
College Sophomore,1,I have never receive any financial aid except for student loans
College Junior,1,I gave a D- because I haven't come across any such above standards as yet.
College Sophomore,1,"I Havent' Seen Any – I dont drink, or smoke, or do any drugs and I have not been pressured to. I am not an easily influenced person anyway but I have not seen anyone under the influence at my time here at the university."
College Sophomore,1,The school is very expensive and more scholarships and graduate assistance should be available.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't a designated area for student parking.
College Freshman,1,I never see anything that frats/sororities do around campus. Come to think about it Ive only seen them at orientation before the first day of classes.
College Junior,1,Worse Library Ever – you have to pay for everything although you pay your tuition already
College Sophomore,1,No cute guys – There are only like 5 guys thats looks good and since there are so many girls here its like u have to compete for them... Really makes me hate this school
College Junior,1,"It is like a work out or worst the aches and pains after an intense work out. Many application, essays, interviews. Did I mention on spot essay before interview with 15 minutes to write it. Also volunteer service of 500 hours or more in clinical setting plus numbers per required courses."
College Junior,1,"Library Equals Horrible – The library is the only library with a noise level of 8, where 1 is quiet and 10 is unbearable loud. There are signs all over that say no food, drinks, or phones. Yet, facilities are usually dirty because people leave food wrappers and drink bottles. People are regularly talking on phones or are in groups hanging out within the library. Overall, if you aim to study, avoid the library at all costs."

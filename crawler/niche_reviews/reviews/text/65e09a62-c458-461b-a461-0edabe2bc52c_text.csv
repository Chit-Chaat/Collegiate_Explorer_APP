Freshman,5,"What i enjoy the most about the NewSchool of Architecture and design is the diversity within the school. Not only is their students from across the united states,  but also from all around the world. Having this diverse culture at our school, it gives all of us students more perspectives and a variety of different ways of problem solving especially in a design school. Everyday when visualize the students work, you see creativity and something new from every project. This school is like no other in my opinion. The relationships you build with the students and the professors just from being in studio is amazing . Theirs not so many schools that provide a work space for you and other students  that is accessible to you seven days a week for as long as you need to work."
Freshman,5,great experience! I highly recommend NewSchool of Architecture & Design to any aspiring design student. Great staff and peers
Freshman,5,"Newschool of Architecture and Design is a diverse school with many different student and faculty. The courses are rigorous while rewarding and although it is small their are so many wonderful people to meet. Great environment to be around, happy and helpful. I love it here and I know many other people do as well."
Sophomore,5,It is a fun school with small campus. All the staff is nice. Climate is awesome. I am architecture atudent and the program is pretty nice. The only thing is quarter system is quite a rush.
College Sophomore,5,24/7 to a reliable computer or WiFi. Counts with all the programs to be successful in college.
College Sophomore,5,To be a CM in NSAD is a great opportunity because you interact with architecture students which we will work together in future careers.
College Sophomore,5,"What makes newschool unique is the great instructors, we have a variety of interaction with architects, construction managers and engineers."
College Sophomore,5,Career center provides us with a ton of internships and help us obtain them.
College Freshman,5,"We have a wide variety of amenities. They provide printers, copiers, 24/7 security, access to work stations and computer labs and other resources that we need to work anytime we need. "
College Freshman,5,The network allows students to quickly download and upload at an excellent speed. The also provide WiFi everywhere on campus. 
College Freshman,5,The work load is extensive but keeps me on my toes. Its what to be expected from a school that expects more form its students. 
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process was very easy. A representative called me and walked me through the entire process from start to finish. 
College Freshman,5,The career services department is very helpful and were more than willing to help with any questions I had. They even helped me create a solid resume. 
College Senior,5,Great Printing – Our school has free printing which makes homework and projects less stressful. We also have multiple computer labs that are available at all hours.
College Sophomore,5,"Anytime, you can stop by and get help.  They really work with your goal in mind, whether its just a summer job, or preapring to graduate and enter the field of architecture.  There is a lot more needed for an architect to get a job than a resume, a portfolio is key.  They have helped keep my portfolio up to date making it easier down the road when I graduate."
Freshman,4,What I like in Newschool Of Architecture and Design is that the job opportunities  that they have are exclusively for student-based organizations and nice staff too. They are a voice of most students because of the work they do and what they are giving to students. What is lacking is that teachers needs to be more sensitive of student's knowledge as they are in a fast-paced program and the course that they are teaching should be done by the professor itself.
Freshman,4,"I love the hands-on approach, they teach not only how to create architecture with current technology, but also teach us how to draft the ""old-fashioned"" way, pencils, pens, watercolors and the like. Almost all of the faculty are (or were) practicing professionals in the fields they teach, so their knowledge is very helpful."
College Student,4,I love the school and its size. You have to be professional about what you do in class. The teachers prepare you for real life's challenges.
College Junior,4,24/7 access to the school is a great campus resource.
College Junior,4,"Very nice, fun, and helpful."
College Junior,4,NewSchool is a very diverse environment.
College Sophomore,4,NSAD does not count with athletic centers but does provide students with gym passes. Library has everything you need for your intended major.
College Sophomore,4,"Registration process is very easy, advising center will help you right away and get you registered in an instant."
College Senior,4,"I was really not used to the courses before but as time and experiences you can excel the course, and it becomes very interactive when you start finding facts yourself, due to the internet access. 
The exams and the interactive session are the creative thing i liked"
College Senior,4,"Well Not all teachers and faculty members are up to mark but yes i can assure you with one thing, our faculty are very interactive and very helpful. The teachers wont be interested in you until you show some interest in it.
But if you ask them anything they will be very pleased to help you in all senses. 
Our college is a little bit of a miser in giving us marks in total , so our average grades go down."
College Senior,4,"I am in architecture college, and the experience is been very good so far, 
The daily dead lines are very hectic but, as usual we learn a lot from the classes. We have many trips which are mainly educational and fun at the same time. 
The workload is preferably is intense and overwhelming . The faculty are just very interacting and yes i would miss my college."
College Senior,4,This school is small and the instructors are mainly working professionals which makes the educational experience better since they are in the industry.
Alum,2,"This school is great for an independent learner who is willing to self teach. A lot of the learning is done outside of class. Class time is to further and direct your outside learning. I was 18 when I entered NewSchool and more accustomed to an in-class learning atmosphere. This school was not for me, however, for a highly motivated individual with independent study skills, this school would be great for them. Additional outside classes may be needed to supplement education and to fulfill major/graduation requirements."
Senior,2,The curriculum includes real world architecture and design experience. Facilities are lacking in regularly functioning equipment.
Niche User,1,"For profit school with little concern for student success – First, NewSchool is a for profit architectural university.  Meaning nearly everyone is accepted to the school despite their poor performance previously and honestly the fact that they should pursue another profession.  This school is devaluing the architecture profession and especially the Bachelor of Architecture degree.
I recommend applying to either Cal Poly, UC Berkeley, or UCLA if you want quality education for a fair price.  If price isn't an issue, Woodbury in San Diego or LA, CCA, or out of state are much better as evidenced by their faculty and student work. Remember, you are paying more in tuition then you would to go to Harvard, so don't make the decision in haste. Demand better!
3 of 5 of the thesis professors here have no more than 2 years of experience and only 2 of the 5th year thesis professors are licensed. Good Luck!"

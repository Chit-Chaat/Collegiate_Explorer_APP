Senior,5,The online experience at chico state was great. Online classes tend to be quite hard to stay on top of your work but chico State is great on making online experience really good and straight forward. The professors do such a great job on explaining the process and making online course so easy to stay on track. They give you a good bread on the lectures and quizzes to be successful.
Senior,5,"Chico State University is such an amazing school with a beautiful campus and awesome staff. Chico stare is a great university experience on meeting new people and help each other be successful and have lots of fun at the same time. It has a lot of great programs such as engineering, arts, business, science and other programs. I believe you will enjoy going to Chico State."
Junior,5,"I love how it feels like home instantly. It’s such an amazing community, with friendly people all around. It’s also close enough to home that I don’t feel “home sick” but far enough away to feel independent and get that full university experience. Chico is amazing, I love the green campus. I wouldn’t change a thing."
Junior,5,"So far, Chico has done a great job adapting to online learning. They understand that us students are adjusting to a huge change as well."
Senior,5,The teachers were helpful and gave lots of examples to help strengthen understanding of material. When needed adjustments to deadlines were granted. The classes were easy to register for and the guidance counselor was helpful and informative in order to get all my classes in.
Senior,5,As someone who took online classes my experience was great. The blackboard system was easy to use and the teachers that used something other than blackboard also found nice options like Google+.
Senior,5,"The university students, faculty, and staff are all one big family; They make sure everyone feels welcome and included in everything;  The campus is gorgeous with tons of different activities; It is very academic forward with hands-on learning;"
Senior,5,The transfer to zoom was smooth unless your professor hated technology; The have provided classes for professors over the summer for them to get more familiar when Fall 2020 comes down the road
Junior,5,I have always loved online course. Due to Covid 19 all courses turned to online courses. The online learning experience was well organized even though it was stressful but it all worked out.
Junior,5,Chico State offers so many different clubs and organization. Everyone that I have come into connect with are willing to help their students.
Junior,5,"I enjoy that even though I participate in the online education program at California State University Chico, I still feel welcomed as a regular student.

I am very glad I chose Chico State to attend."
Junior,5,I really enjoy the online learning experience at California State University Chico! I enjoy the flexibility that comes with it. I think the professors do an excellent job at helping students to overcome any worries they have with online learning. I would recommend their online learning.

Sophomore,5,"My two years at California State Chico have been amazing, I have met life long friends and learned from great professors."
Niche User,5,"I love Chico State and its environment. The students are incredibly well mannered and easy to approach. The small town is very quiet and a big change for me since I am accustomed to the hustle and bustle of San Jose. I would like to see more advertising for the college itself. It's a great college, however it took me a while to learn about them."
Niche User,5,Chico State is a very excellent university. They have a gym that is open to college students attending.  They have a lot of food options at campus and a lot of outside options. There University is a little less than 1/2 a mile away from downtown.
Freshman,5,"I fell in love with campus the moment I got here. Everyone, and I mean literally everyone, is KIND!! People smile at each other when they walk passed, girls compliment each others outfits, people holding the door open for each other. The sense on community at Chico State is the most inviting feeling. Not to mention all our amazing professors who are always willing to sit down and help us. I hope you choose Chico, GO WILDCATS!"
Alum,5,Surrounded by people with the same mindset because it is a college town. Professors are easy to communicate with and readily available. Many resources and events available on campus for different needs and interests.
Junior,5,"This is my first year at CSU, Chico as I was a Junior transfer from my community college. I really like the size of the campus because it's fairly small and I can walk to everything within a short amount of time. They also make student resources very accessible and broadcast them very frequently. I especially love the Wildcat Pantry and the services they offer the students."
Freshman,5,Chico state has a very beautiful campus with awesome advisors in each department of study that are wiling to help you at any time in your college career.
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school with a really wonderful education program! The program is very easy to follow and classes are all laid out for you for the years to follow. Known to be a party school, but if you focus on your studies, you can get by."
Niche User,5,My experience at chico was amazing. I toured the entire campus and it felt like home within the couple hours I was there. The campus is just breathtaking.
Sophomore,5,My experience with CSU Chico has been great so far. I love the campus and the town of Chico. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I am an Agriculture Major so I really enjoy working at the University farm. The professors really want you to succeed and are always available to help you if you ask for help. I would recommend Chico to anyone who wants a good college experience.
Senior,5,"I love Chico, California and I love Chico State! I truly believe I found who I really am while spending my college career in Chico. The people here are very friendly, driven, helpful, supportive, and so were my Civil Engineering professors! I would recommend Chico state to ANYBODY who hasn't quite made a decision on which college to attend."
Alum,5,"Chico state is located in a beautiful area, where the university is a huge part of the community. It has a small town feel, many on campus opportunities to network with others, professors (in natural sciences) are amazing! Great teachers and passionate about their work. The town is small and not very diverse, but still had a great experience overall"
Junior,5,Good School for College Experience. If you’re in the fields of engineering or business you almost certainly will find a good job post-graduation.
Niche User,5,"I loved not only the campus, but every aspect around it giving me a familiar feel. The programs at Chico allowed me to branched outside of the school and get experience with others around me."
Niche User,5,In one of my classes we had some students from Chico come and talk to us about their school and the requirements. From that experience I know Chico is a good school. It isn't the best but it's still really good
Niche User,5,We went for their fist annual Preview day. It was so informational and the campus is stunning. The whole experience has almost made up my mind to attend Chico for my first college.
Junior,5,I have had an amazing experience at Chico State so far.  I have met some of my best friends at this school.  All of the professors I have had within my major are attentive to each individuals' needs.  They are passionate about what they are teaching us and everyone in classes wants to be there.  What I love most about this school is that the average class size is around 30-ish students.  There are very few giant lecture classes.  These smaller class sizes make it easier to get to know my professor and allows me to feel more comfortable going to their office hours and asking for help on an assignment or even to just talk about life in general.  I can't imagine myself at any other University.
Junior,5,"I feel so connected with my university and have found a love an passion for my area of study here. I have lived on and off campus and I love both equally. I have built strong relationships with the faculty and staff at Chico state and have made amazing friends at this university. The little Chico town has amazing food, people, and a great social scene for college students."
Niche User,5,When I visited Chico State University I immediately fell in love. The cool crisp breeze kept me excited to keep looking at the warm tones of the fall leaves. When I was there I was able to see one of the biology labs the professors were working on. It was scoliosis in goldfish. It made me extremely interested in the school.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love going to Chico State. It's so green and full of many beautiful caring people and lots of different trees--definitely makes my allergies act up. But the professors are great overall, and there's lots of different events activities and clubs that anyone can join; they really make every person feel included and that everyone has options to choose from that spark their interests. The night life is cool here but it's a little too much sometimes, but it's totally up to you if you want to keep it lowkey or get hella trashed. The opportunities are endless here."
Senior,5,"Chico State University provides a diverse environment that allows individuals to open up and flaunt their inner selves. It is a petite community that is very social, friendly, and free-spirited. The academics are superior and most of the professors are as well. One of the biggest challenges that Chico faces is the street darkness and the lack of lighting. The city would be so much safer if more street lights were implemented, especially since it is solely a college town. Other than that, Chico is an open-minded community that works as a team to bring everyone together."
Freshman,5,I like how there is a lot of support for first-year students. There are even courses offered to help them out. I also like the campus. It is not too big but still has a creek and lots of nature.
Senior,5,"When I was a junior in high school, I went on a college tour with my high school AVID class. It was my first time visiting Chico State and it was truly wonderful. The campus itself was extremely clean and a perfect size for a campus. If I had to change one thing about Chico State, it would have to be the location of the school because personally, I think the city is too small and far from larger cities near by, such as San Francisco or Sacramento without traveling afar."
Junior,5,Friendly teachers who really give all the help you need! Interesting classes and great local area.  I feel like I can really get the education I need from this University.
Junior,5,I love the friendly and communal environment of this college. The professors really care about their student's success. Their encouragement delivers an supportive atmosphere that all of the students also embrace!
Freshman,5,I like that chico is a really good university that they really care about their students and that they are able to succeed.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Chico state for a campus tour, it was overall a great experience and everyone was very kind."
Junior,5,"I have recently enrolled and applied for a distance/online program at this university. So far, the process has been smooth because communications by the universities various offices and program coordinators are timely and clear."
Senior,5,"I have had a great four years at CSU, Chico and would highly recommend it at a legitimate option to anyone looking at a University."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus and how clean and environmentally-driven the campus and staff is. In addition, I love how all of my professors thus far have been extremely passionate about what they teach and focus on effectively teaching the material rather than points or grades."
Freshman,5,What’s not to love about Chico it’s like a little city put together. It’s like a home away from home.
Freshman,5,Chico state university is a great university to attend because the environment is just simply wonderful. I have enjoyed the orientation that I attended and absolutely like to have toured this college before actually attending it.
Freshman,5,"As my first year of college at Chico ends, I fell in love with the campus. There are many resources for students, the professors really care for their students and are really friendly."
Junior,5,"There are many programs to get involved with on campus, ranging from athletics, social groups, philanthropy organizations, and academic clubs! Whatever you may be interested in, you will find it here! I can't imagine going to a better school."
Junior,5,My first semester has been great so far. I joined a dance club called momentum. I am a part of EOP as well. I got two A’s and 2 B’s. I’m still working full time but I am balancing everything decent. The school has been easy to work with on getting classes that is for my degree as well.
Freshman,5,"Diversity in the students could be improved just a bit, but the surrounding area for campus is beautiful and I loved spending time here every time I visited. The city itself is small, which I prefer when comparing to bigger schools that are in more urban areas."
Senior,5,"My experience being a chico state student has been amazing. I learned many lessons when I first cam here, such as who are your real friends. I also learned who I wanted to be and why. I am so greatful I came to chico, remember the place is what you make it."
Freshman,5,"Attending Chico State is an experience I hope to cherish forever. Before, making the big move to Chico, I had the littlest to no knowledge on what to expect. My oldest brother, who is now thirty-four, graduated in 2009. I remember watching him play soccer for the Wildcats. That was pretty much most of my experience before deciding to pick Chico State. I was worried if the academics were going to be rough and the social aspect of the town. But as soon as the first few weeks went by, I had found my footing in the place I now call home. I’ve learned that not only will the academics prepare you for work once out of college, but the professors are there to help you succeed and prosper. The town definitely makes you step out of your comfort zone and try new exciting things, which is exactly what I needed. That's the ultimate goal after all. Having the experience of thrilling adventures and wild stories that you will never forget."
Sophomore,5,"For me, what I love about chico state is the energy. everyone here seems to be really happy and motivated to do well in school. Also the teachers are amazing, you can really tell that the teachers are passionate about what they teach, just by how they teach it."
Freshman,5,I will be attending Chico State beginning next fall. I  am going in as an animal science major as a first time freshman and I couldn't be more excited! My application process was smooth and the my experience so far with the school has been nothing but positive.
Senior,5,Chico State was my last choice because of the distance and my lack of knowledge about the campus. I ended up loving everything about it once I came to visit it. The staff seemed so approachable and the campus was so green. I could not believe there was a river flowing through campus. I was convinced that day by some future professors of mine to take on the major Recreation Hospitality and Parks Management. I have loved all of my classes. I really feel like my major has the most fun compared to the rest. Classes are very interactive and it helps me learn better that way. Overall I am so proud to be a Wildcat.
Freshman,5,"My first year here has been amazing, it really feels like home here. I love everyone here and the parties are lit."
Freshman,5,"I have had great but also unfortunate experiences at Cal State Chico. It has been great because I realized what I want to do for a career, which is way different than when I first arrived. I also made a lot of amazing friends, and the professors made me feel very comfortable and open to going to office hours for help. First semester was a lot more difficult than my second semester, but I got the hang of it and followed a more set routine. I learned a lot about myself, and also learned to appreciate the experiences I created in college. While it was a great a lot of unexpected events occurred, such as the Paradise fire, which forced us to evacuate. Many other natural disasters followed that, but besides that I cannot complain about my school. It has changed me for the better, and has helped me grow in so many ways."
Junior,5,The campusis beautiful and well maintained. The instructors are knowtructors. I wish they had a football program; this would make the school stand out. The communication from administrators to myself and my family is outstanding. The surrounding communities experienced the devasting 2018 Camp Fire and the school was very supportive. Classes were cancelled for a period. The school went above and beyond to support the surrounding communitie
Junior,4,"For the most part, I like doing my classes online but I do feel that there is a big difference between learning in person and online."
Junior,4,I chose Chico because I wanted a home away from home. Everyone is so friendly! I can't wait till we can be on campus soon.
Junior,4,"It has the major I wanted to take. Appropriate classes for the major. Most instructors are great. It is affordable compared to many other 4-year universities.  I don't love that it is in the middle of downtown Chico, but that is because I have to travel fairly far to get there, and I am not a fan of the traffic."
Junior,4,"As you can see from prior information, I am focused on the academic side of the school, not the part scene, or extra activities."
Alum,4,The online courses will always vary on the courses and professors' instructing. There are some online classes that are video recorded for the students present and the students behind screens. I thought that was pretty cool because it was a taste of both worlds.
Alum,4,"Chico is a gem. The campus is breathtaking and relaxing. The best part is there is a creek that runs through campus. A big open field of grass, several locations to study outside, and beautiful in the fall. Chico is all about the friends you make. There will always be good and bad people anywhere you go. It is all about the experience. The WREC is an indoor gym. Very nice, to work out at. The best part is it is FREE to students and faculty. Then the outskirts of Chico has great hiking trails, rivers, and nature scene to absolutely visit."
Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the professors and courses I've taken in the last 2 years. I have had nothing but great encounters with the staff and faculty, as well as my peers. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transition online. This was a very difficult time for students and teachers, however, I wish I had a more structured transition to virtual learning."
Senior,4,"The professors and students are very friendly, and everything is accessible, although I do wish that there were more programs for POC students."
Junior,4,"Chico State is a beautiful campus and has a very therapeutic environment, which helps a lot when you're stressed out over exams! All of the professors that I have had have been so kind and amazing. They've been willing to help students really understand materials that are being taught. In the future, I would like for there to be more professors of color at Chico State, representation matters."
Junior,4,"Online classes can be hard to take, it just depends on your professor and how they approach the class. You also have to ho.d yourself accountable. In my experience, online classes are based heavily on readings so you have to stay on top of them. You also have to constantly check if there are assignments and when they are due."
Junior,4,"So far at Chico State, I've had a great experience.  I am an Animal Science pre-vet student.  The advisors help you make sure you stay in track with your prerequisites for veterinarian school and are willing to help you make sure you will be applying to the right school.  So far I've had a good experience with the professors."
Freshman,4,"Chico state has a very nice campus, there's brick everywhere and it looks really nice. The professors and staff there is really accommodating for every student there. They have all types of lounges for students and visitors. Also the gym is pretty good"
Senior,4,"Since my major is Social Work, the teachers I had are really amazing and accept every student that wants to major in social work. They do have a lot of different events for everything that you can think of and is a safe University. Although they do accept a lot student, I would want different races of teachers and different ethnicity because it would help students out in the real world to know about all the different cultures."
Senior,4,"I have taken a few and they aren't that bad, the teachers are very understanding if you speak up or email them. The teachers will work with you but if you don't say anything then you won't get the help."
Senior,4,"It was a challenge to switch over to virtual learning. Having no in person group projects, labs, library, in person office hours and classes was rough. I’m disappointed that fall will bring much of the same. But the faculty is amazing and alway goes above and beyond to help students to do their best work in a very difficult time for everyone."
Junior,4,"Blackboard is easy to handle. Though some of the teachers don't know how to use it, and don't use the calendar properly."
Alum,4,"Overall I enjoyed my undergraduate experience at Chico State. I really liked the town, the community, the school. I feel like everyone, from professors to students to locals were all very friendly and welcoming. I feel like I learned a lot from my professors and enjoyed my major courses. However, I would change the safety measures taken by administration and police nearby. There were times when I didn't feel as safe/supported as I could have as a student."
Sophomore,4,"I really like Chico State. I feel that it's a very vibrant campus full of friendly faces. Everyone is passionate about school, but also enjoy outside activities. 
If I could change one thing about Chico State I would clean up the neighborhoods and student housing areas around the campus."
Sophomore,4,The campus at Chico State is really nice and the education here is surprisingly good. The professors really care for their students and want their students to succeed.
Freshman,4,I like how friendly and open everyone is at Chico State. One thing I would change about Chico is to encourage the university to remodel the dorms.
Sophomore,4,"Chico state is a good place to study. if you love nature, Chico state would be a perfect school for you."
Junior,4,"The city surrounding the campus is beautiful and is the definition of a college town, as well an easy easily accessible campus that is located in the heart of the city. The faculty is also amazing and helps make the students lives much more simple and easy going."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Chico State has been very enjoyable. The classes offer a challenge, but all of the professors are more than willing to help you succeed."
Freshman,4,"The campus is Republican, so Chico was trending on twitter since voting is coming up. I did not know this when coming to school here, so I feel like it is something that people should know."
Junior,4,"What I enjoy about being at Chico State is the environment. It is different than experiencing the city-life and now living in a small town, but definitely worth the experience. I learned to love the campus each and everyday I walk to class as well as getting a different experience everyday. No two days ever feel the same one campus. I also really like professors who care and understand their students during tough times academically and personally."
Senior,4,I liked how friendly the environment is and felt that it was easy to find what I needed. I also thought it was great how there are many places you can go to near the college.
Freshman,4,"I honestly love Chico State. This school is so welcoming and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. Chico wasn't my first choice but I'm definitely glad that I did Choose Chico. Chico as a city though? Not as huge of a fan. It's not that it is bad, downtown Chico is great and so is the mall and area around it. The outskirts of Chico are home to incredibly racist and scary people. As a black woman, I never go there and if I do, I never go alone."
Freshman,4,"Chico State envelops the idea of sustainability socially and environmentally. They have preserved the land of the indigenous people of Chico and Chico Creek. The brick architecture of the school is also very amazing, and the campus has done a good job of maintaining its buildings, especially considering that they are the second oldest Cal State."
Junior,4,"The campus is so well kept and the professors are really on top of assignments. I was also very impressed with how informative the Financial Aid Office has been, but wish there were more scholarship and aid offers available."
Niche User,4,"Lots of resources to help you succeed. Despite the large population of students, the town still feels like home. Plenty of activities on and off campus."
Freshman,4,Chico state is very inclusive and has clubs that attend to all types of students. There are also great resources for academics and wellness in order to help students at all costs.
Junior,4,"Chico State offers a wide variety of classes and specific majors. It offers the chance to foster your growing skills with a support system of professional and helpful faculty. The only thing I would like to see change is the amount of help offered to students struggling academically. There should be more outreach and more resources, especially in courses known to be challenging."
Freshman,4,"I love the nature and the community value surrounding the school and town. Most people are extremely nice and welcoming. The only thing that I would like to see change is an increase in safety in the surrounding town, so we feel safer walking around."
Sophomore,4,"Wonderful community with plenty to do. Beautiful campus that feels very natural, with a creek running through the center and many lovely trees and landscaping. There are a lot of people on campus, so parking is generally terrible, if you do not have a class in the early morning you are unlikely to be able to park a car on campus. Luckily the town is very bike friendly. Some professors are pretty bad, but most are at least decent. I've had several incredibly good professors, and also a couple very bad ones. Lots of majors to choose from. There is no football team unfortunately, and sports are not very important here it would seem, though there is a great free gym for students."
Sophomore,4,Chico State is a great university that offers a variety of opportunities towards its students whether it be on campus and through the community. They monthly hold events to help students with their needs.
Junior,4,I love the community and opportunities for students! However the buildings are very old and some classrooms are very small and not updated.
Senior,4,"The people are cool, very chill community, college and party oriented. Everything I thought it would be, the WREC is nice, I spend a lot of my time there. Not a far walk, good university no problems."
Sophomore,4,"California State Univeristy, Chico is a phenomenal school that gives the foundation of diversity throughout camlis. Along with high graduation rates and retention rates for first year students,  the campus demographics are one of the unique aspects of this university. In addition, there are several resources available for students with financial, academic or social concerns. California State University,  Chico for a first year experience was new, fresh and challenging which are all parts of becoming a college graduate."
Junior,4,California State University- Chico has a beautiful campus with the best professors and educators. You will meet different people and learn to grow independent as well as all the students around you. Chico State values their students and the community is very welcoming which is now a second home to me personally. Choose Chico State today and join the Wildcats in making a better tomorrow!
Sophomore,4,"I love all the support Chico state offers for their students. From mental health to class registration, Csu Chico offers a substantial amount of resources to help you navigate college life. This assistance helps me focus on more on my classes."
Senior,4,I learned a lot in school. the civil engineering program provides a lot of labs and a variety of projects to learn from. The only thing I wish they focus more on is making all the professors with a Ph.D. since some professors need to have more knowledge about certain topics.
Junior,4,"I have had a pleasant experience at Cal-State Chico so far. The professors seem to care about the academic success of their students. Also, professors seem to care about the financial situations of students."
Freshman,4,Chico is a school that allows me to have fun while being able to learn more about my major and my future career. The small and personal classes allow one to learn efficiently and to understand the material better. The labs always allows me to have a better understanding of the class lecture thanks to the lab professors. Most lab professors are friendly and easy to get to know it just that sometimes when it comes to grades not all grades are inputted throughout the semester and the guessing game for what your grade is begins and that is something I have struggled with especially with some of the science classes.
Freshman,4,The Chico State University Campus is very beautiful. The students and peers I have meet are very friendly and outgoing and just love to be social with others. There are so many ways to be involved in the school. The advisors I have meet with are super helpful. The outdoors around the campus are to die for.
Sophomore,4,"When first coming to Chico state I felt very out of place and like I didn't belong. However, the more I got involved in the community and started expanding to new people and places I now am happy to call Chico my second home."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful Campus that is wide open while still not super large. The campus is open to all people so there are sometimes some sketchy people that walk through the campus, otherwise no complaints. Lots of people walk their dogs through campus and that always brightens my day."
Freshman,4,"I very much like the campus. The nature of the campus and how pretty it is is the biggest reason I went to this school. I also wanted to come here because of how great the theater program is. There has been a lot of ""disasters"" happening this year so it has been difficult. They don't do the greatest job of letting the students know information about what is going on."
Senior,4,"Very good professors, great environment, really fun to attend and you learn so much. I fully recommend attending Chico State!"
Junior,4,"It’s my first semester here, so I haven’t fully experienced all the potential Chico has to offer. I do really admire that they require a workshop in order to help prepare for your graduation plan. Most college students tend to procrastinate when it comes to making appointments with counselors to figure out their graduation plans. I do, however, dislike the choices in the cafeteria. There are plenty of restaurants near the campus to walk to but sometimes I don’t want to walk that far. It’s a gorgeous campus and very clean and well kept."
Sophomore,4,I like the campus a lot and the environment here in Chico. The campus has a lot of programs to try and get students involved into activities and within the community. I've had some really great teachers who have shaped and influenced me career wise and how I want to impact the world. One thing I would greatly like to change is the diversity on here on campus. The schools claims diversity so hard but I've yet to see many people of color within our student population and even the teachers. I've only had white teachers at my time here and haven't got to experience a truly diverse campus.
Senior,4,"The campus is very beautiful, a lot of trees and green. It's very clean as well, there's no smoking or litter on campus. It's expensive, and sometimes you can feel like they're just out for your money -- and they are -- but that's relatively normal I suppose."
Freshman,4,Chico is fun but is a small area to live in. You make great friendship and students and facility are really nice. Campus is very especially during fall.
Sophomore,4,"So far all my professors have been nice, but the whole party ambience is a bit annoying. Since Chico State is an open campus sometimes there will be some alarming people on campus, but so far i personally have not encountered anything bad."
Freshman,4,"It is my first year at college, so far it is good. The professor really cares about the students, another thing is that the classes are small so that is a good thing that the professor will get to know them."
Freshman,4,"Chico State is a really great college. It offers a great education with challenging academic courses. the campus is beautiful and green, and chico itself is an amazing town with plenty of character. Chico is famous for its party scene, but don't get distracted by that. many of the professors are caring and passionate."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is beautiful and the people there are so welcoming, I truly feel that its my second home. The only thing is that the actual city of Chico is a very small town. Coming from Southern California (the LA area) it was a huge change for me so I'm not used to everything being closed so early. But on the other hand it's a much tighter community filled with kind people. There are approximately 16,000 student enrolled but my classes are a decent size so I can easily get help from any professor."
Freshman,4,"Academics are excellent, as professors tend to want to see success amongst students. Chico is a fairly small, home-y town yet the party scene from students is a bit wild. On campus housing is not the most affordable option, and the food can become repetitive. Despite all this, Chico State is amazing. Professors, students and everyone else is kind and Chico is a great place to become a second home."
Junior,4,Chico State is very diverse and social. There are a lot of social activities going on and a lot of events and activities to participate in.
Sophomore,4,Chico State has a very beautiful campus and if you are someone whose into nature and the outdoors you will fall in love with the campus. The professors are great at their jobs and they really seem to care about students' overall academic success. This school could be a bit more diverse but overall it's a great school.
Niche User,4,Chico State University is a great school with a good sized campus and a great student body and teaching staff. I would recommend  this college to friends and family especially if you love California. Awesome parties too.
Sophomore,2,"Still paying full price for half the work of the school during the pandemic.  Tuition includes the gym, which we don’t use, the shops, which we don’t use, the janitorial work, which we don’t use, lab equipment(when you take a course) which we don’t use, and much more. I feel as if I’ve learned nothing online, in addition to that 90% of students are cheating on tests. It’s hard to keep track of assignments since teachers keep their assignment boards over different websites at times."
Freshman,2,"I think Chico State has a lot to work on. Classrooms and campus organizations are too ""left-ist"" while I believe that classrooms need to be as neutral as possible to educate instead of convince. Everyone submits into the bipartisanship that is currently tearing our country apart when we need to make an unbiased effort to educate and inform students and future voters. I think the food on campus is poor and lacks health. I think President Gayle lacks the punctuality needed to run an academic institution in the 2020 climate today. A pandemic really should have received a different response, not one different from every other university in California.
I already dread entering the workforce because I fear no one will take my Chico State degree seriously."
Junior,2,The teachers here are awful. Especially the accounting department. I’ve had to retake accounting multiple times as the final exam accounts for 40% of your grade. Beware these teachers also don’t do anything. They assign you an online school program to work on throughout the year and they log the grade the website shows you have in the school system effectively playing the system.
College Freshman,2,Well it's a good school but for now I feel overwhelmed and so alone. I really am missing home.
College Sophomore,2,I rarely see recruiters for nursing at my school. There is only the job fair once a year and that is the only chance that I have to speak with people in the field that I want to be in.
College Sophomore,2,It can be a hassle to room with a stranger. Bathrooms are dirty. Janitors try their best to clean. Its not fair to them because they are left with the nasty job of cleaning the students' mess. Noise goes through the walls. People are loud and RAs don't catch that.
College Sophomore,2,I've noticed some harsh entries to the Greek life. I wouldn't do it.
College Freshman,2,They dont care about the students and only want their safety
College Freshman,2,The whole school trys to party. It sucks
College Senior,2,I wish we had a football team
College Freshman,2,There is a Greek presence in school but since we are not a giant school the greek has a role in the community but not as big as other schools.
College Freshman,2,"When I am walking around campus it's fine. When I am out of the campus and wondering around Chico is what really scares me the fact that I can't go on a walk even during the day really bothers me because there are always weird men lurking around or staring at me. It's not only at night, but even during the day which is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"One night I was out with friends and I managed to make my over over to University Village which is another on-campus living option. It was a quarter to 2 o'clock and I called the police station asking if I could get an escort back to my room, the operator proceeded to tell me they stop running and 2 and that they only escort you back to your room if you meet them at the library, ON CAMPUS! The fact that they were not willing to help me, while I was by myself on a weekend that is considered to be not safe because people from out of town come, made my experience with them awful. I somehow made it home safely, but I would not try and ask for their help again."
College Sophomore,2,Depending on where you live it varies but if you are planning on living in the dorms make sure you pick a roommate.  I got paired with someone nothing like me even though they have us fill out a survey of what we like and want. I have multiple friends who had the same experience and it makes the whole school year very stressful.
College Freshman,2,"Average rooms. Loud people. RA's don't care enough that kids are illegally abusing drugs and alcohol in their own buildings. Chico State says they are a ""dry"" campus, but that is simply not true."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't party, but I always hear about people getting stabbed at parties or getting beat up."
College Sophomore,2,Lately the parties are not safe and lots of violence occurs.
College Freshman,2,"Enjoyable for many students on campus, but not for me."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is available but for the middle class there is only one program which just came out Fall 2014. It helps, but for those just above the middle class line it is not enough."
College Junior,2,It was a nightmare to visit my best friend in the dorms (both females). Parking is very scarce if you can't afford the reserved permit. Many open spaces of reserved parking and finding general parking is a pain. One time it took 30 minutes to find a parking spot! The administration has a set amount of days that a student can miss class but not all teachers follow.
College Freshman,2,The dining hours are inconvenient for late dinners. The food is tasteless. They often use the same food later in the week. It is hard to come by fresh raw vegetables.
College Freshman,2,On game days i don't hear much about them and advertising the games is not a huge deal. Evrybody is mainly focused on school.
College Freshman,2,In less then a week five cars were broken into at two of the school's parking structures. This comes to show that maybe a little more security needs to be placed so students feel safe and not feel threatened by criminals by having the feeling that they are being watched.
College Sophomore,2,"The only pro about living on campus was being surrounded by friends and being so close to class. There were too many rules and I felt like I was being treated like a child, not the adult I was."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not receive my aid until October of the school year and had to borrow money from my parents to pay for rent since my rent is paid by financial aid, and they did not disburse it to me. I did not fill out a form correctly and they failed to contact me about this."
College Junior,2,white white white white white white white white white
College Junior,2,"unless you tend on eating at a restaurant here everyday in downtown, fast food is relatively hard to get to if you dont have a car"
College Junior,2,"the athletics is not very popular honestly, everyone is in love with SF baseball here. school spirit is mediocre."
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes there are hiccups between the office and Federal student aid so it may take awhile to receive your aid. I hassled with the office for a portion of my aid for a whole semester and didn't receive it till the next semester.
College Freshman,2,Wish we had a football team
College Junior,2,High amounts of campus crime and sexual assault
College Junior,2,There are not that many African American fraternities or sororities on campus. I think Chico lacks racial diversity.
College Junior,2,"Drinking is expected. I am not surprised by the drinking on campus. It does not really annoy me, I think that depends on the people you associate with it."
College Freshman,2,many students take part in alcohol and drugs and peer pressure to use and drink. There arn't many social gatherings on the weekends where they arn't present
College Junior,2,Chico has been getting more dangerous as I've been here.  I don't know the crime statistics but it definitely seems as if violent crime has been on the rise.
College Junior,2,"Drinking and partying are popular extracurricular activities, but there are plenty of other things to do if you don't drink! A lot of people at Chico smoke marijuana and some take MDMA on a somewhat regular basis."
College Junior,2,"It's easy to walk around Chico and shop/dine/have a good time, but public transportation is AWFUL and inconvenient."
College Sophomore,2,"I want to live somewhere else, good lord, the food is great, but streets and drivers are dangerous and wild"
College Sophomore,2,Haven't seen any strictness of any kind as of yet
College Sophomore,2,"Noisy as hell, parties every weekends and never pick up after themselves, litter everywhere"
College Sophomore,2,"Not safe to walk alone at night, risk of your health is high in the dark, wouldn't recommend it"
College Junior,2,"As a freshman, I found the strictness of the dorms to be somewhat annoying. Constantly having to check in, no visitors on big weekends (Labor Day, Caeser Chavez, St. Patty's Day, and Halloween). But you learn to get used to it. Definitely not like any other school I've visited though."
College Sophomore,2,Strict. Can not ride on campus or have ay drug or alcohol affiliation
College Sophomore,2,No one goes to sports games. It is not advertised well.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is not easy to find or be accepted for.
College Freshman,2,"The majority of students take part in the social drinking atmosphere. But there is no pressure. If you don't like the nightlife at Chico, there are many alternatives. The school educates the students on drinking and other substances. Regardless students are still going to do it, so they want the students to always feel safe and aware of what is going on. I love the fact that they do this. I feel educated and safe when I chose to go out with friends. Knowledge, in reality, is power. "
College Freshman,2,I don't have a car because I live in the dorms and I here that parking is very limited.
College Junior,2,I did not like how varsity sports received the most money and attention from faculty and students. 
College Junior,2,The financial aid advisors were not that helpful and unfortunately I decided to enroll into Graduate school late so I did not make the FAFSA deadline. I am now taking out loans and applying for scholarships for this reason. 
College Freshman,2,"Parking is always hard to find,& inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"certain times during the day it is really hard to find parking. A lot of cars park in two spaces, maybe saving one for a friend which can be frustrating. Street parking is hard to find, almost every spot is taken. "
College Freshman,2,"everyone drinks heavily, especially freshman students. Cocaine and marijuana are the drug choices I see often. "
College Freshman,2,"For freshman, Sutter dining is your everyday place to eat. Breakfast is good, everything else is actually really gross. I have found myself not satisfied after eating in the dining hall too many times. They often reuse the meat for a few nights in a row and just throw it in different meals and call it some new name. The only thing you can really trust in there is the cereal. 

Creekside Cafe is really good and the other places on campus sell really good food. Basically if your a freshman your life sucks when it comes to eating unless you have extra money to spend on meals downtown. "
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall has very little actual edible food in my opinion.  The cafe that opens at 7pm has better food but I have no idea why it opens so late and then the line is really long, generally over an hour and I just do not have the energy to stand in line for an hour everynight to get a sandwhich.  I just go to my room and microwave a frozen dinner.  This has been the hardest part of moving out of my home...going from yummy home cooked meals to frozen crap and long lines for boring food that is high in fat and low in nutrition."
College Freshman,2,"The varsity sports that we have are not all that popular in terms of attracting large crowds.  It would be nice to have a football team.  However, despite all that, the WREC center for all students is really nice and I enjoy being able to use such a great gym as part of my tuition."
College Sophomore,2,"Not very diverse at all, Chico is a dominantly white school. "
College Sophomore,2,"It feels as if every girl here is a skinny blonde.  A lot of them are very stuck up and seem to only go to class to show off new outfits, however, as I take higher curriculum in my classes there are plenty of people who obviously take their studies seriously. "
College Sophomore,2,"The health center is great here, they will help you with anything! Chico is a little dangerous at night and even during the day but making smart decisions definitely helps out. Never walk alone at night kids."
College Sophomore,2,The food is edible but slowly gets worse as the year progresses. Latenight option is good and definitely the better option. It's only for a year (hopefully). 
College Sophomore,2,The buses are free with student ID which is cool but no one really uses them. Taxi's are cheap because you probably aren't going far (chico is small) so it'll be about $5. 
Sophomore,1,"Classes are so easy it's embarrassing. I'm doing nothing and passing with flying colors. I feel for the teachers, it seems like they're trying, but it's just not really working out."
Sophomore,1,"People only care about partying and you get shamed if you don't go out. Barely anyone cares about getting an education. People always say ""why are you at Chico State if you don't want to party all the time."" Diversity sucks, was told that I was the ""only hot Black girl at Chico."" Super offensive and messed up. Frats are a big part of the culture, but their parties suck. I've never been to one that I truly enjoyed. Girls are super cliquey. Classes were fine, but could easily pass them by doing less than the bare minimum. Athletics not a big thing at Chico. Dorms are disgusting, especially Whitney Hall. Never went a day without seeing some kid's throw up on the floor. Only good thing is that the campus is pretty. But that's it."
Freshman,1,Transfering after freshman year. It seems many people aren’t there for school and only seem to care about partying. Drugs and alcohol are everywhere just like most colleges it seems to be more of a focus rather than education. The girls are very cliquey.
Niche User,1,"WARNING!!!!
Parents!!! Never send your kids to Chico State.  DRUGS INFESTED. 
Your kids will never be the same.
Please, reconsider sending your kids to Chico State University!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
College Freshman,1,Teachers fdont care if we pass or fail. They care for their paycheck
College Freshman,1,There is no involvement. Just want money and to drink and smoke
College Freshman,1,They treat you like children and are just out to make you pay
College Freshman,1,"With only a 4/5 question room mate application, people are usually paired with room mates whom they become indifferent towards or who can't stand each other. Too many people from all the resident campus housing buildings resent their room mates/dorm buildings, and have switched room mates or, if that wasn't an option, have switched dorm buildings. The RA's here are in no way helpful and do not go out of their way to be there for their floor residents and do not enforce rules for the people who are too loud/get out of hand."
Recent Alumnus,1,"don't pay for friends, kids!"
College Freshman,1,"A bunch of parents sent their children to Chico State this year and they won't be returning home for the summer. Why? Because they're dead. If Resident Advisors and Campus Police did more to prevent ON-CAMPUS drug and alcohol abuse, this wouldn't happen. But here we are. Thanks Chico State."
College Freshman,1,"I hate partying so much. If you love partying, come here and ruin our school's reputation along with the rest of these idiots. My idea of a good time doesn't include drinking until you're sick, sexual harassment, and death. But that's just me. Apparently some kids love it."
College Sophomore,1,Dorms suck but necessary to meet friends.
College Sophomore,1,"So lame, RA's are super lame and are out to arrest you and get you kicked out of the school."
College Sophomore,1,"Worst food, no food available at night. Bring lots of cup of noodles"
College Freshman,1,SOOOOOO strict!!!!! Honestly are we adult college students or high school children?
College Junior,1,Parking is awful. The best option is to bike or walk to campus.
College Freshman,1,I hate parties and they happen all the time. There are parties every night except around finals time and there is an overwhelming amount of underage drinking.
College Freshman,1,I am from Southern California. SoCal has 75 degree weather all year long. I am not used to the 35 degree days and cold nights. The Fall is beautiful. The Winter gets as cold as 35 degrees during the day. I have yet to experience the spring weather at chico. 
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a drag and makes me not even want to drive because there are never any spots.  The parking permits costs are insane and not worth it. All the campus police do to ""make a difference"" is give out parking tickets."
College Junior,1,It's the most abuse drug here.
College Junior,1,"This school is white, plain and simple. Yes we have people of different race, economic background, political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientation, but that is a very, very small portion of the population here at Chico. You won't be looked down on for being different though. Everyone here pretty much doesn't care."
College Senior,1,"If you don't live within a mile of school and you have to drive, you better plan a half hour to find a spot, and then you have to feed the parking meter for longer than you think you'll be gone because the Meter Maids are VERY prompt."
College Sophomore,1,Alcohol and drug are highly prevalent on campus because students are trying to do the impossible and live up to Chico's old reputation.  The school tries to patrol the usage but they aren't very effective.
College Senior,1,would never live there on campus would rather live off
College Junior,1,"My university has had so many problems with the Greek organizations. Recently, the presidents suspended all Greek activity for several months in order to reevaluate each one."
College Junior,1,They are pretty strict about the drug/alcohol policy. Also the party and noise in dorms. Parking violations as well
College Junior,1,"Too many hazing deaths. However, things have improved greatly since alcohol cannot be publicly displayed in sorority and frat houses any longer. Campus police is making a stronger presence."
College Senior,1,"I am in the nursing program and if I had it to do all over again, I would NOT!!! The staff is fond of the saying ""nurses eat their young"", but the only place I have found that to be true is in the nursing school itself. Most of the teachers and the office staff are horrible, cruel people that, if they actually practiced nursing, would not be allowed to so much as give me a tylenol let alone a shot. They are cold and callous people who have no business educating caregivers."
College Freshman,1,"Dont drive, its a nightmare to try and find parking on camous during the day and into the evening"
College Sophomore,1,"There is a lot of drug use, but can be avoidable by choice."
College Freshman,1,There is only one dining hall on campus. The hours do not fit schedules. There are very limited options for food in the dining hall. There are very poor cleanliness habits. The food will sometimes be too cooked or not even cooked at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Its Awful – there are minorities, but there is not a diversity of them"
Recent Alumnus,1,"High Price, Low Quality – The food on campus is very low quality, and totally not worth its price. Its better to just hit one of the Hot Dog stands on campus, or go to Celestinos (right beside the campus)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They are building a new structure which will be completed when I am done attending, but currently the parking is terrible. If you get to the school after 8:30am you will not find a spot, at all, until around 11:30am and even then it is difficult. Paying for a permit gives you no special access to a spot and they generally fill up very quickly, so you may need to use meters, which also fill up very quickly."
College Junior,1,"The chances of finding a parking space at Chico State is unbelievable. The longest amount of time it has taken me to find parking was thirty minutes, missing half of class."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not Much Going on for Sporting Events – Not many people show up to the sporting events. Most likely because we are a division 2 school.
College Freshman,1,"Bros come here – If your looking to fight, drink keystone light and hook up with sluts. This is the school for you.
Don't get me wrong, you can always find your own type of group, but overall this college is made up of bros or wannabe bros that are looking for what i just detailed above."
College Senior,1,"Avoid Avoid Avoid. greeks live in their own world of working out, tanning, screwing, and drinking. its not an exaggeration to say that 95% are business majors who have a higher blood alcohol content than gpa."
College Freshman,1,"Kinda Sucks – As someone who had no option but to attend a local, cheap school, I absolutely despise my peers. The professors are genuinely interested in imparting knowledge, but the students are largely apathetic, banal, and ultimately self-destructive. This is a den of hedonism."
College Sophomore,1,There is not much transportation available to students. All they offer are free bus rides for students.

Freshman,5,Grandview is a very welcoming school and is very helpful with any problems you run into whether is be financial or studies wise they are always there to help.
Junior,5,"Being a visual learner, i was scared if i would learn anything online, but with the awesome professors and great faculty to make, any student grasp and understand the concept and better yet perfect the concept my online experience was great. All the faculty members took there time to individual update us  about class, keep us motivated through the tough time, and most importantly enjoy the time of learning."
Junior,5,"Being the first to go to my family in college is true experience and without having Grand View close to home i have no idea what University I would've attended. While my parents survived a civil war in Bosnia they decided to take upon a new chapter in there lives. Which is moving to a country of opportunity. My parents arrive in America with just the clothes on there backs and a plastic bag containing documentation and a equivalency of $500. They have fought and fought and worked harder than anyone else to give my sister and I the opportunity that they did not have. While looking for University I was just not quite ready yet to move away from home. Luckily thats when I found Grand View. This school has brought me to so much knowledge and power, and has made me invest 100% of my strength and power to be the person that I am today. Thanks to this school I have found my dream career choice and working as hard as I can to make that dream into a reality just how my parents did."
Freshman,5,"I overall have enjoyed my experience there so far! The professors, staff, and fellow classmates are all there to help me and other students pursue there dreams to the best of there ability and that's all I can ask. I'm grateful for being a Viking."
Senior,5,I loved the class size. I knew all of my peers and created friendships with them. We were able to help each other when we stuck in a certain class. It also helped our relationships with our teachers. I had a relationship with all of them and could go to them anytime I needed guidance or clarification.
Freshman,5,The school has been a great experience for me so far! The professors are helpful and class sizes allow for a personal experience. There are resources available for assistance. The dorms are dorms! Campus involvement is encouraged and there are a variety of ways to become involved and participate. They have a great leadership team that gets students involved! There is a very diverse population on campus! The majority of students are involved athletically as well! So far it has been a good experience and look forward to the upcoming years!
Niche User,5,"From the first day I called Grand View to tell them I wanted to go back to school, they were nothing but helpful. They got me in for meetings when I wanted to visit and determine if it was best for me to come back. I met with an advisor to go over how my credits would transfer in and what my schedule would look like for the school year. They gave me the advice I needed to help me realize I wanted to go back to school and help me with my next career choice!"
Freshman,5,"Grand View is  like another home, everyone is so welcoming and nice. The staff makes you feel like they need you there , they’re really supportive and outgoing . They try to make learning fun and they show how much they care about us and our future. There’s nothing i would change about Grandview ."
Freshman,5,"A small institution means there is a lot of chances to communicate with professors, classmates. A lot of activities are willing to welcome Freshmen and other students. Professors are very determined. Students can study anywhere due to a lot of seats in any buildings. Computers are available for students in order to study. Foods are tasty. There is also student lounges"
Niche User,5,I went on a visit and the students know each other and greeted each other in passing. Teachers also acknowledged them as they passed. I like the family-feel to this university.
Junior,5,It is very welcoming and the campus is small. You really get to know staff and students. It really helps people feel at home.
Freshman,5,"I love how everyone fits in somewhere, no matter what race, gender, major, etc. you are, everyone fits in. I also love how the administration is so helpful to new students, there are many sessions and opportunities for the new students to really get to know their school"
Sophomore,5,"I loved that Grand View University is a very welcoming college, you would expect to see  preppy college students when you first enter a college campus but everyone here is very friendly and makes it seem as a big family. One change I would like to see is more food options on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Grandview University is home.  After going to a different four year school my first year of college, I can safely say I feel comfortable where I am at.  I quickly found out that paying off college right away isn't worth sacrificing the entire experience.  Through Grandview University, I have found the correct place I belong and am able to thrive in my environment."
Alum,5,"Grand View University helped me discover my future career, which has been the most valuable thing I have gotten out of college! Without GV, I would be headed down a career path that I wasn't passionate about. Professors are helpful, available, and flexible with student athletes. I would highly recommend GV to incoming college students."
Freshman,5,"The overall atmosphere of the campus radiates friendliness! It has a sense of comfort while being away from home. The staff are super willing to help out in anyway to help with your personal success. The accessible resources on campus are super helpful, which can range from personal need to school need. I’m addition to the staff, all of the students on campus are friendly and inviting! There’s never any hesitation to talk to anyone or even ask questions. There’s a lot of cultural involvement at Garnd View including that of an organization from one of the staff members. Aside from the academic side of campus and the resources, the dormitory aspect of campus is more of the hangout place. While it is an area to get work done, it’s the spot at the end of the day for everyone to hang out, take naps, and just relax."
Alum,5,"I like the growth I experienced. Both in what I saw at the school and within myself. As a young adult on your own for the first time being self managed was an exciting and faith tested journey for me. I learned a lot about my personality. The one on one personal time you get with a school that small was amazing. However, when I was there it was a college.  But around graduation time it began to grow immensely in size and bells and whistles. Now it offers and competes with the big name schools all day."
Sophomore,5,"As I finished my first year here last month, everything has been great. The environment you are in is great, the people you meet is great, and the professors are great. Yes there are always the few in between that aren’t awesome but past that everyone at Grandview is pushing for success and it just makes you want to keep going and push through also. The only thing I would change about Grandview is to maybe expand the campus a bit more because the school is growing quite a bit and a few more dorms would never hurt a school."
Sophomore,5,"I think that Grand View is awesome because I have had a great experience, and very cool professors.  The facilities are really nice, and the tour guides were friendly when I arrived on campus.  Overall, I've had a great experience at Grand View University.  Go Vikings!"
Junior,5,I would like say the best thing about Grand View are the professors and other staff members. Every one of the professors that I have come across have been very helpful and what stands out the most is that they want everyone to succeed.
Freshman,5,Grand View University is a great place to start your college experience. This school overs opportunities that will benefit your future career goals. Grand View also offers great one on one attention.
Junior,5,I loved all the professors. Their expectations and support are right on point for adult learners! Always treated as an equal.
Alum,5,"Grandview University is a very welcoming University with a wealth of community service. Grandview is a small private college with the right class sizes and professors who care and make sure you achieve your goals/dreams! I choose Grandview for their diverse population and course offerings and a plus the campus is beautiful! I developed so much, and was involved with four campus organizations. And President Henning is a hands on President. I could go on about Grandview it was my best choice and excellent learning environment. I would invite everyone to take a campus tour to West Des Moines to visit GrandView University!"
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my time at Grand View University. The professors helped me feel prepared to continue my education after college. The sports team helped me grow as an individual and mature as an adult.
Junior,5,"From my first interaction on campus to now in the middle of my junior year, I have felt a sense of community at Grand View that I have never felt anywhere else. Grand View quickly becomes a home. The students, faculty and staff become family. Your major becomes your love. Grand View makes sure that every moment of your experience is memorable. I was scared as a commuter student that I would not feel a part of the community but student life quickly made me feel welcome. Grand View is the best college in my opinion. I would not have hoped to go anywhere else."
Senior,5,"Going back to school after being out of school for 15 years, I was scared. Des Moines Area Community College made me feel at home. Then attending an university, I didn't think it was possible. The class size are small, teachers work with you one on one, students are very helpful, and the campus itself is beautiful which makes for beautiful people. If they didn't have the faculty and students that they have, I'm not sure where Grand View University would be."
College Sophomore,5,"We do have an alumni network, which you can learn a lot from. Grand View does provide internships."
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are small which I love. I am able to speak up, know everyone in class, and get to know my teacher and have them get to know me easily. It makes me feel very comfortable. There are many courses to take at Grand View. The professors are very helpful and nice."
College Sophomore,5,It is very important at gv.
College Sophomore,5,Loved my dorm last year.
College Sophomore,5,"The athletics are very important at my school. I am involved and I love it. Many students show up for events, its great to have everyone come together."
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy my school. It is super friendly and many professors are super helpful. Many will even sit and eat lunch with you to talk about life. It is a school that is small, but very big when it comes to supporting each other. We are a big family and I'm really glad I picked Grand View."
College Senior,5,"So far I've loved all my professors, they have been kind and helpful. For the most part enjoyed all my classes, they've been pretty interesting."
College Senior,5,I feel very safe on campus and I've never even heard of anyone being assaulted.
College Sophomore,5,We have really nice on campus suites and apartments for students sophomore year and higher. They make staying on campus all four years enjoyable
College Sophomore,5,Student involvement at Grand View is huge! over 75 percent of our student body participates in some type of athletic team.
College Sophomore,5,My school is unique because it is a community of athletes. we all understand what it takes to be a student athlete and our professors work hard to work with our busy schedules
College Freshman,5,The campus security is very dedicated and hardworking when it comes to protecting the faculty and students here. They are always available if anyone ever needs them.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is really caring and just looking out for the well being of the student.
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of opportunities for both athletes and non athletes to get involved. Everyone is courteous and helps people when it comes to working out or going to the trainer.
College Freshman,5,I have no info on this
College Freshman,5,I am a commuter I live at home
College Freshman,5,I don't party and have no info on it
College Freshman,5,I haven't felt out of place
College Freshman,5,I like the teachers and small class sizes
College Freshman,5,I haven't stayed on campus bug what I've seen looks amazing
College Freshman,5,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,5,My school is very friendly and welcoming. I fit in and feel right at home.

College Junior,5,Everything at Grand View is about athletics
College Senior,5,It was very easy to apply.
College Senior,5,"I don't live on campus or party here. It doesn't appear to have a drug issue, although I'm sure it's around."
College Junior,5,We are national chaps in almost every sport and everyone plays a sport
College Sophomore,5,The best its close to the downtown.
College Sophomore,5,No drugs which is excellent.
College Sophomore,5,If you fill out all your paper work properly and on time the school takes care of everything 
College Freshman,5,"One of the best things about Des Moines is the food!  Immediately off campus there is mostly fast-food.  But if you go downtown or to West Des Moines, you find a large variety of food.  There are 2 vegan/vegetarian cafes, but most locally owned joints have great options.  We have a Zombie themed place, Vietnamese, Farm-to-Table, Breweries, and more.  "
College Freshman,5,"I would say the workload is average, but Grand View offers a great variety of classes.  While most of the professors are pretty liberal, they are open to other ideas and encourage diverse discussion.  The staff is very helpful, there is a lot of help available in the form of writing labs and math labs if you need help in either of these areas, free of charge.  There is the issue of the required ""seminar"" classes that are fluffy and not worth much at all, and a few professors that are scatterbrained as all get-out.  However, I believe that when I graduate I will have some of the best education this country has to offer under my belt.  "
College Freshman,5,"If you're over 21 (and I am.) there is plenty to do.  There is a lot of great music, local art, great food, and friendly people.  What you are looking for, you can find.  Not to mention that it is clean and safe.  I absolutely love Des Moines.  "
Junior,4,"Grand View has a pretty campus, buildings are walkable and you can always see your friends on the way to class. There are a lot of school activities, which let students involve at school and also the community."
Sophomore,4,"It is great small size university. I love how much attention and help I am able to receive from many faculty members. Many to all, the sports team bring in national championships constantly. I never have a problem adapting to my surroundings. Grand View is a fine University, and I would like to finish my degree here. If I were to have a problem with the university it would be that, tuition raises every year however the benefits or resources for students either decrease or stay the same. This is a problem with all universities and colleges, not only Grand View. It would be great when, the american collegiate system finds a solution to this problem. As students, we can only do so much to combat this. I fear that if this trend continues, college will be out of reach for many future students. On conclusion, Grand View has a great atmosphere and  is a superb university."
Sophomore,4,"It is pretty diverse for its size, just wish it were in a better area. Great class sizes and campus culture."
Junior,4,"Grand View University is a great place to go to school. It is a small, private college giving students the opportunity to make close relationships with everyone on campus. The class sizes are small allowing students to have more of a one-on-one with professors. This is a great places to make long lasting friends and prepare you for your future."
Niche User,4,I'm an incoming freshman and the orientation was just simply amazing. An a little fun fact I'm from Carrollton and the students and staff made me feel I wasn't that far from home. So it makes more excited to start my education in late August but the more I think about the less I can  contain my emotions of excitement. Hehehe😁
Senior,4,"Overall it's a great school, but there are a few setbacks that you learn about once you've spent time here. But I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything because I have met so many great people here."
Freshman,4,"It's an overall nice school with welcoming t
Professors and teachers. Most are very understanding of student struggles, and are more than willing to work with a student if they need help."
Junior,4,"It's been quite a wonderful experience. My professors are so supportive of my pursuits, no matter what direction they may follow. I feel as though I'm constantly being pushed beyond my boundaries and it's a wonderful thing because growth has been happening."
Sophomore,4,Grand View University is a great college. I believe they have a nice staff and a beautiful close knit campus. I have spent a year and a semester here and so far I loving my experience here. I am a student athlete and they emphasize the student part since we are here for an education.
Sophomore,4,"I am involved in the music program at Grand View. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved, from being a spectator at a sporting event to starting up or joining a club. Getting around in Des Moines is pretty easy too."
Junior,4,Most classes are good; enjoyable.  Some professors don't give adequate feedback even when asked.  Food is okay; awesome athletic program.
Sophomore,4,"Grandview University is an excellent college for anyone who wants the right blend of a private college, small class sizes, combined with dedicated professors, access to downtown Des Moines and comfortable living conditions.  It has an excellent athletics program and offers great scholarships for talented individuals."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my first semester at college at Grand View! The teachers got to know me personally and made me feel like I could go to them for help, whether it was for the class or for another class they didn't even teach. I got to know many people on the small campus which made the transition from home so much easier."
Sophomore,4,"Grand View University is a great college if you like small class sizes as well as sports. Grand View focuses a lot on student athletes, but also on those students not involved in sports. If you are coming from a small high school and want to keep you class sizes the same size, this is the school for you. I love the small class sizes because it allows the professors to get to know you, you are not just a number. My biggest class I have had consisted of 30 students. It is a closer knit atmosphere, where you cannot walk to class without seeing someone that you know. I love it here and would recommend this school to anyone that likes the close knit community along with the small class sizes."
Senior,4,"I love GVU!! It's just a great school with so much diversity, it's amazing. The classes are small and the professor actually knows you. The staff are outstanding. Over summer I had so many questions about my FAFSA and scheduling and the professor was always around and helped me and replied to my email ASAP. The atmosphere at GVU is nothing like I seen before. All the students talk to eachother there isn't cliques at GVU. Everyone knows everyone and they all get along. I'm so happy I chose Grand View to be the school I get my bachelors from!! Class of 2017!! "
College Senior,4,"I hear about internships frequently, and I've heard from employers that the graduates from this school are typically well equipped for the workforce."
College Senior,4,"The school is pretty expensive, but I feel like I'm getting my money's worth.  I've learned a lot."
College Freshman,4,There seem to be a lot of opportunities and the academic advisers have even brought career paths and what to do to my attention
College Freshman,4,The courses I have taken so far are great and the teachers are great because they care about you as an individual and what we have to say
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, partly because we are on good terms with one of the security guards. Campus is also sort of small so I don't feel very uncomfortable walking across campus"
College Freshman,4,"While the traditional style dorms are kind of crappy, every other housing facility is great, very nice living space and I don't feel like I'm staying temporarily. Residence Life is also good at having residence activities whether it be as a whole or activities as a building"
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are great, we have dedicated athletes throughout the school and the facilities are great for them and non-athletes as well. The school is also good at keeping up to date with sports news and rankings/games"
College Freshman,4,"overall experience is great, I've made a lot of great friends since going and met a lot of great people. There is a great sense of community and everyone helps each other out. There is no shortage of activities from the Student Activities Council and they find new and creative ways to have fun on and off campus"
College Freshman,4,The school does a large amount for the student to ensure they get internship and job opportunities during their time here. All alumni and emplyees are extremely nice and helpful and always show support for the students.
College Freshman,4,"The campus is great and everyone here is very friendly. All the teacher and advisors are really caring and helpful, they just want the best for their students. Overall Grand View does the best it can when catering to its students and pretty much gives anything a student may need"
College Senior,4,Professors care about the success of the students
College Junior,4,The atmosphere at Grand View University is great. The professors and other staff are all very friendly. The campus is neatly kept and always looks pretty. Instructors are great about having office hours and time for students to meet with them. There are also many free events for students each semester including free movie night at one of the local theaters and free ice skating.
College Junior,4,A majority of students at Grand View University participate in a sport. The fan support and student involvement is great. There are usually lots of students in attendance at different athletic events. The facilities where athletic events take place including the gym and football field are great and have adequate seating.
College Freshman,4,I haven't really had any problems on campus
College Freshman,4,It's very clean but there are a couple rules about using the facilities

College Sophomore,4,"Transferring from a large state school, Grand View has been awesome. The students and staff are so friendly. The class sizes are small, and the professors know their students names and care about how they do in the classes. The campus is always clean and well maintained. It is slowly starting to add new dorms and apartments. Their is always ample parking and you don't have to sell a kidney to pay for it."
College Junior,4,I love being a cheerleader and supporting our sports
College Junior,4,Plenty of pleases writhing walking distance to eat at .
Recent Alumnus,4,you're living in the middle of des moines - although it's not on the greatest side. couple of my friends and i had our rental home right behind campus broken into.
College Junior,4,Lots of choices around campus location
College Freshman,4,I've never heard of a drugs or alcohol issue
College Freshman,4,"Love my major, Great instructors"
College Freshman,4,Small class size and great instructors
College Freshman,4,Very low crime and very good security.
College Senior,4,"While there doesn't seem to have much diversity (we are in Des Moines, IA, afterall) everyone seems open to diversity."
College Senior,4,"I've never used these facilities, but they appear to be available easily."
College Senior,4,"The computers are a tad slow and the print limit is fairly low, but overall it's a decent arrangement. I've never not had a computer when it was needed."
College Junior,4,It is good but is about as good as my high school was.
College Sophomore,4,Many restaurants to chose from.
College Sophomore,4,"I drive back and forth since I am a commuter, but since I live close it's not too bad."
College Sophomore,4, Although they are strict they keep us safe and I like that.
College Sophomore,4,"It is located in a nice place where it take about 20 minutes away form the mall.
"

College Senior,4,"With a small department, theatre majors are given the opportunity to learn a wide variety of skills that are not offered at larger schools."
College Senior,4,The core requirements for a B.A. ensure each student has received a well rounded education by the time he or she graduates/
College Sophomore,4,I love living in Des Moines. The night life is great downtown.
College Junior,4,I am apart of the women soccer team at my school and you can tell that sports are a very big part of the school.
College Junior,4,I always see my school's campus security window open and always willing to help people. I also see them walking thru the dorms frequently.
Alum,2,Did not have the best experience at this school. I had tried to get into this school a couple years prior with no success for some reason unknown. So finally getting in was a relief because I needed to find a school but it didn’t turn out to be the best fit for me at all.
Niche User,2,Went there for a college visit and the tour wasn't all that good. Admissions workers are rude and have nothing better to do in their lives. They also spelled my name wrong.
Works Here,2,"Professors are great, staff is great! Benefit is small class sizes. Downside is lack of diversity. There are less than 1% faculty of color."
College Freshman,2,They don't have a following
College Senior,2,"The head of the Criminal Justice program is terrible. He is a terrible professor, very unorganized, not helpful, and doesn't understand the material in the classes he teaches. I've had to avoid him in order to actually make any progress in my area of study and I am very disappointed that he came to class one day boasting of a promotion when he isn't deserving of his position."
College Freshman,2,not much to do for 18 year olds
College Senior,2,"Extreme winter weather in Iowa (snow, ice, low temperature) causes problems with commuting as well as navigation around campus."
College Junior,2,When it it is cold it makes me not want to go to class. Being at a university you obviously have to walk quite a ways to class.
College Sophomore,2,Not a very good variety of foods in some dining halls.
College Sophomore,2,"It is really hard to get help. It is there, but it feels like options are pretty limited."
College Freshman,2,"My school offers some academic scholarships, and even more sports scholarships.  Generally, I am finding the process of getting scholarships to be a little rough.  Because I am older than the traditional student, but under 30, white, responsible, and in good health, I have yet to find a scholarship that is not based on a drawing.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade any of my statistics, but I would be happy if there were more opportunities for average people chasing a dream.  "
College Sophomore,2,It is in a bad part of town and i always feel unsafe walking around at night. It is scary 
College Sophomore,2,We don't have much space for parking. Our school is only going to keep growing and this problem needs to be fixed soon. 
College Freshman,2,If its cold and raining its not very fun to walk 10 minutes to class and have to wait at the stop lights to cross the streets. When its colder outside the heaters tend to work less and the rooms are cold. 
College Freshman,2,I would not chose this school because they lied when I came. They said it was safe it was not. Within the first month of being at the school and living on campus I got hit in the face by a man. There was no campus security around. None of them were helpfully. I can not sleep because of all the yelling at all hours and fighting. No one comes to fix that. We went month without heat and a month with no air. 
College Freshman,2,They have horrible food. That is unhealthy.
College Freshman,2,There safety on campus is not very good!
College Junior,2,"Not a whole lot goes on at night.  I only lived on campus my freshman year, but nothing really went on besides sporting events.  Some people partied, I choose not too.  Even the people who went to parties stated that we are not really known to be ""partying school""."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you're going to live off-campus, there aren't too many choices for apartments around the area.  You can rent a house if you can find one, or you can usually find an apartment as close as 10-20 minutes away, but for the most part, you'll definitely need to drive to class if you live off-campus.  A huge problem with driving to class is the amount of parking available.  There's not enough parking spots for all of the commuter students that the school has."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They have four places on campus. One is a starbucks coffee shop. one is a pizza and pasta place, which is probably the best out of all of them. They custom make your food when you order! Then the other two are so so. I enjoy the sub place but some individuals dislike it. Lastly, the general food location where there is actual seating is in a dorm building and always smells odd."
Freshman,1,I haven't had an expirience with online classes with Grandview yet but I'm sure they would be just has helpful as the in person classes
Senior,1,"I would not recommend the nursing program at Grand View!  What a cluster MESS!  Unorganized clinicals, Unorganized advising. Terrible experience. We as paying students should not have to know about all the troubles within the program. By the time it gets to us it should be ready to be put into practice. Very frustrated!!  Don't choose this school. Huge turn over in staff and no one knows what is going on!"
College Sophomore,1,We do not have greek life.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They don't even give full rides to their best athletes, and the financial aid I received wasn't even enough to make ends meet. I had to take out additional private loans on top of the gov. assistance"
College Junior,1,I don't get any aid and applied for the fasfa
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,After 9 oclock don't even think about finding a spot by your dorm. 
College Sophomore,1,"we do not have greek life at my school, i wish we did"
College Freshman,1,There is always parties going on a drunk people around campus. 
College Freshman,1,Campus security is horrible. They are never around.
College Freshman,1,They have public transport but it is always very difficult to use. 
Recent Alumnus,1,I know they have a few campus houses but other than that the university is surrounded by occupied neighborhoods.
College Freshman,1,"They help with a little bit in financial aid, but one wrong thing and they don't let you get financial aid at all and they try charging you for things you don't even need, or things that don't even pertain to you."
College Sophomore,1,The food is the same every Monday or every Tuesday and so on. They do not have healthy options and the food is bland. The workers arent happy to be there and they show it when you ask them for something. I wish I had my own kitchen to cook my own food. The food plans on campus are expensive and not worth it.
College Freshman,1,"I heard that two female students were raped on campus a few years back.  Then there was the kid who got beat up, wrapped in a rug, and thrown down the stairs.  There are no security cameras, and the security staff consists of two or three old men who drive around looking for parking stickers and making kids with cigarettes cross the street (god forbid that secondhand smoke make it across the huge parking lot, past the other sidewalk and entry, and into the building).  
GVU does not close on snow days,even when public school does, and will dock you points for not endangering your life in the snowstorms.  They expect you to attend schoo no matter what- I had a professor say ""everyone gets sick, everyone has death in the family, and everyones car breaks down- but these are not reasons not to skip class"".  Seriously, they will dock points even if you are sick."
College Freshman,1,"GVU is sneaky with diversity.  They offer student-athletes from England, Texas, and Hawii special scholarships toGVU just to make it look more diverse than it really is.  Mostly, it's a bunch of white kids from small Iowas towns."
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough space for everyone's cars. People's cars get vandalized and stolen.
College Sophomore,1,Grand View is on the east side of Des Moines and there are little to no available housing.
College Junior,1,"I hate this school's parking! For four dorm/apartment buildings, there is one continuous lot that is narrow. If someone lives in Nielsen, then they have great parking since it's the only big lot. Otherwise, you may have to park all the way by Nielsen to walk to the L apartments (in which you have to walk past the other dorms). For students who live off campus, there are a few large lots designated for them."
College Junior,1,"I wish there was a grade lower than 'F' for this part.  If I had known that the English major was for future teachers and people with 'reading concentrations' (whatever purpose that serves...), I wouldn't have chosen this major.  
I would like to be a writer in the future.  I write stories, commentaries, reviews, and articles.  I don't write poetry, which is what the writing concentration seems to focus on.  Also, it would be nice if there was more than one creative writing teacher.  I want to learn to write with my own voice, not with that of one teacher...
There is too much groupwork in this major.  I don't think that writing is a group activity.  And I feel restricted as to what I can write about, lest I offend some loud-mouth eighteen-year old farmgirl.  
One more thing: they have favorites.  It's not based on talent, but 'peppiness' and being outspoken.  As a writer, I am naturally kind of quiet, so I am completely ignored."

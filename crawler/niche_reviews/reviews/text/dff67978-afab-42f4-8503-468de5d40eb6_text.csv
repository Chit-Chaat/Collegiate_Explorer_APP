Graduate Student,5,The degree plan for the Graduate Online Cybersecurity program is manageable with your regular life schedule and work life. The Professors are easy to talk to and give amazing feedback to prepare you for a real life career. The thing I to be improvement is communication within the financial aid department between the advisers and the students.

Senior,5,If I had to do college over again I would choose Utica College all over again. From the time I stepped on campus as a first year student until my senior year I've seen the college change for the better. I was apart of an athletic team during my time here and I really enjoyed being able to play sports after college. The professors want to see you succeed and it's odd the Utica is the Mecca of New York where you will meet people who know you or someone you're close with.
Senior,5,"I will be entering my senior year this fall, and have to say that coming to UC has been one of the best decisions that I have made. From the moment I stepped on campus, I have felt welcomed and at home. From professors to the student body, everyone at UC works hard to really make it feel like home. The professors make it clear that they care about you and your success, and no matter what, there is always someone who is willing to help you on campus whether it be academics, financial issues, or work and the future."
Sophomore,5,"the staff and community on campus is like no other it really is like a big family on campus everyone knows everyone and there is always a helping hand where ever you go, i love this campus and i love everyone on it."
Sophomore,5,"No matter where you go, it is easy to complain about the food because it just isn't like being at home. With that said, if you are not happy about the food at UC, then you aren't asking for what you need. The chefs will make you whatever, even if it's not out. I'm vegan and they keep dairy free stuff in a special fridge, I just have to let them know what I want. They also recognized we needed more vegan options and created a vegan station this year of plenty of veggies and grains that I've even seen the football players sneak over too. The dining staff is very accommodating and here to help, I'm so grateful for their desire to make students happy and full."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Utica College and I wouldn't trade my decision for the world! I am so happy I chose this school. One of my many favorite things about Utica is the small class sizes. I am really close to a lot of my professors which is very helpful for me. I have always been one who excels when I can talk and ask questions during class. I never feel overwhelmed with having to ask a question or talk to my professor. All of my professors are always super helpful and they will work around my schedule. There are also times where my professor will even send me a text just to see how I am doing with an assignment because they knew I was having trouble. I feel like the education experience at Utica College is unlike any other college. Another thing I love about UC, is that there are always events going on. As students we are never bored and can always find something fun to do! I am really happy with my decision of choosing Utica College."
Niche User,5,I am planning on going to Utica College to earn my ABSN and hopefully start in May 2020 after I finish taking 2 prerequisites. So far the experience has been great.

Niche User,5,"During my visit to Utica, I was very surprised, and pleased with the overall friendliness of all of the staff. While at the open house for Utica, there were mant staff members, not only teacher, that went out of their way to make sure I have a fantastic tour of the campus. I saw the same recruiter on the campus while getting lunch, and he helped answer my questions, and help me and my family find the next spot we were going to. While on the campus, I visited both the Criminal Justice building, and the Construction management building. I was very impressed with not only the facilities where the classes took place for those majors, but also the teachers that taught those classes. It seemed as if all of the teachers were above qualified, and had years of experience under their belt."

This makes it easier to talk to them and even conduct research or come up with your own original ideas or follow your own inspiration for something.  
Without my professors I probably would not have taken the risks that I have taken. They have motivated me in every way possible and have empowered me to do the same for  the students that come after me. 
I also really love the campus because there are plenty of ways to get involved on campus. I started out in one organization and now I hold leadership roles in 5+ different organizations."

Recent Alumnus,5,Greek life is a big part of the campus lifestyle and students that aren't Greek are viewed like humans.

Junior,4,"The faculty and staff are really great. They expect you to work hard, but in exchange will work with you. I have had almost no problems since I enrolled."
Sophomore,4,Utica College has offered me the best opportunity to pursue my goal of becoming an occupational therapist. I knew that I wanted to come toUtica College because as soon as I stepped on campus it felt like my home away from home. The professors take time to get to know you on a personal level and they are always willing to help you. There is a close-knit community at Utica College that is hard to find elsewhere; I have made so many incredible friendships. The small class size is one of my favorite things about Utica College along with the amazing faculty and staff!

Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Utica College and I am so happy I chose this school. One of my many favorite things about Utica is the small class sizes.

I am glad I made the decision to come and I hope you will be too!"
Junior,4,I currently attend Utica College for accounting and I love it. I originally didn't come to UC as an accounting major and always had thoughts of switching programs but always doubted myself. With the help and support of professors I changed programs and have been successful with it. The professors here truly do have your best interest at heart and are always willing to help no matter what.
Junior,4,I go to UC for RN BSN (nursing) program and am currently in my third year and the program is challenging yet very high quality. My favorite part of it is the faculty and the proximity of medical centers. The faculty is willing to bend over backwards to help their students which is a huge benefit for me! The college is also surrounded my medical centers and hospitals where we can do our clinicals so there's no lengthy commute to get to clinical.
Sophomore,4,"Utica College has great professors that truly care about your education. The campus is beautiful and they have all the resources you could ever need. This school is great, especially if you are going to live on campus. There is always something going on for the students to relax and destress for a little bit."
Senior,4,I'm a transfer and I live off campus so it's a little difficult for me to judge certain aspects of the school but so far it seems pretty good. The science resources seem particularly strong and they have a good nursing program
Sophomore,4,"The staff here is so helpful and always ready to answer any questions. The campus is small so it feels like a community, everyone knows eachother other. The campus is clean and very well maintained. The dome is great, anyone can go and exercise or play sports with friends.

Sophomore,4,"Utica college is a good school and I would recommend it to other students. The professors are dedicated, the campus is very safe due to campus security always patrolling areas and there is much help available to students.

Junior,4,"My advisors and professors are always there to talk and help. My studies have challenged me to learn. The opportunities and programs are incredible. I have grown into the professional I am today because of UC.  Great school spirit, community, and professional."
Graduate Student,4,It's good for a diversity of different students. the professors are well-educated and have different ideas for each class you go to. Each class is very different and has a different of number of students in it that are among different age groups.
Sophomore,4,"It is friendly environment. The professors and office workers are all very understanding of you ever have a problem. Any time I’ve emailed a professor for problems such as finding cheaper books or questions about honework they have always given me great options that come as a benefit to myself. It’s a small campus which makes it very easy to know more people and navigate easily if you are new. The cafeteria has so many options and there are many healthy options as well. I am apart of a women’s fraternity that I recently joined so we are able to be involved in many on campus functions and provided by the school with anything we made need. I really enjoy attending this college. Although it is private which means higher costs for certain accommodations, they always try to find grants and scholarships to aid students if they are in need and will always try to find more ways to help their students."
Senior,4,I love Utica College. It is a small school where the professors know you by name and not by a number. It is easy to achieve great grades especially when you talk with your professor and ask for help before it is too late. There are many organizations and clubs on campus to get involved in. It is easy to make new friends as well.
Freshman,4,I loved Utica College because of its environment and its campus having a positive energy. The people who attend Utica are very friendly and have a lot of respect for everyone they met.
Graduate Student,4,"I have been enjoying my experience so far at Utica College, I started my MBA program this past summer."
Junior,4,Overall Utica College is a great college to attend. The professors are very nice and cater to their students needs.
Senior,4,"It’s a great atmosphere and a very athletic school. The only downfall is the downing at a hotel nearby called the Ramada Inn. It is dirty, inconvenient, and the students in the building all hate to live there"
Senior,4,"I've have attended Utica College for one semester thus far, I have nothing but excellent  experiences there. The advisers and the professors are very helpful keeping the students on tasks with their educational needs to graduate."
Junior,4,"Utica College, like any other college or opportunity is what you make of it. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved, make friends and have fun. The staff and students are friendly and the facilities are good. Would recommend having a car to explore."
Junior,4,"I love that Utica College is an accelerated nursing program. The program is only 16 months and has a high passing NCLEX score. However, because the program is accelerated and you're doing in 16 months what others do in 24 months it is very intense. There is a lot of work including clinical which you begin in the first semester. You have to stay positive and stay focused but graduating early is worth it."
Sophomore,4,"What i like about Utica College is how diverse it is and the wonderful professors they have. The campus is small and in that way everyone knows each other and is a family. Where the campus is located is quiet and peaceful. i love that there is always something going on to keep students occupied and the campus vibrant. my dislikes about Utica College is lack of supporting of each other organizations or group. Although we are one big family, students differ to come out to help and be apart of something great."
Freshman,4,I love everything about UC. It’s what you make of it. Classes are the perfect size and you can get the help you need. Fun too
Junior,4,I love the environment of this school. It has such a large diversity and safe environment for everyone. The counselling services are amazing and offer great support making the transition from home to school easier. In addition the school is very accommodating to the needs of all students.
Graduate Student,4,"In the masters of healthcare administration program. Great courses in a variety of healthcare management, finance, Quality improvement, marketing, etc. That I really feel will prepare students for leadership positions in healthcare."
Sophomore,4,Utica college provides a great environment for undivided attention towards academic studies and allows the students to be independent responsible adults while still managing to provide plenty of activities.
Junior,4,"Utica College is a small, diverse environment. It's a very accepting institution where the professors know your first name. The classrooms are small, there are always things happening on campus that can keep people away from the party scene. But, there is always parties going on if that is what you're into."
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience at Utica College has been very positive and everyone is very supportive and helpful with whatever you need. Safety is the number one priority on campus and is very secure. Housing is iffy because there are two dorms off campus but are considered to be on campus so you have to drive or walk to campus for classes. The food is not the best, however, it is decent some days and once you figure out what is good and what isn't, you will be good to go. The entire campus is extremely diverse as well and there is a club/organization for everyone. Sports are also very big here and the games are usually very exciting. The classes are challenging but manageable and have good learning environments."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the small close knit community and the small class size throughout the school. The campus is very lively and growing constantly, with the addition of a multi-million dollar sports complex, our programs are looking to win championships with the access to this state of the art facility. I'd like to see the campus network of roads more connected, however the campus is small enough to walk in 10 minutes or less."
Freshman,4,"Utica College is amazing. The staff work hard together to make a sure students get involved in the activities on campus, as well as their grades. I would love to see a bigger variety of activities to do."
Freshman,4,I liked that the college is small and there are not that much students that attend the college. The professors help you if you need it.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the size of Utica College. The small class size allows me to really make friends and get to know everyone in each class I am enrolled in, including the professors. The price is just like any other college and there is plenty of different scholarship opportunities. "
College Sophomore,4,no issues that i am aware of.
College Sophomore,4,mostly student athletes. very sports friendly
College Sophomore,4,"Enjoyed Freshman year. small, student-athlete orientated"
College Junior,4,Utica College is giving me the experience that I don't think I would have at any other college. It has given me a clearer idea of what I want to do for my future career path. I now have experience in the fields that I want to pursue after college.My journalism professors are very experienced in their field and have given me valuable advice and critiques to my work.
College Sophomore,4,I know finding a job I will be happy and successful in will not be a problem
College Sophomore,4,Campus Safety could be less strict on alcohol and more on assult
College Sophomore,4,Other than the occasional disturbance of quiet hours and the community bathrooms it was nice
College Sophomore,4,I love the gym! Except varsity Athletes have more power when it comes to use of gym equipment during certain hours
College Sophomore,4,"I love it there is a wide range of different people, all the proffessors I have had are awesome, it is everything I wanted in a college."
College Sophomore,4,I love the small school feel at Utica College. Even if you don't know a lot of people it feels as though you have a connection with all the students because of the size. The professors take a great deal of interest in the students on campus. They are most personable and show a great deal of passion for their fields.
College Freshman,4,"The office of career center sends a mass email every month of the networking nights and other events they're hosting. This office works very hard with students who come in and offer a lot of convenient options such as how to build a resume, they produce free head shots and business cards, and you can even go in their and have a fake or mock interview for practice if you're nervous. This office also works with students and alumni up to 5 years on setting up jobs or internships."
College Freshman,4,Utica puts more effort into athletic facilities than academic buildings.
College Junior,4,The athletic department at Utica is very clean and organized.
College Freshman,4,"I work very hard in my classes! I'm on sports teams, but my school work always comes first."
College Freshman,4,"Being in the nursing program, I know I will be able to find a job once I am out of school. The medical field is always in need of workers."
College Freshman,4,"I commute, but my friends dorm room is comfortable!"
College Freshman,4,We have a dome! Come see our dome 2016 freshmen!
College Freshman,4,I have the best grades I have ever had!
College Freshman,4,It's nice. Hard to manage all that I'm doing but definitely worth it all
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletics are students as well as members of the sports team. Athletics are treated just like non-sporting students and they are obligated just like everyone else to do there best in the field as well as off the field in the classrooms. There isn't any special attention or treatment given to the students that participate in sport activities and the whole school support and provide great school spirit to the teams at Utica for there hard work and dedication!
College Sophomore,4,"Here at Utica College there are rarely and crimes. There are always campus safety in place is an event was to occur. I housing, there are always campus safety offices on duty through out the night so i feel pretty safe while living on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Thus far, I have not had a professor that is not willing to help me succeed in their class. Every professor is willing to help. They also do a great job at explaining the class material. Some professors even come up with creative ideas on how to understand some of the work."
College Sophomore,4,"Utica College is very popular for their nursing and law program. In each field, each student have to complete an internship. This give each student a chance to get their feet wet before jumping into the field. this also give them an opportunity to potentially secure a job at the firm or organization they are interning at."
College Sophomore,4,"housing is very nice at Utica College. The building are always clean, and they are not far from the school buildings. I rather to live on campus than commute"
College Freshman,4,Class size isn't that big
College Freshman,4,Greek life is important here
Junior,2,"Not the best experiences, I came in with high expectations and was very disappointed with most outcomes."
College Freshman,2,"There is some diversity. The problem is, cliques form around them. Therefore, if you're not part of a certain ethnic 'club' then you don't have friends that are. Usually."
College Freshman,2,Rape has just become so common I don't even know what qualifies as rape anymore.
College Freshman,2,"The campus doesn't allow or approve of many Greek related things. The parties are crashed, greeks need to go through jumps and hurdles to get an event approved, they're not allowed to all live together on campus, their letters are not allowed on their houses (which are apartments located off campus because again..greek housing is not supported on campus), and there are probably 2 or 3 sororities and fraternities to chose from if you're interested."
College Freshman,2,They do not have a lot of the fraternities or sororities that people wanted to pledge.
College Senior,2,I commute but I've seen the dorms and they're tiny.
College Freshman,2,The dinning areas that are off campus are so far away. And they don't give student discounts. The cost is pretty decent.
College Freshman,2,It's not bad but it's not great
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of parties
College Senior,2,"There is not many options for an African American Student, All organizations are community service org honors society or predominantly white or latino"
College Freshman,2,"Rooms are tiny and cramped, no one pays attention to quiet hours. Don't even get us started on the bathrooms."
College Freshman,2,You could be brain dead & still graduate this school
College Freshman,2,The city itself is not in good condition.
College Sophomore,2,Internships are pretty much up to yourself to look and find one. It is extremely hard on the student
College Senior,2,Utica doesn't offer much financial aid unless students are REALLY in need.
College Senior,2,"Utica College isn't known to be good at sports generally, so not many people attend the events, other than football usually. The Athletic Center doesn't meet the demands of all of the teams offered at Utica: There is constant fighting for practice time , the pool is drained almost every month, and the track and field team has no track."
College Senior,2,"Greeks don't do much on campus. They throw parties. Some do beneficial events, but they are either scarce or unadvertised.  Utica has no special housing for Greeks either, which is odd because some of our tuition or some of the money that the Greeks raise should probably go towards that specific area. Otherwise, if Greeks did broadcast their membership by wearing their letters everyday, you would never know them from non-Greeks."
College Junior,2,"It's ok, but not what I would choose"
College Junior,2,No room for negotiation once you are in the door
College Senior,2,I do not like the financial aid process at Utica College. They have no idea about the programs at UC and how they can impact your aid.
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many parties they are usually private or invite only kinda things but there are ""clubs"" that people go to"
College Freshman,2,They are not strict at all in the dorms. You can always smell weed and see alcohol use but no one does anything about it. 
College Freshman,2,Although the school does offer generous funding it is very often heard that students are having trouble with the financial aid department. It seems to be a bit disorganised and can take a significant amount of time to get issues resolved. 
College Freshman,2,"Overall, Utica College is not the worst school. However, the lack of student enthusiasm and appreciation of the school as a whole brings it down. There is little participation in events and you constantly hear stories of students who wish to transfer. This can bring down the energy as a whole and can make for a less than enjoyable experience. "
College Freshman,2,Many of the students have little or no school spirit. This makes the social life boring as even when the school holds events it is rare that many students participate. 
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do surrounding the campus. This is especially true if you don't have a car as public transport can't get you to many places so you will have to resort to taking a taxi. 
College Junior,2,They need more options during dinning hour and especially more late night options. 
College Freshman,2,I wish there were more options. There are only like two places where students that are 18-20 can go.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't live in off campus housing cause I don't want to walk even farther from my classes.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life isn't big here. Some of they don't even own a house, only like 10 at most in my school and only like 3 of them have parties."
College Freshman,2,I usually take cabs when I go out because it's too cold to walk and the cabs are expensive.
College Freshman,2,"There's needs to be more parking spots available.
 "
College Freshman,2,My schools very expensive and my mom is struggling to pay.
College Sophomore,2,Not enough parking for the student body
College Junior,2,The landlords buy old houses and split them into as many rooms as possible.  Even a closet can be a room
College Junior,2,"The school buildings are mostly older and out dated, the bathrooms are always dirty but the criminal justice and athletic buildings are brand new. "
College Freshman,2,"Cost of living off campus is pretty high. There is also not much variety for students. They're better off staying on campus. Living on campus is a cheaper and more convenient way, especially safer. "
College Freshman,2,People dont really give a s***
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many appetizing choices. Produce such as lettuce and tomatoes are not very fresh.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid can be very annoying, but for the most part they try to help. Regaurdless its a process you have to brace yourself for."
College Freshman,1,Campus safety is more worried about finding a beer can in your garbage than finding a black-out-drunk freshman girl in a junior lacrosse or football players room about to get smashed and not even remembering it.
College Freshman,1,"Campus Safety treats you like you don't even live there... You have to sign in every single time you come into a dorm hall after 8pm, and they will often give you a hard time."
College Freshman,1,"We have two nationally recognized fraternities, one of which is not recognized by the school...(TKE.. although it should be because it's more of a frat than AXP ever would be)... and one fraternity that is local, and it's not even really a fraternity.. APD..  They don't do anything at all.  It sucks.  The sororities kind of clique themselves away from society.."
College Freshman,1,"If I were a senior in high school again, I would most definitely throw my application to Utica College in the trash...  More than half of the students here are from NYC and you feel unwelcome in most occasions because they already have their niche and culture.  There are barely any events the school holds that have more than a $500 budget for the school.  Campus Safety is on your skin every second and you live in a hostile environment where you need to sign in with either famous safety or an RA at every single front desk of every single dorm hall.  The food is Sodexo, if you don't know what that is, it is one of the worst companies I have ever eaten from.  I'd rather have road kill.  Athletics is honestly a joke.  I played baseball, and half of the kids who are on the Division 3 intercollegiate team, would have been cut from my 500-student public high school.  I'm trying to be nice about it.  Utica College is run-down as is the city.  Townies take over all the bars except the Finger Bullet.  House parties are tightly-packed in small apartments that get shut down by the police.  Fraternities and Sororities are all on thin ice and can be unchartered with even the smallest mess-up.  They aren't even supported by the school so they have to find their own housing off-campus in sketchy Utica.  Most juniors and seniors are barely seen on campus because of the cost of on-campus living, and the value of freedom from campus safety even when your legal.  I can almost 100% guarantee Administration will screw up on your housing selection forms when you apply for housing your sophomore year.. I know at least 100 friends who were screwed over.  Please read.  It is important for your future.  You do not want to make the mistake of wasting thousands on a school in Utica, NY.  Did I mention I've had a knife and a gun pulled on me from NYC students?  Oh, and a sweet blonde girl on the third floor of South hall was being chased by another NYC student with a knife.  Oh, and rape. Oh."
College Freshman,1,Try not to get shot.
College Junior,1,Weather is cold and messy for six months.
College Freshman,1,The food at Utica College is awful. There is variety but none of the food is good. Your best bet is to visit the wrap station but that is only open on the weekdays. 
College Freshman,1,It's hard to find a good party and you need to send a lot of money just on transportation 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Online courses are awful. Very little liberal arts to choose from considering the amount of liberal arts you have to take. Cost of online is high and just went up again. Facilitators of the courses are very rarely online, do not answer all your questions, and rarely give advice that is of any use. Syllabus is vauge and tests are confusing.Also the courses that are similar have very different needs depending on who is proctoring the course."
College Freshman,1,even the hot girls are beat
College Sophomore,1,I live in a dorm that constantly reeks of marijuana and there is no one that enforces it. It was the same way last year in a different building.
College Freshman,1,I don't travel into town because there isn't anything to do there.
College Sophomore,1,"Too Strict – There's an understanding that we all need rules, but the punishments for little problems here and there a far past unnecessary. Campus safety is pretty cool well some of them, but when the head of security is around or the head ra is around sneezing to loud is a problem."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Hardly Any – No houses and lame rushes.  Don't bother, not worth it"
College Junior,1,"Hard to Get Around – The bus system is confusing.  Taxis are extremely expensive, and every off-campus activities is too far away to walk.  Basically, if you do not have a car, you cannot go anywhere. This is very inconvenient."
College Junior,1,"Not Enough Labs and Not Enough Support – There are many labs on campus, but they always have classes in them; therefore, they are not very accessible.  This makes the few open labs very crowded.  The WiFi often disconnects when you need it the most.  But my biggest peeve is that the Help Desk is not able to work on or even look at student laptops.  Many other schools have this, and I feel like I am being robbed."
College Junior,1,"Divided and Isolated – The Greek Life is very choosy.  Many of the people involved in Greek Life have a specific personality.  There is little variation, which make them even more isolated.  They never interact with other individuals.  The keep friends mostly with other people in their Greek organization.  They offer little chance to join, except if you are related or already a friend of a current member.  They rarely have any events that involve other students besides their own members.  All the Greek organizations are divided from eachother and the rest of the campus.  They keep to themselves, which prevents them from growing in size and in character."
College Freshman,1,North and South Hall residence halls parking has been pushed down the parking lot. South hall is in front of North Halls front door and North hall is now in a parking lot further from North. Since we have so many commuters coming and going the parking has suffered for students with cars that live on campus.
College Junior,1,"there rally isn't a night-life, but everyone usually goes to other frat houses."
College Junior,1,Greek life is available to students but only certain ones are actually available at the school.  You can pledge for other ones that are not on campus but it makes things harder.  There is no Greek housing available.

Junior,5,"In my short time at UMC I've been blown away by the support I've received. From instructors going the extras mile for me to my baseball coach and advisers being truly dedicated to helping me succeed as a student-athlete here at UMC. The thing I most enjoy about UMC is the family enviroment. I certainly don't feel like just a student, my instructors know my name and story. And they want to do every thing they can to help me achieve my goals and graduate. I'm so glad I have the opportunity to study in a small town like Crookston. I would recommend studying at UMC as a student or student-athlete as UMC is also strong in a variety of spots and has great facilities for dealing with the colder winters."

Freshman,5,"Nice quiet campus out of the way, good solid classes, workable work load but challenging, very hands on, big on critical thinking. Dorms for freshmen are NICE. The older grades get kinda cruddy dorms though. Diversity is excellent. Agriculture department is very strong. Big study abroad department. The local area is pretty sparse, but there is a lot to work with on campus. Winters are cold. Would like warmer winters. Nothing worth complaining about, 5/5. If you go there for an Ag or Business degree, you will be will get a good education."

Sophomore,4,Attentive admissions staff and guidance counselors. Highly recommend for any working professionals seeking to continue their studies and/or complete higher education.
Niche User,4,It is a very small school with a very student-based system.  All students with more than 6 credits a semester get a laptop through their technology program.  They have a great equine and AG program as well.
Freshman,4,"Minnesota Crookston is a great place to go to school. The faculty is always willing to help, and you receive a great education. If you live on campus, the housing is affordable and very nice. The meals are decent and offer a variety of food options. The school offers many scholarships to help students pay for college. Crookston is a small town, but if you are looking for something to do you for sure can find something! If not, Grand Forks is a quick thirty minute drive away!"
Freshman,4,"It is a small university, but I actually like that. It has an amazing animal science program and equine science program. They have wonderful hands on experience, and the professors are all really nice and easy to talk to. The only downside to it is the small town; there is not much to do in town."
Freshman,4,It is a really small school and I enjoy that. But the small size has its downsides. Word travels fast and there isn't a lot of diversity except the international Japanese students. The professors that teach generals suck so I would go to a community college.

Sophomore,4,The University of Minnesota-Crookston is a very unique and inclusive environment. Everyone at Crookston is very encouraging and friendly. The University of Minnesota- Crookston is like a second home!
Senior,4,"The University of Minnesota Crookston is a very small campus. During my stay here we hovered around 800-1100 on-campus students. The small student body may not be for everyone, but it does allow for a student to have opportunities that a larger campus may not. Being able to get involved in lots of clubs and professor created projects allows for a student to grow and learn outside the classroom. Getting connected with the different higher administration and utilizing their opportunities is very common here on campus, as a fraternity president I have been able to meet with the Chancellor many times to talk about student engagement and university programming. The professors are very well trained and teach their courses very well and are available for 1 on 1 help which wouldn't be available usually through a larger institution."
Freshman,4,"The U of M has been good to me, everyone is easy to work with to solve problems. Teachers are understanding and work with their students to understand the material and not just be ready for tests."

Everything about the UMC is great. "

College Sophomore,4,I think that the campus does a good job making sure students feel safe and are well taken care of.

College Sophomore,4,Our program contains many hands on learning opportunities that I really appreciate as a student. The class sizes are small which makes for a great and more personable learning environment. We have a horse barn right on campus with full access to the horses for classroom use which is extremely helpful when studying the animals in lecture.
College Freshman,4,parking permits are reasonably priced for students and usually there is a spot close by housing.
College Freshman,4,UMC has a high responsibility standard for all students with a no tolerance drug and alcohol policy for the entire campus

College Sophomore,4,"The public transportation is pretty good, mostly things are in biking distance."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many interesting clubs, there are alot of interesting people that attend and teach at this college. The small town atmosphere is great!"
College Freshman,4,"Athletics department could be better, especially the field, and the field house. The fan support could be better, then again we are in a very small town. School spirit is good."
College Freshman,4,"I wanted a small campus environment but a big degree. So when I was offered a scholarship there for football I accepted, but had second thoughts of the cold cold weather.  It has great academics, and great value but not a great location. The professors are pretty cool, and workload is not too heavy, since we work mainly on our computers, which was given to me and all athletes. The study area is great."
College Freshman,4,I am majoring in animal science and equine science. So far all of the professors that I have had have all had personal experiences. We do all kinds of hands on work with animals and we get to see exactly how to do things before we get a job in our field of study. Also all of the professors in these degrees are very laid back and easy to go and talk to about anything.
College Sophomore,4,The transportation  is really good for a small campus. The  options include a taxi and a bus to and from town.The taxi is 5 dollars at anytime and the bus is handy for going into town. You can also walk into town as it is not very far and it is really good exercise.
College Senior,4,Well Respected – The movie theater in town provides free movie nights for students every Wednesday of the week.
College Senior,4,Easy to Get Help – If you are having troubles with your grades there is a AAC where students can get help between 8am-4pm. There are also tutors for variety of classes. All you have to do is ask for help.
College Freshman,4,"Totally Amazing – The professors are great, highly flexible, and know you by name.  The majors offered are very limited, but for a student wishing to go into anything agriculturally related, I believe there is no better choice anywhere on earth.  There are plenty of options available for independent study, the registration is extremely simple, and if you are highly motivated you may be able to graduate in 3 years."
College Freshman,4,"Cheap Housing – The housing off campus is extremely affordable, as well as comfortable.  The small town atmosphere also makes you feel cozy if you are used to country or small town life.  Being in such a small town, both apartments and housing are very cheap."
College Sophomore,2,"When its not snowing or super freezing, its great!"
College Sophomore,2,I don't really do anything with Greek life at the university. I do know they have a club which people who want to join can.
College Freshman,2,"Winter Is Bitter Cold – It is Minnesota, so you can expect it to be bitterly cold and snowy the entire winter.  This is especially a pain if you are an aviation student, as you are dependent on the weather for progression in class.  I would rate it a D, but because almost all of the building are connected by walkways, and the parking lots are close to the buildings, I bumped it up to a C."
College Sophomore,2,Night Life??? The night life at school is not the best. If you want to have fun and party go out and get something to eat go to grandforks.
College Senior,2,"First of all, my school is located in very small town. It's a very small school like a high school size. Only few bulidings and facilities are poor than my high school. (I graduated high school in cities)"
College Freshman,1,"A Unique Experience – For those who like small towns, Crookston is where you need to be. It is quite picturesque, green, and beautiful in the summer. Biggest attraction is definitely our famous summer parade."
College Freshman,1,"Our schools athletics aren't good at all, nor is the fan support but we just got a new football coach so hopefully one of our teams will be decent."

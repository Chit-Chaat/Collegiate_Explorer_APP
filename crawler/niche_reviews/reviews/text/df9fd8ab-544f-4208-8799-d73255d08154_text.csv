Alum,5,All of the professors are awesome and are really there to make sure you succeed. The science department is full of great people that are so easy to talk to to get help.
Alum,5,"Loved the atmosphere and the people here. Great school! Not the best nightlife, but the vibes are great."
Senior,5,I like Saint Mary’s because of the great network and the connections that I have made while I was here. It helped me get a job and advance my career.
Junior,5,"Wonderful sense of community, love the people, the campus, and everything about the school! Everyone knows each other, and there are so many great resources to get help when you need it. There are easy ways to get accommodations if you need help with certain things, and this has helped me the most during my time at SMC. The class sizes are small, so you really get a good learning experience and good, quality time with your professor. They do a great job at getting first year students the help and advising they need, and by the end of my first year I felt really good about myself and the decisions I was making at school. Out of all the professors I've had there so far, there has only been one that gave me a hard time. Everyone else has been great, and you can really tell that these professors care about their students. It's super easy to get help, and it's really a good feeling to be out in the community and having people recognize that you go to SMC."
Freshman,5,"I am just finishing up my freshman year here at Saint Mary's and I have enjoyed it tremendously! The education here is unbeatable with the small class sizes and great professors this school has to offer. The community here is very tight knit and there's lots of ways to get involved whether that's clubs, athletics, social events, etc. The best part about Saint Mary's is that the college is growing and only getting better on all aspects."
Freshman,5,"This college is truly one of a kind. With the small class sizes, amazing teachers, and strong school spirit, I really couldn't see myself at any other college.  I believe Saint Mary's gives me more than just an education."
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising junior at Saint Mary’s and have such an amazing two years here. Starting with small class sizes, and the bonds I have created with my professors has made my learning experience really enjoyable. The community that we have on campus makes it really easy to make friends, and get involved all over campus! There is something for everyone, with how inclusive our campus and community is. I have made amazing friends, who I know will be in my life forever."
Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at SMC, it has taught me the value of small classes with professors who really care. SMC has given me the opportunity to pursue my academic goal of double majoring with a great support system. Additionally, I feel that there is always something fun to do as long as you know where to look. I cannot imagine having gone anywhere else and enjoying college as much as I have."
Sophomore,5,"SMC has become my home. With the help of my advisors, I found a job and found my ideal major within my first year of college. I've made the most amazing friends through the SMC community and no matter where I am on campus I always know someone. A common question is about the party scene, and the honest answer is if you're looking for it, you'll find it easily."
Junior,5,"I'm finishing up my third year at SMC. I am going to be completing two majors and a minor during my four years. Every summer I've been able to get an internship in my career field. I am not nervous about getting a full-time job when I graduate in 2021 because of the skills, experiences, and networking SMC has prepared  me with. 
I've also had lots of fun during my time and I know I've made lifelong friends."
Senior,5,"I'm now entering my final semester and will be graduating from St Mary's going straight into a job. I'm thankful for how St Mary's has supported me throughout my 4 years and setting me up to be post-grad ready. I have loved every single minute of it since the start. From fantastic professors, helpful faculty/staff, to life-long friends. It saddens me to this day knowing that I will be graduating and leaving all this behind. My advice to everyone is to not be afraid of taking chances!"
Niche User,5,"This school allows you to grow in areas you didn't expect to and the teachers are very supportive. Class sizes are small, students are friendly, and the campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,"I graduated here in 2016 with a degree in Politics and a minor in English. I left to get a graduate degree and am now back working at the College.

This place changes lives and am so happy to have made so many lifelong friends and family here. Looking back on my experience, I could not imagine spending four years of my college career anywhere else."
Alum,5,I can wholeheartedly say that Saint Mary's has been the best investment I have ever made! I truly enjoyed every minute I spent on campus. I made lifelong friends and was offered so many different opportunities that have made me into the person I am today!
Sophomore,5,"Saint Mary's provide hospitality to students. The college is well-known as having a splendid campus. Faculty members are always helpful and willing to serve the students' needs. Students are passionate, focused, and respectful of each other. The Lasallian spirit that the school highlights empowers the students in preparation for their future. A great school that changes lives."
Senior,5,"SMC is an amazing school but don’t expect a big school experience. Based upon “the great books program” its platform teaches you to think deeply and critically. I am a senior and the school is well connected. I just got into Columbia law school and I attribute this to SMC, the caring professors and the tight knit community for getting me through. 

Highly recommend if you are an extroverted introvert. If you like being healthy and don’t need a frat or sorority- my observation is that you’ll thrive here.

I will say, there are a lot of entitled students here. I think they allow some rich kids to pay for the other kids so they let them in. Some are quality, some are not. 

They also went a little overboard with equality, which is good but there’s been a bit of an increase of riffraff or less than serious students."
Alum,5,I had a very positive undergraduate experience at Saint Mary's. I loved how tight-knit the community was. I loved that it provided many opportunities to become involved on campus and with the community. I loved that it had many different courses to choose from. It was very easy to change majors.
Alum,5,"I still treasure the four years that flew while at SMC. I actually wanted to go to SCU but SMC gave me a huge scholarship. In short, SMC is all about what you put into it. Weekends are dead, but that’s what the BART is for. The location is amazing. Beautiful rolling hills and near the big city. I was well prepared for law school and before I attended law school, I worked for four years in NYC and made over $150k my first year. This school teaches you to think when you open yourself to it."
Graduate Student,5,"Awesome school! Its small you get to know all staff and classmates. Great relationships, atmosphere and village that takes care of you"
Sophomore,5,"Great atmosphere and vibe!! Feels like a home away from home, great place to the enjoy the natural weather and homey feel. Small school with great professors and amazing people. Great place for those who live close as well as those from far away, great choice for a four year academic college."
Graduate Student,5,"Lovely college, great teachers, and small class sizes! They offer a Jan Term where you are able to take a course on campus or study abroad for school credit. They offer one-of-a-kind experiences that you don't want to pass up!"
Freshman,5,They seem very honest and caring. They are always ready to help and are very nice and respectful about it.
Freshman,5,The school has a beautiful campus. It is surrounded by hills and there are many squirrels and deer that walk across the 420 acres of campus. The structure of the buildings is set up like a mission. Saint Mary's is a private catholic college. I just completed my freshman year at Saint Mary's and the year went by so fast. I cannot believe I finished my first year. It seems like I just started.
Freshman,5,"People who say they don't have any fun here or there is no night life, is because they are not looking for it. There is always something to do here, you just need to put yourself out there. Yeah the food sucks but thats what makes it fun. Most professors here truly care about you and your education and will do almost anything to make sure you pass their class. I have never been so sure of a choice I have made, Saint Mary's is truly amazing and a very special place."
Freshman,5,My experience here at Saint Mary's is like no other. I chose this school because of the teacher to student ration and I get a lot of one on one attention if I ever have a question. The environment here is very tight knit and friendly. I'm a lacrosse player here and the team and they guys are just great. If you are looking for a school that excels in education and has a home feeling this is the school for you.
Freshman,5,"I like how the professors are available to talk to and actually care about the students. The majority of people on campus are nice people and are easy to talk to. The campus feels isolated despite being in between Oakland and Walnut Creek you would never know that some of the busiest places in California are only a few miles away. The campus food is somewhat diverse and suffers from the stereotype of ""dorm food is terrible"". Thankfully the cafeteria manager is open to criticisms about policies and food quality."
Niche User,5,"Saint Mary's College is a very diverse group of students who regularly participate in protests and encourage others to join. The class sizes of typically no more than thirty students and the supportive professors make up for it. The professors go out of their way to ensure their students succeed, often extending office hours and staying on campus late to accommodate students' needs. The dorms here are also pretty spacious, and the school does a great job of matching up roommates. You will rarely hear of roommate problems because everyone is so friendly and eager to meet new people. If you are looking for a small school with a tight-knit community within an hour from a big city, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of city life, then Saint Mary's College of California is the perfect fit for you."
Senior,5,"Small classes where the students and professors truly know one another. No student ever feels like a number.  Great campus close to San Francisco, so getting internships is extremely easy. Also SMC, has fantastic connections and partnerships with companies to ensure students are successful. Furthermore, all students have advisors and personal coaches to ensure their academic and personal lives are successful."
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere at Saint Mary's. It is such a friendly and enjoyable environment. The students are so kind and the professors are amazing!
Niche User,5,I loved how small classes are and the size of the campus. The campus itself is beautiful! Everyone is very kind and helps those in answering questions or in guidance around campus.
Sophomore,5,Saint Mary's style of learning is so out of this world from the way I was taught in public schools back home. There is so much constant learning through conversations with your peers instead of information straight from a textbook.
Junior,5,"Being at Saint Mary's College has been a great experience for me. While it was hard at first to try and socialize with others, especially those of my peers, I quickly learned that it was quite easy to interact with everyone around. That is because most of the students there are like me: many feel shy at times; they sometimes struggle with finances and keeping up their grades; and are even confused about day-to-day occurrences like current events or how to write a proper essay. Being able to relate to such people has allowed me to feel like it is okay to make mistakes and be confused, because there are others that are probably feeling the same way as I do. This college has helped me better interact with other students and better understand what I can do to better myself. I feel like this campus is like a second home to me."
Senior,5,Saint Mary's is a fantastic school. The Professors knowledgeable and encouraging. Saint Mary's also has an excellent career center with a proven track record of getting student's desireable jobs post-graduation.
Junior,5,"Life on Saint Mary's is peaceful as can be. Look from any window view and you'll get a beautiful scenery of the surrounding forest or the beautiful campus. In addition, the class size is well enough for you to raise your hand when you have a question or are having trouble. It's like a second home to you, and anyone student you pass by will be happy to help you out or make small talk with you. There is never a limit to the number of friends you can make. Because that's what Saint Mary's is all about."
Sophomore,5,Great campus and great environment. I expected the people there to be a bit stuck up but I feel very welcomed.
Sophomore,5,I love Saint Mary's! It's a great environment for learning and there are many on-campus resources to help students in their academics. Teachers encourage their students to succeed and are successful in helping their students do so.
Sophomore,5,"The school is amazing because it offers an incredible amount of support and this makes failure almost impossible. The whole campus is both environmentally and socially beautiful and amazing. By this, I mean that the people are astonishingly kind and the campus is beautiful with all the nature it is surrounded by."
Senior,5,I like the location and the social atmosphere of the college. The professors take the time to help you outside the classroom as well. I have learned more about myself at Saint Mary's and I feel I have gained new skills and improved my skills. I have also gained some friends and great memories.
Sophomore,5,"As a business analytics major, vice president of pep band, and midfielder for the lacrosse team, there is a lot to do at Saint Mary's College; if you put yourself out there. I have a great experience in Moraga connecting with friends that I make through my major, through band, and through other athletes that I meet through lacrosse. The facilities are also always accessible to anyone, and there are tons of untapped resources on campus that are available to anyone; if you look for them."
Junior,5,"Saint Mary's College is a great fit for me.  I prefer a small school, although not everybody does.  It felt like home from day 1.  I am a business major and I am satisfied with the level of instruction and quality of the program.  The instructors are generally well qualified and are effective and skilled.   SMC has offered me plenty of social opportunities to make friends.  The campus is small and beautiful.  The basketball team has a great reputation and the games are well attended.  Overall, I am very happy with my decision to attend SMC."
Alum,5,"15 years out of SMC, having taken undergrad courses at Berkeley; grad courses at Fordham, Columbia and receiving my master’s from NYU, I know that that this institution is top-notch. It’s definitely a you-get-what-you-put-into-it. You will encounter caring and passionate professors and a community. Every time  I visit the campus, it seems more diverse and of course, that’s inspiring. I was a business major but the liberal arts aspects - learning to think deeply and to constantly question the answer with a critical view - is what this school is about. This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC. I will say that St Mary’s is a bubble; the school isn’t so much about teaching street smarts, but you can easily learn all things academic here, if you choose. Getting involved is key, too. And the alum connections are fantastic."
Junior,5,"I really love it here.  The small campus allows for a tight knit community, where you can easily talk to whoever you want, whether it may be students, teachers, or other faculty members.  The school works hard to help their students succeed, and personally, I thank them for that."
Freshman,5,"To whom this may concern,

The thing that I love most about Saint Mary's is the campus and its community. The atmosphere on this small campus is inclusive and diverse. Even being a first year student it is impossible to walk into our dining hall without seeing someone familiar and saying hello. People at Saint Mary's are not afraid to stop you in the halls or around campus and say hello. Our class sizes are relatively small, usually around 19 students but no more than 25, because of this, the professors and facility on campus know every student in their classes by name and will notice when one is missing. This inclusive community at Saint Mary's makes the environment more academically enriching and the students get more out of each class. For these reasons I have truly enjoyed my first semester of college and look forward to many more."
Graduate Student,5,"I am halfway through my MASTERS Program and so far , I have been very challenged with the curriculum, but am learning a great deal of things to use as I transition into a new career with my masters under my belt."
Niche User,5,"I am a parent who sent my student to this college, great campus, easy access to classrooms, to the school with needed security but not overwhelming. very pleasant teachers, parents, and students very friendly and family oriented with many activities to attend as a parent and student"
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my four years at SMC. After learning what I didn't like, I was able to find a career path that I love. During my time here, I discovered that I have a passion for teaching and helping others. I am extremely grateful of SMC for providing me so many wonderful opportunities and connections."
Freshman,5,I have loved every moment of my freshman year. The challenging classes and inviting community are some of my favorite parts about the school. As soon as you step on campus there is a feeling of welcomeness and a true college experience.
Junior,5,"Ever since beginning at SMC, I have not felt out of place. The atmosphere is very inviting to all kinds, no matter how different you are. The academics are challenging but will make you a well-rounded individual who can attribute to any work or social environment."
Junior,5,"Saint Mary's is such an amazing school. Not only are the students very welcoming, but the professors are always there to help any way they can. They really care about your education."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from Concord, CA. I have been visiting Saint Mary's this entire summer for personal reasons, since I will be attending this Fall for my first semester. It is very exciting and beautiful to spend time there and feel a part of something new and amazing. Everyone is very helpful and nice all around."
Freshman,5,Great School. The small class sizes allow for more understanding and opportunities. The campus is beautiful and diverse.
Freshman,5,"I love Saint Mary's College of California. One of the most prominent reasons is because of the school’s affiliation with religion. The Lasallian values that the school is built on work to create an environment that inspires its students to help others and to have respect for everyone around them. The school offers a comprehensive learning environment that pushes its students to leave their comfort zone. The discussion style classroom setting is effective in helping students share their perspectives without fear. In my classes, my professors made it their goal to help me achieve greatness. Also, having the chance to take a class outside of my major and explore my other interests during January term is an amazing opportunity. I also love SMC because of the social environment. Upon stepping onto the campus for the first time, the bright smiles and joyful dispositions of those around me made me feel completely welcomed."
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled in Saint Mary's. I love the size of the school and how beautiful the campus. I do wish that there were more things to do on campus.
Junior,5,I love the tight knit community! Everyone knows everyone and the professors really talk their time to get to know you! Same with the advisors you are assigned to help you plan out your four year experience.
College Junior,5,Go Gaels! Rugby and basketball are big deals and the majority of the school shows support.
College Freshman,5,I have heard many things that those who graduate from Saint Mary's go on to have really great careers and go on to grad school. I believe it is because of the relationship a professor and student have.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely loved my teachers in my Fall semester, especially my Ethnic Studies and Women and Gender Studies professors, because they each had so much passion in what they were teaching. They opened the students eyes to look at certain aspects in society in a different way."
College Sophomore,5,"The availability of college recruitment banquets, career fairs, and dinners for internships is incredible. The opportunites are unlimited if you take advantage of them. You can start from the bottom and eventually build up a knowledge of how to approach the business world and how to establish your own credibility."
College Sophomore,5,"From my experience in starting with Health Science and switching to Global Business & marketing, this school is great in accommodating and getting me right back on track to graduate on time. I love the learning style, small classes, and seminar thinking. My professors for my business classes are very educated in their field, and I feel I am truly getting a well-rounded education here. I don't have a doubt of my capabilities to get a job after college because of the skill I've learned here."
College Sophomore,5,"For such a small student body, my college amazes me by how good our sports are and the team spirit around campus. We are currently number 1 for varsity basketball and hold a 3 year World Championship title for our Club Rugby team. Even our other sports and club teams don't go unnoticed because of our school's high popularity and skill of those teams."
Senior,4,"As of Fall 2020, all classes at Saint Mary's (like at most universities) are online. We attended realtime zoom classes, and professors still generally require you to interact with your classmates or ask questions at some point during each class. Professors tend to be flexible and understanding, and are really trying their best."
Senior,4,"Saint Mary's is an institution that cares about the quality of the education provided, emphasizing the interaction between students through questioning and dialogue. This university offers more than simply 'job training'. You will be asked to question your morals, thoughts, preconceptions about other people, and places; you will learn what it truly means to think for yourself. 

The professors are a good balance of challenging and compassionate. The campus is beautiful and extremely safe. The food is standard.

The main downside to attending is that pretty much all of the students grew up within 40 minutes of the college. So most people go home on weekends. This can make it hard to make friends or have an active social life if you are from far away. I wish someone had told me that. (I did meet my two best friend here though, so things can still work out great)."
Freshman,4,"Great place to go to school.  

The campus is just outside of city with 3 major airports.  So getting home is easy.  Public transportation is easy to use, and there is many stores, restaurants and places to stay in the area.

The campus recreation facilities are great.  Several places to work out.  There are many trails and places to run.  There is several fields that you can run on. 

Being close to the city is also a huge benefit.  You can visit many nearby cities, and go to many different events.  

The dorms are a little bit old, but in good shape.  The campus is very private, and easy to get around.  I can walk to everything.  

The sports facilities are in great shape.  They have a great recreation center and the baseball and basketball facilities are really nice.  

I have been in my room for most of the first week because of COVID, but the food is easy to get and taste good.  I haven't been able to explore everything yet, but i'm looking forward to seeing a lot more."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, it would be nice if the freshman dorms were updated a little bit.

I like being able to walk everywhere."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Mary's does not typically offer online courses, but I was pleasantly surprised with their sudden and effective shift to online learning after the outbreak of Coronavirus hit the US. The professors were incredibly understanding of students various changing situations and the school was understanding of the new financial burdens people were enduring. I actually look forward to returning to the online learning platform this upcoming fall semester as I have no doubt that I will still receive the proper academic support I need."
Sophomore,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Saint Mary's College of California this past academic year. The students are kind, the professors are helpful, the atmosphere is welcoming and cheerful, and the campus is beautiful. My few issues come with the cafeteria food and the diversity of the school. The food provided by the cafeteria is sometimes under cooked and bland, so if someone could be a bit more careful about those things, it would be much appreciated. As for the diversity of the campus, there isn't much to be found. It would be nice to see at least a few more students of color walking the halls, as the majority of the school is white. I would be very happy to see just a few more students who look like me be a part of this wonderful community."
Senior,4,Due to the corona virus I had to take classes online. The teachers did a great job adjusting to the new online format and made it easy for students to continue their progress. It was a good experience.
Alum,4,"I had an amazing experience at Saint Mary's! The campus is beautiful and extremely quiet, I loved that I was able to experience the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area and then return to our gorgeous campus tucked away in the hills. I always felt safe on campus and included and part of the community.  The classes were also very engaging, the round table discussions we had helped to sharpen my speaking and critical thinking skills. The seminar classes allowed me to discuss the Great Books from writers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle among many others with my peers. My favorite program at SMC was our 4-1-4 schedule, that let me explore out of my major. Saint Mary's also has an amazing Career Center that helped me be able to graduate with a job at a Fortune 500 company. Overall I enjoyed SMC and encourage everyone to visit and consider attending if you are looking for small classroom sizes, great discussion, and a well rounded education."
Senior,4,I loved my time at Saint Mary's. It is my home away from home! The small class sizes really separates this school from others
Senior,4,"Saint Mary's College offers great opportunities to students. Through the school, I was able to travel parts of the world in January Term. January term is a chance to explore something new and fun. The whole month students take one class, like Pet Psychology, Beer vs Wine, even travel with other students. After transferring to this school, I was placed in transfer only classes that created lasting friendships and a network of people I am happy to 'graduate' alongside."
Senior,4,"I am finishing my last semester at St. Mary's and have greatly enjoyed my experience these past four years. Because of the small personal academic setting and courses offered, I was able to discover my passions and then pursue a double major while still completing my degree in 4 years. I also formed friendships and memories that will last a lifetime, which I am so grateful for. I will definitely miss St. Mary's, but I also feel ready for the next chapters of my life."
Graduate Student,4,"I have attended Saint Mary’s for five years. Being apart of “the great books program” as an  undergrad taught me to think deeply and critically. It has challenged me to engage the world in a manner that allows me to think using multiple perspectives. Now, as a grad student in the MSM program, I am learning how to apply business concepts to real-world situations. I hope to combine the skills I learned as an undergrad with those I gain from the MSM program to give me a competitive edge in the workforce.
The highlight of my experience, however, has been the community at Saint Mary’s. Though I will say some people here are more pleasant than others, I have made friendships that I know will last a lifetime. I recommend checking out the Women’s Rugby team among other clubs on campus when figuring out how to get involved. There is no greater group of people."
Graduate Student,4,"As a current Graduate Student of the PMBA program, I cannot speak higher of the quality of education that Saint Mary's provides to students. It seems silly that this even needs to be stated-- but professors care. You are not a number, you are an individual. Professors want to see your success and individual growth. 

Beyond the classroom, there are so many connections to graduates of the college who really advocate on behalf of current Gaels for jobs post grad. The rich alumni network contributes to a high rating on the ROI of attending a small liberal arts school."
Junior,4,"I really like how small Saint Mary's College is because I am able to get my way around school pretty easily and create a lot of friendships. The Professors are super nice and always willing to help their students succeed. In addition to the small campus, the classes are also smaller so students are able to create strong relationships with their professors and classmates. Ever since freshman year, I have been living on campus. Many students commute but I find living in a dorm to be much more convenient when it comes to getting to class on time, using school resources, and even hanging out with friends."
Freshman,4,"I when was originally warmly welcomed to the campus of Saint Marys College of California, I could sense that the student body was happy to be a part of this community. The athletic center was stunning and the chapel held many masterpieces done in Christ's name."
Freshman,4,"It's a great college where professors and staff care about individual students. There are so many resources available to students that are included in the tuition, such as tutoring. It's a great environment to study and to stay focused in."
Freshman,4,"So far I have liked all my professors and courses. The faculty is very encouraging overall. I am comfortable to challenge and push myself to do more than the bare minimum. However, due to the size of the school and location, it can feel isolating, but some people seem to like that. The food is not the best but the dining hours are great."
Junior,4,"Saint Mary's is an overly expensive but quality college. I have only gone here for a semester, but have had a good experience so far with other students, teachers, and faculty."
Senior,4,"As a transfer student, it took awhile to feel like I was part of the school.  about 8 of my classes did not transfer. The campus is beautiful. Not the most diverse campus. Class sizes are larger than advertised probably averaging about 18, 12-25 in practice. That is still incredibly small compared to a 300 person lecture, but larger then the 13-14 they will tell you if you take a tour. Still, small class sizes allowed me to get to know a few professors on a personal level, enabling me to get letters of recommendation, research experience, and even opportunities to publish. Parking is difficult, party life is almost non-existent unless you wait for the hourly bus to the train to Berkeley or San Francisco. Students complain that there isn't much to do nearby, the school opened a bar on campus recently but its not  that popular."
Niche User,4,"Saint Mary's College of California is a very chill school. Set in the town of Moraga the weather is beautiful all year round and there is no need to worry about snow or any other rough weather. Additionally, being close to the Bay Area provides plenty to do with only short car trips or even taking the train for the day. Also, the athletics are extremely good for such a small school. The basketball team has been to March Madness quite a few times and the soccer team has been great the past years. The professors help out a lot and its very easy to get to know them and build strong relationships with them.Overall, my  experiences at Saint Mary's have all been very good."
Freshman,4,It's a really nice campus. Classes are engaging and easy to feel comfortable in given they're quite small. The dorms are great to live in as well.
Freshman,4,"I love this college because of the size of the school. Having only 5,000 undergraduate students is extremely helpful for me because I get more help from professors and I can be more successful in school and focus more on academics rather than partying and being immature. Saint Mary's is in an amazing town and it gives amazing opportunities to all that go there."
Freshman,4,"I'm about to attend Saint Marys and it's an amazing and underrated college! Amazing individualized academic programs available in a gorgeous area. Although it's not a party school, most students can go down to the Bay area which is nearby."
Junior,4,"Overall, everyone is very welcoming. It is very similar to my high school which I liked. The classes are small so we can get close to the teacher and build a strong relationship. It also helps to get to know everyone in the class in case you need help or simply a person to talk to."
Freshman,4,This is a dream come true for me. St Mary's is a great college with great opportunities. Excellent teaching level a great place overall.
Junior,4,"My experience at St. Marys has been going very well. One of my favorite things about St. Marys is the smaller classroom size, and the more one on one time you get with your professors. If there is one thing I don't like, it would be the required courses that SMC makes you take."
Senior,4,"I transferred to SMC after the Summer of 2016. I was accepted 1 week prior to the beginning of the semester, so it was a hectic week trying to get everything sorted out. But the housing staff was very accommodating and helpful in getting me a place to live. I've enjoyed my classes here and my professors as well. I've developed great friendships and relationships with some professors, one of whom has written me a letter of recommendation for grad school. 
However, being a transfer student is a challenge anywhere, but SMC could not separate themselves from the pack. There was lots of information that I did not receive about the school and the way of life on campus. Furthermore, several previous classes were not accepted, and I was forced to take several classes all over again."
Sophomore,4,"The school needs a bigger cafeteria to accommodate for large number of students during lunch and dinner hours. They should remodel many residence halls. The tuition increases, but no change anywhere. Where is the money going to?"
Niche User,4,Good school overall. I liked the friendlyness of the professors and their gym where I spent a lot of my free time.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I have loved going to school at Saint Mary's! I have met so many people and because it is a small school I feel like I really get to know my professors.  There are lots of events on campus and I feel like the staff truly try and accomodate students.  There is a new, awesome rec center!  Because it is a small school, there aren't as many opportunities socially such as fraternities and sororities, which is disappointing.  I also wish there were more food options on campus.  Lots of the buildings on campus are very out dated because it is such an old school.  There isn't much to do in the area, so you have to drive to get lots of places, which makes it hard if you don't have a car."
Alum,4,Amazing psychology department! Lack of diversity and increasing tuition prices. The professors care and you are able to create relationships with them because of the small class sized.
Junior,4,In my experience with Saint Mary’s College the professor’s and the brothers are very helpful and go out of their way to make your experience at the college the best that they can.  The housing is cheap considering the rent in the area.   Overall it is a good place with friendly people.
Freshman,4,"Saint Mary's is an amazing school if you want to focus on your education. The teacher are more than willing to help each student and have office hours that are very helpful. However, the night life is not the best. If you don't have a car, it is hard to go out because the schools is in the middle of nowhere. You can get good at public transportation though and go to fun places like San Francisco."
Freshman,4,"As a girl from Ohio, i’m destined to feel a little out of place in such a different place. Luckily, the student population is more accepting and friendly than I ever could’ve imagined. I’ve made many friends and even the students I don’t know, I’m not scared to compliment or chat with my classmates. 
The professors are all immensely different from one another, in the best way. There is a wide array of teaching methods, as well as personality. It’s always nice to have change in between classes. All of the professors have office hours where students are welcome to come chat, ask questions, and go over grades. 
This is my dream school and i’m so blessed to say it has completely exceeded my expectations for college."
Freshman,4,I am only a freshman at St. Mary's but I love it. The first semester was definitely rough but Jan Term made me realize this is the place I want to be.
Graduate Student,4,It has a lovely campus. Their dance program is pretty good and diverse. They do not give enough scholarships to dance students. Food is pretty good in the campus. They have a beautiful rec center.
Junior,4,"This is an incredible liberal arts education institution that helped me view the world from an multitude of perspectives. Each class is typically deeply engaging, challenging, and I've found admiration and value in all of my professors thus far. 

With these positive attributes in mind, SMC needs to improve in listening to the voices of students by implementing new rules. For example, they've struggled to answer students demands for ethnic equality in our community, and the same for taking bigger steps to implementing green energy."
Alum,4,"I attended Saint Mary's through the LEAP program. I loved that they were flexible with my schedule and made every effort to help me succeed. When Megan was head of the program, things were very organized but when she left for another organization, things got a bit disorganized and getting advice was a challenge. I decided to transfer to a school which was closer to me. Transferring my credits has not been easy, mainly because the LEAP program isn't set up to help you transfer anywhere. Which I guess is okay. Either way, I felt like I was relatively supported and my education was solid."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Mary's is a great school for people that are interested in small classes and being surrounded by nature. For all those who love to party, this is not the school for you. Saint Mary's is a small school with many academically drive individuals. The campus is located 35 minutes away from downtown SF and 15 minutes from Walnut Creek. Although, Moraga is very dry, there are a lot of cool places you can get to by car. The professors care a lot about their students so even if you are not a strong student, you will still receive your degree here. You will meet a lot of great people and make a ton of friends. Overall SMC is a fun, small school, but my advice to incoming students would be to make the most of your experience."
Freshman,4,I think that Saint Marys College of California is a wonderful school. My time here has been great. The professors are extremely nice and willing to help any way they can. I love that the class sizes are small so you get to know your class and professor. I think that the only thing that I would change would be maybe to have more activities on campus because it can get a little boring.
Sophomore,4,Really great professors on campus and friendly environment. The classrooms are small so it is easy for the professor to get to know you on a personal level.
College Freshman,4,The rec center is very big and has a lot of machines that we can use.
College Freshman,4,Employers love Saint Mary's students and have a private page for hiring us
College Freshman,4,Many presentations given and resources available
College Freshman,4,At saint marys each student is treated like an adult.
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on campus and know where to get help when i need it
College Freshman,4,"As a college freshmen, I was immediately welcomed by older students and my fear and anxiety quickly dissappeared."
College Junior,4,"I love the small class sizes, the interaction with the professors and Jan Term is a phenomenal break in the middle of the year to try something new and expand your interests."
College Junior,4,"I do know that when people hear they name ""St. Mary's"" their initial reaction is good basketball and quality education. This understanding of the school gives a degree from there a nice boost in value in my opinion."
College Junior,4,"I love the campus and the students, and overall it is the perfect school for me, but some areas are not perfect."
College Sophomore,4,Saint Mary's has been working towards becoming a more inclusive campus and I am anxious to see their progress in the fall.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is in one of the richest cities in the Bay Area, the crime rate in the city itself is incredibly low. I think campus is pretty safe, however Public Safety is a bit of a joke on campus. They don't do much and, when they're asked to do something, many of them do so begrudgingly."
College Sophomore,4,Team members seem to be very close and seem to work pretty well together.
College Sophomore,4,I love my school. We have really really great professors who treat students like people not just numbers.
College Sophomore,4,"Alumni LOVE their school! The community built at Saint Mary's continues through the years and generations. Getting a degree from Saint Mary's is a prestigious degree, the community takes the college very seriously."
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers really care about you as a student and person. The classes are interesting and challenging ina  good way. Every class discusses social justice/ethics in some way, which is great to see how these classes connect to the world and being the best human you can be."
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Mary's doesn't have greek life, but they have some clubs that kind of emulate greek life. These clubs are all inclusive and are a great way to make friends. I was a transfer student, and I joined the Gael Sisterhood and met some amazing people that I know I will be friends with forever. The club does some mixer, and is big on helping the community/raising awareness. For earth day, we are doing a clothes swap where girls bring in old clothes and get to pick out new ones. The Gael Sisterhood is also all inclusive, so there is no application, you just have to sign up"
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Mary's big sport is mens basketball, they won the Western Championships this year :) They have this program called the Gael Force where you pay a small fee and you get a tee shirt and get to go to all the games for free with reserved seats. A lot of the student body participate in the Gael Force."
College Sophomore,4,"Saint Mary's is a school that take it's mission statement very seriously. There are lots of opportunities to get involved with the school, with the community, and with social justice. The kids at the school are very polite and respectful. Most of the teachers truly care about you as a person. Class sizes are small, which give you lots of one on one time with your teachers. Jan Term gives you an opportunity to explore new areas of study, or to travel the world!"
College Freshman,4,"Good conncetions for business majors, not sure about anything else though."
Junior,2,"As a transfer student, I didn't have the best experience at SMC. Students are friendly but don't really want to be your friend. They will talk to you but they won't invite you out so it is hard to find a good group of people. The food is terrible (I have gotten food poisoning from it) and the dorm life was pretty poor. Buildings are old and if you come here PICK YOUR ROOMMATE way a head of time. I had a terrible experience with my roommate. People at this school come from money and flaunt it like no where else I've been (I went to private elementary, middle and high school). Some professors are really good and some are pretty poor. To me, the tuition is not worth it. The quality of professors, academics, and student life is not worth the high tuition. If I had to do it over, I would go to another university. That being said, I did meet some cool ppl but very few."
Graduate Student,2,"I was a graduate student at St. Mary's for seven months.  Their ""Master of Arts in Leadership"" program was a straight-up SCAM.  I was dismissed from the program after three classes because I asked too many questions which the ""instructors"" did not want to answer.  I also found out that all graduate students were going to be kicked off campus at the end of the school year, to make way for a surge in undergraduate admissions.  Avoid this school!"
Sophomore,2,There is no potential and the school is racist. They do not give opportunities to people of color and claim that they have a good business program when they don’t have anyone who is good at actual upper division courses.
Sophomore,2,"The people aren't all welcoming. I had some unfortunate experiences with some people and it has not been the best. I love the academics and the campus, but the people are not my favorite. The social life is what I would have to say the worst part of my overall experience."
Sophomore,2,"It's a small school, so there aren't a lot of majors/minors to choose from. The campus is really pretty, but it's in the middle of nowhere. Food is pretty bad, especially on the weekend. Classes are small so that's nice"
Freshman,2,"I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews on here before enrolling here. There is nothing to do over the weekends; everyone who lives close by goes home for the weekend. The food is TERRIBLE. There is barely any variety or accommodations for people on a restricted diet. The food gets even worse over the weekends. SMC is located in the middle of nowhere so you need a car to go anywhere. There is little to no diversity and it's so small that it's like high school. The classes are also very small, which may be great for some people and not so nice for others. The administration at this school is also HORRIBLE. Getting the classes you want, especially as a freshman, is very hard. If you are looking for a party school, this is definitely not where you want to go. It's very hard to transfer out so be careful coming to this college; only come here if you are completely sure that this is where you want to go."
Sophomore,2,"The food at the dining hall is rarely - if ever - prepared correctly. I've gotten food poisoning twice in three months because meat is never fully cooked and there's no one to tell (ie a health group). The dorms are awful. While there is a department on campus that is supposed to fix things such as lights, etc, they only work 6 hours a day, Monday through Friday. My suitemates and I had mold in our shower and whenever I put in a work order to get it cleaned, it was marked as complete when no one came by. I eventually had to clean it myself after the sixth ignored work Order. The English department is a joke. I had to take English 4 and 5 and I learned nothing whatsoever. My professor in English 5 never had a lesson plan or showed up on time. At the end, we had to write a research paper without any advice or guidance.  Student Disabilty Services does the best they can with what little they've got. The school would be one star in my book but SDS is so awesome I'm giving them two. "
College Freshman,2,Its pretty boring we dont have a football team so theres no tailgating or anything fun like that
Recent Alumnus,2,"Recently, there have been various bias incidences that I have not personally experienced, but I know others have"
College Sophomore,2,"School is very small and there always feels like there is a certain amount of tension on campus, much like a high school as opposed to a college. Professors aren't worth the money students spend on the school and the school, for that matter, costs too much."
College Freshman,2,"Public safety is horrible about enforcing rules, a student on my floor has been smoking weed consistently, one time when P safe came, the two officers were talking with them about how they (the officers themselves) smoke weed to. I got my bike stolen, reported it to P safe and to my knowledge, nothing ever happened with that. We have a gate with a guard 24/7, that shuts late at night and checks to see if you have a parking permit, but other than that, safety isn't really actively enfored. We do have a good Health and Wellness Center though."
College Freshman,2,"I got excited when I heard the janitorial staff will come in and do some minor cleaning and take out your trash from time to time, but the only time my room has ever been ""cleaned"" is when they just cleaned the floor over winter break (I don't think they cleaned my sink or anything, but I could be wrong). My room has scratchy walls and popcorn ceiling, and I am on the 4th floor with a slanted ceiling adjacent to the roof, so at spots it is too low compared to my height, and in bed I have sat up and banged my head into the ceiling getting popcorn ceiling all over my bed. They have also shut off the water several times this school year, and the fire alarm has gone off like 5 times in our building if not more, once at 3 AM, and not one time was there actually a fire."
College Junior,2,"Sometimes I think that the campus police has nothing better to do that to get people in trouble.  Usually they are pretty good if you obey campus rules, but in regard to anything with parking or driving regulations, they are strict and usually unnecessarily strict.  For example, I left my car parked in front of my dorm (where parking is not allowed) when I needed to get something heavy from my room and as I ran in to grab it, I came out to an officer already writing me a ticket. I found that to be a little ridiculous, especially since I was not parked there more than five minutes.  I hear often about stories like that from other students as well that they are not even allowed grace period for things like that."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the parties are small parties or kickbacks. There aren't very many ragers so if you are looking for big frat parties SMC is not the place to look. Parties on ascot are fun, but you can't show up without an invite. If you are looking for ragers  you can go to berkeley but it is a 30 minute drive from campus."
College Freshman,2,It could definitely improve if the hours/food service was improved upon.
College Freshman,2,There is no college experience.
College Freshman,2,Drive far to find food
College Junior,2,"Moraga is very boring, there is nothing to do here"
College Senior,2,It took forever for me to both apply and get my financial aid.  I think that this was due in part to the person who handled my financial aid application and I had to ask another staff member to help me out to get everything sorted.
College Freshman,2,The housing is so out of date. The rooms are pretty small and the cost is pretty high compared to other schools. The only perk is that it is pretty close to the class rooms.
College Freshman,2,"There are apartments and housing close, maybe like five minutes away so it is no too bad."
College Freshman,2,There is not really that many places to eat and late night dining usually closes at 12 a.m. Most often Moraga has little food restaurants to chose from.
College Sophomore,2,The school is accepting more students than there are housing for the upcoming freshmen
College Freshman,2,It gets too cold for my taste.
College Freshman,2,"I personally would prefer to have a car on campus, more convenient than bus"
College Freshman,2,"Not much enforcement, you get a write up if you get caught, so there is a lot of drugs going around."
College Freshman,2,Bart or car. I live 20 min away so my mom picks me up when i want to go home.
College Freshman,2,"If you dont play sports or party hard, then you wont make many friends."
College Freshman,2,A lot of stuff in the beginning of the year then it becomes a dry campus.
College Freshman,2,If there were more options for what i am paying then i would pick this school.. Education is good but everything else needs help.
College Freshman,2,"No student discount, and without a car, you have to take a 2 hour bus to get there.."
College Freshman,2,"If your parents make over 100,000, forget about it."
College Freshman,2,There is only one dining hall and food gets repetitive and gross.
College Senior,2,"I have not had any experience with the nightlife at my school since I don't live on campus and never go there at night anyway, but in general the city of Moraga and Lafayette are pretty boring. Just hearing from other students as well, they always complain how boring life is over there since there aren't many nightlife activities or places to go to around campus. "
College Senior,2,It's extremely hard to find a parking space unless you go at the right time when people are getting out of their classes. To find a parking spot you have to be very aggressive. 
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes they'll have something good, but usually it's similar food everyday and it's bad when it's flavorless and unhealthy. They over-pepper the vegetables. They have nothing towards the end of dinner and lunch and they start cleaning up the food available even before the cafeteria closes so if I want to go in and out toward the last ten minutes of dinner the food is already gone. The times for meals is not convenient because I have classes that make me miss meals since it's only open for a little. I've found hair in my food twice and the plates are always dirty with specks on them so I always grab paper plates. The price of the meal plan is definitely not worth the food. I'd rather use that money and go to Chipotle, and if I did that I'd still have money left over. Too pricey for it's lack of quality and unhealthiness."
College Sophomore,2,"One bar nearby that is very small and you'll probably see some faculty/staff from the school there on the weekends, but they accept some fake IDs."
College Sophomore,2,No loud noises in the dorms. No alcohol in the dorms. No drugs in the dorms. Your RA or someone else will call Public Safety to write you up with a citation.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a free bus for students that covers Lafayette and Moraga, but it only comes to school every hour until 8pm. "
College Sophomore,2,"The biggest difficulty i faced was being in a lower economic level; most student come from quite wealthy families and throw money around like nothing: mom and dad will reimburse them, whatever they spend."
College Freshman,2,"They're all nice, but just not so much fun."
College Freshman,2,All dining is provided by Sodexo. The food isn't very good. If you want to eat a great meal you'd have to drive 10-15 minutes.
College Junior,2,"I'm giving it 2 stars because we are going through construction currently, so there is no parking anywhere. This is extremely frustrating since campus pd will still give you a ticket which can add up quickly."
College Student,2,I plan to have an internship in the future. So far I have not gotten a job or very many opportunities since I am a first year. 
College Student,2,Food on campus is satisfactory but after a while the options get repetitive. 
College Student,2,Off campus housing is a bit far from central campus but there are lots of free public transportation systems in the area. 
College Student,2,"The school is located in the town of Moraga where there is not much to do. However, free transportation to a BART station is provided and from there students can travel wherever they wish. "
College Student,2,"During the week there are several activities to engage in. However, on weekends it gets fairly slow with not much to do. "
College Student,2,The campus is quite strict when it comes to students drinking under age. Teachers are also strict with attendance policies. 
College Student,2,I usually don't drive my car up here but when I do spots are usually located far away from my dorm building. 
College Freshman,2,"There if you want it, but not if you don't"
College Junior,2,"Pot and Cocaine. Hard to get alcohol because of grandma 
Moraga town. Must have friend that is 21 or be 21 to really get it crack'n."
College Junior,2,Need more computers. Only one Lab.
College Senior,2,"If you have an 8am class, parking is easy. Anything later in the morning parking is almost impossible."
College Senior,2,Wireless internet is crappy throughout the dorms and in the library. Not enough wireless bandwidth to keep up with the tech demands of the student body! Also relatively small computer lab that fills up before classes and on big study nights.
Recent Alumnus,2,anyone under 21 has no real options for fun. When you are 21 there are few places that are really fun and you have to drive to get there.
College Junior,2,"Well living off campus is way nicer and a little bit cheaper the cost is still relatively high. My 2 bedroom apartment is 1700 which I split evenly with a roommate. The more people you have to go in on an apartment the cheaper it will be, I was only willing to pay a bit more because I wanted my own room. Apply for off campus housing is really tricky. Some place want the student to be able to pass all the credit check on their own while other are willing to have co-signers."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many local attractions, activities, and cultural events for college students. The safety is excellent (kind of too safe, if you ask me). Students throw parties on the weekends, but only 1 out of 4 parties go longer than 12am. If you are 21 you will be better off in the area."
College Sophomore,2,"The local food options outside of SMC are good. Unfortunately, the campus dining hall does not match. The SMC food is not horrible, just average (sometimes a little below). I do not recommend buying a meal plan higher than the ""10- meals a week plan""."
College Freshman,2,There is no night life if you are looking for bars and stuff - but there are other things to do - especially during basketball season!
Alum,1,"It is shitty institute for international student with no work experience, wastage of time and money. Please if you can do not study in this institution where there is no campus jobs available. You will never ever get a job after coming out."
Alum,1,its just shit. I don't know why it falls under niche. It want to squeeze money from candidates that's why it has a hybrid space in silicon Valley where 10 to 12 people study. It's not a campus neither a college.
Alum,1,Didn’t take online classes. Niche is making me fill this out so my school review post can be uploaded.
Alum,1,My biggest turn of was the lack of diversity of thought. There is an extreme liberal / Identitarian belief system that seemed to be held by all faculty. I had teachers pushing bizarre fringe feminist theories on me constantly and felt I was punished with poor grades when I raised or wrote about opposing view points. I was told my parents were the equivalent of evil nazis because they are Republicans.
Freshman,1,"I was a student here, until they raised tuition and housing cost yet again. The school claims to give huge amounts of aid then revokes it if you get outside scholarships, and has hidden costs you will not find until after you attend. And I am sad to say, no one will help you if you find yourself in a position like mine where you have to leave after a semester. Not only that, but they won't refund my housing deposit because I am leaving before summer and many of my credits are not transferable to other schools. It is a beautiful campus, many of the teachers are very kind, but the huge flaws completely negate all this, I am sad that I turned down other fantastic schools to attend here. One of my biggest life regrets.

The food is horrendous, like many of the other people on here I have had food poisoning from it. They will not fill your work order if something in your dorm breaks I'm sorry to say. If you need help overall as a student, I am sad to say it will not be provided to you."
College Freshman,1,we dont have greek life so campus is pretty dead
College Freshman,1,The food is disgusting. Everywhere I read that the food was great but as soon as you come on campus you cant find a single student that doesnt have a complaint about the food. Its hard to transfer out with the 4-1-4 so you have to stick it out or make sure you really love it. There's absolutely no campus life at all.
College Freshman,1,We do not have any greek life here at Saint Marys but it doesn't hinder your college experience at all.
College Freshman,1,"We have pseudo Greek Life with clubs that I have not personally experienced, but I think they are a lot different."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life on this campus. If you want to experience you can travel over to Berkeley though!
College Freshman,1,SMC is in the middle of nowhere.
College Sophomore,1,I do not get the money I need and I have to get big loans that I will have to pay for the rest of my life.
College Freshman,1,Dry campus unless you party hard and have a car...
College Sophomore,1,ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO HERE. To find anything fun you have to go to Berkeley or San Francisco (50 min. away) and good luck getting there without a car.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,If you get into a party it will get shut down at 11 pm.
College Student,1,There is not much to do here without the use of a car.
College Student,1,There are always several issues with the wireless connection on campus. 
College Student,1,There aren't many close by healthy options to go eat so staying on campus for meals is preferable. 
College Junior,1,As entertaining as watching a essay write itself.

Sophomore,5,"I have taken classes online due to the COVID19 Pandemic. I have loved my experience with UVA online, and all of my professors are super helpful!"
Freshman,5,UVA has done a good job of incorporating on-Grounds and off-Grounds students during this time. I don't feel as if I'm missing out as much as I thought I would be.
Sophomore,5,"Currently, I take my classes online due to COVID-19. I feel the professors have worked hard to create a good learning experience despite the nontraditional means of interaction. They have been very accommodating during a stressful time for students."
Sophomore,5,The University of Virginia is an excellent institution that offers a great education. The professors are accessible and friendly even with larger class sizes. The campus is gorgeous with historic architecture. I would recommend it for any ambitious student looking to further their education.
Junior,5,"I've got nothing but good things to say about the professors and people I've met here at UVA. My nursing professors are extremely accommodating and understanding, and they really take feedback to heart. I've had so many experiences at the hospital that I know I wouldn't be able to get elsewhere. The social life is great, too (aside from COVID), and I've met so many people who are genuine and share the same values and I do. Go Hoos!"
Graduate Student,5,"I have been a graduate student at the university for about 5 months now and while most of my classes have been online due to the pandemic, I have greatly appreciated the effort my professors and classmates put in to make it seem like a typical class. While I'm in a technical program, we are given opportunities for hands-on learning and are well supported. I feel valued by my specific program and the professors are second to none."
Freshman,5,"It just started, but it's been going well so far. The professors have done amazingly in these uncertain times. While there might be a few mistakes with the technology, the proffesors and TAs are doing everything they can to make sure the students are getting a good education."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at UVA. The school was full of tradition and became home very quickly. The school was as big or small as you made it and I went out of my way to get to know as many people as possible. The food was better than high school, the athletics were national winners for several sports a year, and the professors are the best of the best. The school gave me opportunities I couldn't have gotten at a smaller school or much larger school. The party culture was above average and there was something going on every night. I would recommend this school for any high schooler who wants to study hard, have opportunities post graduating, travel abroad, be challenged in classes, study late nights, and wants value for money."
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience with UVA was decent.  I continued to learn and do well, but the online environment did not help me learn the same way as an in person class."
Sophomore,5,"I love UVA.  Not much I would ask to change, apart from dining hall food.  I have learned a lot so far and still have a lot of time to go."
Junior,5,"I love the grounds, the size of the school, and the fact that it offers a typical college experience. It has great sports teams! I think it can improve by addressing the racism the university was built upon by hiring more professors of color."
Freshman,5,It's definitely a school that stands firm on a work hard play hard ethic and does not limit or hinder student participation and leadership
Freshman,5,When one needs information on anything it's very detail-oriented and organized and takes most situations and conditions into consideration in terms of internet access and eligibility
Freshman,5,"UVA is a different, but great experience. UVA is a community of great caring people. I wish the dining hall food was better. Also, some of the classes are limited to availability. Other then that, it is great!"
Freshman,5,"UVA did a great job moving everything online. Most classes were still helpful. I feel like I learned less, but it still was an enriching experience."
Junior,5,Quick transition to the online learning experience.  Professors and individuals of leadership were quick to accommodate a wide range of students.
Sophomore,5,"I loved my first year at the University of Virginia. The students, faculty, and administration work together to create an inspiring and welcoming community. I enjoyed going to sporting events (2019 National Champions) and spending time in Charlottesville. I cannot wait to return to UVA this fall, and I am incredibly grateful to be a Wahoo!"
Sophomore,5,"I've loved my time at UVA so far. There's definitely something to be said about the unique passions and involvement each student participates in, which is incredibly motivating. I've made amazing friends, and met some even more amazing professors as well. The dining hall food sucks, but first year dorms are pretty good now! Overall, I am so happy with my decision to come to UVA."
Niche User,5,"I am attending UVA this fall, so I'm not really sure how to respond to this question. I have two older siblings who both attended and were able to graduate a semester early and land excellent jobs straight out of graduation. Furthermore, UVA is just beginning to open an astrophysics major which is exactly what I was planning on taking advantage of."
Senior,5,"As a Hijabi student at the University of Virginia I was quite enthused by the ability for  Muslim students to pray in Newcomb Hall. However, as more Muslim students are accepted into the University I hope that bigger accommodations will be made for prayer. I also truly enjoyed the Iftars held during Ramadan for Muslim students by the Alumni Association at Alumni Hall in the Spring of 2019."
Niche User,5,I have loved it ever since I came here. Everything is great. The professors are amazing and there is nothing that isn't good about it. I would highly recommend this college to anyone
Freshman,5,"I have met the most extraordinary people at the University of Virginia. Professors and students have made my first year amazing. The academics are exceptional, as I challenge myself to learn and expand my horizons everyday. I have come to feel at home and feel safe at this school."
Niche User,5,"My sister is a sophomore at UVA and it is truly the most amazing school! I love whenever I go visit because the environment is always lively and the campus is very well kept. You can tell the students there have a lot of school pride which is awesome! Not to mention Charlottesville, VA is a great town with plenty of shops and restaurants!"
Junior,5,"I absolutely love it here. My fellow students are always encouraging me to explore the world around me and better myself through all kinds of social and academic support. The professors are always so engaging and knowledgable,  creating a learning environment that is perfectly challenging and accepting. Outside of classes, there are so many research opportunities, and faculty is very approachable and  helpful when it comes to supporting experiences outside of the classroom."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year and I had such a great experience. I met so many new people and became part of many organizations where I can really connect with people. I am part of the marching band and we are such a close-knit family. Your professors are there for you when you need help. We have such amazing athletes and I enjoy going to game like soccer, volleyball, football, and who could forget basketball games."
Freshman,5,"As my first year at UVA is coming to end, I have gotten to fully experience college life. UVA provides so many resources including great alumni networking which can lead to internships and jobs. At UVA, you have access to amazing professors and deans who care about your future and want to put you on the right path. You have the opportunity to meet many people from around the country and around the world which provides UVA with a unique environment that no other school could rival. Charlottesville is the epitome of a college town that blends university and suburban life so well. It makes UVA feel like a home away from home especially for out-of-state students, like myself, and international students. Even as a first-year, you have great access to a variety of classes that can help you determine your major and future career. Through my overall experience at UVA, I can say that UVA has been the best decision for my future and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Freshman,5,I just got accepted and I already know I'll love it. I've visited a bunch of times and it gets better every time. Can't wait to start in August!
Freshman,5,"Very nice campus with many interesting professors, peers, and faculty members. The area is nice and the academics are awesome. The school is very big in sports and the party scene, but it really requires a lot of hard work and personal growth to learn and get through the courses."
Freshman,5,I am currently a first year at the University of Virginia and I have found my experience to be far better than I ever could have imagined. This is due to the passion shown to me by my professors and to the education that I have already received at this excellent university.
Freshman,5,"Work hard, play hard. I love this school. I'm learning so much in my classes, and I'm having so much fun when I go out. All my other friends from high school are at schools up north and all I can say is that I'm not jealous. This school is the ultimate college experience"
Alum,5,"The school's honor code is incredible and impactful. Totally run by the students. Provides a strong culture of trust among students and between teachers and students. The Grounds are gorgeous, tremendous architecture by Jefferson and others."
Niche User,5,Great school that is very focused on academics but still maintains a work hard party harder mindset that allows students to understand the benefits and positives of hard work
Alum,5,"I loved my time at UVA, I made some of my best friends there, and I always love going back! The student life, athletics, and academics are one of a kind, truly."
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere at the school. You can tell that everyone there is happy with where they are and the people that are there. It is such a loving community!
Niche User,5,"the University of Virginia is a beautiful school with warm, welcoming staff that have been welcoming to answer any questions regarding the application process."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at UVa was really difficult because I felt like I wasn't the typically successful first-year student. There were so many resources, new things that I felt obligated to try, and it was just very overwhelming. But as I continued attending the university, doing my best to learn not for the sake of getting good grades, but for the sake of learning and getting my money's worth. And I found that my experience was so much more rewarding as I naturally found my niche of volunteering, opportunities, activities etc. that just enhanced my college experience. I thoroughly enjoy how the professors here care so much about their students and about education, and that most students here are the same and enjoy working hard."
Niche User,5,"When I visited UVA's campus, I was fascinated by how polite both the students and teachers were. Although it was far from my house, I felt like it could be my home."
Junior,5,"The employees are so nice and everything is clean and productive! Definitely love it here! Our classrooms are simple with the right amount of tech. The professors get stuff done in a timely manner and aren't too hard on students. The courses are challenging and prepare us for the real working world. Personally, I am premed and the counselors have done a great job of preparing me for medical school apps."
Alum,5,"My time at the University of Virginia was fantastic overall. Looking back after graduation, it is even more of a unique, inspiring, exciting, welcoming, and positively challenging university than I had previously thought."
Niche User,5,It is an amazing campus with honestly great people there who are always willing to help you in anything you need. Anywhere you look around campus or off campus there is a place to eat or a spot to be with friends.
Junior,5,"Dining at UVA is convenient and diverse in options! The staff is so kind, and the food is always available and delicious. There are many meal plan options for everyone to choose from. Meal exchanges can be used to get meals from places like Chick Fil A and Subway on grounds! We also have plus dollars that are easy to use at any restaurants on grounds! I always enjoy eating in grounds before and after classes!"
Sophomore,5,Love the architecture! The old buildings make it feel homey while the student body are incredibly spirited and motivated. Great work and social life balance.
Sophomore,5,"Thus far, my experience at the University of Virginia has been excellent. The meal plan has been great for me. Since I live on grounds, but have an apartment-style dorm, the smallest meal plan has been perfect for me. In addition, I love having the plus dollars option for meals as well."
Junior,5,"It has been an amazing home away from home! Everyone is focused not only on academics but growing as invididuals. My only critique is housing— as a first year you are not promised AC, and hopefully that will change. Also some professors are too focused on their research rather than their classrooms. The local food scene is great, and Dinning makes sure to support local farmers and promote sustainability!"
Graduate Student,5,Campus life is great! There’s something for everybody no matter what you’re interested in. Sustainability is great on grounds and in the dining halls.
Senior,5,"Very glad I decided to go to UVA - I’ve met my best friends here and will be sad to graduate! There have been plenty of opportunities both social and professional, and all of the faculty that I have come in contact with are extremely helpful."
Sophomore,5,The University of Virginia is a wonderful place for people to study! They have the ability to participate in such a wide variety of classes and activities in a vibrant community and with the support of some of the nation's best professors. Students have nearly endless resources at their disposal and are able to learn in such a unique environment so closely connected to the local community and the history of the area.
Senior,5,"I love having so many different options with my meal plan by using plus dollars, meal exchange, and residential dining halls. It's great to be able to have options and get to eat Chick Fil A, smoothie bowls, and salads with my meal plan."
Junior,5,University of Virginia is an amazing school with a great dining program!!!! The atmosphere is inviting and encourages conversation! It’s a great place to sit and hang with your friends too!!!
Junior,5,UVA is a great school and my time here has been very formative! The food is great and they are a variety of options for everyone to find something they love!!
Junior,5,The food at the university of Virginia is very good. The party scene is also very fun. The academics are great.
Niche User,5,Not an official student there yet but visiting the campus and touring the university was a great experience. There are a variety of activities and things to do and it seemed as if everyone there cared about each student personally and were willing to help. The campus itself was nice and felt like a place I could see myself in.
Niche User,5,"Our son is a ""First Year"" student. He arrived to UVA independent of his parents for move in day. Because the university is so organized he was able to get moved in and immediately had activities to attend with new friends."
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely love UVA. Grounds is gorgeous, both the students and the faculty/staff are incredibly friendly and interesting people. Chancellorsville is a vibrant small town with an incredibly accessible downtown.  On top of all that, the quality of education is top notch."
Sophomore,5,Uva is home. Charlottesville is the best community. You won't find a better balance between academics and social scene.
Freshman,5,"Although I haven't started classes at UVA, all the events thus far and my experience with the university has been nothing short of amazing. UVA has been my dream school since a child but I always felt that even though I was accepted I was out of my league. But after attending Days on the Lawn and Orientation I never felt more at home in many aspects including: academics, diversity and culture, extracurriculars, research and athletics."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at the University, which is a 10-hour drive from home. I was far away and unable to go home on weekends. I was very homesick, missing the comfort of my family and friends, leaving me unsure of my place. But, I quickly came to love the school. My old, unrenovated dorm without AC forced us to keep our doors open and welcoming, creating lasting friendships. By December, I was yearning to go home. But during Winter Break I realized something: I missed UVa, and the home it had become. Second semester, my friendships flourished. The courses I took were challenging and specialized to my interests. As well, the community came together to cheer on the men's basketball team for the NCAA championship. The communal, overwhelmingly pure school pride and excitement is of which I cannot describe nor ever forget. UVa has nurtured me to be a stronger person, and I will forever be thankful for this school."
Junior,5,UVA staffs and faculties are nice and helpful. They're always there to answer your concerns. The way they communicate with students is really friendly. I'm also proud to be a Wahoo.
Sophomore,5,Picked UVA over Vanderbilt and couldn't be happier with my decision. Student life here is amazing for an unbeatable price.
Junior,5,"I liked the curriculum and what was going to be offered, I felt this would provide the broad foundation she needed—in topics that included organizational management, policy, and budgeting—to become a more well-rounded public servant. The program has fulfilled my expectations, thanks in part to the professionalism and expertise of the faculty. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable and dedicated to making sure that students get the most out of the courses they teach. Thanks to the program, I feel more confident pursuing positions of more responsibility knowing that I can meet the challenge."
Sophomore,4,I love the Charlottesville area! I especially love the people at UVA. The professors are also usually pretty great.
Freshman,4,UVA is a great school. I have really enjoyed being a part of the Undergraduate student body so far. They are very inviting and inclusive towards everyone.
Junior,4,"It obviously isn't ideal to be learning online and would much prefer in-person classes, but I can see that my professors are trying their best to help us learn regardless. I am lucky in that my courses are less hands-on and more knowledge-based-- I don't know I'd rate the experience as positively if I had, say, a lab online."
Graduate Student,4,"While some classes have been online due to the pandemic, our faculty and classmates have worked hard to make it feel like an in-person experience. We haven't encountered too many obstacles with using Zoom for lectures and the presentations we have had."
Freshman,4,"The communication is great, however, it could be faster. I understand this is unprecidented times and the response so far has been great."
Alum,4,"I spent my graduating semester of 2020 online due to COVID-19. Because we had just gotten back from Spring Break and went straight into online classes, the teachers had no training on how to run classes without a classroom of kids. I felt that it was a quick adjustment, but it was my best academic semester. Teachers were understanding and fair given technological issues, WiFi issues, and the fear of 2020. I felt a lack of desire to work extra hard as I graduated online, but looking back, the education they provided was almost as good as in the classroom."
Freshman,4,"I love the university of Virginia. The vast amount of opportunities that the university offers for all students is amazing. the Campus is beautiful and peaceful, it truly feels like you are in a place completely different from reality. The amount classes and class variety that is available for students is amazing as well. Even though I would prefer a much more diverse university, the student crowd is incredible and extremely nice. Overall, the University of Virginia is an amazing College."
Freshman,4,"Online classes at the University of Virginia are not that much different from in person classes. Online classes still provide the same great learning experience, as if you were in class. Assignments are easy to do, and asking your professor for help and assistance is made to be very flexible. Online classes makes everything so simple."
Junior,4,"The University of Virginia is a wonderful institution with a wide variety of options in terms of academics, social life, extracurricular activities, and jobs. However, it is a predominantly white University that has failed to address several aspects of its Grounds and buildings affiliated with racist historical figures. It also has a history of poorly addressing sexual assault cases and rape culture on Grounds. It is also incredibly expensive and has not provided many students with the funding they truly need, especially in this pandemic. They did not provide student refunds for tuition or student fees, nor will they be doing so this upcoming Fall 2020 semester, and have not been understanding of the financial struggles that students and their families have had to endure throughout the past several months. Their president makes almost $1 million annually, if not more, and has not assisted his students in their struggles these past few months."
Senior,4,"I thought that online courses were normally no different from the average lecture-based courses taken on grounds at the university. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, online learning became a necessity. In these times, lecture based courses remained similar, and professors managed to answer their students' questions as well. Smaller classes however that required small group work were difficult. Overall, online learning experiences at the University of Virginia are mostly similar to in-person learning."
Senior,4,"So far, my experience at the University of Virginia has been a challenge. Following high school, I was definitely unprepared for the work load and amount of studying that each individual class required of me. However, after 3 years of experience, I have learned new tactics on how to study, and I have seen improvements on my exam grades from the beginning. This university is incredibly challenging, but provides its students with an incredible college experience, prepares them for the future, and ultimately gets its students degrees that will help them thrive in their careers."
Junior,4,"During covid-19, I took all of my classes online. They went better than expected, and since I am a government major, not much was changed in terms of assignments. However, I feel like being so removed from classmates and the teacher makes it more challenging to motivate yourself and stay focused."
Sophomore,4,"Definition of work hard, play hard. Don't believe the stereotype that all students at UVA are preppy and rich, because this definitely is not true. It is a big enough school that no matter what you are like or are interested in, you will find people who are like you. Most people are accepting of different beliefs. That being said, UVA needs to improve its diversity in acceptances, as they are not representative of the diversity of the state."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience after the transition due to COVID-19 was difficult, yet manageable. UVA faculty and professors made the online experience convenient as possible while providing reliable access to resources, lectures, labs, etc."
Sophomore,4,"The university's school spirit is unmatched. I love the feeling of togetherness stimulated by healthy competition, dedication, and great academics at this school. There is always something to do for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"UVA is a great school for pursuing your educational and career interests. But more than this, it gives you a great holistic experience of what it means to be a college student. It challenges you academically, but also allows you have other experiences as a student, such as meeting faculty, peers, friends, and clubs."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at UVA. I found that taking time to get involved with student life and clubs was beneficial because I had time to settle in and find my footing. I found a core group of friends that have greatly affected my time at the university.
Alum,4,"I loved how there was always opportunities to get involved. The spirit of student self-governance is really emphasized. UVA is in a great location with lots of opportunities to get involved with the Charlottesville community as well. It can of course be quite stressful as there is a culture of competition. However overall, it is a great school."
Sophomore,4,"The grounds are beautiful and radiates an aura of scholarship and intellectual excellence. The learning environment is incredible and the instructors encourage a diverse space to share ideas and ask questions. As a first-generation immigrant, I would have liked to see a bit more diversity in the student body. Nonetheless, the people are all friendly and welcoming, making UVA a place to make wonderful life-long connections with some impressive individuals. Students are very involved in the community and with the plethora of extracurricular activities available, there is something to do of interest for everyone. Sometimes the workload is heavy and stress is inevitable, but if one manages their time wisely and makes an effort to reach out to other students, TAs, and professors, academic success is achievable."
Junior,4,"This university is located in the beautiful, artsy location of Charlottesville. Since it is a relatively small campus, it feels like a true family to be a student here. The architecture of the school is traditional, and many building remind you of the Thomas Jefferson era. The education is exceedingly good, and every professor here is one that you want to get to know. The food at the University is not good, but Charlottesville has amazing local food so it really makes up for it. New dorms are very modern, but old dorms need some rennovation."
Senior,4,"UVa is a wonderful school with ample opportunities to study and get involved in whatever you are interested it. Greek life is an option, though you will be completely fine if you do not join. The school work is intense, but manageable."
Freshman,4,"UVA is an excellent institution. The professors and academics are high level and rigorous but they are meant to challenge you and the professors are really focused on not only wanting you to succeed, but instill learning that will be relevant, impacting, and long lasting throughout your life and make you into life long learners. One thing I hope to see get better is UVA's response time to emergency events. In light of the recent circumstances due to COVID-19, I've been disappointed with how the university has handled things compared to other schools whether it is how they are handling certain things or the rate at which they are coming to decisions."
Senior,4,"I transferred in to UVA from a community college my second year, so my experience was non-traditional. The academic rigor really slaps you in the face when you arrive, but you become accustomed to it. The campus, or ""grounds,"" as we say here are really beautiful. The dining hall food is average, though this is an area that needs improvement. Professors are generally excellent, but you still need to do your research before you choose a class. I am graduating this year and will really miss UVA. You really do form a community here."
Freshman,4,The scenery is refreshing and everything is spread out. It is a good choice for university if you're looking for a change from a city life.
Niche User,4,The University of Virginia is an amazing school with amazing people. The school spirit makes the campus feel very united.  The classes are very inclusive for every personality type.
Freshman,4,"I really like the challenging academics and the communal atmosphere at the University of Virginia. One thing I would like to see, however, is more diversity and support for lower income students. The professors are very nice and truly want to see you thrive in their classes."
Freshman,4,I have liked most of my professors and enjoy all the resources provided by the University. One thing I really dislike about it is the extremely competitive nature it creates amongst students.
Freshman,4,"UVA is a wonderful place to find your college home! Nowhere is perfect, but, coming from someone who was determined to not go to Virginia (I didn't want to go to my state's big school), I have found so many incredible opportunities and can't imagine myself any where else. It is academically rigorous, there are many resources to take advantage of, and it's diverse. You are bound to find your passion and your people at UVA."
Alum,4,"I think UVA has an excellent level of quality academic fields with individuals ready to teach and individuals ready to learn. The school does well in trying to foster a community of  “us” as being Wahoo and encouraging students to find their niche and to support each other. This university provides a listless amount of opportunities to try things some individuals may not normally have access to, as well as meet people from all across the world. The UVA community has a ways to go in recognizing the skeletons of its past and reconciling the treatment of slaves and their descendants as well as women and other minorities. I also feel that a community of this size does attempt to address the needs of its inhabitants, there is still more that can and should be done to help support the mental and physical health of its hard working students, faculty, and staff."
Freshman,4,"I love the warm atmosphere, college spirit, and the work hard- play hard mentality in the University. Academics can be quite tough, dining hall food isn’t the best, and there’s a slight lack of diversity but the pros definitely outweigh the cons! Proud to be a wahoo."
Sophomore,4,"UVA has great sports teams, good social life, and great academics. The school is not exceptionally diverse; however, the administration does everything within their power to make sure everyone feels welcome here. The campus is beautiful and there are many great places, both in inside and outside, for studying. My only issue with this university is that there is a very competitive environment that can take a toll on your mental health if you’re not careful."
Niche User,4,"When I visited UVA's campus in the summer of 2018, I was surprised at how friendly the staff and student guides were to me and my fellow peers. They gladly showed me what UVA had to offer. This experience made me consider this university more for when I eventually applied for it this fall. They told me all about the amazing academic fields, clubs, and organizations that they offered, and this further enticed me to consider UVA in my applications."
Sophomore,4,"I love a lot of things about UVA, but it is very expensive for an out-of-state student, which is really my primary complaint, but nothing I didn't know going in! The campus is beautiful, the academics are top-tier, and there is incredible school spirit. Also, the food and dining programs are really good!"
Junior,4,The food has gotten better over the years but can still use some improvement - as per usual. They need to work on diversifying the student body beyond just race/ethnicity.
Senior,4,"So far, my experience at the University of Virginia has been very good. The grounds/campus is beautiful and the academics are excellent."
Junior,4,"There is a myriad of clubs and organizations at UVA, so I found it easy to find people with common interests. During the first year, the university makes you get an unlimited meal plan which was very helpful during that transition period and not having a place to cook meals."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at the University of Virginia was a challenging, yet enjoyable  experience.  Besides trying to manage the academic rigor, I made some new friends and joined a few extracurricular activities that I am passionate about.  My first year was also a learning experience.  I did not have the best roommate situation but through faith, I learned how to not let that situation negatively affect me.  Additionally, I learned how to take better notes and how to study more effectively.  The University of Virginia challenged me without a doubt academically, emotionally, and mentally, but I have learned how to perform better in those areas.  I love being a Virginia Cavalier."
Junior,4,UVA is a prestige school in Virginia that provides world class education to students preparing them to take up on the rigors of this world.
Niche User,4,"The University of Virginia has one of the most beautiful campus in the state with excellent academics and a competitive atmosphere; however, like most colleges, there is a lack of diversity as there are mostly white students. Although this is the case, the search for inclusion is not difficult as there are always groups for everyone."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshmen at the University of Virginia so my experience at the University is limited, however from my countless visits and student orientation I have developed a positive image of the University. The students and staff at UVA have been welcoming and helpful, assisting me when I am lost or in need of advice. UVA encourages independence amongst its students which I believe to be an essential part of the maturing process of a student and young adult. UVA offers countless resources for its students to get involved or seek assistance when they are in need. Whether that be the deans that are available most days with an appointment (walk-ins are available with the ""dean of the day""), financial advisors available with just a brief phone call or handshake, a resource that helps students find jobs/internships and plan their future outside of college, UVA offers its students countless opportunities to get help and succeed which is something I really value."
Junior,4,UVA is a great school with great opportunities. The academics are very rigorous so be sure to study hard.
Freshman,4,"There could be better food and housing on grounds. I am impressed with the academics, but I do not understand why everything is so competitive. You are not even guaranteed a certain curriculum in the College of Arts and Sciences. Not saying this is bad or good necessarily, just important to note if you don't like applying to things. Finally, the college is simply TOO expensive."
Freshman,4,The campus is nice and the faculty are more than willing to help you. The food here is not the best though.
Sophomore,4,"The environment at the University of Virginia is amazing; anyone can find their community within the large grounds of UVA. While getting accustomed to the academic life at UVA is difficult, finding upperclassmen friends to guide you along the path helps. If I were to change one thing about UVA, I would change the amount of resources they have for first-generation students. First-generation students need more help than others."
Sophomore,4,The academics are challenging without fluff. It can be challenging meeting students of my background
Junior,4,"The academics and learning environment at UVA are unmatched. The quality of education for the price is impressive, and there are countless opportunities here to explore your interests."
Freshman,4,"UVA is a great place to balance both your academic and social life. It has a great party scene, but it offers way more social opportunities for those not interested in partying. The professors and students here are very nice and welcoming."
Sophomore,4,"The University, while trying, still needs to improve on the diversity of the staff, especially the professors."
Junior,4,"University of Virginia is a great school, with excellent academics and an amazing campus. One thing I would like to see change is an increase in diversity, and less of a focus on separating groups of people, and more of an emphasis on empowering all people in a diversified environment."
Sophomore,4,"my first year was awesome! the only thing to complain about is the food quality! considering that is the only complaint, i go to the best school ever!"
Sophomore,4,"UVa is an excellent school in regards to academics. The professors I've had are generally quite friendly and willing to help you during office hours. However, I will say that it can be a bit difficult for out-of-state students (especially those who are more introverted) to break into the social scene."
Junior,4,"The Univeristy of Virginia offers great facilities and student life. The academics are rigorous, but employment statistics seem to suggest the rigour is well worth it."
Junior,4,"I love the campus and the people. I think that it is certainly challenging academically, but I find that many students are willing to help you in classes. The campus itself is absolutely beautiful (especially during the fall and spring time) which encourages a lot of students to study outside on the Lawn. The school is known for being preppy; however,  you can still certainly find you friend group outside of that (as I did in a Christian fellowship). Most of the professors that I have been taught by were really good, but I have heard my fair share of poor professor stories (I've just been lucky enough to not encounter that in the English department). The one other downfall I would like to comment on is that  I do sometimes find myself hyper-aware of the fact that I tend to be one a few black students in the classroom. However Black Student Alliance tries to have a strong presence on the campus."
Senior,4,"This college if pretty good. It is one of the best colleges in the state and it is the best college in the state for the subject I am majoring in, which is astronomy. It is pretty pricey of course, which is expected. The meal plan is crap, you pay more per meal for the plan than for buying the meals one at a time."
Sophomore,4,Joining the University salsa club at the University of Virginia has been the best thing that I have done since coming to college and would recommend it to everyone.
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Virginia is situated in beautiful Charlottesville, VA. It has a prestigious reputation and a diverse student body pursuing a number of exciting and interesting courses of study. However, any student can easily get lost in the shuffle of a large institution. The support resources are good, but require the student to step up and use them voluntarily. In addition, behind the UVA brand, there is some lack of connection with the surrounding community. UVA is not quite as good as they perceive themselves to be."
Junior,4,"My experience, as a transfer student, has been intense, humbling, and excellent. Transferring from a community college to U.Va has been life changing. It is academically rigorous, but the professors are more than happy to help. Everyone here is a natural born leader and are highly active on Grounds. Though I come from a community college background, I feel that U.Va has done a fantastic job with their transfer students. I was assigned a mentor who happened to be a transfer student a year before. They definitely aided my journey through U.Va, and spoke to me about their own experience.  My experience academically has been challenging, but my professors were patient and easy to work with. Additionally, professors of this institution are extremely passionate about their courses and are willing to help their students grasp the material.  Overall, I am more than content with my experience and enjoy the diligent atomsphere here."
Senior,4,This is a fantastic school with a terrible history. I was able to find my home here but it took a lot of searching.
Freshman,4,Something I really love about UVA is everyone's willingness to look out for and support others. The atmosphere is great and there's always something to do; just look at all the clubs and extracurriculars offered! There's something for everyone and the campus itself is beautiful.
Alum,4,"Academics are great! Definitely worth the price you pay for the school- which is relatively inexpensive. Socially can be a bit ""uppity"", however don't let this deter you. Everyone finds their place!"
Junior,2,if you want a school with rich kids who got in from daddys donations then look no further. awful overall.
Junior,2,"The professors/academics have for the most part been great, though I've had a lot of frustrations with the way the school is run. For one, many majors at UVA are application-based, and have very competitive acceptance rates, though they're extremely misleading about this on their main website. Even majors like Creative Writing require an application, which is unusual for even similarly selective schools like William and Mary. I applied to one of these types of majors, but because I was a transfer student taking three courses and commuting due to chronic health issues, therefore having no time for extracurriculars/a beefed-up resume, I was not accepted, despite having the grades I needed. UVA is not by any means a commuter school, and it is very difficult to work with many of the university's systems if you are a non-traditional student. They also prioritize good-PR investments like athletics and eco-friendly LOTL when the bathrooms are falling apart in some older buildings."
Freshman,2,"Good school for you if you don't mind meeting a lot of selfish and big-headed people, people like that and very antisocial nerdy types seem to be the only kinds of people at UVA"
Niche User,2,I am an above average student and I wish they offered more merit scholarships. I do not qualify for the TOP and only merit scholarship. They need more mreit scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,Old Dorms suck but are closer to classes.  New dorms are really nice but much farther away.  Social aspects of New and Old Dorms are the same.
College Freshman,2,"The whole atmosphere surrounding the rush and pledging process leaves much to be desired. The rush process is terrible for girls (sororities) but the pledging process is great. It is the opposite for fraternities. Lots of hazing takes place, whether or not anyone wants to believe it. This is typical, nothing unexpected. The concept of having a group of people that you are close with and can bond with and can rely on for support is good, however the execution of joining these groups are pretty sad and inhumane. Being a member of a professional service fraternity myself, I cannot say I have experienced all this, however I have heard many stories and witnessed much of what I have described. 

Students in greek life are generally regarded as partyers and people who abuse alcohol. However they are not all like this. Many are, however. Greek housing is plentiful. Most social greek organizations have houses, and even some professional organizations also have houses."
College Freshman,2,"There is little diversity at the school, and those who are minorities don't really get much a say in things here. It's not a great situation to be honest."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone at UVA drinks, and if you don't, it's noticeable. Anyone saying otherwise is just trying to convince you to come here. In terms of drugs, I definitely see it everywhere, and that's not a huge problem. I personally have no problem with drug use, and other than excessive study drugs that start taking a toll on people mentally, I don't see many drug problems here."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of issues with the Greek scene, including pervasive racism, sexism, and homophobia. They are generally a large group of wealthy, privileged white kids who don't want to look outside the bubble that is Rugby Road (the road most Greek organizations are located on). It's pretty big here, but if you want to avoid it, it's not that hard."
College Junior,2,"Greek life at my school has a bad reputation but is still sought after by first-years and anyone looking to party. I personally find Greek life disruptive at times, but they can be very big-hearted. One time a CIO I'm a part of was raising money for a family with a terminally ill patient and a fraternity extended their time and efforts to help raise money and awareness. I'm not aware there is any Greek housing, but if there are it would be located off-grounds."
College Senior,2,"Campus housing is expensive, far away from grounds, socially isolating, and lacks amenities. Most students rent off-grounds housing after their first year. Anyone who tells you on-grounds is a better value is absolutely lying- coming from someone who worked for Housing and Residence Life!"
College Senior,2,"Hard to escape Greek presence. Most individual Greek students are nice, but the organizations themselves contribute nothing to school life except parties."
College Freshman,2,Excessive drinking is pretty common here.  I don't drink so I am not worried about my safety.  But I do worry about my friends occasionally.
College Freshman,2,"If you want a good job, to William and Mary or Tech"
College Freshman,2,"We are pretty good at every sport that doesn't matter, other than basketball."
College Freshman,2,"The partying is excessive to the point that it's debilitating- even going so far as to inhibit my own study habits and ability to sleep. If you don't appreciate living with a bunch of rich animals, UVA is so not for you."
College Freshman,2,"It takes a while to receive, and the employees do not offer much help. You can call the office, and get two different answers for a problem that is easy to solve. So many headaches."
College Freshman,2,"Long process, hard to get scholarships as an instate student"
College Freshman,2,"The food on grounds is very disappointing.  There are very few healthy food options, and the meals that are available are often undesirable.  The quality of the food is very poor as well.  The salad bar is often filled with old vegetables and the fruit available is often unripe."
College Freshman,2,"Easily the biggest downside to the first year experience. Food is repetitive, processed and hastily prepared. There are great, super inexpensive alternatives all over Grounds and the Corner though."
College Senior,2,Parking is pretty difficult at UVA and in Charlottesville in general.
College Sophomore,2,"Between frats and the bar scene, personally I am over it. I like to have intimate small parties with friends."
College Sophomore,2,"Lately the University of Virginia has received a lot of bad coverage over sexual assault. Our leaders, student and faculty, are in the process to help this problem."
College Sophomore,2,It's very cliquey and predominantly white.
College Freshman,2,"UVA does not offer many scholarships, and I ended up needing to take out more loans than I had originally anticipated. Most scholarships are for students who come from obscure states or for upperclassmen, and there aren't a very many scholarships available."
College Sophomore,2,My family is too wealthy for need-based financial aid and I'm below average for UVA students so don't get academic financial aid either.
College Sophomore,2,Some times swiping into dinning halls I regret it instantly once I see the option. They are a hit and miss. Sometimes the hours suck. Plus dollars and meal exchange are a life saver and there are plenty of better tasting options outside of the dining halls that are UVA dinning affiliated.
College Sophomore,2,"Its seems like I am always getting updates about a sexual assaults from the school. I also hear about people stoping guys from taking advantage of girls. Some houses use grain alcohol, are rumored to use date rape, or are creepy, but I haven't had that happen to me personally. Everyone has been more aware with everything happening recently with Hannah Graham."
College Freshman,2,"The quality of housing depends greatly on where you live. Old dorms have the best sense of community and they are closer to classes but they have no AC and are very dirty. Housing for first year is assigned randomly. Because off campus housing is ridiculously over priced, it is super important to stay on top of deadlines for on-campus housing when applying after your first-year. You also apply to one of the residential college for any year."
College Sophomore,2,UVA isn't as diverse as it should be. It's a big school but I find that a lot of the students are pretty similar (read: generally well to do). UVA can and should do a better job at admitting and supporting students who aspire to attend a university of such regard but may not have the finances to do so.
College Sophomore,2,"Racially, things seem very self-segregated."
College Sophomore,2,"For the amount of money we pay for tuition, the quality of food and variety should be much better."
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little variety, and somehow they found a way to make everything taste the same."
College Sophomore,2,"Many people abuse drugs and alcohol.  It is very available, and fake IDs work almost everywhere."
College Sophomore,2,"As a non-Greek, it seems to me that Greek life is about buying friends and getting drunk.  Sororities and fraternities throw charity events because they have to, and do not really engage genuinely in the Charlottesville community life.  The culture is generally very elitist and Greeks seem to look down upon non-Greeks."
College Junior,2,"Parking sucks--you can't park anywhere on campus without paying, even on the weekends."
College Junior,2,"Parking is expensive at the University of Virginia. What's more, the street parking spots are limited and during the day, parking permits are enforced. After 5pm however, there are some parking spots that you can take advantage of because they become free for all. One such place is the parking garage for the Memorial Gym (colloquially called Mem-Gym)."
College Freshman,2,"The weather changes randomly to cold and hot. Even recently, snowing in March. It affected me because I got sick often and didn't go outside because it was too cold."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of wealthy upperclass white students here.  In greek life, there is a lot of racial and class segregation."
College Freshman,2,There's always a grungy frat house you can go to if you want to get soaked with beer.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life dominates. Obviously you can get by without being in a frat or a sorority but: there are girls who think that ""all guys with a social life rush"" so... boys might want to consider that. For girls there's less obvious pressure, but when Bigs start showing up in your dorm showering all their littles with gifts, the Greek presence definitely dominates."
College Junior,2,Bad weather negatively affects the experience
College Freshman,2,The drug scene is not that noticeable. There are many other options if you don't want to and there is not pressure to if you don't want to. The most prevalent is alcohol though.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of aid besides Jeff Scholars for merit!
College Sophomore,2,"Parking isn't great during school hours, but pretty easy to deal with at night or on weekends."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to find parking but few people actually drive to class. Living off campus and trying to find parking is near impossible unless you buy a space. 
College Freshman,2,Lots of competition and stress. My dislike comes from mostly personal reasons. My advice is to consider whether or not a large school is really right for you.
College Freshman,2,There's not much parking...it kind of sucks.
College Sophomore,2,Not so easy to find solely merit based aid.
College Sophomore,2,"We do very much accept different races here; however, there is some self segregation of certain ethnicities that seem to be impermeable. Economic background, political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientation all are handled well and are rarely even noticied among our scholars. We very much accept everyone or at least to the point of respecting their own opinions."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is definitely a presence at this University but it doesn't represent an overwhelming majority of the student body. Fraternities and sororities are definitely spirited organizations known for their tightly-knit members and sometimes exclusive parties; but that doesn't prevent any brothers or sisters from becoming integrated in other groups at the University. Being non-Greek, I'm part of a handful of student-run organizations that have an outstanding number of Greek participants. I've never thought that Greek-life was a dominating presence at my school."
College Junior,2,really cold when its cld and really humid when its not
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking, at least, is pretty visible.  I don't think there is a lot of peer pressure."
College Sophomore,2,"I had to send in the same document multiple times. Also, for the amount of effort I put in, I did not receive the amount I was expecting. I do not have enough aid or the money to pay for the rest. I suggest to anyone in the same position to apply to as many renewable scholarships as possible, and contact financial aid with any questions or concerns you have. Also, college planning network is a great resource but it is not free."
College Freshman,2,"For students under 21, the only real options for parties are frat/sorority parties. Many of them usually have a guest list or only admit certain people. A lot of them tend to even exclude minorities."
College Freshman,2,"There are diverse people, but we tend to self-segragate. People gravitate towards familiarity when they first get to college so they are more comfortable. Because the beginning is when most friendships are formed, people tend to stay in their own cultural groups."
College Freshman,2,"Campus dining is acceptable, it would not win any prizes.  Not enough variety if you want more than the basic, standard food."
College Freshman,2,"It is very very difficult to park on or around campus. There are very few available spots unless you have a house. I do not need a car to get around campus, but it is problematic when people come to visit me on any time other than the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"I know a friend group that smokes pot, but that's all I've seen here. It's not incredibly common, and in my experience, if it happens at a party, it'll happen in somebody's room or somewhere off-limits so you're not likely to stumble in on it if you don't wander off the beaten path. They're really strict about having it in dorms, so I guess it's more for the upperclassmen who live off-grounds.

Alcohol, though, is really easy to come by if you want it. Very visible, and all you need to do is walk across the lawn on a weekend night or game day to see lawnies having parties. They don't have it at parties for some of the Christian groups, I think. Nobody will think less of you if you don't drink (hopefully), but there's definitely a pressure for it at parties just because everyone is doing it. It sorta depends on the party. It's not allowed in first-year dorms, but some people choose to have it anyway if they know upperclassmen who will buy it for them (which is fairly common in my experience). You're good as long as the RA doesn't see it, and some (but not all) RAs go out of their way to not see it.

I'd heard this before I started at UVa, and it's definitely true: the police are here to keep you safe. They'll bust a party for noise violation, but they don't really do anything about underage drinking unless you mouth off to them. I've heard that they're tougher on drugs, but that's not really my scene, so I can't speak to it."
College Sophomore,2,"Percentage wise The University may be diverse but when it comes to parties, greek life and friend groups it is rather homogenous."
Junior,1,ehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.enenenenenenennenenenenenenenene
College Freshman,1,I had a horrible experience rushing a sorority and feel very excluded now by Greeks
College Freshman,1,Everyone is very stuck up here.  Most are the assholes who thought they were cool in high school.
College Freshman,1,Don't come to UVA if you don't enjoy living with a bunch of stuck up assholes.
College Junior,1,"Food on campus is awful. I got food poisoning from O-hill my first year. I did not get a meal plan after my first year, but first years are required to be on meal plans. The food not only is unhealthy, but also there are limited options and it doesn't taste good. I absolutely hated the food, and I would not recommend eating in the dining hall unless that's your only option."
College Freshman,1,It is very hard to receive any type of financial aid as an upper middle-class student. Especially as an out-of-state student as well.
College Freshman,1,"The scholarships for first year needed to be turned in before I even knew if I was accepted into the University, which just seems a little ridiculous. Even after turning in all of my financial aid work I got nothing back and felt as though I wasted a ton go time just doing what they wanted with no returns in sight. It also was a hassle for them to receive my fax messages and I had to re-fax some of my information up to three times."
College Freshman,1,"Wireless could definitely be better. Buy your computer through Cav Computers, definitely."
College Freshman,1,"Grounds is very wealthy, straight, and white. Socially many people may be liberal, but there is a huge core of Young Republicans who will loudly disavow Obamacare without making any solid points. For what it's worth, the University makes a huge effort to increase diversity or at least awareness of diversity, but it is hard to pick up on this on a daily basis."
College Sophomore,1,Filling out the form was a long and lengthy process and there was no aid given.
Recent Alumnus,1,"the drug scene at uva is not very big, although it depends on who your hanging out with. Drinking is much more popular."
College Freshman,1,UVA doesn't give out many scholarships. All my financial aid only consisted of things I could get from the government. Any scholarships they offer are very prestigious and most people don't get them.
College Sophomore,1,"Although parking is not a necessity for most students - most housing is within a very walkable distance - when you are desperately in need of a spot, there will be nothing within a mile. Or, if there is, it will be ticketed after a mere half hour or perhaps after a bit longer - if you have the luxury of landing a slightly better spot."
College Junior,1,"While it pains me to say anything negative in relationship to UVA, dealing with the student financial aid office has been the single most frustrating aspect of my three years here. Granted, UVA is a fairly large school, and for the number of students we have, the office is vastly understaffed. Having said that, my interactions with financial aid have been exhaustingly taxing (pun intended, although it's no joking matter), as I have repeatedly been on the receiving end of their inefficiency and lackadaisical treatment. It's best to deal with them in person--the representatives I've spoken to in person have usually been kind, good people; but if you want to get stuff done, don't deal with them over the phone. 

Grants are absurdly stingy here, too; if you are looking for scholarships it's best to do it through independent foundations, or through sites like this."
College Senior,1,Clemons library used to have a good amount of computers for student use and allowed for students to borrow laptops for use in the library until last year. You better have your own laptop! There is a small computer lab in Alderman.
College Freshman,1,"Parking and even driving On Grounds is a nightmare during the school week, central roads are blocked off from through traffic and parking passes are not available for students. You can pay at the bookstore, but other than that, keep your car at your apartment."
College Junior,1,"Greek Students Viewed by Non-Greeks – At UVa, non-Greeks view those involved in Fraternities and Sororities as snobbish people. They tend to be very cliquey and very self-centered. There is no interest in getting to know non-Greeks. Also, the socio-economic divide between Greeks and non-Greeks is obvious."
College Freshman,1,"Don't Bother Unless Your Parents Dont Make Any  Money – Financial Aid in general is a pain in the butt and they screw up the paperwork often. UVA doesn't offer any academic scholarships, only need based, so unless your parents do not have any money or are unemployed, good luck getting any financial aid. I only have my moms salary and they still didn't give me anything. Other people got tons if their family income is less than $25,000. I would recommend applying to tons of private/national scholarships instead"
College Freshman,1,"There is no parking at UVA. For anyone, even professors. Good luck finding a place on grounds for your car."
College Sophomore,1,"The local atmosphere is non-existant, UVa makes the town."

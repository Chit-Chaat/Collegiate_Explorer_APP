Freshman,5,"I don't do fully online classes because I understand that, that is not the best way for me to learn but there is some crossover in in person classes and the CSC Online is very easy to use."
Freshman,5,"Professors were understanding, easy to get ahold of, and willing to help. Smaller class size helped a lot, too."
Graduate Student,5,I am a graduate student at Chadron State College and I really have enjoyed the small town type community that they have.
Freshman,5,My experience so far at CSC has been amazing I’m learning better here than I was at my old school. Honestly the only thing that the school could change is the activity options that can be enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,I love going to such a small school it brings out the community within the school and it makes it easier to know everyone within your major.
Freshman,5,It is a very good college the communitte is very supportive and there is something for everyone. There is a degree for almost everything a person can choose from
Junior,5,The START office at CSC has been excellent about answering questions and offering guidance to me as a non-traditional student. I recommend CSC to anyone looking to continue their education.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed viewing the campus at Chadron State. They have excellent facilities and the learning program is above adequate for my learning. I would recommend this college to many high school students.
Freshman,5,I love Chadron State College. I plan on returning and graduation from here. I have met great people and the staff genuinely care about you. I have always had the help I needed when finding myself clueless.
Junior,5,"I Love Charon for it's caring professors and the affordable education I can receive! This school really cares about you, the town can be a bit of a bore at times however"
Niche User,5,"I am still in high school as of now but I will be attending Chadron State College in fall 2020. I have visited and they are the best school out there for my future career. When I visited them made me feel that this could easily make me feel at home. They have an aspect at the college where the students get to know their professors and their professors know them. Students at Chadron are not known but their student number, but by their name. I am excited to get to call Chadron my home next year."
Sophomore,5,"I had an amazing first year at Chadron, being there made me feel like I was at home.  I enjoyed the majority of my classes as my professors were a great group of people who were able to connect with the students as individuals instead of just a number unlike other major university.  Another great part of Chadron is their athletics.  I am on the football team so it might be a little bit biased but athletics at Chadron really bring the campus and the community together.  We have just recently built a new athletic facility which includes a new football stadium, gym, locker rooms, and training room.  Chadron is also building a new outdoors track.  Choosing Chadron was the best decision I could have made for myself and I can not wait to go back next year."
Junior,5,So far I have enjoyed my experience attending Chadron State College.  I really enjoy the flexibility of the online experience and the accelerated classes.
Sophomore,5,"Chadron is a pretty small school, but it's hard to feel trapped. There are so many different people and cultures on our little campus. I swear you see a new face every day. The professors make an honest effort to help you out with anything. Your advisors truly care for their advisees and the food is to die for!"
Sophomore,5,"As a sophomore at Chadron State, I have had an amazing two successful years of college.  The community is small enough that social life has had a major impact on my education and I have been able to maintain relationships with my instructors.  Courses are very challenging and I have gained all sorts of new knowledge from every course I have been enrolled in.  One thing I would change is having more activities available to students on campus as far as social life because of thow small the town of Chadron is."
Freshman,5,"The environment and the many lists of majors , I got accepted to the college and they love to check up on me and see if I need anything and etc , the campus is so beautiful and the community is very nice and same with the people .
They have many majors to exceed somebody’s focus and study them ."
Senior,5,"As a geology major, Chadron has one of the best geology programs in the country. It is one of the few places, perhaps even the only college where you can get a degree in geology online. The field camps every summer are a blast, giving you great field experience in states such as Colorado, Idaho, Utah, etc. With small class sizes you get one on one with your professors. I'd recommend Chadron to anyone who is willing to work hard and to learn."
Niche User,5,It's a great college. A lot of caring people. I have a few people that i know that are there and really enjoy it.
Freshman,5,My experience with Chadron State College has been fabulous. The professors are just out of this world. It is almost like getting one on one learning.
Graduate Student,5,I love Chadron! The way online classes are set up makes it easy for me to fit them into my crazy life. I can't say enough about the difference the Chadron experience has made in my ability to complete my undergrad degree and now return for my graduate degree.
Graduate Student,5,Chadron provides small class sizes and has a great faculty and staff. I feel like they really wanted me to do well after school was finished.
Niche User,5,This school is in the panhandle of western Nebraska.  Chadron is a smaller town with a lot to offer.  the school has small classes which guarantees more one-on-one work.  The college has a good academic program and offers a lot of financial aide.
Senior,5,"The college puts on many different activities to keep the college kids busy. It is very affordable for in-state students at 12,000 per year and is only one dollar more per credit for out of state students. The teachers are highly qualified and get you ready for future jobs or graduate schools."
Niche User,5,This college has amazing facilities and a very welcoming and friendly staff. The students are also very welcoming and it definitely has a hometown feeling to it.
Sophomore,5,"My experience in Chadron State College was overall amazing. The professors are very helpful and patient with you. It's a small town so don't expect the party scene to be great because it's not. That is one of the reasons why I love attending because you have so much free time to focus on your academics more than partying. The people are great and very friendly, if you ever need help they'll come running in a second to come help with whatever you need."
Freshman,5,Like the small campus and the professors are great!  They are very helpful when you have questions or need guidance.
Senior,5,Chadron State is a great place for those who like the small town atmosphere along with always something to do on campus. People are friendly and always treat you like family. Professors care about the students and are always available to students if they ask for help. Loved my experience on campus and online classes are just as great.
College Freshman,5,"My professors are the best. I only have three and I've heard many horror stories about other professors on campus, but mine have only been good. They all seem to know what they're talking about and seem relatively happy each class period which is nice. They're all very animated and easy to listen to."
College Sophomore,5,Chadron State has a lot of things for the kids to do at the campus to keep us busy and not miss home.  I enjoy going to my classes very nice teachers.  I am on the golf team and enjoy playing sports for Chadron State.
College Sophomore,5,Chadron State does not seem to reach the top of the charts for any sports but the students still support their team and are very involved in games. Most students seem to take pride in the school.
College Junior,5,I have heard of very few saxual assults. I go out quite often and I have never really felt unsafe.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the smallness of the campus! It is nice that my professors know me by my name, and not just some number. There is a wide variety of majors and classed offered, which helps with the diversity of the campus. I really can't imagine being anywhere else for college! I have had a great experience at CSC!"
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love CSC! I feel like this was definitely the best place for me! CSC is a small campus, making it feel like we are all a big family. I love the atmosphere of the college! It seems as though the professors are passionate about teaching and genuinely care about me and my success as a student and person!"
College Freshman,5,You always see a security driving around campus.. So i feel safe all the time
College Freshman,5,they are okay could be better less bugs!
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe as campus police are available to the students and there are street lights along all of the sidewalks at night time.
College Freshman,5,Many students from this college are widely hired out of college based on the college's reputation for having good students.
College Freshman,5,Teachers are always available for the students and they encourage us to stop by and ask questions. The classes are enjoyable and peak an interest for me.
College Freshman,5,The students get really into the events and they are advertised very well on campus. We have many dress up days for home games and almost everyone participates. It is a lot of fun.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love this school. I wanted a small town feel and my teachers are always available to help. I feel like home here and I love it.
Freshman,4,It is very nice. Its a smaller campus but still has diversity. My only complaint is that I decided to change my major and they do not offer the major I want to go into here.
Freshman,4,Chadron State College is a great college if you want to stay focused on your studies. There are many helpful professors who want to see you succeed.
Niche User,4,"Very kind staff. They are hardworking and care about each student. The small numbers make it easier to know your professors, and it gives you a better chance at success."
Niche User,4,"The food is not spectacular but you won't find a more friendly staff and as many resources to succeed anywhere else. While there is much to do on and off of campus, academics are a staple in what this place has to offer. Throughout campus, you will find students and professors hard at work to create a better world for the generations to come."
Niche User,4,"very clean, friendly place.Visited a few times due to event from FFA to 4-H. Football camp was a great experience. the dorms were super clean and home feeling. the food is amazing and so is the athletic program."
Niche User,4,I haven’t dealt with them much yet but through referrals I’ve heard great things. I’ve been selected to attend and am now working at trying hard to find scholarships for schooling as money is tigh.
Sophomore,4,Chadron state college is a fun environment and you can make friends very easily here. The cost is super affordable and you get a great return on investment.
Junior,4,"I am new transfer student in my first semester so my experiences are minimal. However I can say that my adviser has been more than helpful and has gone out of her way to help me and answer questions and my professors have been friendly and helpful, as have been the students."
Niche User,4,Its a nice small college in a small town. Everything is nice and simple this makes it really easy to navigate around town and have fun.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Chadron State college is good. I get to meet a wide variety of people here and see some familiar faces from back home. While at Chadron I've always had things to do. CAB puts on events in the hub for students to come win prizes and get to now one another. Chadron is a pretty small campus and I like that because I came from a small school and I get along great here.
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus of Chadron. It really was a good looking college and a great state college, the medical and scientific fields of the college are very impressive for having four cadavers at such a small school. Absolutely a great choice for students whop prefer personal help from teachers, as the school has a 14:1 faculty-student ratio."
Freshman,4,I liked the atmosphere of Chadron and that you could be really close with the professors. The professors will know you by name. This is very helpful when you need help on a project or any other things.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love most of the teachers there. They are people who want to see you work hard and succeed.
Like most schools, the cafeteria food can get boring and unappetizing."
Freshman,4,"So far I have had a good experience here at Chadron State College. So far I have straight A's, which is something I haven't accomplished in quite some time,  so gotta give credit to the professors here on campus. One of my complaints about this campus is how they influence the students here to become comfortable, which is why I constantly here about people procrastinating and instead of going to college to challenge their lifestyle, they keep their old ways by dating people back home. I would like if the college at least influenced some sense of urgency. I do like some of the programs the residence advisers plan, as they get a lot of people together and always result in a fun time."
College Freshman,4,I have enjoyed all of my courses and professors.
College Freshman,4,They have good programs to get us ready later.
College Freshman,4,The health and safety here on campus is good.
College Sophomore,4,There is always a security office at night to walk you back to dorms if you need it.
College Sophomore,4,I don't know much about the Greek Life not interested in it
College Sophomore,4,There is great support for are school sports.
College Sophomore,4,"In chadron I have my own dorm room, I love not having a roommate. Without having a roommate it sometimes gets boring being along but they make fun games and events that happen every week that are entertaining."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the sorority sounds like a lot of fun, I like most of the girls in it and this fall I am going to join."
College Sophomore,4,Ive only been there a semester but so far they are great! I love seeing everyone gear up for the basketball games and its fun to go see everyone supporting the teams!
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy going to Chadron State because I didn't really know anyone when I started, but by the end of the semester I got to know a lot of  people and really enjoyed the campus and all the fun activities."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus housing is great, but at times can use improvement."
College Sophomore,4,"I would choose Chadron State College, over any school, if I had to do it again. The environment is safe, fun, and there is always something going on. Not to mention the professors are great, well at least the majority and fellow classmates are super friendly."
College Freshman,4,"Campus security usually drive around campus at night. The side walks are well lit. Crime in Chadron is very low, so there is not much reason to feel afraid when out at night."
College Freshman,4,"I've made some great friends here, the professors are usually enthusiastic about what they teach, the classes are small, and the dorms are nice to live in."
College Freshman,4,"Chadron State College wants its students to find work as soon as they graduate college. From day one, professors try to tailor students to fit their careers. The career center constantly posts job opens and provides job fairs both semesters."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've seen of the dorms, the overall quality rivals top rated schools and they have a lower housing price. The diversity of people and the social atmosphere creates an fun place to live while studying. The housing process seems to go quite smoothly. Most of the dorms are located right next to educational buildings."
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are small which gives you a chance to work with professors one on one. Most professors are excited about what they teach and want to help students learn.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of connections that students can find after Chadron State College. Student Academic and Career Planning is very helpful.
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed many of my courses and I really love most of my professors.
College Junior,4,"The rooms are big, and every dorm building is within a 5 minute walk to the cafeteria and classrooms."
College Junior,4,I love Chadron State because 1) I have met my best friends here. 2) All of my professors have a genuine interest in my success. 3) I love the small town atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,The small community allows small class sizes and professors that know your name and care about your education.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel like overall, CSC is a very safe campus!"
College Sophomore,4,"CSC is kind of known for their education department, so job prospects are pretty awesome! I would say the quality of professors at CSC is very high; they are passionate about what they do and really care about the education we receive!"
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the dorm life! The dorms I have lived in have been plenty spacious, which is nice! I like the social atmosphere gained from the dorms! Also, I like living on campus because the distance to classes, activities, and just around the campus in general is very nice!"
College Freshman,4,We just got a new coach so hopefully everything is great!
College Freshman,4,The school is great but I wish that all of us can come together as one instead of having lots of diverse groups. I just wish color did not matter still. like each other for the inside not the outside and how the person skin color is.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not know for sure but after talking to people, if you can make it through the science program here with good grades, you will be accepted to a graduate program."
College Sophomore,4,"We are not viewed very well which I believe is mostly because of stereotypes about Greeks.  The school is not very supportive of us and if it wasn't for certain individuals, we wouldn't be here.  Currently we are working really hard to be viewed better by the community as well as get more involved.  We are planning more community service events and applying to a national fraternity to get the guidance we need.  The membership is great though and is worth it."
College Freshman,4,The rooms are plenty spacious and they are very nice the only complaint that I have is that it can get very noisy at night.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, Chadron state is a great school. The resident halls aren't the greatest, but I love everything else. My program is one of the best ones on campus. The social work professors are great."
College Freshman,4,"The campus security are great here on campus. Pretty much every time I am out and about on campus, I see one of the campus security guards. They cruise the parking lots a lot, and they have an escort service available for those in need. The doors are locked between the hours of 7pm and 7am, and only those with a key for that dorm can get in."
College Freshman,4,"When I applied for financial aid, I received the help that I needed, and while I was looking for a job to fill my work study position in the library, one of the librarians offered me a job there. The library also has an entire wall dedicated to internships and job opportunities based on each specific career area."
College Freshman,4,"Chadron State College is a great school for students who are previously from a rural area, or are interested in settling down in a rural area after graduation. I know that most of the students who are from a bigger city don't enjoy living in such a small town, because there is less to keep them occupied. I really enjoy how involved Chadron State is in the community, welcoming high school students from the surrounding towns onto campus for different events. Chadron State is very unique in the fact that it is located in such a small area, so it brings a lot to all of the communities in the area. I would not go to a different school if I had the choice."
College Senior,4,The professors are very willing to help students and they truly care about the education we receive.
College Senior,4,I am an online student therefore I only know about the athletic departments based on what others report to me.
College Student,4,So far I have enjoyed my classes and feel like I am learning a lot.
College Student,4,I prefer the small class size and the professors are approachable.
College Freshman,4,"The learning courses here, at Chadron State College, are excellent. The teachers are great and they teach well. There's a lot of events on campus that I attend so I'm not too bored. Financially, I wasn't ready for college, I need books and I need to pay the rest of my bill off so I can stay here."
College Freshman,4,"its hard to get up for class every morning so I missed almost every day of class since school started, so it sucks.. but  I found the major I want to be in and am striving for that degree finally. its overall, a great small school"
College Junior,4,"It's a very small town, but their are some many opportunities for everyone to succeed in."
College Junior,4,"This college is great, if you like a small campus and small classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,Just have to find  your place but there are a lot of opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great class size, nice campus, good value overall if you don't mind a small town."
Recent Alumnus,4,Applied after the deadline and still got a full tuition undergrad scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Always something open from 7am-midnight, sometimes poor menu choices by cafeteria and sometime grill is understocked (usually before breaks)"
Senior,2,At Chadron State College I have not been as challenged academically as I had hoped to be. Some of The classes that I have taken have not encouraged me to really understand the subject which I find highly frustrating.
College Freshman,2,"For what I am paying, I'd rather live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,Chadron state really does not have a greek life around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I attended another college and they were a lot more strict about the rules in the dorms.  Yet, they were a lot better about student interactions.  The RA's and RD's were hired because of their interactions with people.  They were a lot friendlier and looked to support college students in their activities within reason."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much for Greek life
College Freshman,2,There are so few options. you usually eat the same thing.
College Freshman,2,"I believe there is only the one sorority, and I've yet to hear about a fraternity. Either way, their presence is all but unfelt."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have many programs of study here. Mostly, it's an education school. We also have a lot of people in the Rangeland Management program. They cut the program I was entering the semester before I started here, which upset me a lot because it was the last of its kind in the state. We only have three history professors which makes the course rotation hard to be done in 4 years with. Workload is normal. I have a museum studies minor, which I love. Wish it were a major."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not receive any scholarships, even with a high GPA from the schools I have previously attended, just because I didn't have an associates degree when I transferred. If you aren't in sports, good luck getting scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"Chadron is a small town. It's the same size as my hometown, but my hometown has more options for shopping and dining. Chadron is in the middle of nowhere. You have to drive at least an hour and a half to get to any decent shopping and restaurants. Only a few bars in town. Nice enough movie theater. Not many options for work aside from Walmart. We have three state parks nearby for recreation. Never any concerts. No professional sports teams in the area. The townspeople are pretty used to us college kids and are very friendly and helpful people. The town is fairly safe. I never hear about accidents. But we have had some drug busts on campus."
College Freshman,2,i live in a very small town so not alot of options for food is expected 
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and alcohol are pretty prominent, especially in the fine arts programs. Most students involved in these programs take part in drug and alcohol usage, and little to no enforcement is taken. I have been to many classes and/or performances where participants have shown up high and no enforcement was taken. Many school trips have been taken as well when people have gotten drunk at the hotels. "
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do, unless your life revolves around bowling, going to the movie theater(which shows 3 movies and changes them MAYBE once a week if you're lucky), or smoke hookah. Even then, bowling closes early, and the movie theater and hookah bar open pretty late. Forget parties, they always get busted if they get big and are shut down by midnight. There's only one liquor store and it's pretty expensive, so if you drink you have a pretty limited selection. Shopping wise, they close by 5 or earlier sometimes. The only hangout place worth going to is the bean broker, where you can drink coffee and listen to whatever bands come into play (and if you get headaches easily, don't come cause it's loud). Even though the Bean Broker is a pretty nice place to be, the liquor, food, and coffee is more expansive than Starbucks or a sit down restaurant for what you're getting. I would say it's San Francisco pricing, and if you've ever been to an independent coffee shop there, you would know what I mean. 

Fast food wise you have mcdonalds, subway, and taco johns. That's it. Forget taco bell or panda express or literally anything else. The closet place to get any of that is rapid, an hour and half to two hours away. Plus only 3 restaurants in town which are on par with cafeteria food, yet charge close to $10 a meal. Want a pizza? fork out $10 for a medium pizza, barely enough to feed an 18 year old, 100 pound girl who ate lunch a few hours ago. If you don't like pizza hut, then it looks like you won't be getting any pizza."
College Sophomore,2,There are a couple bars here but not much else. The RLA puts on events and dances which can be fun.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not really a diversity for people who want to pursue a career outside of Social work, teaching, or agriculture."
College Freshman,2,"Were in the a small town so there are no buses that I know of. You pretty much have to have your own car if you want to go out of town, but everything is walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm an African American who is a third year student here at Chadron State College, and most people here are of Caucasian background. It was quite hard at first adjusting to the culture here, but if you have a positive attitude it won't be a problem after the first month. However if you play football or any sport you'll be fine because there are a quite a few people of color on the teams. All in all economic background is middle class, living is easy here because once you get into the school pretty much everything will be provided."
College Freshman,2,"Limited Fast Food Restaurants – There are only 5 fast food restaurants in Chadron. They are Taco John's, Arby's, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and Subway. McDonalds is open 24 hours a day which is very nice. However everything else closes at 9 or 10. There are also a few local restaurants. Angela's eatery is a good place to get decent Mexican food. There is also a New York Pizzeria, and a Country Kitchen. They are all located within 5 minutes of driving from campus."
College Junior,2,"COLD COLD COLD! It snows a lot, there is a lot of wind, but classes get cancelled for the snow! All the classes are close though and there are lots of buildings to cut through for the longer ones."
Alum,1,"Of course it's easy to get A's. The education quality is low & unchallenging so it's easy to get good grades. The real problem comes when you graduate & are looking for a job, it's a no name, unrecognizable college which makes your degree basically useless on its own. 

Spent 4 yrs at this college & I regret it when I look back at it. 2 incidents stand out for me where once I was confronted with a professor who blatantly discriminated against me & decided to try to mistreat me & I reported it to HR which decided not do anything about it. 

2nd incident I remember is having suite mates who were being deliberately destructive, kicking on the shared bathroom door & opening the bathroom door while there were occupants in it,playing loud music and screaming late at night, I decided to report them & guess what, the resident director decided to side with them.

I now have a BA degree which is basically useless & I don't even have much of an experience to look back in this substandard college"
College Freshman,1,"The athletic facility here kills. The hours are incredibly wonky. I like to workout at night but I can't do that because it closes at seven. Also, they have a totally separate gym for athletes, that regular students can't use. We have to share the gym with all the people in town. The gym here was a huge letdown."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life on campus aside from academic groups.
College Freshman,1,we actually don't have a greek life 
College Junior,1,"I enrolled in the online MBA program at Chadron State College in Nebraska.
I am a 30-something professional that has been out of college for only a couple of years. I have completed two Bachelor's degrees online and a Master's Certificate prior to enrolling at Chadron. In addition I have a 3.9 GPA and am a Mensan. 
I chose Chadron because they had an MBA program, my employer's tuition reimbursement would cover the entire degree, and I could earn it in less than two calendar years. 
My first class was Managerial Economics. The first homework assignment was a handful of questions from three different chapters in the book. I literally spent hours on the homework, without completing it or even understanding how to complete it. My fellow students had questions and requested help to which the instructor directed them back to the other students in the class. The book offered no good examples of how to complete the homework and the supplementary information provided by the instructor loaded to the course content did not review examples of the math either. I ended up dropping the class as a result of the lack of response from the instructor. I contacted the advisor and graduate studies director after dropping to explain the situation and request more information on how I could have been successful. Two weeks later I still had no answers and just got the run around.
I would not recommend this school. It is not acceptable to teach from a math book with no answers or relevant examples. Further the instructor should not push student questions back to fellow students and ignore student emails."
College Freshman,1,Don't drink in dorms or even on campus. You will get written up and sometimes MIP's. Even being discreet about it doesnt work they seem to always find out. Most of the time you just get a warning but if you keep doing it you have the possibility of getting kicked out of the dorms.
College Junior,1,"The people who work in the cafeteria are super nice and friendly, always asking how your day is, etc. The food is GROSS though!!"
College Junior,1,"We have few restaraunts in Chadron, McDonalds, Arby's, Subway, not even a Wendy's or Taco Bell. It is hard to find food off Campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"As far as I know, there are not public forms of transportation at Chadron. So if you want to go somewhere, you better have a car, bike, or friend with wheels cause otherwise you're walking."

Junior,5,"Mount Marty has been my home away from home. Before coming to Mount Marty I went to a different college and just hated being at school everyday and was not motivated to do good in school. Once I can to Mount Marty I feel like it is the place I am supposed to be. I get to be with excellent teachers, great environment and great coaches. While being a cheerleader at Mount Marty I get to experience the crowds and I get to see the great MMC spirit."
Freshman,5,"It is a great community of people who you can rely on and trust. Everyone knows everyone, and it creates a great atmosphere. Teachers care, which is not always common in other colleges."
Niche User,5,Mount Marty College is a very small college that is growing. Their athletics are starting to improve especially now that they've decided to make an indoor track facility. They also provide a very good financial package for people who are struggling to pay for college which is really nice. Everyone I met there was very supportive and truly wanted to help get the best for you. I think it's a very lovely college that a small town person would enjoy!

Alum,5,"Mount Marty is one of my favorite places to return to time and time again. I enjoyed my time there, immensely. It's a great, small enough campus with a loving community. You have small class sizes and it's not overwhelming. The people are great and very friendly. I don't think I would change anything about this wonderful college, the campus, or the community."

College Junior,5,"Small Class Sizes – I think the most people in a class, I've known of anyway, is 40 students.  This is a beneift because the teachers have more one-on-one time with students.  They actually care about you and know you and want you to suceed"
College Freshman,5,"Parking at Mount Marty College is great. There is enough parking spots for all students and more. It is like a normal parking lot, but if you park wrong or exc, you will recieve a ticket. Which I think is fair for the other students."
College Senior,5,"The school is very small in which students can walk from class to class with ease. For activities that are farther from the school, school buses are offered to transport students to and from the activities."
Sophomore,4,"Mount Marty is a small college with many opportunities for you to pursue. Everyone on campus whether it is a professor, campus staff, or another student cares about you and wants to see you succeed."
Sophomore,4,Everyone makes you feel very comfortable. And everyone is very friendly. You learn a lot from the professors and they always have time to help you understand if you have questions about the lessons.
Sophomore,4,I am currently enrolled at MMC and I absolutely love it. The community feeling makes you feel as if you're at home.
Junior,4,The nursing program is great. Very educational and pushes you to know your information. The dorms are great very spacious with lots of storage. We have lots of community benifits.
College Sophomore,4,"All of the students in this program have to pass a background check prior to being accepted, so I feel very safe at my school. Many of the students in this program have families and there are no safety issues."
College Sophomore,4,"Many of the anesthesia professors at Mount Marty College have been practicing in the field for many years and not only lecture on the content from textbooks, but can relate it to their own clinical experiences to help tie the textbook to real life situations. Not only do they push us to be successful in the classroom, but also in the community where we come together as a school, take time out of their busy lives and textbooks, to volunteer and help those in need. This school prepares us not only to be experts in our field, but also as humanitarians."
College Sophomore,4,"Parties are okay for socializing, in my opinion.  They bring people closer together and bond them.  However, I do not party often at all (3 times,) and even then I only attended the party and did not drink or do drugs like other students."
College Sophomore,4,"This is one of the few processes that is efficient and not a hassle at MMC.  Submitting the FASFA on line is the only part that is sometimes a hassle.  Other than that, the college does its job efficiently."
College Junior,4,Our school is big into diversity and we want to make sure everyone is treated equal and that no one should be left out from activities because of their background of any kind.
College Junior,4,My Experience at Mount Marty College has been Great. I am not a number at this school and the professors really care for me. I will get E-mail asking if I am doing alright in the class. You will  not find that in a smaller school. It feels really good to know that I am cared for and the professors want me to be successful. Courses are really good and even for a small school I think that their is a lot that can be offered yet.
College Junior,4,This school has a 98% placement rating after graduation Meaning that most students get a job right after college in their field of choice. So you know that employers respect having a degree from this college. I know in my first year as well they had me go observe classroom because I want to be a teacher and the teacher I observed graduated from Mount Marty and she got three job offers right away.
College Sophomore,4,there is people from many states so there is a big variety of looks and interest.
College Sophomore,4,There is a big lake close to the college where you can go fishing or boating. Also on Tuesdays you can go to the theater and get a student discount.
College Sophomore,4,"I would say that almost half of the students in MMC are involve in a kind of sport, and we take sports very serious."
College Sophomore,4,Since is a small town the restaurants are very close to the campus.
College Sophomore,4,Its great! we have the cafeteria and is a buffet you can serve yourself as many times as you want. also you can go to the Cyber which is the store in the school.
College Sophomore,4,"Here at Mount Marty we are a small community, very conservative and religious. This is a  very small Catholic College but there is a big diversity of students from counties, like Mexico, Australia, Ireland, and the Sudan and we all treat each other like family."
College Freshman,4,The small class sizes allow you to be able to be familiar with professors and gives you a better chance of succeeding.
College Freshman,4,"No 24hr fast food isn't the best, Subway is open till 3am on Saturdays. There is a wide range of options within Yankton and close by, which is good for being a small town."
College Freshman,4,Due to the small school size their isn't a huge amount of options but there is still a good amount. Nursing is probably the premier program the school has to offer. The business program has given me a good feel so far.
College Freshman,4,Permits are free. Sometimes it's difficult to find a spot near Bede Hall.
College Freshman,4,This is a pretty strict private Catholic campus.
College Freshman,4,"There are no drugs here on campus, which is awesome. Every now and then you hear about someone drinking, but that's it."
College Freshman,4,I very much enjoy the dining here on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Everything you should need is here. We are a smaller campus, but we do have some nice facilities."
College Freshman,4,"Yankton is cold for the better part of the school year, and it can sometimes get chilly walking from building to building. Just bundle up!"
College Sophomore,4,Our nursing program is excellent as far as the other majors I am not very informed about them because most students here are nursing majors.  But we do offer a variety of different majors.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a small campus with good lighting if you are walking from the ""far"" parking lot to the dorms late at night the security guards strongly encourage us to call them for a escort to make sure the students are safe at all time.  The security phone number is also posted all over campus."
College Junior,4,There Is Close Parking Everywhere On Campus However Some Parking Lots Are Not Lit At night
College Sophomore,4,Professors here push you to your max to make the best come out in you! They want you to succeed and there are many classes that may be take for anything.
College Sophomore,4,Being a Double Major in Physical and Special Education is a big work load. It is possible at Mount Marty to get it done in four years but it rarely happens. It is good because all of the education professors are there for us and want us to get a job. Last year we had a 100% job placement in the education field.
College Sophomore,4,"Mount Marty is a small school and get people all over. We have  Mexicans, African American, Asian, and some other. But it is good school where everyone gets along."
College Sophomore,4,"Since Mount Marty College is a small school we have plenty of chances to ask the professors more questions.  They are very helpful, and go out of their way to help each student.  The registration process is made very easy, because there is someone always there to help you through it- professors, students, advisors, etc... We have a nice library that I like to study in.  A lot of people also study in the ""Cyber Cafe"", which is where you can order food, and Starbucks.  There is also a ""Learning Center"" that people use for extra help in certain areas of a class that they might be struggling in, or just need to have a little extra help."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of places to eat off-campus in Yankton.  Some restaurants provide a discount to Mount Marty College students, while there are others who do not.  We have a variety of food choice from: American, Mexican, Italian, Chinese... So there are plenty of choices to choose from.  My personal favorite of all restaurants in Yankton is the Mexican restaurant- El Tapitio."
College Sophomore,4,"I am in the nursing program, at Mount Marty.  I do enjoy it, even though it can be tough at times.  It does take a lot of work to do well in the nursing program here, but it is totally worth it.  In the long run, I will have my BS degree in nursing, within four years.  I am almost done with my second year, so time has flown by very quickly.  We get great oppurtunities as nursing students here.  We go to the nursing home, medical floor, and surgical floor to practice what we have learned, by the time you are a sophomore! I would recommend Mount Marty College to anyone who's interested in nursing."
College Senior,4,"I have been quit satisfied with my education thus far. I am a criminal justice major and human services minor, and all of my professors have been out in the field and are very accomplished. With my advisor he gives great advice on how to apply for law enforcement jobs and etc."
College Senior,4,The academics at the college are challenging in some areas. Classes perfect or level of each major. The campus is small enough to where you don't have to be running late to anything and professors get to know you well enough to help with any questions that you may have!
College Sophomore,4,The company that runs the dining program recently changed in August and so far I'd say the food has been a much needed upgrade. So far so good!
College Junior,4,"They Know People Make Mistakes – The first violation is usually dealt with a small community service event on campus and it isn't recorded and usually isn't a big deal.  However, the second and third violations come with fines and possible police interaction."
College Junior,4,"Everything You Need. Mount Marty is an old school, and deep rooted in Cathloic tradition.  The campus facilities and buildings are beautiful, but need rennovations. However, they are continually changing to meet the needs of the students. I believe this year they are getting a new resturant and coffee bistro and also building a new wellness center.  Everything a student needs is there, or on the way.  The class sizes are small and the many organizations are very self-rewarding and also give back to the community."
Junior,2,"The professors are amazing, for the most part. A majority of them are very dedicated, understanding, and flexible with their schedules. However, the school staff (departments such as Financial Aid Office, Business Office, and especially Student Affairs) is extremely unprofessional and inconsistent. Without getting too much into detail, the school cares more about getting as many students as possible and making as much money as possible (without making any changes to the living arrangements, imagine having 300 beds, and already having 200 students, and then recruiting 150 new students, but then not accommodating the new students), over the morale and needs of the students already attending. The tuition raises yearly and with no explanation and zero changes to the facilities, quality of education, or anything. Also, certain members of the campus security have a vendetta to get students in to trouble, simply to make their own life more interesting."
Freshman,2,My experience was okay here. I enjoyed the friends that I made and the professors. I would change the parking and the food.
Sophomore,2,"The community is great, most teachers are very helpful; however, the facilities are terrible. Also, the tuition goes up yearly just to help renovate unnecessary things such as the carpet in a certain building but not the dorms with broken sinks, showers, toilets, and radiators"
College Sophomore,2,"We have no student discounts, which the college should absolutely fix.  There are plenty of fast food places; however."
College Sophomore,2,"The wireless internet is sometimes very slow, and takes along time to watch videos."
College Sophomore,2,"I go to Mount Marty College, located in SD and the weather over here can change your campus experience in hours specially on the winter. The snow doesn't allow us to do many activities outside during the winter."
College Sophomore,2,Cold winds off of the river. 
College Sophomore,2,It is a small town and a small campus.  We find things to do to keep us entertained.  No crazy concerts or big festivals in this town but we manage.
College Freshman,2,parking is brutal if you cant get the in the front parking lot. Other wise it is a walk from acorss campus to your dorms. You can always fiind a parking space just might be farther then what you would like.
College Freshman,2,"Not the Best – The food is not great.  We only have a main dining room, and the ""cyber cafe"".  Both are run by the same business and both are repetetive, but the cyber cafe does have good $5.00 meal deals, that can be good."
College Sophomore,2,Average Campus in SD – The library is hardly ever used. The Athletic center is ok. Student learning center is helpful if you need it. There are tons of Yankton campus activites.
College Sophomore,1,"Our school requires students to live on campus.  To make the students stay on campus, this crappy college takes away 28% from the students hard worked for scholarships, and also from their well deserved grants.  It is bull sh*t.

Also, since the state would not let MMC raise tuition, the college is undercutting the students by raising the meal plan/housing prices by at least $1000 per year."
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs/alcohol are a problem for some.  Also there have been many noise issues.  The parking is the worst.  However, I believe they should be less strict about visitation in the dorms, even if this is a catholic college."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus food's staff is either lacking enough people to work efficiently, or they do not work hard enough.  Salad bar is quite often never refilled, as well as there are frequent problems of undercooked chicken and other meats.  The stir-fry line is always too long and takes almost a half hour to go through, that students leave there unsatisfied daily.  This line is the last section of the food line, so when it gets long, students have to cut in and out between other students, just to get some of the other food behind the stir fry line.  Very poor set up."
College Sophomore,1,"Cost. Couldn't increase tuition, so increased housing but $5000 next year.  System is not fair for housing process as well.  Poor RA system."
College Freshman,1,"There is no campus transportation available, but there is an occasional taxis around."

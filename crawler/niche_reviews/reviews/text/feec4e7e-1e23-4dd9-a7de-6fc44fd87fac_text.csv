Senior,5,"Hamilton is the best thing that ever happened to me. The cost of attendance ended up being comparable to the highest rated state school I was considering  and the quality of education has been incredible. Every class I am amazed by how much professors can accomplish, challenging students to consider questions about their understanding and tailoring work to their learning. There's always parties on the weekend ranging from house concerts to greek life mixers, though if you're looking for a traditional party school Hamilton likely isn't the place for you. I sometimes wish the administration was a bit more responsive to concerns of the student body, especially when it comes to issue of access and race. Unfortunately it's also not easy to be physically handicapped at Hamilton, as few dorms and academic spaces are tailored for disabled students."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus!!!

Amazing food!

Professors really care about you understanding the material.

Resource centers are always available and extremely useful to those that utilize it!"
Sophomore,5,"There are 2 good reasons one would choose to go to Hamilton: the open curriculum and academics, and the community.  The open curriculum encourages students to explore different topics that they're interested in rather than waste their time with gen ed classes.  Thanks to the open curriculum, and randomly found a second major that I didn't even know existed until I came to Hamilton.  Hamilton's emphasis on good writing and communication skills has also proved invaluable when inquiring about jobs or internships.  
As for the community, there is no community like at Hamilton. Yes, there are downsides to being at Hamilton, such as the location, the limited range of food options, and the often crummy weather.  However, the people at this school 100% make up for it.  The school holds a true ""we're all in this together"" mentality, and the small class sizes allow you to get to know many of your classmates as well as your professors."
Freshman,5,"Professors care and love you and cater to each individual student.  An open curriculum allows the student to pick classes that they want to take with no class requirements, and a class cap of 40 students gives each student the one on one time with the professors that they need.  The school is mellow and stress less."
Freshman,5,"The vibe you get from Hamilton is that it's a community rather than a school.  It's not a big state school, and it's not near a city,  it's certainly not cheap, and the weather is sorta awful, but it's MY school.  Something you'll see is that alumni and students alike are all very proud of this place.  I cant tell you the amount of times I've left my house and have worn Hamilton gear and have been screamed at from across the street from a passionate alum (even though I live thousands of miles from  the school).  

Sure it may not be the most enticing location, but if having one of the most generous alumni networks doesn't tell you everything, then you should refigure your priorities."
Sophomore,5,The small campus allows for you to get to know many people on a deeper level than at larger state schools. The academics are unparalleled and the environment stimulates intellectual and social growth and development
Sophomore,5,"Hamilton College offers a highly academic environment, while also enhancing sports, sciences, and general wellness. The school culture and personel are wonderful as well as their embracing of diversity."
Freshman,5,Hamilton College offers a rewarding small school experience.  Professors are excellent and are available as needed. Campus is spectacular although liking winter is a must!
Alum,5,"Ok I went and I’m baffled by the negative reviews that it is cold and remote.  This was not a surprise for me, and that was pre internet.  What I wanted and got was a place that focused on teaching and academics and a 9:1 student:teacher ratio.  No TAs and virtually no multiple choice exams in 4 years.  That was non-existent in larger colleges and universities then and the landscape is worse now.   If you want an intimate teaching environment with PhDs who are supported to teach (and not surviving on grant support), you may want to consider Hamilton where you likely will get your money’s worth."
Senior,5,"Absolutely amazing. The campus, professors, food, everything is top notch. Almost didn’t even visit due to its location, but turns out there is plenty to do off campus. Food on campus and off campus is great. Best curriculum of the LACs, and the open curriculum is a significant plus. Professors care and really want to teach. The campus is beautiful, and the dorms are really nice. Again, didn’t even consider it at first because of location, but glad I did. New Hartford is only about five miles away, is a good size, and has everything you could want. Hamilton is a hidden gem."
Junior,5,"I am now halfway through my time at Hamilton, and I have never regretted my decision to come here. Although student experience isn't perfect—my biggest gripes are that there's not a lot going on in Clinton, the housing lottery is a bit of a mess, and the mental health center needs more counselors—the community is incredibly friendly, diverse, and supportive. The idea of there being a ""Hamily,"" cliche as it is, is actually very accurate. There is definitely a niche (or several niches) for everyone, and because the student body is all very involved in what's going on on campus, there's always something to dip your toes into."
Sophomore,5,"I applied here early decision and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The emphasis on communication has really helped my writing and public speaking skills. The professors are really caring and especially if you go to office hours, they'll be very generous with helping you understand the class's content. The academics are definitely demanding, but your professors care about quality, not quantity. Usually assignments are more about showing a thorough understanding rather than just throwing busy work at us. The community here is really welcoming, its a great place to find new hobbies and meet a wide range of people. It can get a little chilly, but the snow is beautiful and it stays quite warm throughout the fall. Clinton is a cute town and there's much more to do in New Hartford, which is only 15 minutes away. Plus there's lots to do on campus as well."
Sophomore,5,"I feel like it's a cliché at Hamilton to say that the people here are the best part of your Hamilton experience but it really is true.  I've never found a better more engaged group of people.  I know that all of the friends I have found here will be with me for the rest of my life, but it's not just the individuals I am really close to that have transformed my life here.  It's the little interactions.  Classes at Hamilton tend to be discussion-based and because of the open curriculum students are so engaged in class.  They are the reason I'm still excited to go to my 9 AM's.  Because Hamilton is also a relatively small school I also feel like I can recognize most people's faces (don't get me wrong there are still lots of new people to meet) but people who I pass by every day, even though we've never had a conversation, will still smile at me and say hello.  I never felt homesick during my time here.  I really feel like Hamilton is a second home."
Sophomore,5,"Hamilton College places a heavy emphasis on developing writing and communication skills, which definitely helps prepare us for applications/ careers in the future. There are very friendly and pleasant interactions on campus amongst the student body and staff. Theft isn't really an issue on campus; most people leave their belongings unattended and return to them later with nothing missing. Great school and beautiful campus!"
Freshman,5,"My time at Hamilton has been excellent, the education is incredible,  and the community is wonderful. The highlight of it all is the professors, who are so intelligent, and and so so kind and helpful.  I don't regret coming here at all."
Freshman,5,"A degree from Hamilton can really take you anywhere, if you take advantage of what's offered here-- that means the career center, networking opportunities, research, scholarships and grants. There's so much to offer.
Culturally, I love that there are two sides preps and athletes fit in just as much as artsy, indie people do. You just have to find your niche. It seems that some people who don't fit into either of those categories and are purely academic, might struggle a bit more socially. 
Yes, we're geographically isolated, but the school does a great job of bringing fantastic cultural events and performances here from all over that you would have to pay big money to see elsewhere (here, it's $5 max). 
Professors are like no other. Party scene can be whatever you make of it, depending on whether you're involved with greek life, sports, clubs, etc. 
Really interesting people here."
Niche User,5,"Hamilton College has provided me with numerous accounts of patience and understanding, and it has given me so much consideration. It advertises discovering yourself, and since I was very confused of my passions and my character before applying, I feel more comfortable knowing I have Alexander with me."
Niche User,5,i love new York it is an absolute dream to go. and being able to go there for college is a great way to open my mind more
Freshman,5,"I am happier than I ever thought I could be at this school. The people here are amazing it is a wonderful community and it is very easy to make meaningful relationships quickly. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and understanding in most cases, and there are many in the administration you can reach out to. I have made the best friends I’ve ever had, met the love of my life, and became truly passionate in so many subjects. I feel very prepared for the world and very supported by this college. PLEASE visit if you’re interested. This school was such a hidden gem for me."
Freshman,5,"I love the hill. It's not perfect, and maybe one thing I feel I didn't realize coming here is how absolutely isolated it is, but if you're okay with that, this school really is amazing."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved Hamilton so far. I am a sophomore here and these two years have been truly amazing. It really does feel like home for me. I get sad to leave and excited to return. The faculty love what they teach and really care about their students, which enhances the learning environment and makes it a lot of fun. You are able to explore different academic routes with the open curriculum, which is something I really cherish."
Sophomore,5,"I love Hamilton. It's not by any means perfect, but the college truly does it's best to give students all they need to succeed. From the professors learning not only your name, but who you are as a person, to the staff's friendly hellos and helpful advice, Hamilton is full of wonderful people who care. 

That's what makes Hamilton stand out above all the rest."
Niche User,5,"Great experience, great school, highly recommend it. Only thing that really bugged me was the lack of diversity."
College Junior,5,Professors are usually passionate and want to interact/help students.
College Senior,5,"I have never felt afraid on campus. Crime will happen anywhere, but it is minimal here. At Hamilton, you can leave your laptop and phone on a desk for days unattended and no one will touch it. That is not an exaggeration. If I lost my wallet today, it would be where I left it tomorrow."
College Senior,5,"You can run into a bad professor anywhere, but you can't run into the best professors anywhere. I have so many great mentors who were my professors in the past few years. The courses are great because you really have a voice in them and feel involved in what is going on."
College Senior,5,"We have walk-in closets, spacious rooms, and you can always live with friends. The housing down the hill is a little inconvenient, but some of those buildings have singles with their own bathrooms, so even that has perks. My friends at other schools are all jealous of the dorms here."
College Senior,5,"Hamilton has such a small and close-knit community that hasn't been matched by any other school I have heard about or seen. Beginning with our unique small group orientation trips, we are on a campus where caring about others and having empathy is the most important thing. Although it is a competitive school it is nurturing, and students help each other. Because of the small size, we are also very close with our professors and the administration. It is not uncommon to go to dinner at professor's homes, or even at the presidents home. The connections I have made here are incredible, and I would never ask for it to have been any different."
College Freshman,5,I love Hamilton College! Best decision I made was coming here. Everyone is so nice. Classes are challenging but manageable.
College Freshman,5,I feel safer here than I do at home even though I live in a very safe neighborhood in a very safe town
College Sophomore,5,"My school is incredible. Great people, intelligent professors. Not great weather, but having amazing people around helps you get through it."
College Freshman,5,Absolutely incredible! This school will challenge your intellectual capacity. The professors care a lot but there is a range in quality. Don't underestimate the open curriculum.
College Freshman,5,"This schools reputation in the work force is amazing, far more people know Hamilton than I realized."
College Freshman,5,Great academics for all majors. You can even create your own major. And the professors are mostly very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"There are generally very few problems, and the administration has addressed everything immediately."
College Sophomore,5,"I was in Wertimer my freshman year and absolutely loved it. The community was great, it was a small dorm and we all knew each other pretty well."
College Sophomore,5,My classes have probably been my favorite part because I only take subjects I'm really interested in. I've made a lot of great friends and met a variety of interesting people as well.
College Freshman,5,The Chinese program is stellar.
College Freshman,5,"Its definitely challenging.  I am always pushed outside of my comfort zone, but it is not too overwhelming."
College Freshman,5,So pretty and a great mixture of old and new buildings.
College Freshman,5,"Clinton is cute.  If you want a city atmosphere obviously this is not your place, but it has everything one would need and is beautiful."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is seriously so attractive physically, but also interesting in other ways."
College Freshman,5,"I have no regrets about Hamilton.  I love the small classes and sense of community on campus.  The professors are great and so are the classes.  As a freshman, I have had a much easier time adjusting to this school than many of my other friends at other colleges.  The people are just very welcoming and friendly."
College Freshman,5,"I am still a freshman, but I already have an internship for the summer.  The career office has been very helpful, especially the peer mentors, in helping with resume help and interview tips."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is a great option, but it doesn't dominate the school.  People will not judge you for being in one or not.  They do throw some good parties on the weekends."
College Freshman,5,"Athletics are pretty good, but the school does not revolve around them.  If you do not play a varsity sport, there are still plenty of options to play at the club or intramural level."
College Freshman,5,"People usually eat on campus because there are so many options here, but off campus dining can be nice, too.  Ordering Asian Bistro or Indian food can be fun."
College Freshman,5,"people like to sh*t on the admin, but they really are not that bad when it comes down to it.  They tend to have everyone's best interest in mind and are fairly lenient with rules."
College Freshman,5,"Always something going on.  Its super easy to find parties, even as a freshman.  There are all campus party options, but also smaller things going on in the suites/downtown."
College Freshman,5,"School spirit for varsity sports isn't that high, but what would you expect from a very small liberals arts college that's division III (versus a big division I public university)? Hamilton can be pretty good at sports and athletes take pride. Club and intramural sports are also very popular and provides options for everyone."
College Freshman,5,"The few places in Clinton are delicious (such as Tony's and Nola's), and just 15-20 minutes to New Hartford and Utica has all the ""normal/common"" places (fast-food to restaurants) you can think of (Chipotle, Applebess, etc.)"
College Freshman,5,"Scholarships are hard to get, but hey scholarships are scholarships - free money is always nice."
College Freshman,5,"For starters, off-campus housing is being eliminated. However, on-campus housing is great, with a surprising amount of variety. You can live in suites, singles, doubles, triples, quads, and special ""apartments"". Greek housing does not exist but is not necessarily a bad thing. For the most part, all dorms make it easy to get anywhere on campus and are pretty spacious and clean. Of course there are exceptions, but usually are coupled with perks that make sense. For example, Dunham, a big mostly freshman dorm, may not have the nicest, most spacious rooms, but it always acts as a major social hub for freshman. Private bathrooms to rooms and suites do exist but are not as ""necessary"" as you would think as they are nice to have. Hamilton just switched to ""all freshman housing"", but most of these dorms actually still have a few upperclassmen. The dark side dorms are mostly made of stone and have the signature ""waffle"" ceilings and huge windows. The light side dorms have a different feel altogether, with opposites, and wherever you end up it's nice. There are ""nicer, more desirable"" dorms than others, but if you really get down to it, all of Hamilton housing is pretty nice."
College Freshman,5,Plenty of options with super dedicated professors.
College Freshman,5,Double majoring is very doable.
College Junior,5,"It's not complicated and hard to get. If you have any questions just ask the faculty, the majority of them are super helpful and friendly."
College Sophomore,5,"Hamilton students are unlike any people you'll ever meet. Come here for the academics, but stay for the people."
College Sophomore,5,"Wifi is awesome, but technology can fail in the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,Hamilton is need blind and meets full student need.
College Sophomore,5,The physics department here is a amazing and I would not change for the world
Senior,4,"I've had some professors transition wonderfully to adapt to online platforms, even improving some aspects of the course through it, and others who have done less amazingly. At the worst it's lectures with limited class discussion and not much engagement from students coming in virtually to a hybrid class style, but at its best its breakout rooms, polls, and hand raising all well connected to the content being discussed."
Senior,4,"Hamilton College is a good place to be to hone one's writing and language skills.   The campus is beautiful, and the professors are kind. I have thrived with small class sizes and the intimate community. My biggest complaint is simply the glaring lack of diversity."
Senior,4,"The professors did the best they could moving online mid-semester. It was a difficult transition, but the classes ran smoothly over all. I believe switching all courses to pass/fail was the right decision to fairly handle everyone's different situations during COVID quarantine."
Sophomore,4,Hamilton is a good school with great opportunities and an overall enjoyable experience. One of the major downsides is that the school is practically in the middle of nowhere and is therefore very isolated.
Alum,4,"Few institutions will give you a true liberal arts education like Hamilton. Academic rigor is Hamilton's strong suit. With the open curriculum, students are encouraged to study outside of their comfort zones, and for the most part, they do. Classes are small and professors are real people. Not a cut-throat academic culture - office hours are everything here. There are great student resource centers, especially the writing center and oral communications center, both of which are staffed by students. Hamilton is fully residential for students, but luckily most housing is quite good, providing plenty of options.

On the other hand, student life is just... fine. Plenty of clubs, organizations, and events, but parties and nightlife are average. Clinton is a sleepy little town, so don't expect much down the hill. Food is getting better at Hamilton, but the vegetarian and vegan options still disappoint. The staff barely knows what vegan means, to be honest."
Freshman,4,"It's a small school, so you form very close connections with your friends. However, I found this to be somewhat limiting."
Alum,4,"Hamilton is a small but strong community. If you are able to find your niche, it can be a very rewarding college experience."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed how writing-central the school is, but the price of the school is almost unjustifiable when coupled with the travel expenses."
Sophomore,4,"Hamilton College is a great liberal arts school that focuses a lot on writing, which I've found to help me a lot in job interviews and applications. It's a hard school, but a great community and you receive a wonderful education here."
College Freshman,4,"The gyms have a lot of good equipment, and there are several places to do exercise beside weight lifting (basketball courts, pool, etc.)"
College Freshman,4,"I'm aware that it's going to be hard to get by in college, but the support system is definitely there. You just have to use it"
College Junior,4,Hamilton alum are very involved with the school and the career center is great.
College Junior,4,"There is no longer any off campus housing, so everybody lives on the hill. There are a great selection of dorms on both sides of campus."
College Junior,4,"The glen around the college is one of the best and most unique features of Hamilton. There is endless exploring and bonfires to be had. If you are from a big city, you'll be amazed by how great it is to be able to take a forest walk as a study break. The glen is just one part of Hamilton's focus on the outdoors. Both the outing club and the environmental studies departments are thriving, close knit communities."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't personally needed these resources yet, but I know the are helpful and very available."
College Freshman,4,Most of my professors have been excellent and I have had great interaction with them.
College Freshman,4,Campus crime is very low and not too many instances occur.
College Freshman,4,I think the overall quality of housing here is great with lots of different options.
College Freshman,4,Most of my professors and classes have been excellent.
College Senior,4,"The network is amazing and the value of a degree here is high, but since we don't have a ton of diverse specialized majors, that can stand in the way of certain career paths."
College Senior,4,"We are a division 3 school, so sports aren't crazy here, but students all have a good balance between being fit, academic, and social."
College Freshman,4,The professors are really knowledgeable about their subjects and really want their students to do well and ask questions
College Freshman,4,"It is an extremely small school so I see people I know everywhere I go. Unfortunately because it is so small, there aren't always enough activities going on to keep me busy and it's slightly difficult to get off campus to go somewhere fun."
College Sophomore,4,Everything I have experienced has been good.
College Sophomore,4,"The light side dorms are my favorite, very beautifully designed and close to my classes."
College Freshman,4,"Annex, Hub, and all campus parties tend to be pretty good. Bundy... can't say the same thing, but not bad if you have pre-gamed."
College Freshman,4,"You know where the horror shows go down, you can choose if you want to go  (cough cough Bundy)"
College Freshman,4,"Lots of work, but interesting classes."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school. Its a lot of work. The professors demand a lot from you, because they want you to learn and do well. I was a January admit, so me and 30 other January admits had the option to take classes in London out first semester. People who are jans do many different things, from work at home to study abroad. The transition to campus has been a little tough. The academics are much more rigorous here than they were in London. People here are generally welcoming and friendly but coming in mid year is a bit tough socially because many of my classmates had already gone through the making friends and figuring out what do to stage. Commons is generally good. It does get old after awhile, but its not too bad. It is worse having to walk in the next morning and awkwardly dodge your hook up from last night. The community here is great! Everyone is very supportive of one another. Many students go and support their friends in sports, or art shows, or plays, etc. Feb fest is a fun time of the year. For a week in February the school has all sorts of activities going on. They range from Mr. Hamilton (male beauty pageant), to chocolate tasting, to black light sledding, to cheering on the hockey team."
College Freshman,4,"I'd say it's pretty diverse, for an expensive liberal arts school, though. Which means it's still not very diverse racially, but I don't think anyone really minds that. Everyone's very well accepted."
College Freshman,4,"They have pretty nice housing for freshman, I think. I live in Wertimer and love it. Sophomore housing kind of stinks, and then upperclassmen housing is really nice."
College Freshman,4,We have EMT's on campus that are very responsive and make everyone safe. Very little crime and the area is very safe.
College Freshman,4,I'm only a freshman so I don't know much just yet but from what I've heard we have a great alum network.
College Freshman,4,"Courses are great and they have a good variety, but really only when you get up into higher-level courses, which is normal. I haven't had any ""life-changing' professors yet, but they've all been great and love what they do. Class sizes are fairly small, depending on the course. Of course Bio 101 is large, but still smaller than an average school so it's nice. One thing I don't like is that you don't get any extra credit for taking a lab course than a regular course, which I find to be unfair."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors are excellent; most are very supportive and fascinating people to get to know. The small class sizes help make your education feel individualized.

Being a double major, I appreciated that I could take both classes I need to fulfill requirements for my majors and also have time to fit in other options and explore what the college had to offer. 

Registration is okay for the most part EXCEPT your very first semester, where I had to take all awful introductory classes because nothing else was available. But after that I found I always could get into the classes I wanted. 

The workload depends on your major. As a primarily humanities and social sciences student, I found my workload to be fair, but I feel that science and history students would beg to differ. 

You definitely have the option to create your own major or independent study, which is cool.

The most popular majors are probably economics and psychology, although it really runs the gamut. Our history department is also pretty much the best so everyone will take a history class at some point."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors at Hamilton are great, and while they may not necessarily be experts in their field, they are some of the most passionate and interesting people you will meet. The small class sizes are excellent and you really feel like your opinions and education matters. Mostly everyone will have dinner at a professor's house at some point, which speaks to how friendly and supportive the professors here are. 

The variety of classes is great, especially because most people here have many interests. It is rare to see someone who is not a double major or a double minor. I also found that outside of your first semester, it's pretty easy to get into the classes you want to take, and the lack of gen-ed requirements means you can really customize your education.

That being said, a word of caution: just because a class sounds interesting does not mean it will be. Although I appreciated the open curriculum, there were a few classes I took that were pretty much useless, both academically and from a practical standpoint. These classes are usually taught by faculty unknowns. So my advice is to take classes based on professors and to only take a class that seems interesting but is taught by an unfamiliar professor if it is related to what you want to do career-wise."
Recent Alumnus,4,"While I personally felt safe while I was at Hamilton, I also was not into the party scene so I was never really in situations where I might be sexually assaulted. That being said, I do know it is a problem and wish that students did not have to leave campus because their rapists would not get expelled. The student body itself is very much about consent, but it seems like things are murky behind the scenes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It really depends on where you live. The light side dorms are newer and cleaner, and there are some REALLY nice options (save Bundy) downhill. 

However, I lived on the dark side all four years, and as much as I love the dark side for its community and proximity to McEwen/Opus/KJ...those dorms were in desperate need of renovations. And some of them have been renovated while I was there and after I left. But I was content for the most part, although the bathrooms in all dorms could just get plain nasty at times.

It also sucks that as a sophomore, the only way you can escape Bundy is the sub-free lottery. There should be more options for students who are not about crazy partying."
College Freshman,4,"Hamilton College is a great school. The academics here are really amazing and the people are wonderful. The only thing that I wasn't a huge fan of was the social scene. It took me a while to get used to all the partying and the fact that everyone is unsure of their plans, but eventually I got used to it. The party scene isn't crazy crazy, but it's also definitely not dead. The best part about this school is I think the people, though."
College Freshman,4,"They try their best to admit a variety of people. No matter what, people are super accepting of anyone."
College Freshman,4,"I don't have many complaints, except for the fact that it can be a little repetitive in commons.  Usually the food is high quality and there are enough options to choose from no matter what."
College Freshman,4,"They just took down off campus housing, which some people may not like.  However, this can be a great benefit to the school, as it fosters a sense of community on the campus with everyone living together. There are plenty of options with housing."
College Freshman,4,"You can't expect a huge rave or anything like that; Hamilton isn't like that. It's not a huge Public University, it's a prestigious private university. With that being said, the party scene is surprisingly good. There's always something going on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, and everyone is open. Popular big full annex parties are probably the closest you'll get to big, really live parties. Parties in the suites of Milbank and Babbit are good, but can definitely get extremely packed and hard to get in or get out. All in all parties at all locations can be pretty good."
College Freshman,4,"There is a surprising number of options for food on campus considering how small Hamilton is. The two main dining halls, Commons and McEwen are average and can have a select both really good and really bad options sometimes. The Little Pub for lunch is a great occasional alternative. What really comes in clutch is the ridiculously good Howard Diner. Many students would agree that surviving without the diner is unimaginable."
College Sophomore,4,"Diner for breakfast, pub for lunch, and mcewen/commons for dinner is a pretty good variety I've found"
College Freshman,4,Hamilton has a very attractive campus. Everyone looks pretty put together. Campus has a hook-up culture but relationships definitely do exist.
College Freshman,4,"There is usually always something to do from Thursday - Saturday although sometimes it is small. There are a few all-campus parties spread throughout the semesters. The parties are not huge, but very easy to find and frequent."
College Freshman,4,Sexual assault is taken very seriously on campus. Students are encouraged to report sexual assault and there are easily accessible support services for victims of sexual assault. There is little to worry about in terms of safety and campus crime. Hamilton is very safe.
College Freshman,4,The financial aid office has helped me a lot. I received the recommended federal amount although I could always use more financial aid. The people at the financial aid office were very helpful throughout the whole process and were very kind. The process was very clearly laid out and it was easy to work with.
College Freshman,4,"There's a small town right off the hill which is nice to shop and eat in. About 20 minutes away is New Hartford, there's a lot of department stores and restaurants there, which is convenient."
College Freshman,4,"It's a prevalent topic of discussion, people are aware of the problems and want to prevent them."
College Freshman,4,"Most students are safe, the parties are fun usually and easily accessible."
College Freshman,4,"Hamilton has an open curriculum, so there are no required classes, which is great for most people, like me, but can be hard for others who need more structure in their lives."
College Freshman,4,"Pretty good but recently getting much stricter about a lot of things, mainly alcohol use and noise violations."
College Freshman,4,A few options in Clinton and a lot in New Hartford. Jitney comes by every hour to get students there.
College Junior,4,The econ department has a program in NYC every fall and it's a great program for students to gain internship and research experience with the guidance of a faculty.
College Junior,4,There's a great variety of dorms. It's not hard to choose the one that fits you if you are an upperclassman.
College Junior,4,Most of the policies are trying to keep the students safe during the weekend nights. However students can always refer to the student assembly if they don't want to accept the rules.
College Junior,4,Hamilton is need-blind. The amount of loan they assigned to you is very fair too. I am very satisfied with my experience of communicating with the financial office.
College Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, and academic buildings"
Senior,2,"As a POC and financial aid student, a bit hard to fit in and I definitely see some problems here. If you don't like tundras, this is not the place for you. Not a lot of diversity and a whole lot of privilege. Party scene here sucks. Feels like a very very tight and small bubble. A bit like high school honestly. Academics here are great though."
Junior,2,"It's great  if you're extroverted, but it's awful if you're not. I'm an introvert and have felt isolated on this campus despite joining clubs and all that kind of stuff. They say you'll find yourself here: that's not true. You should know who you are before you step on this campus or you'll be left at the side of the road."
Alum,2,I paid an obscene amount of money to re-live high school with better teachers in the middle of nowhere. Part of me wishes I had picked any trade school over Hamilton.
College Freshman,2,"Best parties are downtown and COOP. A few other places have decent stuff but don't come here thinking this is a party school. I visited a school whose party scene was ranked a B+ on this website and it was significantly better. A B/B- is fair. There are a lot of parties, they just are rarely good. Its weird, the nightlife here is just weird."
College Freshman,2,"Partying feels forced. We're so restricted, I sometimes see similarities between drunk students and animals at zoos. There are a few parties every weekend but the administration is kicking out greek life and shutting down all the fun dorms on campus. Most parties are average, 2-3 good ones a semester, no bangers. The best time you can hope to have is chill with some friends. I love chilling, I just wish there was more we could do. Rare to see people just hooking up on the dance floor. People are too embarrassed and most parties are too well lit. Many people love the party scene on campus. But if it isn't for you, you're kinda up the creek. Only one bar downtown, very sweaty and male-dominated. No atmosphere on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Fairly liberal, mostly white upper-middle class kids. Most minorities are a part of the community, some segregate themselves."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot to do around here, so yeah kids drink on the weekends. Definitely less than at party schools though. You sort of get the feeling that people drink because they feel its necessary to have a good time, not to aid in it."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of rich, white, east coasters here. And the occasional asian/black/minority"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Oh, God. What can I say about this? The career center is useless. They did jack s*** for me in helping me find a job or internship in my field. Although Hamilton has a good online internship database, there is a limited deadline to apply to funding for unpaid internships (I believe it was before April, and many people do not hear back from internships until after then). Every time I'd go to a counselor asking if they had connections in my field, they would just tell me to shadow people or look into something...which I was already doing by myself. Very few employers recruit here, and who can blame them?  Being in the middle of nowhere and with a small alumni-base, Hamilton just doesn't have the connections that less prestigious, yet bigger schools have. And when you go out into the real world...most employers are going to have no idea what Hamilton is, so don't assume that your 3.8 GPA liberal arts education actually carries any weight. Because it doesn't. Very few people I know got a job in something they actually wanted to do upon graduating, and many are still trying to figure things out. Luckily my graduate school, although significantly less prestigious than Hamilton, has EXTREMELY good connections in my field, but it's unfortunate that I kind of HAD to go to grad school to get those connections."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, this college was a terrible fit for me. Every weekend, most of the students get incredibly drunk and/or high. Hamilton claims to dedicate itself to improving the writing skills of all students, but I haven't seen this. Instead, professors punish those who do not start at an incredible level. Trying your best? Making progress with each assignment? Who cares: you're not getting above a ""C"". I honestly hate it here, and I'm planning on transferring as soon as I get the chance. The cliques are ridiculously numerous and based on money or race. It's like high school, but smaller. The only good thing I can say about it is that the school is very supportive of the LGBTQ community (though, ironically, the professor teaching that class is terrible). Think before you come here."
College Sophomore,2,"On-campus housing is really nice... would've given it 5/5 if not for the administration taking away off-campus housing. When I was applying to the school, they marketed off-campus housing like it would be available to me. This year, they decided to take it away without any kind of grandfathering. This is representative of the interaction between the student body and the administration- they do what they want, when they want with no student input."
College Sophomore,2,We live in a tundra for 9 months out of the year.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of snow here in the winter, creating a perpetual tundra"
College Sophomore,2,"Oh man, its bad. Always cold. A warm day is 40 degrees. Then after that it will follow with a drop in 30 degrees and snow the next day. If you want florida weather, this is the opposite. But buy a winter jacket and you'll be fine."
College Freshman,2,"There are zip cars but I don't use them. Otherwise, the Jitney is useful. "
College Freshman,2,"snows a lot, very cold. Often a bit dreary. But mostly because of the snow and grayness during the winter. It is beautiful during fall and spring."
College Sophomore,2,"Clinton's one of the snowiest towns in the U.S. but since everyone lives a short walk away from classes (10 min. at most -- except for a few housing options), it never affects us."
College Freshman,2,A lot of rich white kids that went to boarding school.
College Sophomore,2,"not necessary – The places for students to live off-campus (down in the village of Clinton) are very limited. However, student housing on campus is guaranteed for all four years, so why live off campus to begin with? Every dorm on campus is a great place to live, and actually about 98% of students will live on campus for all four years."
College Student,2,Not Very Strict – they obvioulsy care about drug use but they are not very strict about it.
Senior,1,Online learning has not been terrible but the administration's handling of covid has been horrible. Their concern for the health of the student body is non existent.
Senior,1,Terrible school. Shows no concern for students well being. The faculty and students are wonderful but the administration is so unbelievably awful that it ruins the entire experience. The administration employs mindless cretins who are unable to do their job properly at the most basic level. Avoid this school at all costs. - Student
Freshman,1,Boring People; Boring Place. It Feels like a high school in how small it is. I was not expecting the level of petty drama that came with Hamilton
Alum,1,"The academic experience was excellent, but if you don't fit in well with the well-off, sheltered, entitled student body ... well, then you're alone in the middle of central New York with nothing but your own misery."
College Junior,1,I haven't heard of anyone live off-campus.
College Freshman,1,It is so cold and the people are shallow and self-involved. It is a suffocating environment. 
College Freshman,1,"It's boring, monotonous, and dominated by Greek organizations who think they are cool. It bores me. "
College Sophomore,1,"The college recently unveiled sweeping housing changes which they described as non-negotiable after extremely limited input from students. These changes include a plan to completely eliminate downtown housing as well as transferring many of the most widely sought after dorms to exclusively freshmen housing. Rather than having the opportunity to live in spacious quads as upperclassmen, many will be relegated to isolated singles as well as cramped triples and quads that were originally reserved for freshmen"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Alcohol is everywhere and anywhere on campus. It does not take much for those under 21 to find where the dorm parties are. 99% of the time, upperclass purchase liquor for underclassmen. As far as drugs like Adderall, cocaine, and weed, students can easily get them as there are multiple sellers on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly white, upper middle class kids. Also a lot of kids from extremely affluent areas and private high schools."
College Freshman,1,Clinton is a very small rural town with nothing to do but it's a nice community.
College Freshman,1,"Clinton Isn't a Town – Outside of Hamilton the town is dead, it can't be even described as a town since there are only about five local shops. Really nothing fun or interesting going on outside life on the hill."
College Senior,1,"About 2% of the school is allowed to live off-campus. That's right, not only do people just choose to live on campus, but there's a CAP on how many people are allowed to live off-campus. I think it's around 40 right now, and they keep lowering it every year. Luckily, everything is on campus and I can't imagine living off, but it would be nice to know that there was the option if I had wanted to.
Often, it's mostly Greek life who has houses off campus, but very few."
College Junior,1,"Don't Expect to Live Off Campus – You actually have to get residential life approval before even looking at the few available places.  Off campus housing is also too far removed from everything, it is not easy to trudge up the hill every morning."
College Freshman,1,"Mostly White Students – The campus is mostly white though, there is just enough diversity to ensure that there is at least 1 person on campus who would have something in common with you."
College Sophomore,1,It's atrocious – I had no idea how terrible central NY weather was.  It is gray and depressing pretty much all year.  The weather is reason alone to transfer.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Very Very Poor – The Jitney, the van service that the school sponsors, is the most poorly run system ever.  If you cannot get a hold of a car, you better plan your day around the Jitney.  A trip to CVS can take two hours.  There is no other 'public' transportation available, can you say isolated? Other then that, if you can get to the Utica train station, you're pretty much golden for your traveling desires."

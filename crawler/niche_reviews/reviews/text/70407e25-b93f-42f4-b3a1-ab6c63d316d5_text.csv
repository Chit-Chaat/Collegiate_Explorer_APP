Senior,5,I like that there are several extra curricular activities available and I also like how beautiful the campus and town is.
Junior,5,I love the people and staff around campus! It feels like home and there are so many opportunities to enhance my learning
Junior,5,"Although in the spring, the sudden switch to online classes was abrupt, it was a learning experience for all. UD puts its funds into making its online courses the best it can be for students to ensure they maintain their education."
Alum,5,"Love this school! Great students, great campus, great activities, great area. So much fun while being academically rewarding."
Alum,5,I did not take online classes. I dont know if they're good or not. I would think that they are but I can't say.
Junior,5,"Learning online with the University of Delaware for prepared online courses is very helpful. Professors are very clear on what they want from you in a given course, and stay available if you need their assistance.  However, with the University being online for this semester due to corona, they will have to adjust many things which could be hard for them and students to live in an environment like that. Overall, I think that learning online at the University of Delaware is excellent because they have resources available for you to succeed."
Alum,5,"I took my last semester of courses online due to COVID and found that the professors adapted quickly to the sudden switch. It wasn’t an ideal way to finish senior year, but the faculty did a good job given the circumstances."
Alum,5,"I just graduated from UD and going there was truly the best decision I ever made. The academic programs provide ample field/real-world experience and the professors are truly top-notch. There is always something to do at UD, whether it’s on campus or on Main Street. I loved my time there so much and wouldn’t trade it for anything. The one thing it could do better with is diversity. I hope to see more students of color in the coming years and think that this is critical going forward."
Sophomore,5,"Love the campus, the education, the people, the dorms, and social life. The campus is not too big and not too small. Most of the classes are within a 10 minute walk from the dorms. South Academy is the best dorm!"
Junior,5,"I do very well in online learning settings, so I had an easy time succeeding in this format. However, I know that many others did not for reasons that I can understand. I, too, sometimes found it hard to motivate myself outside of the normal campus environment. Despite this I knew that the instructors in my department were going through the same pandemic I was and were with me every step of the way, ready to talk, listen, and be there for students when needed."
Freshman,5,"All of my professors were easy to communicate with. I think that is a huge asset to have at any university. To be able to contact your professor whenever you have a question, and they get back to you as soon as possible is a great relief."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about the University of Delaware, is that they made it very known that they are there to help you succeed and give as many opportunities as possible to make that happen. There are plenty of clubs to choose from to make incoming students feel welcome."
Sophomore,5,I took all of my classes online once the corona virus came about. I was very surprised at how well my professors handled the situation so well.
Sophomore,5,I love the University of Delaware! The campus is beautiful and I enjoy all my classes! It is a great area and going to school here has allowed me to meet some of my best friends!
Senior,5,Professors are very flexible with work for class. Transition of online classes was very smooth................
Freshman,5,"I have loved my time at the University of Delaware, my classes and my experiences. The school has amazing programs that help you become a better student."
Freshman,5,"Amazing! The school is the best!! I have only been at the school for a year and I am so grateful, the school is the best!"
Freshman,5,"The University of Delaware is a well rounded college.  The surrounding area is great for student life, there are endless resources for students, and the staff genuinely cares about the wellbeing of their students.  The food could use some work but overall, this is a great school."
Graduate Student,5,"The amazing part of the University of Delaware is the sense of community, belongingness, and true life changing opportunities is brings. Not only are you enhanced academically, but it truly offers opportunities one may not be able to find elsewhere. I have found lifechanging friendships and amazing leadership opportunities through UD, and additionally have grown as an individual. I was able to find my true career path and was supported along the way. The campus cultivates a sense of growth and development that one may not be able to find elsewhere."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the classes I am taking and meeting new people. The campus is nice and most of the professors care about their students and enjoy teaching.
Freshman,5,I have been at UD for only a year but it is one of the most fun experiences of my life. I have made lot of new friends and also reconnected with old ones as I am from Delaware. The social culture over here is great and it does make everyone seemed welcomed and all the professors are chill. It is the place to be especially if you are a business major
Sophomore,5,"UD is the best school! you wont regret committing to UD. Also consider joining Greek Life, as it is a big part of social life. There are so many different opportunities. I have realized all my professors really care about my success and don't try tp jip me, they want their students to do well."
Sophomore,5,"UD has an amazing campus. The campus itself is split in to north and south campus, each pertaining to certain majors and sub colleges within the University. The programs are well funded and very in depth. They have many resources you can utilize such as the language proficiency center. They specialize in the languages offered at UD and have trained professionals and online resources you can utilize throughout your attendance. The professors themselves go the extra mile to help with anything your struggling with weather it be academically or personal. The campus library is up to date and well ran. Many students including myself utilize it during all hours of the day because it is comfortable, clean and a zen environment for studying and getting tasks done. My favorite part about the campus itself is the student diversity and variety of multicultural places to eat. There are many restaurants that offer a different and diverse menu, there is always an option for any food preference!"
Alum,5,"I loved my four years at the University of Delaware! To me, it's the perfect size campus and student body. Large enough that there are plenty of opportunities, clubs, sports, events (be sure to make the effort to attend events and take advantage of career fairs, club and sports fairs, etc.), but small enough that you don't feel like just a number in classes."
Freshman,5,I love that the university feels like home and everyone is super nice and helpful. The university really helps with academic support by offering tutoring and library resources for your major. The university professors are also very invested in seeing everyone succeed.I would like to see less construction on campus.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Delaware is an amazing large school. Coming from a big city, I was skeptical about going to school in a ""college town"" like Newark. I have found that it is a very safe campus, that is beautiful in the springtime and that has amazing architecture. The school offers many opportunities for student involvement, whether it be in sports, theater/arts, or just fun clubs. Main street is full of employment opportunities, and the nightlife/party scene is great as well. I am a member of a club sports team and I have loved being involved and being able to represent my school at competitions, especially at nationals."
Sophomore,5,Very fun school and great atmosphere. Lots a ways to get involved and make the most of your time here. Campus is beautiful and manageable.
Freshman,5,The size of the campus and ease of getting to class are things that are favorable.  The only thing I would like to see improved is the freshmen housing updated or new units.
Freshman,5,I will be attending in 2020 and am extremely excited. My family legacy is here and 10+ members of my family have attended this school.
Alum,5,"I loved my undergraduate experience here. The academics were strong in the honors college, but the intangibles made this the right choice for me. People are down to earth, the study abroad opportunities are some of the best in the country (UD was the first study abroad program in the US) and there are endless extra-curricular activities available."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at the University of Delaware has been very pleasant! It has wonderful events for students and has an amazing staff to work with! The classes, that I have been taking, are very informative about topics I'm interested in. A big plus about this college is that it's next to main Street, where a lot of students can work."
Sophomore,5,"I love university of delaware. I had a great freshman experience. I made a lot of friends, i loved my floor and I had a great RA. I the professors are great and the academics are tough but i feel like I’m learning a lot. The dining halls are really nice and accommodating to everyone. The safety on campus is good, but anyone can really walk in the dorms and on my floor. The athletics are not as hyped as i thought, no one goes to the games. The local area is amazing i love Main Street and the surrounding area is really accommodating to college students. The campus is absolutely beautiful and looks old but most buildings are renovated. My dorm was one of the renovated suite-style dorms and everything was really nice. The only thing was the windows wouldn’t open. Other than that i had no complaints for my dorm. I was also on north campus which was a walk but it’s really not that bad and when it rained i took the bus and always made it to class on time."
Freshman,5,I enjoy my time here. Educational and social life is great. My only concern is the safety. Sometimes I feel a bit unsafe.
Niche User,5,I have visited campus numerous time and also gown up in Newark attending football games and other events held at U of D. The atmosphere and area are great! The campus is beautiful and overall a safe place.
Freshman,5,"LOVE UD. Best place to have ended up for me. Supportive friends, amazing homey feel on campus, and adequate teachers."
Freshman,5,"Great experience at UD, friendly people, not too political compared to other colleges, beautiful campus"
Freshman,5,"I love UD!  My room mate and I get along fabulously- every night is like having a sleepover!  My classes are interesting, and the professors are engaging.  It is a great school.  The campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,The University of Delaware is a great school that provides students with an abundance of activities to do outside of class.  With professors who are willing to help students it makes the learning experience all that much better.
Freshman,5,Lots to do whether you like to party or want to win free stuff every week. great people I made a lot of new friends. great teachers and classes. Great food options most of my friends in other colleges hate their dining halls but ours is good...10/10! Only thing is the price I am paying the same amount as in state kids without a scholarship with my scholarship. I am going to be in crushing debt when I graduate. Also classes can be a far walk with how big the campus is. Also no diversity they should give more money to non white people so there's not a 2% African American demographic.
Freshman,5,I love being in the University of Delaware Marching Band. The political science major is also really good. Though the University of Delaware needs to make out-of-state tuition cheaper. The university also needs to allow meal swipes to be accepted at the Trabant Student Center food court.
Senior,5,"I would love to see more parking spots 
I had a great experience with the university all the professors are helpful and experts"
Alum,5,I really like how close the University of Delaware is to my home. I feel like if I ever need to go home for any reason that I am not too far away. I liked that the University of Delaware is a Division 1 School but that it is on the smaller side of a D1 school.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Delaware has been a great experience for me thus far. The academics here are just the ones that I could ever hope for. Reliable professors, timely office hours, tutors, and some of the best study sessions I have seen."
Freshman,5,"When I had decided to attend UD, I was completely convinced it wasn’t the best place for me, and that I would probably transfer after my first year, and I was 100% wrong. I’ve just completed my first semester, taking intriguing courses, making amazing friends and loving every minute of being a blue hen. I want to tell everybody I know to attend, it is the greatest place on Earth!"
Alum,5,UD is a great school and offers excellent education through outstanding professors. I loved every minute of time there.
Freshman,5,"AMAZING. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Love the resources, the campus, the social life, the academics. University of Delaware has a vibe that no other school can compare to. It is challenging yet so rewarding and the opportunities provided are amazing."
Freshman,5,The university of Delaware is an amazing school and has truly made my freshman year nothing short of amazing. I have gained many hands on experiences in my major and have received many great opportunities.
Sophomore,5,I transferred here as a sophomore and I am so happy I did. I love this school! Everyone here is so nice and the environment is one I thrive in. Everyone cares about there academics but also finds the time to have fun with friends which is super important in a well balanced college career. Lots of clubs and opportunities also!!
Senior,5,I had so many unforgettable experiences at UD. I am a go-getter and have taken every opportunity given to me and that is what you have to do no matter where you go. UD has the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. I have made forever friends and gained some great professional relationships. It felt like home to me these last 4 years. I am sad to leave.
Niche User,5,UD is amazing! I have toured many times and love it there. Filled with great people and great academics.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is incredible and the coursework is doable, but challenging. I have had great professors so far in a variety of different subjects. A lot of construction has been happening since I started my freshman year, so that is one thing I'd change."
Senior,5,"University of Delaware is a great school, with hard working and knowledgeable professors and staff, and a diverse student body.  The campus is beautiful with its brick walkways, open green, and old architecture.  The amenities include a huge sports center, cafeterias, concerts, and many restaurants."
Junior,5,"My experience at the University of Delaware has been excellent.  One of my favorite aspects is the academics.  The university offers a variety of classes and this has allowed me to not only participate in classes on the track of my major, but to explore a wide range of topics.  Also, the majority of professors I have had in the past three years have all been focused on the success of their students and offer many opportunities for assistance if needed.  Another of my favorite aspects of the University of Delaware is the student life.  From a variety of clubs to sports to job opportunities on campus, there are so many ways to express your interests and meet other students.  If I had to change one thing about the school, I would change the involvement of athletics.  The majority of students do not attend sports games.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my experience at the University of Delaware so far."
Niche User,5,My brother goes there and it is a very nice school. He likes his classes and their pool is very nice. My high school hosts Swim States there and I love it.
Freshman,5,"In all honesty, I applied to this school on a whim. That may have been the best decision of my life. The professors I've had so far do care about their students, there are so many resources, and the campus is beautiful."
Works Here,5,"Since I began working here, I have found UD to be committed to the success of their students, employees and everyone here cares. They want students to be successful and give them the time and tools they need to be."
Junior,5,"University of Delaware has always made me feel welcome. From signing up, enrollment, and being a blue hen."
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Delaware. The campus is in prime location, right on main street. Main street is full of restaurants, activities, and shopping! The school is amazing. Classes are good sizes, with professors who care about your education. Every professor has office hours, with a main purpose to help you."
Freshman,5,"Things that I liked about the University of Delaware is that the people there are really nice and really helpful. And, they have good facilities when it comes to their campus."
Alum,5,"UD has a great mix of everything of college student could ask for. The student population is a perfect size- not too big, not too small. The professors and staff are very supportive and campus is beautiful any time of year."
Junior,4,My online learning experience has been going fine so far. Every one of my professors has made an effort in accommodating everyones needs. They are also very understanding about this transition because of covid-19. I feel as if I am still getting the materials I need to learn online.
Sophomore,4,"My professors are handling online teaching very well. Being in the Associate in Arts program, I tend to have smaller classes, ranging from 20-30 students, which gives the professor more time to give each student attention and keep their schedules open for meetings."
Sophomore,4,"It's a big, old school campus connected to Main Street. It's very pretty but there's always construction and almost everywhere near campus is paid parking. The campus itself is massive, with a large courtyard and many places for students to hang out. Campus buildings tend to be organized into sections (Student Help, Laboratories, Mathematics, etc.), so it makes it easier to find people within your field to converse with."
Sophomore,4,Professors try their best to adapt to the new online learning experience and are quick to answer emails and help you adapt.
Sophomore,4,"There is a major for everybody. The only downside is the small amount of minorities at the university, however the administration tries to work towards accepting many minorities at the university, but they could work harder. Mental health resources accessible to students and the administration is working to make it better. Definitely a university that is trying to modernize itself."
Senior,4,I personally have had a relatively good experience at the University of Delaware.I think the campus itself is beautiful and full of life. I have had pretty solid professors. Only thing the campus could do better is actively making the campus a safe space for their students of marginalized identities. Lots of cool RSOs on campus.
Junior,4,"most professors were really nice and understanding, once you talked to them they were willing to give extensions on papers or assignments. they were they if you needed help."
Junior,4,"The University of Delaware provides many diverse opportunities for students to not only expand upon themselves academically but find themselves as a person. I wish, however that it was easier to find all of these opportunities when I first started at the University. I believe there should not just be an involvement fair but more explanation on how to find more things of your own interest. Having something to do that you are passionate about besides your major or to match your major can help your focus and academics immensely."
Junior,4,UD is a school that allowed to take a wide variety of classes and explore different fields before settling down and picking a major. Professors care about your success especially since going to fully online classes. Many of them have attempted to make class engaging a memorable.
Junior,4,UD is a place that after 2 years truly feels like home. Ive met so many amazing people here with amazing stories and I actually look forward to going to class. I believe that everyone can find a place where they belong here and its a big plus that the campus is so beautiful.
Junior,4,"My overall experience with the University of Delaware has been very positive. The campus is beautiful and I've met amazing people in my classes, RSOs, and throughout campus life. I am a music education student at UD and my time in the School of Music has been nothing but positive. This department FAR exceeded all expectations I had for it and has given me more than my money's worth. 

UD's Residence Life and Housing department, however, did not. The housing process each year was tedious at its best and painful at its worse. I was ignored by my RA and area coordinator throughout freshman year when I was having problems on my floor. I was then given no notice when assigned a random roommate midway through my sophomore year and was forced to help move this individual into my room from 10:00pm-1:00am on a Friday night while processing through the shock of it all. 0/10... would NOT recommend!"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, when there isn't construction. The school has a lot to offer, so you can definitely find your place. There are options on the weekend to do if you are not the big party type. If you do want to go out to a party, they are easy to find."
Sophomore,4,"At the start of online learning, it was a bit of a mess. Once everyone got more used to the new setup, things went more smoothly. Most professors were understanding of the circumstances but some were more difficult and hard to work with."
Alum,4,"It has a beautiful campus, great professors, many opportunities to get involved. The dorms could be better, as well as diversity on campus. The mental health services are not great. But classes are engaging and campus life is great."
Alum,4,professors were very fair and knowledgable. most were willing to help and genuinely cared about our wellbeing.
Alum,4,I did not take classes online however the online platforms for most of our classes were easy to navigate.
Sophomore,4,"My first year at the University of Delaware was an eye-opening experience. I was faced with many academic challenges such as transitioning to online courses and adjusting to a new lifestyle as a commuter. Even though I was never really home, since my days were quite busy on campus, the University became a second home to me. I thoroughly enjoyed being more independent, but I was thrilled to meet, as well as collaborate with, many people from different cultures and backgrounds. UD is known for its diversity and union within the community, which are a few of several things I get to be most proud of when I have the chance to say, “I am a Delaware Blue Hen.”"
Sophomore,4,"I like to view the online experience with the University of Delaware a learning process that became a benefit to me. It put a lot more on me, as a student, to teach myself, neglect procrastination at all costs, and being sure to take care of my mental and physical health. Often times it was difficult not having the regular face-to-face interactions because the communication was not fully there on some the professors’ behalves. However, I did have an amazing handful of professors that genuinely cared and helped us as best as they could. It made me determined to continue to work hard, putting in the effort to be understanding no matter what the circumstances were at the moment. Overall, the staff and faculty members that did what they could, and I could not be more thankful for these individuals because it made the semester run a lot more smoothly. I hope everyone was able to stay healthy and safe through times where the unity at UD was the most crucial."
Sophomore,4,Online learning was definitely different from what I am used to and it was not my strong suit. The school had lots of resources and handled the situation as best as they could for students and faculty.
Junior,4,"What I like most about University of Delaware is the amount of opportunities available for the students to throw themselves into anything they desire. The faculty is down to earth, the number of student organizations is incredible, and there are many ways to get involved with other students and people on the administration."
Freshman,4,"Going online for the semester was very difficult for me. Although I know every college was going through it, it turned me off. I realized I don't enjoy the academic side of UD and only liked the student life."
Freshman,4,"The academics here are very difficult. I went from being an A student to B to C-. My parents were very disappointed in me. Although, the student life is amazing and everyone is so sweet to one another. I love UD but looking at it from my home for 3 months, it may not be for me anymore."
Sophomore,4,"I finished my freshman year back in May, and UD's response to Covid was better than most. However, some of my professors were't prepared for the switch to online learning, and those classes were hard to manage."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus. Main street is full of a variety of restaurants. Some surrounding car traffic but campus interior is large enough to ignore, avoid, and be peaceful. Classes are typically easy to get to/able to get to within at most 15 minutes. Safe (blue light system scattered throughout campus, campus police station is close). 
      Professors always willing to help when you reach out to them. 
      Dorms are okay (generally good distance from classes and dining hall). Food is okay and I always leave with a full stomach (a variety of options for taste ad dietary restrictions). 
      A variety of club to join and get involved in. Plenty of student services available for academic and professional resources. 
     Overall friendly, comfortable, casual atmosphere of people. However, much construction conducted around campus recently but does not severely impact walking routes and will eventually result in a better campus expereince."
Senior,4,It has a great balance of work and play. Everyone is really friendly................................
Freshman,4,The online experience was very accomodating and I was able to finish all my work and learn the rest of the curriculum thanks to the professors and college adjusting to the pandemic.
Freshman,4,"After COVID shut down the campus, and all classes were moved online, I was fine at first. However, it did feel like there was a lot more work to complete during this time. However, because most of my classes were lectures to begin, it made the transition relatively easy."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman in the University of Delaware. It is a beautiful college with great teachers and students. What I appreciate the most about this university is that there is a lot of help from faculty members when you are in need. They will take time out of their day to give you advice and help you take the next steps.
Freshman,4,Teachers help a lot by sending emails and notifications when something is posted such as your grades.
Alum,4,"Excellent school on the east coast. Popular destination for NJ, Long Island, and Philadelphia residents.

Beautiful campus where almost everyone dorms/rents. Highly ranked engineering, nursing, and business programs.

Great social life/schoolwork balance with tons of fun bars."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my freshman year at UD. There are a lot of events held on campus such as movie nights open to every one, comedy shows etc so there is always something to do. It’s not a very culturally diverse campus though."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at UD.  The campus is beautiful and the newer dorms were immaculate. The campus layout made it feel like a big high school. Considering UD is a mid-sized university, I liked that the campus was concentrated so you would see some familiar faces on your walks from the dorms/off-campus living to your classes, but you didn't know every single person you passed either.  I liked that there was a sorority/fraternity presence on campus but it wasn't overbearing. You weren't odd man out if you chose not to join one. The campus offered a wide variety of student clubs to join. Sports weren't a huge deal at the school.  If you are looking for a school where the students are excited about Football and go to the games, the University of Delaware isn't for you."
Sophomore,4,"The academic culture and degree programs are top notch. Academic advisors and counselors are amazing with explaining what is needed to graduate on time and is cost effective .The availability of the faculty is exceptional . The campus is large , however they provide easy to read maps and logistic information. The campus is patrolled 24 hours by campus police. The school is ranked #1 for its Physical Therapy Doctoral program. The campus cafeteria and meal plans are reasonably priced and offers a variety of food choices. The college campus lives up to is reputation of a  college town with many shops, restaurants, and entrainment is close by."
Junior,4,"University of Delaware is a large institution with the ability to give students a small, community feel. The resources offered by the university to get involved will shape a student's experience while at UD. Joining clubs, sports, councils, or other groups will give you lifelong friendships and connections. The academic programs at UD have a strong reputation and a great career outlook. I love my time at UD and would recommend this college experience."
Senior,4,Univeresity of Delaware is nice but they do not care about their students as much as they care about their money. The students don't get an education with close relationships with their professors. I wish the school would be more focused on the students and not just earning and making more money. University of Delaware finds so many ways to profit off of the students. The campus is beautiful though.
Niche User,4,"Its energy is very radiant, people are kind and nightlife is fun. There are many places to walk, eat and shop."
Niche User,4,"University of Delaware offers countless opportunities for students to learn, interact with with students, and enjoy the full experience that comes with being in college."
Freshman,4,"University of Delaware offers challenging courses, countless RSOs and events, and dining halls that (as far as I've heard from students at other universities) one of the best dining programs a university could offer. The food is diverse and there are options for several dietary restrictions. The party scene seems pretty good, in the eyes of people who actually do party, but I don't. The housing process is also fairly accomodating, and they really do try to put you with your requested roommate. You can also choose housing communities based on certain subjects studied, or you can choose puppy-friendly housing in you're going to be in a puppy raising program on campus. There is also lgbt-friendly housing, which is a huge step for a college."
Works Here,4,"The University of Delaware is a great school for prospective students to go to. There is an ample amount of nearby restaurants and other forms of entertainment surrounding the campus. In addition, one can easily take a train out of Newark or out of a nearby town for a quick ride to Philly or DC."
Junior,4,"Walking through the halls as a Blue Hen has been a dream of mine. Since I was a little girl I’ve had a desire to make a difference in our ever-changing society. One thing that never changed is whatever I do, I want to help be a hand for people to hold when going through life-changing processes. Receiving my doctorate has been a lifelong goal of mine. With this goal in mind, going to the University of Delaware to start my journey is a dream come through. Staying in state will has provided me an opportunity to feel comfortable in my undergraduate college experience. I have been actively engaged in many extra curricular activities, made great friends, and advanced my knowledge above just a basic level of thinking.  At the end of the day, I have been given the opportunity to attend the University of Delaware, and have been able to showcase the high caliber student, that will be a successful alumna of the powerful Blue Hens."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed my time at University of Delaware when I was visiting. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming, I felt as though I belonged there. The campus is gorgeous and very well kept and I felt safe while there. There was a lot of diversity in the student body which was a nice to see. Overall a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus and the atmosphere. Everyone is super nice and I just genuinely enjoy my time there, the only downside I would say is the constant construction"
Freshman,4,University of Delaware is an amazing school. I love how diverse it is and very welcoming to everyone no matter where you come from. We are all one big family!
Junior,4,I am about to start my second semester at the University of Delaware. I am a transfer student from a community college so I was expecting the adjustment to a bigger school to be difficult. It was actually easier than I expected. There are many opportunities to make friends and get involved. Most of my professors were good as well.
Junior,4,"I love how no matter who you are you are able to find a group or groups of people who you can really click with. I am only a junior and it just keeps getting better. The professors are also extremely helpful within the Communication department. They are always willing to help you academically, give advice for the future and even write recommendation letters."
Freshman,4,My favorite part of the University of Delaware is the school spirit. A lot of students attend events around campus and wear University gear.
Niche User,4,"I graduated from UD in 2019, and am going back for a second degree this year. The professors are fine. Some care more than others, but that's anywhere. The biggest selling point for me is the price. It is incredibly cheap for in-state students."
Junior,4,"Some assistant professors need to be re-evaluated. Other than that, so far my experience has been great."
Freshman,4,I just started at UD. But the campus is really nice looking. I got to meet some new friends. Got access to alot of different foods near by. Overall it's nice.
Sophomore,4,"University of Delaware is a beautiful campus with friendly folks (if you look in the right places). With hundreds of RSOs, it is a very inclusive and community-centered place to be. I love this school, although high tuition, incessant construction, and the occasional bad professor holds me back a bit from the many opportunities I'm given there."
Freshman,4,"So far at the University of Delaware I find that it is a good school. Although i have only completed one semester I can say that it has been a great learning experience. I t is a very large campus and really focuses on being students being successful both individually and together. What is hard though, like most places, the school is expensive. A lot of things are required and must be covered out of pocket, so finances can be a struggle. The school is also very large so there is no help will come to you scenario. Otherwise, it is a good school and I look forward to graduating in the near future."
Freshman,4,"The campus is gorgeous and even though it is a big school, it is so easy to meet new people and I feel very comfortable here. All of my professors are so kind and helpful, and you can tell that they truly care about their students and want to see them succeed."
Niche User,4,I liked the interest the teachers demonstrated at open house. They were very thorough in their presentations on various majors. They brought current college students in a panel forum to share their experiences with us. I enjoyed the students  descriptions of their experiences in a lot of the programs.
Freshman,4,Very nice school decent campus and overall nice area. Technically D1 but not great at any sports. Good education standards and teaching methods
Sophomore,4,"Like anywhere, the quality of your education here depends heavily on the teacher. Most of my professors were really helpful and dedicated to making sure students are grasping the material and will be prepared for future challenges in later classes and the workplace. An area that needs improvement would be the housing. My dorm had flooded, and at some points there was no water because construction was being done during the semester. The frequent temporary evacuations sometimes affected my ability to work or study."
Sophomore,4,"The University is well structured and has good degree programs. Certain staff/faculty members, however, ruin the student experience. My main problem with UD is the counselling center."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful. There are many new science dedicated buildings and the school offers many majors that are sure to cover varied student interests.
Junior,4,"Great professors and beautiful campus. Could use more in terms of diversity, but the school is taking steps toward making the campus more diverse with support for these students."
Sophomore,4,It has been pretty good attending UD so far. Here you really choose the type of experience you want to have. It is a really pretty campus and has a welcoming community.  The school does have very VERY little diversity but as a minority you just have to get involved in whatever you can to stay involved in that community.
Niche User,4,"It is indeed a great pleasure and honor to use this precious time in rating my overall experience at the university of Delaware.
Firstly, the university of Delaware has been rank as the number in the state of Delaware among other universities and has also been placed and ranked as one of the best research universities when it comes to graduate,PHD and Doctoral degrees among others. It is suitable for learning purposes because of its uniqueness, qualified and competent professors and its ideal environment.

Secondly, the university of Delaware has created an avenue for both residents and international students to come and achieve their academic potential and help build the society through innovation, creativity and invention. These excellent academic activities has greatly improved the learning process and also encouraged students from all around the globe to fully experience their academic potential at the university of  Delaware.

I rest my case.
Harris"
Senior,2,"Overall, it has been a  very mixed experience. Mostly the rigid and suddenness of the transition to moving courses online was a little rough, for me personally and thousands of other students. Felt very spur-of-the-moment in terms of planning which absolutely is not super reassuring during a global pandemic. There also has been very little actual dialogue, in my opinion, between the  university and it's students. Seems like there is a sense of vagueness in general plans for the fall which again, is not too great. Could be better, could be worse I suppose but overall is not pleasant."
Junior,2,During Covid 19 online education was poor at best.  Most of the professors just posted assignments and it was self study.  Some time available for questions with certain professors but not all
Junior,2,"You’re really just a number. The school caters to athletes-they get priority scheduling, excessive academic support, free healthcare, etc. If you’re paying tuition you should know that you’re subsiding the perks afforded to the athletes and high staff salaries. Funny thing is the teams are all just mediocre. Classes are not challenging; decent professors, but work is easy. Most students are not interested in doing anything but partying-parties start Friday night and run all day Saturday and Sunday. Very clicky environment. Each sports team has their house and if it’s a guys team parties are exclusive to the team and females.  Campus food is ok. Off campus dining is expensive. Crazy large classes. On campus housing is typical one nice dorm for freshman the rest are Meh.  The schools approach to housing after the first year is ridiculous in that the school doesn’t allow you to choose your roommate if you want to stay on campus, off campus is gross or overpriced."
Freshman,2,"As a male student, the opportunities for fun are somewhat out of reach, unless you are on a sports team or are willing to get drunk and beaten up by fraternities to be able to party. There is little involvement with extracurriculars, and out-of-state tuition is very expensive. The professors, however, are very great and eager to teach and easy to get close to. The food is also really good. But the students are not as eager to learn, as partying every night is the custom and little academic involvement is common."
Junior,2,"My overall experience at the University of Delaware was poor. Most of my professors lack the ability to teach, and the ones that I assume are great professors; accents are very strong which makes it fairly difficult do understand what is being taught. Also the tutoring availability for more advanced mathematics classes were very awful, they were completely out synch with my schedule. This made me feel like I was truly alone with no help. I had to watch many YouTube videos to be able understand apply the information I learned from the lectures. Although you should work hard for your accomplishments, I felt as though I had to work much harder than I should have. And no student should ever have to feel like that. This was my first time attending this university, and hopefully my second time would triumph my first experience."
Sophomore,2,"It is known for being a great university, but this school does not mean much to me. I am transferring. It costs way too much and I live a 15 minutes away in a different state. Out of state tuition is horrible at UD."
Junior,2,"In terms of academics, University of Delaware is a pretty good school, and one of the only colleges in Delaware with a good reputation. The campus is pretty, and they have quite a few interesting clubs for basically any interest. However, I am not entirely thrilled about this school.
The staff here can be incredibly uptight with amazing egos, and I've had quite a few who don't show up to class because they had research to work on. For the skyrocketing tuition here, I find that pretty unacceptable. IN terms of security this school is lacking as well, with UD being voted the #1 party school in America this year. Many of my friends have been sexually assaulted, and after going through something similar I was met with the UD police department, which was extremely incompetent and insensitive throughout the whole situation. Overall, I just want to get my degree and leave."
Alum,2,"I thought the academics were sub-par and not challenging . The party life was fantastic though.  Overall I felt the school did little to help me get a job, or teach the necessary skills to be successful at a job."
Freshman,2,"I'm a music major, and everything here is in a transition period. I don't really like it here but it was a last minute decision."
Sophomore,2,"I came to UD as a student athlete.  The school academically is great.  I love my classes and professors.  I play softball and had an full scholarship to pitch.  I have suffered bulling and harassment from fellow teammates and my coach.  I have talked with four staff members and no one has done anything to help me.  I have since suffered an injury and am no longer able to play softball.  

I can not afford the out of state tuition so I will have to transfer back to my home state of Virginia.

I feel that the University has let me down by not helping me with the bullying and not helping and being more understanding with my medical problems."
Freshman,2,"The University of Delaware is known as a top party school, and it is nothing but that. If you are looking for an environment that will increase your academics and form strong connections with people who aren't just looking to party all the time, this is not your place. Friendships here are formed around who you go out with. Becoming connected with students in any other way is hard as a lot of students party every weekend night, every weekend day, and also during the week as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing, office hours, dining, acceptance"
College Sophomore,2,"Small, no ac, disgusting restrooms, social-a little"
College Sophomore,2,Housing seemed to be small. Hazing was bad
College Sophomore,2,need to be in it to understand
College Freshman,2,"It's not very diverse at all, mainly white wealthy people."
College Sophomore,2,No one goes to any of the games. I am on the varsity track and field team and my school's track program has cut so much in order to reallocate funds for football. In the winter we have no where to practice
College Sophomore,2,There are definitely drugs but its easy enough to still party and stay away from them if you want.
College Sophomore,2,"If you are looking for a big time sports school Delaware is not it. Our athletics aren't the best and no one attends the games. Homecoming weekend isn't even pumped up for the football team, but instead for the dages that happen. If anything our club sports are better than varsity sports."
College Senior,2,No school spirit but great sports
College Junior,2,They don't do much until something bad becomes public.
College Freshman,2,"The Student aid is a very difficult situation for myself, and I struggle financially and I do not feel like the best work is being done to help students like myself"
College Freshman,2,"The process itself wasn't terrible, but UD doesn't give out much money in the first place."
College Freshman,2,There are good days and bad when it comes to the dining hall. I will say there is not a good enough healthy option for food. The food is really overpriced as well.
College Sophomore,2,"The housing program completely ruined my freshman year, and did not even care about my well being."
College Freshman,2,unless you are a native american basketball start with a 4.0gpa you will find it hard to get aid
College Freshman,2,The cops and public safety care more about breaking up the fun and causing harm than trying to keep us safe while letting us continue to have fun.
College Freshman,2,They don't give out a lot of money to the average student
College Freshman,2,"unless you are despondent, you get nothing"
College Freshman,2,dining hall food is horrible
College Freshman,2,"Registering for classes was a nightmare for many students, and on at least one of the days the system crashed and people were unable to register at all."
College Freshman,2,"Most upperclassmen move off campus sophomore year, but leases are due in November so students don't have a lot of time to decide whether they want to move off campus for the next year or not. Also, some of the off campus housing is really far from main campus."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much to do off campus unless you have a car. In that case Newark is close to Philly and Baltimore, and the Christiana Mall. There is also a train station near South Campus."
College Freshman,2,"The parties aren't much to get excited about. I'm not a big partier to begin with, but the few times I've gone out I've been underwhelmed. The frat parties are pretty lame, and I've heard that the sports houses are okay. The best bet is to wait until you're an upperclassmen and can either go to the bars or smaller house parties, or even go to Baltimore or Philly since both of them are less than an hour away (or D.C. if you're up for a longer drive)."
College Freshman,2,"The teams are okay, but the student body is so focused on social life, Greek life, and partying, that athletics have taken a backseat. However, the students who do go to games have a lot of school spirit, and the Little Bob (the gym) is really nice."
College Freshman,2,Nursing is an extremely competitive major to get into and then a challenging one to remain in.
College Freshman,2,"I have only been at the school for a few months but as far as I can tell, there is very little involvement in varsity sports. Nobody goes to football games, there are just parties people go to instead. Club sports and intramurals are pretty popular and a great way to make friends."
College Sophomore,2,"Very opinionated. They say they are friends with people not in their greek organization, but its just more people in another greek organization. Many sororities dirty rush."
College Sophomore,2,"I always feel that students shouldn't go to college to party, they need to focus on learning"
College Sophomore,2,They need to give more financial aid to transfer students.
College Sophomore,2,They need more jobs and internships for students
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman year I stayed in the Dickinson dorms, they were the most run down dorms on campus and the experience was unlike anything I had ever had to live in. The people I lived with were great, but the bathrooms were terrible."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of crime on campus and also a lot of police worried about parties. Instead of trying to bust every single party, they should be concerned with the crime on and around campus. This has gotten even worse lately."
College Junior,2,Greek life here makes it almost seem like high school again. It's cliquey and each chapter hates each other. If you are not in Greek life you feel left out. The people in Greek life think they're better than everyone else.
College Senior,2,"Registration processes are a hassle, most of the administrators are incompetent, and trying to meet with an academic advisor is laughable; it'd be easier for students to be matched up with a senior who can help them who know what they're doing."
College Senior,2,"There's a lot of white people, despite the claim about ""diversity."" Most of the international students are from Asian countries (mostly China and Korea.) Most of the kids here are white, cis, straight, but we have a surprising amount of left-wing people, which is nice. As a mixed person who is also trans, pansexual, and pagan, I'm pretty much a minority here."
College Sophomore,2,Needs to be improved and more funds should be given to people in need.
College Sophomore,2,Off campus housing can be really expensive and hard to find. It takes forever to sign the lease and it's really competitive for places which are close to campus. It can take up to 6 months for you to even get the place sometimes so file it quickly and know you are definitely going to live there if you sign the lease because even that is not an easy process.
College Freshman,2,It can change by 20 degrees in an hour. It's completely unpredictable and surprisingly cold in the winter.
College Sophomore,2,UD has a history of racism and unfortunately some of that past is still evident.
College Sophomore,2,"When it rains, getting to and from buildings across campus is a challenge. By the time I get to class, I am completely soaked and it takes the whole class period for my clothes to dry off. In addition, it is very easy to get splashed by puddles of water when you're walking on the sidewalk when a car drives by."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone drinks all the time
College Sophomore,2,I always hear about crimes going on in the area
College Sophomore,2,Not enough school spirit or attendance at events
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of students on campus do drugs. On holiday weekends main street becomes crowded with drunk college students, though they're usually pretty harmless."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of it is just fast food, with very few healthy options. A lot of the restaurants offer the same foods, even though they are pretty good quality."
College Sophomore,2,"Certain things are ignored on certain occasions. When it comes to St. Patrick's day weekend, there's almost no enforcement on the underage drinking and partying. However, on normal weekends it feels like a party could get broken up within ten minutes of starting."
College Student,2,Parking is a hassle but having a car is completely not necessary. If you are living off campus though it will be nice to know someone with a car so they can take you grocery shopping otherwise it can be a bit of a hassle.
College Junior,2,"It rains very frequently here, especially in the spring. It makes it difficult to do work occasionally but it could be worse. We have bad weather and good weather like everywhere else. It's not something that can be changed, so the way you work around it has to be thought about"
College Sophomore,2,Local atmosphere is pretty boring.
Sophomore,1,I took all of my classes online in spring of 2020 and I will take all of my classes online in fall 2020. The professors basically gave up on teaching us and made all the assignments too easy. There was no need to learn anymore since we weren't being taught.
Alum,1,"I did not take any online classes.

I did not take any online classes.

I did not take any online classes."
Freshman,1,Unsafe area. Professors are pretty bad. Boring campus. Doesn’t live up to the hype of how everyone says it’s such a great school.
Niche User,1,"Terrible University. 
Care more about their athletic facilities than about academic reputation. Tuition dollars are spent carelessly and dorms are of the poorest quality.
Arrogance of the typical Northeast University but without the quality."
Freshman,1,"In the first 3 months at UD I'm already turned away. Commonly known as a one of the best party schools, but only if you're in a frat. Which consists of 2 months of hazing on a 6 day a week basis and paying ~$1400 a year for parties and borderline assaulting drunk girls. If you're a guy who isn't in the frat, you can expect to be asked ""who do you know here?"" at least five times before they will leave you alone. Campus is beyond dry on a weekend, and truly the only thing to do besides party is eat on main street and go to the gym. The only school spirit you'll find here is for getting blacked Thursday through Saturday. Club sports are competitive and most freshman only make the team if they have connections. Overall, keep Delaware as the backup to your backup and don't be surprised when you get here and you're disappointed."
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no diversity on campus
College Junior,1,A sea of drunk greek life spills onto the streets pretty much every night. We are known as a party school and it shows when you walk on main street. Drunks everywhere anytime. If you like sexual harassment come to UD.
College Junior,1,They are only willing to work with you in person and can be very rude.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall food is horrible.  There is very little variety, and the food is very fatty with a high calorie content."
College Sophomore,1,Student Health and Safety is not something that the university seems to care at all about
College Sophomore,1,I hate greek life here. Its a very annoying culture.
College Sophomore,1,I was denied any type of help when forced to withdraw from classes due to a family emergency. I had to fight tooth and nail to receive the smallest portion possible of a rebate.
College Freshman,1,"Ud is the whitest place in the world and there is no diversity unless you are an athlete living on north campus. The University makes very little effort to be inclusive and as a multiracial person I feel completely underrepresented not only in the student body but also in the faculty. The only people of color are those who work at the school in service and janitor jobs and many of the white students have never even been friends with a black or latino person. I hear racist comments everyday and can walk past hundreds of people without seeing someone who looks like me. A lot of the international Asian students keep to themselves and people are rude and resentful toward them because of it. The Greek culture is prevalent and honestly most of the campus walks around like clones. You can't tell one sorority sister from the next and every frat guy dresses the same. I am not saying that every white person at the school is racist, but it often feels that way. If you value individuality and creativity this is not the place for you. If you take any sort of pride in your ethnicity and culture or are looking for an accepting community do not go to UD."
College Freshman,1,NEWARK SUCKS THE COPS ARE AFTER YOU!!
College Freshman,1,"Those who like to party think it's the best, however I don't."
College Senior,1,"Working 20 hours a week for no pay, working in an institution you want to work in but not in the right department, most of the other interns are snooty about it the bosses get annoyed when you ask questions because you don't know something.

The Curatorial Apprenticeship Program at UD, however, was wonderful and I loved the people I worked with for that and I had an opportunity for a Museum Studies independent study. Jan Broske was wonderful and I was sad to learn that they had to get rid of the program."
College Senior,1,"The Financial Aid people are a hassle to work with, rude to people who are independent students and need financial aid, a hassle to get everything through, and they purposefully leave out information so that you'll not get your aid on time. They try to force the poor kids out so that we can't get an education. They barely show us any scholarship options and although I have been attempting to get scholarships since I was admitted in 2007, I have never received any."
College Senior,1,"I'm not really into night life but if I was, all the bars close at 1am and I wouldn't really call that ""night life"""
College Sophomore,1,"As a minority on campus, I realize how little diversity there is on the University of Delaware campus. In a classroom, chances are I can count all the number or minorities on one hand (African Americans, Blacks, Hispanics, etc.) Minorities definitely stand out on the campus because there are so few of us. This needs to change."
College Sophomore,1,"Most Greeks are annoying, they are either men (Frats) who only let girls into their parties. Or girls who are not in touch with the world or plight of others. Not very much diversity either, come on UD!"
College Freshman,1,"Campus housing is all based on luck of the draw. you can either be placed in the worst living conditions or the best, and as a freshman you're paying the same regardless"
College Freshman,1,"They should have torn down the oldest dorms when they originally intended to. Unless you are placed in the new dorms, you will likely find bugs and dirt everywhere as well as tiny rooms. The lack of air conditioning is the least of your problems."
College Sophomore,1,UD does not give out a lot of money at all
College Freshman,1,I am still dealing with to the point where I can not register for my spring classes and the spring semester starts in three weeks.
College Junior,1,"The off-campus housing is highly overpriced for how run down some of the places are and how unkempt they seem. Most of the apartments are cramped, stained, and you can hear people through every wall. The landlords are always cranky about everything and like to avoid their duties when you need something fixed, even though you pay your rent monthly, they seem to think they don't have the money to fix the things needing fixing. It's closer to a lot more public transportation, but that's about it. I would never walk outside alone at night, it's far away from main campus, most of the apartments or shared houses are run down; but not having to worry about the high costs of on-campus housing, feeling like it is actually YOURS, and not having to abide by any rules but your own is nearly worth all the stress the aforementioned issues cause."
College Junior,1,"I'm not a fan of Greek life, or the idea of Greek life in general, so anything I say past this will be heavily biased, thus I shall bite my tongue and sally forth. "
College Junior,1,"The price for a parking pass in the semester is an outrageous amount of money ($300+) and doesn't make sense to charge that much when we're putting all the money we have and a lot of money we don't have straight back into that school. If you can't get one of those and want one for a parking garage, they're $600. It's completely ridiculous that they would charge that much of students who only want to be there to learn, not have anxiety attacks over how much their parking passes cost. 

The parking enforcement officers are always on their game, though. They ticket very fast and efficiently, and you never even see them until a delightful little envelope is attempting to escape from the clutches of your windshield wiper in the breeze."
College Sophomore,1,"All the girls wear leggings and are stuck up partiers who only care about their looks.  The guys are athletic or very nerdy and in the case of the athletes, they only care about the girls in the leggings."
College Sophomore,1,The dining halls are not accommodating to those with food allergies or restrictions and they do not do a good job of informing students of meals ingredients and contents.
College Freshman,1,My first semester as a biology major was hell. Chemistry is close to impossible and I could barely understand what my biology teacher was trying to say. The curves help but be prepared to stay up all night to study for tests you may still potentially fail.
College Junior,1,"Parking is ridiculous. The cost of parking permits are way too high, especially considering the location of the lots. Many of the lots are far away from the dorms. I had to purchase an expensive pass for a lot that is one mile from my dorm. It is not convenient at all. Also, you cant park anywhere without a permit, or in a lot not covered by your permit, or else you're almost guaranteed to get a ticket."
College Freshman,1,"At the meters, it's twenty-five cents for 12 minutes. The police officers will sit there and wait until the meter runs out to give you a ticket. WATCH OUT."
College Junior,1,"I really need financial aid, but it is very difficult to get any help. I've only been able to obtain loans, which are ok, but I get good grades and really financially need more help. I went to the financial aid office before to discuss possible scholarships or any other available options but the man was very rude to me and offered no assistance. Also, I can never sign up for my classes until last minute because my payments are a bit late. "
College Sophomore,1,"This school is terrible for alcohol and drugs and partying. Really stupid. There are parties all the time and you can hear the idiots screaming from your dorms until at least three in the morning. God forbid you actually need to study or sleep. Alcohol is a major problem and people literally walk around with cigarettes and hookas and talk about smoking marijuana in their rooms all the time. It really is ridiculous that they haven't been caught yet. No one really says anything to people that do it, they just tell them to be sneaky about it. My roommate went to a party the night we moved in and she brought a friend back at 3 in the morning and they started smoking marijuana IN THE ROOM!!!! Needless to say I moved to another room and applied to another university when I woke up in the morning. "
College Sophomore,1,The parking is so far away as to not be useful unless you really need your car to get to work. Plus the parking permit is over $500 so it really isn't worth unless like I said you need for work or you go home all the time. 
College Senior,1,Football is the only major sport .... Delaware winter break is so long that major winter sports are not supported by students
College Senior,1,what public transportation ... to go off campus locations is not easy
College Sophomore,1,"Overly strict, especially post-I'm Schmacked. Still, Delaware has a great party scene. On the upside, if you're sickly drunk, a cop will find you and help you (you'll still get in trouble, but just with the school)"
College Senior,1,"There is no free parking anywhere on campus. If you live in off campus housing you do not qualify for campus parking permits. Any open lots are metered and garages are $1 per half hour. Parking for students who live on campus is expensive and if you live on campus you pay the same no matter whether there is room in the close lot for you or if you have to park all the way down by the field house, which is about 2miles from everything else."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not actually live on campus. I commute everyday. However, there have already been some careless actions reported by UD students at night and on weekends in Newark, DE. The actions were definitely not acceptable.UD, unfortunately has a bad representation for partying. I do not see any of this at all, since I commute and I attend classes during the day, however."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is pretty bad. Most of the lots are a decent walk from the dorms, and parking permits are expensive. Parallel parking on Main Street is a nightmare."
College Junior,1,Parking at UD is terrible. I commute to school and buying a parking pass is very expensive and the parking garage is not in a very great location. You can also pretty much be guaranteed to get a ticket anywhere you park. It is very difficult for me to get to class or to visit friends on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Hardly anywhere convenient to park. If you find a spot you are lucky and unlucky at the same time. Meters are expensively ridiculous. Parking Police are everywhere and never sleep.
College Sophomore,1,There are people from different races on campus. But almost all are International Students and don't attend classes at the University just on the University. Majority of students are from two states only.
College Junior,1,The Newark Police seem to be more interested in writing jaywalking tickets and busting parties than fighting actual crime.
College Junior,1,Parking is terrible. There are never open spots unless you are early. All parking is either at a meter or a pay to park lot.
College Junior,1,Campus and local police are very strict during homecoming tailgates. Do not go to a tailgate and drink if you are under 21. Otherwise don't be dumb and be aware of cops trying to stop parties
College Freshman,1,"only social scene is frat parties, lots of alcohol and people get wreckless, lots of alcohol poisoning and people going to the hospital. Little else to do other then party"
College Sophomore,1,You don't need a car. Plenty of bus transportation. I walk all over campus. Parking is expensive and spaces are at a premium. You will be towed if you don't have a permit. I don't know the cost of a permit but i'm told it's over #500.00. a semester or a year.
College Junior,1,"I'm a fourth year student here.  I've enjoyed a number of classes, but haven't been able to get much out of it because of the student culture, even though the professors here are often great.  If you come to Delaware, you'll probably have a few good times, but this place has serious issues.  It can be massively isolating for many of the students here.  People are unfriendly and untrusting / cold, like there is a serious apathy / depression epidemic.  The mental health overall is just bad. Someone shot themselves in the head on the library patio last year.  The girls here are quite attractive, but that doesn't mean they're cool."
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the parking is metered parking, or, in other words, you need to have a lot of quarters on hand in order to pay to park."
College Junior,1,"I got sick from the dining hall 3 times last year alone. They undercook meat a lot. The offerings are nothing to write home about. They have a lot of ethnic food that nobody likes. Also, the people working there are pretty snippy. That having been said, the Scrounge in Perkins isn't bad. They also put a Starbucks in Smith recently."
College Junior,1,The parking is way too expensive and there is not enough on campus parking for commuters who have night classes.
College Freshman,1,"There are many dining halls to choose from. There isn't much variety and the food is just average. I found myself wasting food because it looked aesthetically pleasing, but tasted horrible. I suggest getting the smallest meal plan possible because you will not use up all of your meals. The dining plans are a rip off and I found myself paying for food that was not worth the money that I was putting forth."
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible at school. The permits are way too expensive. Everything is a meter and it's not worth it to drive anywhere. If you don't have a driveway, its not worth it to bring a car."
College Sophomore,1,Parking permits are ridiculously expensive and ever lot is still at least 10 minutes away.
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely HATED going to the dinning hall. Convenient, but not worth it"
College Freshman,1,"The food is horrible! Definitely the worst part about UD. A lot of the dining halls are different, and some are better than others. The staff is always very nice and friendly, but the food is dismal, although they do make a few decent things."
College Freshman,1,"I applied but did not recieve financial aid. However, luckily I was given a merit-based scholarship. Colleges should give more financial aid so more kids can dream of going to college."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is outrageously expensive. To park near your class, you need to get to campus early to find a metered spot which has a 2 hour parking limit. If you don't mind parking in the garage to get a spot, you will be paying $1.00/half hour."

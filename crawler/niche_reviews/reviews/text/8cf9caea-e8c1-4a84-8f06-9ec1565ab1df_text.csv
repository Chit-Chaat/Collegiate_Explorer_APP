Junior,5,I did the majority of my pre reqs online. I enjoyed it quite a bit . The professors that had online classes also had campus classes and if I had problems they would allow me to come in for a class or needed item.
Senior,5,"Convenient learning experience, most of my classes are done online.  Will make it easier to achieve goals for a  two year degree.  Financial aid is available."
Sophomore,5,Kirtland Community College provides a great learning environment with amazing staff to help you along your learning path.
Sophomore,5,Kirtland community college is the perfect up north retreat for the dedicated college student. Kirtland is settled in the beautiful rolling hills of northern michigan in the middle of the beautiful gorgeous country side. Enjoy the activities of all 4 seasons.
Sophomore,5,"Brand new health science building in Graying Michigan just off of Interstate 75 and opened this past fall of 2016. State of the art materials available for all health occupations. The building is absolutely beautiful, clean and maintained and is easily accessible."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful staff, great curriculum and the most beautiful campus around!  You don't feel left out or forgotten it's like they've got your back.  There are a lot of services and help to succeed."
Niche User,5,"Going to Kirtland for my first year of college was one of the best decisions I've ever made. It wasn't costly, but I still received a quality education. Unfortunately, I had to transfer because I took all I could take there toward my program. If you're going into nursing, this is a GREAT option. I was also a work-study for the disabilities department. The staff is very friendly and it was like we were a big family."
College Junior,5,I am able to do all of my classes online so it is very flexible.
College Sophomore,5,The courses are great. They are a little difficult but college is supposed to be. The amount of class time vs homework is decent. The courses are very informative and the instructors are wonderful.
College Junior,5,So far this school has gone above and beyond my expectations. As being a first time student to a community college  Ive gone to Ross Medical Education for my Medical Assistant Certification. Kirtland has relieved many of my first year jitters! I cant hardly put into words what this school has done for self-esteem!
College Sophomore,5,Small class size and helpful instructors
College Sophomore,5,vary inexpensive school to attend
College Junior,5,I have told many people how great the school is
College Junior,5,Seems to be quick and reliable

College Junior,5,I have enjoyed the time I.have been with the school
College Junior,5,met a lot of nice people and making it.
College Sophomore,5,I could not have gone to a better school than Kirtland. Everyone is fun and friendly.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many kinds of people together in one room and i think to myself, why couldn't our history be like this?"
College Sophomore,5,Almost all of my teachers would push assignments back another class session if i was overruled by other homework. it truely is the best school.
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid process is quite simple. All you have to do is fill out a FAFSA and then redo it when it is time.
College Sophomore,5,There are many resources on campus. We can go to the teacher's office or to the library with questions for tutors.
College Sophomore,5,It's fast and it gets the job done right. The printing is fast when you need to print multiple pages.
College Sophomore,5,It's the best school anyone could go to. Financial aid helps a lot with books.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes, the students and staff are very friendly, the teacher's are very caring and helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"There are computers available for use, or you can bring your own and get on the wifi.  I have never printed anything on campus but, I believe you can for a small fee.  I have never had a problem with the reliablity or speed of the network."
College Sophomore,5,"I haven't had a teacher yet that wouldn't take extra time to explain, review or help me with anything I needed. The teachers here will do anything short of doing it for you.  If the student puts the time in to study and really tries, you will succeed.  I find the work load for most classes to be appropriate."
College Sophomore,5,"The tuition and financial aid process is straightforward, I am not sure how it could possibly get any easier.  I think I am getting a good education at a great price.  I do everything for financial aid online.  The staff in the finance department is pretty friendly, some more than others."
College Junior,5,"Other than a few glitches in the programs, I love our online classes and how they work."
College Junior,5,It is awesome! My whole program is on line so I can work at my own pace and times during the week. Some times the workload is a little overwhelming but I can manage.
College Junior,5,I have had four courses on line and have found them all to be GREAT!! I really like to not have to leave the house and drive to class because I am out of district and my drive extremely long.
College Senior,5,"I really didn't have any problems transferring credits anywhere, and the fact that not every credit will transfer but the credits I needed transferred so that was great."
College Junior,5,"The campus is mainly outdoors I enjoy walking to each class outdoors some may not because in northern michigan the school year is cold, but I personally enjoy a brisk walk in between classes"
College Junior,5,They are very good at making absolutely sure that all online and technology is up and running and available when the student needs it
Freshman,4,"In the time that I have spent at kirtland I only had a basic understanding of what it was I am leaning, now I have a lot better knowledge and a deep appreciation of what Iâ€™m learning. The only thing I would like to see change at my kirtland campus is for more students to join."
Freshman,4,"I think Kirtland Community College offers a great opportunity to get a headstart in the game. It offers excellent classes many of which are offered at 4-year universities. However, these classes are more than half the price which makes Kirtland extremely affordable. I do not regret spending my first year of college at Kirtland and feel as if I have saved a lot of money."
Freshman,4,"When I attended Kirtland, I only had online courses. Even so, my experience was satisfactory with both the staff and other students. All of my instructors were kind, helpful, and quick to respond to any questions I may have had with my courses. Some of the other students even offered to help me with homework if I had any trouble, and I'm very thankful for that. I would definitely recommend KCC to anyone interested."
Senior,4,I have had a great experience with Kirtland. Kirtland is the school I have stayed with the longest. They have a wonderful understanding staff who is always more than willingly to help. The instructors are wonderful as well. Only thing to improve would be the materials some instructors use for online classes. They are not very user friendly such as Cengage.
Sophomore,4,"Kirtland is a great smaller community college, they have a great range of programs and opportunities. The professors put in the extra effort for students to succeed in their programs. KCC offers great classes at affordable prices."
Junior,4,"Kirtland Community College has been a great place to obtain an education. The small class sizes, location, and low tuition has been wonderful."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed Kirtland Community college overall because of the people who worked there. When I needed help with my finances, the people in the office were very helpful in that. My advisers would always do their best to get me into the classes I needed even if it looked like it was full. The environment there is very laid back and quiet. Not very much going on that would distract you. The facilities are okay, no cafeteria, just vending machines. But the teachers are almost all amazing, I only dropped out of one class there my first day because the teacher was unprofessional and very much annoyed me, other than that they were great, especially the art professor."
Junior,4,"They are very well educated, as well as provide a great education!!! They care about you and your success."
Freshman,4,I have taken courses through this online college and I have had an overall good experience. The teachers are good and the classes are not terribly difficult.
Freshman,4,They have more schools since they made more money from college students. Now I have to drive far distance to go to school.
College Senior,4,"Most of my online courses have been great overall experiences. Student interaction in the discussion forums is vast and most instructors actively participate in discussions as well, giving a more personal feel to an online course that can be missing when compared to in-person classes."
College Senior,4,Most of my instructors have been very helpful when additional help or clarification was needed. They're all clearly experts in their designated studies and have a passion for the subjects they teach.
College Senior,4,"I'm currently earning my Associate of Arts and will be transferring to a different school to earn my Bachelor's degree. While an associate's degree is a great step, it is a stepping stone to a higher degree and therefore won't have much impact by itself. Being a community college, there is no expected name recognition or advantages that a degree from this school over any other community college."
College Senior,4,Small school size and availability of online class options has made this school a great and convenient way for me to earn credits while balancing the responsibilities of work and caring for my mother and her medical needs.
College Junior,4,I love that I can work at my own pace and the teachers are always available via email.
College Junior,4,I love the small class sizes and that it's not hard to get the classes you want.
College Junior,4,Small classes with personalized teaching. Have done most of it online.

College Sophomore,4,People whom have graduated the nursing program from Kirtland have had excellent employment opportunities. I have seen many job offers while still in school
College Sophomore,4,I am entering the nursing program and haven't had much experience with this yet
College Sophomore,4,The courses aren't that flexible however there is the optiion to take most courses online. I haven't had to transfer credits.
College Sophomore,4,The career center located on campus is great. They are helpful with making the correct class choices for you. I have had nothing but good experiences with them.
College Freshman,4,It's an amazing  experience
College Sophomore,4,"I'm excited to start the nursing program,  I have heard its one of the best."
College Sophomore,4,I've had trouble in the past but so far now things are moving at a great pace for me.
College Junior,4,The course work is relevant to the career field and the instructor has great insight into the field.
College Sophomore,4,"The staff are extremely helpful and will take all the time to help you get where you need to be. 

The only issue I've seen is there aren't enough classes offered during certain semesters ."
College Senior,4,I chose this school because they offered the program I was interested in and all the classes were offered on-line which works great for me since I work full-time.
College Senior,4,"Since I'm a new student, I've not had an hassles except learning how to navigate the school's on-line canvas.  So far so good."
College Senior,4,"It is a community college with a diverse student body, ranging from still in grade school to older folks like me.  Students come from all walks of life and are well rounded."
College Senior,4,"This college has a program specific for police officers along with many others.  So far, I've found the professors to be very good and helpful.  Registration and orientation was enjoyable and interesting."
College Senior,4,I am going for a one year certificate in medical billing and coding and all the classes are on-line.  I am taking 3 classes the first semester and that so far is all I can handle because I also work full-time.  Everything is available to me as if I was taking classes at the campus as far as labs and library and even tutors.
College Senior,4,"The campus has a decent library and student center with a nice book store.  There are many campus activities going on all the time.  There are some athletic programs, but I don't participate in them.  The campus is very nice, out in the country with lots of trees and rolling hills."
College Freshman,4,I can practically walk in and just talk to them. They are always available.
College Freshman,4,There's always something to do. You are never bored.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the students know what they r doing
College Sophomore,4,Small class sizes more one on one help
College Junior,4,"Student center is usually full of students and staff interacting daily, as well as the library area. Disc golf, walking club, music and lots more activities welcome not only students but also area residents from many counties. No matter where you go on campus the resources needed are at your fingertips!"
College Junior,4,Online course I took has increased my knowledge and has helped me prepare my skills needed in today's market.
College Junior,4,"I really do like Kirtland.  I went to Henry Ford Community College and Eastern Michigan University in the past, but now that I'm older--I feel like I am retaining the info and getting much more out of the experience!"
College Junior,4,I have had a couple of times where I needed an extension for homework and I never received any flack about it.
College Junior,4,FAFSA was easily enrolled in and accepted by Kirtland.
College Junior,4,I have really enjoyed the online class experience!  I think its great that it seems all the teachers want book learning done as well as interaction with you peers on class discussions.
College Junior,4,"When I've had any problems, the computer people resolved it right away."
College Junior,4,I believe the student body is quite diverse.
College Junior,4,I've had a lot of success in my Health Information Technology courses and believe that the workload and curriculum are most than fair.
College Junior,4,I believe that Kirtland does a wonderful job employeeing empowering professors!
College Sophomore,4,The teachers keep you interested in the subject.
College Sophomore,4,Many options available for everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"Class schedules, times/dates can be limited due to the fact that this is a small, rural community college.  There are some night classes, they do have remote campus buildings scattered around a five county area to help with this."
College Sophomore,4,"If there is an athletic center, I am unaware of it.  This is not really an athletics school.  There is a student center with a cafeteria, T.V.s, tables and chairs, even a few cushioned comfy chairs.  The library is nice for a rural, community college, computers  and tutoring available there.  The campus always looks clean and well groomed"
College Sophomore,4,"All of the teacher's I've had so far have been really great.  The curriculum seems about the same as anywhere else.  Registration is done online, it's pretty basic."
College Sophomore,4,I will transfer to the SVSU BSN program after I complete my RN here.  Kirtland has a partnership with SVSU and students can take the SVSU bachelor's degree classes on the kirtland campus.  I haven't transferred yet but I am not worried about my credits transferring.
College Sophomore,4,"I am in my 30s with a family, I don't hang out with anyone from the college but, a lot of them are in their young 20s.  The younger students are always nice and friendly and we interact in the classroom but, outside of the classroom we don't have a lot in common. There are a variety of students here, everything from nerdy, geeky, artsy, outdoorsy, etc...  There doesn't seem to be a heavy concentration of one particular group.  Because this is a community college there are people here from all age groups, almost everyone is very friendly after the first day or so of class."
College Sophomore,4,"This is not an athletics school, we do have them but it's not a big deal here.  This is a rural community college built in the 60s I believe, some of the rooms have been updated and some haven't been yet.  We have a beautiful campus surrounded by woods, and tons of open spaces with picnic tables scattered about the grass.  There are hiking and nature trails,  and a shooting range.  There is student housing but, from what I understand only a couple to a few units."
College Sophomore,4,My school is unique because of how the buildings make you feel at home. The green grass in the summer nice fun to play games. In the winter time the pathways are always cleared from snow. Our campus is comfortable no matter what.
College Junior,4,The college is great with diversity
College Junior,4,I like how this program you can work at your own pace.  You have all you assignments always due on a certain day and it is easier for my schedule to be able to work on assignments.  I have been in classes where you have to have assignments all due on different days of the week and that is hard to do because I am not always available to get work done on different days.
College Junior,4,It isn't bad. It works with the FASFA but I personally don't get anything because of my parents. But my parents don't contribute any money because I haven't lived with or had a real relationship with them in almost 7 years.
College Freshman,1,Lots of homework and most of it is online. Wish the teachers were more hands on. 
College Freshman,1,Bad experience with the basketball coach. 
College Junior,1,The prices in the Student Center books and Cafteria

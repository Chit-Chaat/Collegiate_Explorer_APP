Niche User,5,"Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak I had taken online classes from IRSC however, I had never taken a lecture class halfway and then transitioned to online. IRSC did an amazing job moving all lecture courses to online and found ways in which to ensure that students ended off their courses successfully. The college also implemented Honorlock which replaced having to take proctored exams as this system made sure that students were taking exams without cheating. Overall the online experience with this college is great. It is a bit confusing to understand how it all works especially if you have never taken an online course however, it becomes super simple once you familiarize yourself with it."

Sophomore,5,My online experience at IRSC has been a pleasant one. To begin with the sign up process is quite easy and if there is any issues the staff and professors are always happy to assist. Any technical difficulties there is always tech support online and at the school that will help with any issues. Always one thing especially like If your have any issues with course work all of my professors that provided online classes were always happy to help during office hours.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Indian River State College has been journey of learning and maturation. From the minute I step into the building there was always a staff willing to help. From the application process to the tough decision of finding a career, and helping with financial aid/ scholarship their was always a staff ready to assist. For example, I chose a career path in the medical field and with the assistance of my advisor and the informational sessions the college had made the decision process easy for me and I decided to become a respiratory therapist.
Once I pick my career I found the program to a arduous and stressful. But, all the classes at IRSC  have small class size allowing for one on one help with the professors and various opportunity for hands on experience in the program. Although the program was hard,  I felt it had provided the skill and the knowledge to excel in my career field."

They all go above and beyond to make sure each student has the tools and ability to succeed. I was having an issue with financial aid where I didn't meet the standards academically to receive the help. The financial aid advisor and the academic advisor went above and beyond working non stop with one another to help me appeal the decision. Because of the team effort I was awarded the financial aid and have been on the Deans List ever since. The teachers are just as great if not better then the admin. I would recommend this school to ANYONE! I cannot express enough how much IRSC has helped me and continues to help me become the Teacher and student I want to be in life."
Graduate Student,5,They offered great programs and opportunities to communicate with other students. They had great teachers who offered plenty of information needed to living a successful life in a career job and as a student on school.
Freshman,5,"This college is a smaller college that allows more time for the professors to focus on the students. The smaller campus allows for a close knit community where you feel better knowing that someone in your class may just be someone you know. It is a very ""home-like"" college and is great for anyone who wants a smaller college to not be so overwhelmed."
Senior,5,"I had a wonderful experience. I met some of my best friends here, we are always helping each other. Everyone is there for each other and the professors are always there if you need anything.

I am grateful for the time I have spent here and I have gotten good quality education for all the effort I have put in."
Senior,5,"Indian River State College is full of opportunities. Many of the professors changed my life for the better.

Niche User,5,"During my time at  Indian RIver State College, I have flourished as a person. The system here is really organized, which helps students like me a lot. Even though there is no sports here, the diversity and beauty of the campus make up for that. The teachers here are really smart and experienced. They do what is best for their  students and are always around to help. The safety at this College is great. There is always security guards around to protect. The students at Indian River are always having a blast and have fun socializing during breaks at the college. If I wasn't looking to go to a major University, I would definitely go to Indian River State College."
Niche User,5,"Great School, they're an amazing state college and close to home! Good for dual enrollment and very helpful school all together."
Freshman,5,Was very nervous going back to school after a very very long time. The advisors are very understanding and nice.

It has an overall great population and the staff are easy to work with, and they care about your overall success. its an amazing place with a great opportunity to grow and succeed, i would recommend this to students who don't want to leave their community of vero beach, and for students who have a tough financial situation. it also is a great opportunity to teach high school students the demand and rigor of college."
Junior,5,"I have only ever stepped foot onto 2 college campuses (3 if you count the irsc's campuses to be separate and not part of a whole). I have visited not only the Pruitt Campus but the Main Campus several times for classes, functions and whatnot. I would like to say that I am a proud student of Indian River State College. Their campuses are gorgeous, professors are kind an professional, and they are always buzzing with student life and resources. The only concern I have is their online enrollment and course selection process. There used to be a system called MyIRSC which was simple, easy to use, and efficient. However recently there has been a major change to a new system called WorkDay which has thrown many curve balls at not only the students, but the faculty aswell due to it being very different. I have no doubt that it will be worked through but this change has been a small damper on the college experience."
Senior,5,I love this college. The professors take their jobs very seriously. I couldn't be more happy about being accepted into a program at this collage.
Sophomore,5,"Indian River State college is small but impactful, I love the student to teacher ratio and how well organized the school is."

Freshman,5,Its a great college to go in and they provide you with everything you need. The teachers are easy to understand but still give you great challenges to help you improve yourself.
Alum,5,"Indian River State College really allowed me to flourish in to who I am today. I was a little hesitant about going back to school especially since I knew no one in the area, but the warm welcome into clubs, help with my coursework, and support emotionally through my entire associates degree was better than I would have expected. I had trouble understanding concepts with a couple of courses and I wish some of the courses were more blended with different learning styles, but besides that IRSC was a great college."
Alum,5,"The courses that I took were interesting, well-prepared and the instructors were fantastic. It is a great school for the price."
Sophomore,5,"Not only the top college in the nation (statistically proven), but the best college overall due to its high qualified  faculty and programs offered at this institution."
Freshman,5,I love Indian River State College! The professors try their hardest to help you in any way they see how. IRSC offers different colleges over  FL that help students commute to another location if needed.
Freshman,5,"There are many degrees to choose from and advisors that help you choose classes directly related to your degree. To compliment the classes and degrees, there are clubs and organizations that introduce you to real world activity related to your guided pathway."
Niche User,5,I have not started there yet. I will be starting in the fall of 2019. I have heard great things about their computer science programs.
Sophomore,5,"I began at Indian River State as a high schooler through the dual enrollment program. This allowed me to begin my associates degree for free. There are four campuses and I have attended three of them. All campuses are diverse. Each class is filled with people of different races, ages, genders, and styles. At Indian river, the class sizes are small. This allows students to get a more hands-on experience. Professors at this college are passionate about what they teach. If you want to learn more or have any questions about class material, grades, or extra help, they provide their emails, phone numbers, and office hours. When you need to reach an advisor about a problem, student have the option to email, book phone or in-person appointments, or walk-in. Indian River is great about getting their students involved. Student mentors are always hosting special events to talk about issues, socialize, or even have fun. Overall, my experience at I.R.S.C. has been nothing but warm and inviting."
Sophomore,4,"I've had some amazing professors at IRSC, but I've also had some teachers who would rather put you down then bring you up. Other than certain teachers I've had a great experience at IRSC"
Sophomore,4,Professors have been answering and grading quickly now that we're online and doing their best to accommodate these circumstances.

Graduate Student,4,"Most of my teachers were excellent and strives for their students to achieve their goals for the class and takes initiative to communicate with the students to make sure they understand the material being taught. The school is also very easy to navigate, the guidance counselors were always helpful, and the bookstore almost always had what I needed to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,"I never took an online class, but the lectures I attended were almost always relevant to the topic being discussed. Almost all of my teachers were attentive to the students questions and interacted with the class greatly."
Alum,4,The professor vary but for STEM courses and programs itâ€™s great! Good transition to university. The advisors are sometimes difficult to work with and you have to almost figure it out on your own. But they provide sufficient info on the websites so you donâ€™t really need an advisor.
Niche User,4,My experience with Indian River State College has been amazing so far. I really enjoy the multitude of classes available as well as the ability to customize your schedule. I enjoy being able to take college classes alongside with my high school classes and since the college campus is so close to my high school campus I can walk to classes and save money on gas in the process.
Freshman,4,"When entering Indian river state college there are a lot of buildings around. When asking help for directions everybody around is friendly.  The staff are vary patient with each student and applicant that walk through the doors.  The advisers take the time to figure out your schedule and what degree path you may want to choose. If you don't have everything you need they help you find step by step the item you need to register.  The college helps you out academic by providing support in the academic support center. Every student at the academic support center has the chance to talk to a professor to help them out at what ever subject they are having trouble with. There is a good diversity in the school. When walking throughout the area i could see a lot of cultured people in the area. The professes there are good at teaching, because they pay attention towards the students lack of comprehension and break down what the lecture means so that each student does well."
Freshman,4,my experience at IRSC is going good. there have been a few mistakes that the college made but other than that it is a really good college. what i would like to see change is easier contact ways to communicate to them and faster responses.
Junior,4,Most of the professors are very interesting and inspiring. Many resources provided by the amazing staff.
Niche User,4,"It's a great college with a great staff. The counselors are always ready to help, and give very insightful answers.

The teachers i've had were always ready to help and I feel everyone connected with them on a personal level which the classroom a more fun environment.

Niche User,4,"When I was 7 years old I came to Indian River State College to take piano classes and I was always interested in their performing arts program. Every year they have amazing students performing various shows, making their shows to sell out very quickly. I am now a high school student that is in Dual Enrollment and I take college classes at this campus and it has been a great experience. The students there are very helpful as well as their faculty. The campus itself includes helpful resources to gather information and has a wonderful cafeteria that has good quality food."

Alum,4,"IRSC was a nice school, I preferred the vero beach campus, but the fort pierce campus was nice too. The faculty was nice, and overall good professors. Advising can be a little confusing as far as what classes to take. (Make sure you actually need the class, and it's going toward your degree) but overall good school."
Sophomore,4,"I am a dual enrollment student, and personally I feel that IRSC is wonderful for me to go through the program.

I have almost earned my Associates and I am happy that IRSC has given me a foundation to truly start my college career."

Freshman,4,"Indian River State College is a college full of opportunities. I love that there is a variety of options for each and every student attending college there and that they wonâ€™t be ignored when they are lost or confused during their college experience. One thing I would like to see change is that sometimes it is not easy to get in contact with someone at a local IRSC campus, so I would like that to change!"
Sophomore,4,"I liked that they offered all the classes I needed for my AA online. I would change that they offer even more classes online for the Bachelor programs. Some are available, but not the one I am taking."
Freshman,4,Indian River is one of the most hands on colleges. The professors are very thorough and help anyway they can
Freshman,4,"Everything was made very easy for me by the staff and educators, I was also pleasantly surprised by the clean and friendly campus. Resources are easy to find and buildings are close together making it easy and fast to go from class to class on a cramped schedule."

Sophomore,4,"Professors are very helpful and engaging, help is readily available. Courses are structured very well, making it easy to understand and be successful."
Sophomore,4,The Admissions office is filled with informative and helpful people! The campuses are clean and safe! Overall its a lovely and affordable school!

Freshman,4,"As a dual enrollment student, this college isn't so bad. It's like a laid back version of high school, but it counts more.  There are some wonderful teachers online and in person, but there are also some that have attitude and are strict. Choose your teachers wisely, see ratemyprofessor.com, and get your work done."
Niche User,4,I am a dual enrollment student and the colleges convenient placement next to my high school makes it easy and accessible for me to take high school and college classes at the same time to get a head start.

Junior,4,I am a dual enrollment student at Indian River State College. I have a very good experience with this school as it has allowed me to earned college credit while still in high school. I have been satisfied with the teachers and staff at this school and would recommend it to others.
Freshman,4,Knowledgeable staff that guided through the registration process. Easy online options for courses and a counselingâ€™s staff online or in person is very convenient.
Niche User,4,"It's a very great college when at the main campus. Some of the best teachers, campus food, athletics, and academics are at the main campus. One thing that does need to change is the effort put into the other campuses, specifically the Mueller campus. There's a pretty big difference in the quality of campuses when visiting from one campus to the next. It'd be great if they all were kept at the same standard."
Sophomore,4,I love the fact that Indian River State College has 4 different campuses. I have parents that live in this area so I can take classes on the campus that is closest to me. The professors are also very personable and really want you to learn the material. It's a great community college.
Sophomore,4,The school's student services work very hard to accommodate and help every student get the resources they need. All the programs are competitive and everyone takes pride in their studies.

Sophomore,4,I like how you can choose classes that go with your schedule the only thing I will change is have more classes open in the Indiantown location.
Sophomore,4,My experiences at Indian State River College have been very educational. I have learned and grown so much since I started going there. I received my Associate Degree there and I went back for my bachelorâ€™s degree. What I like about the college is that the resources that are available to the students; and the interaction with the professors. I also like the convenience of several campus locations and the affordability; and the cafeteria food is amazing.  The only thing I would change is the long hold time at the student services; I donâ€™t think they have enough people working at the front office.
Sophomore,4,"Teachers are usually always very helpful & understanding. Wide variety of classes. Different campus locations & online platform. Perfect for any student who has a busy schedule and needs options. They recently introduced a new website which can be confusing and not even work with some browsers and give you incorrect information when you are looking for courses or searching for certain information regarding customization. I am graduating with my A.A. soon In 2019 and I have been to only two different schools. IRSC was better than the other college because the advisors and teachers really do want you to succeed but they must know you want it and you have to show it, show up & do the work. It is not so hard to pass these courses, especially if you dive into your career and love your work."
Freshman,4,Indian River State college is a wonderful and willing college to help the fellow student I recommend a lot of high school students to start here.
Niche User,4,Indian River State College is very inexpensive and convenient. They have 4 campuses that make is easy to find classes. The professors are also great!
Junior,4,Indian River is a great state college. I'm glad I chose to go to a state college first because I have saved a ton of money over the past two years. The classrooms have about thirty kids in them so it's easier to talk to the professor and have them help you when you don't understand something in class.
Sophomore,4,I liked IRSC diversity. I felt warmly welcome being a student that was out of state however one or two of my professors I believe need to go back to school themselves. The campus and dorms are beautiful. The food on campus is very good. Most of my classes were thought provoking and very interesting.
Junior,4,"I Received my Associates in Anthropology through IRSC a couple years ago. I went on to complete part of my Bachelors degree as well. Of my three years that I was at this school, it was overall a very good experience. I had some great teachers, and because the classes were usually only 20 or so students the teachers were able to be very helpful and personable. Many of them were more like friends than educators. They were strict at times, but fair. I would highly recommend anyone to attend this institution, especially if you are on a budget. Furthermore, though it is an inexpensive school and not an university, it is still highly rated and respected."
Freshman,4,"IRSC has a diverse range of programs and courses available to suit our complex community. The faculty and staff are always there to guide you on whatever path you may choose to take. The quality courses, combined with their amazing employees, make earning a degree enjoyable (and inexpensive!)"
Junior,4,My overall experience with professors has been great. I have had quite a few professors who have been great mentors and make lectures interesting.
Junior,4,"IRSC is a great school, with a majority of the professors ready to help you succeed. Some professors care more about the work you submit rather than you learning and understanding the material. Overall I have had wonderful professors that have helped me succeed, and I am almost done earning my associates degree. One thing that IRSC could fix would be the busy roads and parking lots with construction, or add more parking spaces."
Junior,4,"What I have been surprised by is the amazing talent of the professors with their knowledge and what they convey.  These folks are brilliant, they care and they want to share a message.  They want their students to succeed and they want them to be paired with jobs in the community."
Freshman,4,"I attend IRSC as a dual enrollment student. Overall, the professors are extremely knowledgeable and accessible. They are always willing to help and want you to succeed. The amount of campuses is great because you are never too far from one."
Sophomore,4,There were so many campuses to take classes on so you didn't have to stay on one campus if you didn't want to. the only problem I had was with the advisors because sometimes they didn't answer emails.
Sophomore,4,"Indian River is a great college for those experiencing college for the first time, or those returning to finish an associates or bachelors. Because it is a state college you will find more professors/teachers more willing to assist you on subjects that you find difficult. It is not all sunshine and butterflies as to be expected. You will find some professors who are will teach you straight from the book and are closed minded to certain topics in a field of study, such as science, but that is to be expected. All-n-all, if you can look past the biases of the lessor instructors and stay in contact with the ones who will promote growth you will succeed at Indian River State College."
Sophomore,2,"At Indian River State College, there is no housing, there isn't any campus food besides vending machines, there aren't any parties and the local area is terrible. But, the professors are great and the classes are informative and very hands on!"
Alum,2,IRSC is in the middle of Fort Pierce and in kind of a bad neighborhood. The professors are ok some don't care others treat you like you're in the 8th grade
Graduate Student,2,"Sad, sad school not at all about education. Absolutely 100% about state funded money ONLY. Hell....... I had teachers that never even showed up to class, that's right teachers that forgot they had a class, students had to go find the teacher and remind them they had a class. Students are held to what this school calls a academic standard. However, teachers aren't held to anything, I often wondered what were the requirements for working here 'breathing?' You get what you pay for! Save yourself much heartache, drama and grief by finding another school!!"
College Senior,2,I do not know of any career center at my school and many of the counselors do not advice you on what to do after college or get you prepared for life after graduation. The counselors help you pick classes geared towards your major.
College Senior,2,"The online classes are somewhat of a nightmare, as the website we use is complicated and can be difficult to get around. The workload is manageable but if you have an online math class the site will mark you wrong for a correct answer. The method of learning the material via online courses is not very great. Most of the time you read a lot of information without being able to comprehend a word."
College Senior,2,"As mentioned before, the career options for a Psychology major are very limited. My college also doesn't offer a Bachelor's degree in Psychology which is part of the problem."
College Senior,2,The counselors on staff are always packed with students and never give valuable advice regarding your major or suggested classes. They push for you to take classes they need to fill. They did not come find me to get me to come to their school because I was already dual-enrolled.
College Senior,2,For psychology students there isn't much offered in terms of different fields of psychological studies. You're limited to just general psych. The professors for this field are very engaging and educated on the subject which is helpful. There are no job opportunities or internships available at my school for this major.
College Sophomore,2,I would like to go into Radiology and the program starts in May so I cannot go into it because technically I'm still consider a high schooler. I don't understand why such programs start in may as apposed to the fall. So now I have to wait a whole year
College Freshman,2,I would chose Indian River State College because the people is helpful.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know of any athletic centers, and the library is ok."
College Junior,2,I've been trying to get aid and financial help but no one at the Chastain Campus is very helpful.
College Senior,2,Its best to obtain a degree at a college that has value.
College Sophomore,2,Social is weak on my knowledge of learning .
College Junior,2,"teachers are diffcult to work around, and the adminsistration during many days is not flexible nor helpful to any of your predicamets."
College Sophomore,2,Everything is less than par at my school.
College Student,2,There is nothing special about this school.
College Freshman,2,"Around here, there is nothing. Most people go to IRSC to get an AA degree and then move to a better school. Its mostly to save a whole lot of money."
College Sophomore,2,I'm pretty sure the muller campus has one computer lab. The library is great though.
College Sophomore,2,I've only heard of 3 clubs or organizations to get into at the muller campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The amount you pay for your classes is worth the education you're getting, but my issue was even after my parents filed bankruptcy, I didn't qualify for Financial Aid."
College Sophomore,2,To many people that passes the buck off to someone else. No one can give you right answers and follow through with anything.  
College Senior,2,registration process is very hard its very hard to talk to someone about it aswell
College Senior,2,the schools website has been very bad with giving myself the chance to apply for scholarships through their website
College Senior,2,"My overall experience at college has been very challenging than high school, right now what am trying to do is take my education more serious and I hope that later on in the future I will be able to find jobs that have to do with my major."
College Junior,2,Since it is hard for me to learn my teachers have been somewhat accommodating
College Junior,2,IRSC has terrible service when it comes down to helping students. But it's the best school I could afford.
College Senior,2,"The courses are either extremely difficult, beyond the scope of an online class or set to educate a high school student.  The work load for online classes often exceeds that of a regular class."
College Junior,2,"The online courses vary - some of very difficult, some of very easy - but as long as you do your reading and homework, all are passable. 

My biggest problem with the online classes is that you are still required to report on campus two - three times a month for tests which is very difficult for people who work two jobs or have no vehicle.  This is why we take online classes to begin with!"
College Junior,2,"One thing I strongly dislike about IRSC is that if you are taking ONLINE classes, you are still required to report to campus for all tests, which sometimes happens two or three times a month.  Other schools which offer online classes don't require this and I find it strange that a small state college does.  it's very inconvenient because of my work schedule and the fact that I have no vehicle."
College Sophomore,2,Things I did 10 years ago when I was 17 shouldn't affect me now when it comes financial aid but it does. I got denied and appealed and denied again for both loans and financial aid. Now I'm struggling to come up with the money for my classes before school starts or I'll be dropped.
College Junior,2,seems like i can never get a direct answer from anyone when i ask questions about financial aid everybody seems too busy to help. i need help
Recent Alumnus,2,"As I mentioned earlier it is a small state college, thus there are not many classes to choose from so while the academic flexibility is not the best I am still able to choose my preferred class time and schedule my work  hours around them. I am having trouble with transferring my credits and have had to retake 2 classes which is beyond frustrating!"
College Sophomore,2,Transferring Credits â€“ transferring my credits was a total pain.  they only uploaded my classes as they became pre reqs for other classes which delayed registration and caused me to not get into a class on more than one occasion.
College Sophomore,2,Bachelor Level Non-Degree Seeking â€“ I would give it a lower grade except for the few individuals I've encountered who treated me with kindness.  Overall I'm treated as if I'm an inconvenience to whom ever I'm trying to work with.
College Sophomore,2,"Professors Lacking â€“ I've not had a good experience yet with the quality of teachers.  The quality of students is even worse, its a step above sitting in a teaching day care center. Students constantly play on cellphones, talk during lecture, take phone calls during class.  Very disappointing in the overall quality of education and look to others schools for any option to take needed classes."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors Are Not Helpful â€“ I have had many professors that seem to not care about the student's education. When you go to them for help, the only advice they give you is to study harder. Also some do tests that are related directly to class lecture notes however, the information for the the test in no where to be found in the notes."
College Senior,2,"Soon I Will Find Out â€“ I have yet graduated from IRSC, so I do not know exactly what it will be like to use one of these post-grad services."
College Junior,2,"The Students â€“ Everyone is pretty much to themselves, not much going on on the campus."
College Junior,2,Library and Computer Center â€“ The library and computer center is always loud and busy. Its always filled and can't get a computer.
Junior,1,"Can't even get to taking classes because they won't let me know my financial aid awards! Extremely terrible and far worse experience I have ever had with a school. In my senior year in high school, I had schools competing over me and giving me award letters by May... not this terrible school. You will NOT be given anything until fall registration opens... HA!"
Junior,1,"Please avoid this school at all costs!!!!! Terrible financial aid department. Aimee Bowen is rude. I have been trying to go to this school for over a year now. I am transferring from out of state and will be paying the out-of-state tuition. I have an associate's degree with a 3.4 GPA. My FAFSA expected contribution is $0. I am more than qualified for several scholarships and grants, yet they keep postponing the time I should receive my Fin aid award letter. I was expecting it in April, then they tell me middle of June, then right before fall registration starts, and now its after fall registration starts! These people DO NOT help students. I emailed all advisors and Aimee Bowen send me a snide email back demanding I only email one advisor. I am pulling my hair out with this school! I think I will take another term (after the year I already have taken off for this school) to apply to a different school. All I can say is BEWARE!!"
Niche User,1,The college is really great and really nice.  The employee Jovana Pena is one of the rudest women I've ever dealt with. She thinks she is better than everyone and talks down to people. She is poor representation of your lovely school.
College Senior,1,I hate the separation from an actual person breaking something down personally.
College Freshman,1,"I took online course back 11/2013, one of the worse experience of my life. The college was located out state and their where a lot problem with that. I didn't have a computer that was one problem that I had. Another problem that I had was keep in contact with my teacher."
College Student,1,We have no athletic centers whatsoever. There are barely any campus activities.
College Senior,1,My student body is very lively and fun! The campus is very active and there's always constant motion. They are all very friendly and forthcoming. 
College Senior,1,There is no post-graduate program at my school. 
College Junior,1,"Complete disaster. No communication. Previously I have never had a problem with the financial aid department. This year there were extra documents that needed to be turned in, in order to receive aid. I have only gone to the Mueller campus to try to take care of this. I was told you could just drop off any missing documents with the people at the front desk. There are also signs instructing you to do so. I did this about a month before school started and they were never turned in. Financial documents- just missing. I waited 2.5 hours to speak to someone in financial aid and try to give them my missing papers. When I told her what happened she said I shouldn't have dropped my papers off at the desk, opposite of what I was told before. I was also told that I did not have my tax return transcript. The financial aid lady showed me that there are instructions on how to get this transcript on the IRSC website. She also told me and apparently other students that this was the number to call to get it faxed to you. This is false. I eventually found the right number but I have basically been doing everything on my own. I understand that this is a very stressful time, but they have shown no communication skills. The staff is there to help and they are not doing a very good job of it.  "
College Senior,1,"The campus rarely gets together, besides graduation."
College Junior,1,We Have a Internet? The network access at IRSC is like there isn't any. The wireless access is avaiable but the signal is so weak that it takes 5 minutes to load the irsc website. My 3g is faster then that.
College Freshman,1,"i haven't had to transfer credits but i'm afraid to even try with the lack of help i've gotten. there seems to be a lot of classes for one subject, which is odd, but eh it lets you choose what time of day or if online so its kind of around your schedule"
College Freshman,1,"so far its been terrible. i cant seem to get any help, some faculty act like they don't know what they are doing. some of the teachers i've had act like they are bored with the class they are teaching. if i could i would change schools but right now its the only ""cheap"" school around."
College Junior,1,"Run in the Opposite Direction â€“ IRSC is was the worst experience of my life. I attended the school in hopes of raising my gpa so I could go on to finish my final year of college. What I came to encounter were sub-par professors, and issues with even such rudimentary things as the class building having electricity. The last straw with this college for me was when they sent out letters informing a large number of students that their financial aid was not going to cover their tuition after the drop/add period was over. In short they made me not only stop attending the classes for lack of payment, but still required me to pay for the classes out of my own pocket. After many unanswered calls and a formal petition to have the grades, from the semester in question, turned from F's into withdrawals my efforts were met with denial. Worst college I have ever even heard of. All they are after is money, at any cost, even at the cost of the future of your education."

College Sophomore,1,"They make it very dificult to talk to anyone and to recieve finacnical aid, I have been trying to get financial help for over 10 years and have not been able to get it. Very frustrating."

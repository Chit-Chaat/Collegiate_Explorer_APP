Freshman,5,I am taking all my classes online. The teachers and students are very friendly and always willing to help
Freshman,5,The staff and teachers have been with me willing to help every step of the way. I feel very welcome and comfortable with Post University.
Senior,5,"Post University has to be the best choice of a school for me. It's affordable, the staff and the students are very helpful. The online environment is way better than the campus environment. I'm pursuing an Associate's Degree in Criminal Justice. I wouldn't say that the courses are easy because they aren't, but help is always there and there is a ton of support given to the students."
Senior,5,"I currently take classes online and it's better for me that way. I am able to focus more. It also gives me more time to be able to study. There is always enough effective communication among the professors, advisors, students, like myself and other peers."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful Experience. I love attending classes at Post. The classes are challenging but I am able to complete when I am able .
Sophomore,5,Post University is a wonderful choice for everyone. I returned to school after almost 40 years and I feel like I am an equal.  I recommend Post to everyone
Sophomore,5,The best decision I have ever made. They work with you on every aspect of your academic career. It is really an easy transition and makes me still feel like a student despite not having the physical component of going to campus.
Sophomore,5,A truly amazing school. Each professor I've had has been understanding and patient during my learning process. Every advisor I have worked with has been extremely helpful!
Freshman,5,"I have only taken a few classes so far, but its a very good school. They offer lots of help and the teachers are very engaging."
Freshman,5,Professors and instructors are very good and I like how they have the classes set up. Its very easy to navigate the online schooling.
Sophomore,5,This university is amazing. I am going online and all the teachers take the time to talk to you and make sure you are doing ok. The councilors take the time to call and/or email you at least once a week to check on you as well.
Sophomore,5,All my classes are online. Teachers take the time to make sure that you know what you are doing. They are available for you if you need to contact them
Junior,5,"Just started online distant learning courses in May of 2020. I have met some of the nicest and helpful staff than I have at any other college. They make sure your beginning weeks are going great and if you have any needs or need help, they are right there. Even the students are kind, especially to strangers. I would never pick another online school - I'm staying at Post University."
Junior,5,"Be prepared to work hard and do a lot of homework if you are taking more than two classes online at once. It's great though, knowing your classes are over in 8 weeks."
Sophomore,5,"I love POst University because I take it online and the professors are so helpful in your learning. If you don't understand something all you have to do is ask. The Counselors are always there for you and if you can't talk to them right away they will get back to you within 24 hours at least. They answer any questions that you have about classes, where to get extra help with your assignments if you need them, and if they can't answer the questions you might have about anything, they will find someone to help you answer the question. The interaction with your classmates and your professors as if you were in a classroom. It is the best thing I have ever decided to do, and I am glad I picked Post University. The professors are great they try to give you as much information to learn in a week's time, every week. But they don't overload where you have to much work to do that you really didn't have time to learn as well. It's just like being on campus but I take all my course online."
Sophomore,5,"Yes, I took all my classes online. The teachers help you any way they can. They give you certain websites to go to, it teaches you to want you might need to know. Its been a very relaxing environment taking my courses online and really convenient not having to be in a classroom at a certain time of the day or night. I can study on the time that's best for me at home. You can still go online to you university and find out about sports and clubs and the rules and anything you want to know about your finances, all you have to do is ask or you can go look at your chart yourself and seed where you stand with financial aid or your scholarships or even your student loans and when you have any questions are problems they staff will work hard to help you get it to fix so you feel comfortable and not stressed. If you do get stressed they have an excellent student council that will try there best to help you and assist you in any problems you might be having in school or at home or work."
Sophomore,5,"My overall learning experience is amazing. At the pace I’m going I could possibly graduate a year early. The professors don’t mind helping, the encourage you to teach our to them if you don’t understand something. They do all they am to help you learn and pass the class."
Sophomore,5,I love the online environment and the OSGA Board I sit on. I’m able to work at my own pace and get immediate help when needed. The advisors are very hands on and I appreciate that because it’s shows they care.
Junior,5,I go to school at Post University using their online degree program. The academic success counselors are extremely helpful and are willing to do anything in their power to make sure the students succeed in their degree goals. All of the professors I have had are knowledgable in their course and help the students to think critically. I recommend this school to anyone looking into online colleges.
Junior,5,All of my courses are online. The professors have used many different sites to help the students navigate the coursework. They use discussion boards to help students think about what the week's coursework is teaching and have professional discussions about their thoughts and opinions on the topics. Flexibility with working online has been a great help because I work retail without a set schedule.
Freshman,5,Defiantly challenging but easy enough to do while working fulltime. Something that is worth looking into.
Freshman,5,They have been so helpful and absolutely friendly. Post university is very professional but also they make it personal.
Freshman,5,Post University for the time being...having all online classes due to the corona-virus.  All the students know what it's like to be online.  The staff has been great.  Go Post..woohoo
Sophomore,5,"It is not easy by any means, but it is college so that is to be expected. Professors really seem to care about your success and individual counselors are always available too."
Sophomore,5,"The support from teachers, counselors, and other students is amazing. The lessons all seem to be pertinent to my future career choices."
Alum,5,"Amazing experience! They provide a fully online degree program, they help you with internships or in my case student teaching. The professors were wonderful and very well versed in their fields. The academic advisors are very helpful from day one and beyond graduation. 

I would caution that you double-check everything with your financial aid. Otherwise, you will have a wonderful educational experience and gain a high-quality degree and be ready to enter your field and achieve your dreams."

Sophomore,5,"Since my first day at Post I’ve felt like I can accomplish anything. The staff is wonderful, encouraging, and knowledgeable. I also love that Post offers online degrees. Having the option to obtain a degree online has been a blessing. I have the flexibility I need to work on my degree and work 2 jobs. I couldn’t be happier with my education at Post!"
Sophomore,5,"My online experience with Post has been a learning experience for sure. In the beginning, it was hard to adjust but over time I learned more about time management, organization, and how to properly use blackboard. I appreciate the fact that professors and academic success counselors are always available to answer questions or make suggestions."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at post has been great! After making the decision to return to college after 20 years, Post has mad it a great experience for me. The professors are great when it come to communicating with their students and the academic advisors have also been great with communication during this time of dealing with and living through the pandemic. I would recommend Post University to anyone who wants to further their education."
Sophomore,5,Taking classes online at Post University has been amazing. There is time to handle work life and school life. It all comes down to how you manage your time. The professors communicate in a timely manner so if there are questions or issues concerning the work they will respond.
Senior,5,"I gave 5 stars because of my accounting teacher. She was amazing through this hard time we all are going through, she was kind, and very helpful, understanding as well.  Without her concern in making sure I would get the information and understand it so that I would pass the class! I want to tilt my hat off to her!"
Senior,5,This has been the best experience I've had with online learning! I tried online learning with another school and I didn't get the concern and understand I get with Post University.
Freshman,5,This is my first year with Post University and it has been great! The teachers are very helpful and on time with email responses.
Niche User,5,The staff is very helpful in anything you need. I’m glad I picked this online college. The courses you take are some what hard at first. Reading your entire assignment is a must to understand what’s going on. If you have trouble. The instructor always helps
Junior,5,Post University is an amazing place with amazing people. Post is a very tight knit community. Everyone at Post takes care of another.
Freshman,5,"I like how easy it was to enroll and I feel like the staff is there for me. It feels really good. When I enrolled for college I was lost and I didn't have much direction. I was going down the wrong path and but something inside of me wanted to do better. I was researching school opportunities one day I think, It might have been an ad I saw but all I know is that I'm glad I ended up filling the online form out because today I have direction, I have purpose. It's hard to say all the things that Post University has done for me yet but so far It has done more than I can ever repay. That's beside the fact if of if I even graduate or not, but I know I will honestly and I'm back on track nonetheless. It has taught me critical thinking skills and just so much. I'm eager to finish and not only that but to finish strong."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love Post University. You can feel the care and the support from your professors. They want you to succeed and they help you to accomplish your goal. I am a senior (on-line student) and my daughter is going into her junior year (on campus). I am excited that I am earning my degree, there is no other place I would rather be."
Freshman,5,I love attending Post University! All the academic advisors and course instructors  take the time to make sure everything is going ok and let us know that if we need help or have questions to contact them.
Sophomore,5,It offers online classes that i can do at home and teachers are helpful and get back to right away. When need extra help in a assignment they will help you.
Freshman,5,The friendliness and helpfulness of advisors and instructors is appreciated and helpful into my journey of Psychology.
Freshman,5,"First time applying and attenting an online school and I must say the staff at Post University is and has been so helpful, that now, unlike before I'm very eager and ready to start with no hesitation and worries."
Freshman,5,I like that post university will help you when you need their help. They have good teacher who are willing to help you learn about their course and make sure that you are learning all you can.
Senior,5,"Very good and diverse crowd. Great experience for a young college kid. Campus life was very safe and was very easy to meet new friends. The campus life felt like a small community and everyone came together to get the best experience they could possibly get. Academics were great at Post University. They made sure that if you needed help, not only would you be able to go to the library and ask the professors for help but you could also go to the learning center and get more of a hands-on experience with Tutors that worked there. Overall Post University is a great university and I am so glad that I mad the decision to go there."
Senior,5,Post University is an excellent college with professors that relate to everyday life and understand when there is an emergency or something unexpected comes up. I take online courses and there are so many resources that they have to offer for people that are out of state. The professors make it seem as though you are in the classroom with them. They have tutors that can help with anything at any time of the day. The advisers are excellent in what they do and help in any way that they are able to. I ended up with cancer in my first year attending Post and they were more then understanding when they found out. They helped my husband go through the process of pausing my schooling until I was able to return. When I did return they were more then helpful in transitioning back into school.
Freshman,5,"I’ve only been attending Post for one complete Term and I will be starting my second come January 13th. 
My experience with this University has been great. The advisors are the best with helping you keep on track, making sure your doing what your suppose to and always there routing you on. 
The professors, virtual for me, are always helpful. They have great communication skills about what’s going on and will let you know what improvements could be made and how to do so. 
My admissions counselor also has been a big help with getting me into Post and double checking all my paper work and helping me to make necessary changes. She will call me a few times a term just to check in catch up and see if there’s anything I may need help with."
Graduate Student,5,I love the love on academic experiences online. It keeps me focus and challenges me to stay focused.
Junior,5,Best choice I could of made when furthering my education. This is one of the best online Universities hands down. The staff they are amazing from the time of admission they are involved and they check through the MODS to make sure you are doing okay and also make suggestions as to how you can improve your grade
Sophomore,5,I am an online student. The workload is often tough but doable. The academic advisors have been awesome and very helpful. The professors are always willing to help. I sometimes wait for grades on assignments but overall a very good experience
Freshman,5,"This is my first time taking online classes. Post University is a good online school and they help break down the work to help you do what's due in a certain day. Yes, it's a lot of work for a first time student, but they give guidelines that can help you a long the way. I suggest this school to whomever wants to go to an online classes."
Freshman,5,Post University is a friendly university. It is a small campus and students are welcoming to new students. If you are looking for a college you can actively get involved and make connections Post is perfect for you. Teachers are very knowledgeable in their fields and go out of their ways for students. Many teachers worked previously in the subject area they are teaching. Class sizes are small.
Niche User,5,"I am still in the admissions process with Post University, but I am exceptionally impressed with their response time, professionalism and excitement to help me reach my goals."
Freshman,5,"My experience with Post University has molded me to be a greater mind built to help grow society. I say this because, the administrators at Post University has been available for me 24/7 and has been patient with me every step of the way. I would recommend attending Post  University because they have a great foundation for all students of every degree!"
Junior,5,I like everything about Post University because you get that one on one experience with teachers and they treat you like you are right at home.
Freshman,5,"I enrolled as an online student in January 2019, seeking an Associates Degree in an accelerated Business/Marketing course. Their Academic Success Counselors and Professors are genuinely interested in your success."
Senior,5,Everyone at Post is very helpful and attentive! I currently attend Online courses and the communication is excellent! Post has really made me feel like family and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to start or continue their education.
Freshman,5,Going to post online and they are very helpful  and make sure you have everything you may need to be successful
Freshman,5,I am enrolled in the online classes they have and I love it. Plus when you finish your degree you online  you get to go to CT and walk  the stage and get your diploma
Freshman,4,"Advisors are available at any time during the day to discuss academics, financial aid or even advice on future classes. I really like the degree layout for classes. I can reach out for direction virtually to my teachers and staff. I never felt the need to visit the facility."
Freshman,4,"A little pricey, I enjoy the 100% online degree programs but also like that there is a facility i can visit If i need to talk to a specific department. I also like how our advisors reach out weekly to see if we need anything."
Freshman,4,Being an online student is great.  I like online so I can make my own schedule for class time or time to study.  Whatever the case may be Post University is the best.
Senior,4,"Academics, clubs, professors, and athletics are excellent and well organized. Residence halls are beautiful for being able to live on-campus and getting the full college experience. The amount of activities that are on campus is vast because there is usually something going on. Financial aid is probably the most confusing and lacking of communication even for on campus. The attendance policy, in my opinion, is not necessary since it is college and the students are getting ready to go into the real world with full-time jobs."
Senior,4,Online classes can be taken as well as being on main campus and they are really good for each class being an 8-week program and the amount of information and the information is almost exact same as what is being taught on main campus.
Sophomore,4,Online classes work perfect for my schedule. The professors were very helpful and if u needed any assistance or struggling in a area there are tutors to help. The professors are very encouraging.
Sophomore,4,The instructors are helpful. I cannot say to much bad things about it. I take online classes so I really cannot say so much negative. There are alot of tools to help throughout the classes.
Sophomore,4,"Post is a very good online school, the instructors are willing to work with you. They even communicate and check on you. They try to find every possible option available to fit your situations. The only thing I would want to see change will be as far as the financial department having more options when a student has exhausted all federal funding and struggle due to natural disasters."
Sophomore,4,Post university has been a pretty positive experience for the most part. Some of the teachers are hit or miss. However I’d highly recommend this college to anyone wanting to get their degree
Junior,4,I liked the ability to attend classes online. Teachers were great with communication. Financial aid seems to switch advisers often which can be confusing though
Sophomore,4,"As I’m an online student, I like knowing each week what my deadlines are and pace myself throughout the week. I also like how helpful the Academic Success Advisors and Financial Aid advisors are."
Freshman,4,Most of the professors are great. Financial aide takes forever. It’s pretty self paced which I love being a single mom balancing school and 2 full time jobs.
Senior,4,"I really have enjoyed all I have learned at Post University over the past 4 years, and the friendly and close-knit atmosphere of online students and instructors.
I have had one challenge which has been financial aid covering my degree plan, and not having the best financial aid adviser to help me disperse my financial aid funds. I was also told my degree would be a specific amount as well as my time frame in school, but I started it and I must finish it no matter what."
Sophomore,4,Post University has me Excel at life skills as well skills related to the Criminal Justice Department. The teachers are committed to the students succeed and go above and beyond
Sophomore,4,"Online Student, working on a degree and running a small business. Post offers the online resources needed to achieve a bachelors degree in Human resourses."
Junior,4,"Post University’s programs are manageable for a full-time working adult. The courses are challenging, but informational. I had some technical problems, a few times, with my online account, but there is a 24 hour IT department available. Average cost of tuition and fees."
Sophomore,4,"Very divers school, great science program and good sport teams, great environment small class size. Always very active with students and its clubs and programs for everyone to be involved."
Junior,4,"Post University has been the most rewarding experience of my life.  Although I take classes online, I have complete access to the professors and there is constant communication between my peers.  The professors are completely knowledgeable in their specific areas of teaching and I always feel like I'm right there in the classroom."
Sophomore,4,The online program is a wonderful it is however quite expensive to take their online classes. Which they don’t tell you how much tuition is so you have to press for that type of information. Other than that a great school and the classes are not too challenging but challenging enough.
Senior,4,What I like about Post is that they have very nice people in there admission office. If you know when it comes to school those are some of the first people you meet. One thing they could definitely work on is there cafe food. Its not the best but it could be worked on.
Sophomore,4,The classes are well thought out for my major. The time frame for each class make it manageable for a working adult. The work load is not overwhelming but doable. It is easy to connect professors when you have a question or are in need of help. I enjoy the discussion boards and input from my classmates.
Sophomore,4,"All the personal that work there is very good and return information and calls promptly, They work to assist you anyway they can. They help you plan which classes you need for your degree and help you decide which order is better to take them in. They make suggestions on where to look for financial aid, and scholarships. The will do a video conference call for the class and assist them with anything they might be having a problem with. They call and check on you each week to see if there is anything you need assistance with. I think a great facility."
Freshman,4,Post University Is a great College especially if you want to do online classes also. I was struggling finding a good school that also offers online classes because it was just easier for me in the moment. It was honestly so easy to apply . It was also great because they also get back to the emails that you send them. Its just great  because sometimes I can't get to the phone all the time. I've took 3 modules so far online and they are honestly the best and if I every need anything professors are an email away and your advisor are too. They are so helpful.
Sophomore,4,I love the advisor very informative  instructors are knowledgeable about the subjects. I look forward to completing my education at Post.
Junior,4,"The online classes are great for someone who wants to earn there degree while working  full time, serving our country and or raising a family .  Several options for degree plans."
Alum,4,"As an online student I felt that the material helped to keep me engaged throughout my program. Not always the most interactive of professors, but most provide some valuable feedback. Success counselors are great, while the registrars office must be overworked, since every request was a problem for them."
Senior,4,"Post University has a wonderful online program! The professors are overall very engaging, and the online classroom environment is both challenging and rewarding. The only aspect of this school that I would like to see change is the graduation rate, but I truly believe that the lack of graduates pertains more to on-campus students, rather than online students. Post University is located in the heart of a major city in CT, and therefore the traffic is almost unbearable! However, I highly recommend the online program,!"
Alum,4,"I loved the 1:1 interactions I was able to have with my professor, the classes were fairly small (which is what I was looking for) but the campus life was non existent and a bit too pricey for the services."
Freshman,4,The portal is a little more difficult than any of the other apps I have used for school. Everything should be all in one marker for me to be able to log in to one place
Senior,4,Tuition say too high. Make it affordable to attend college without added stress. Students shouldn't have to spend their entire lives worrying about how they will continue to pay for school.
Senior,4,One of the best thing about Post is the communication to any of your questions that you might have. The staff are extremely professional and answer your questions to the best of your ability. The professors will actually help you out instead of a TA. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I truly do not have any other experiences with other universities.
Sophomore,4,"All faculty at Post University work with you and care about your success. Enrolling was simple and easy and alll of my questions were answered thoroughly and completely. The online program provides students with ample resources to study, receive tutoring, and accelerate earning a degree."
Senior,4,I have taken online classes at Post for four years.  The work is challenging. Online classes fit with my busy life.
Freshman,4,This is a very awesome school for beginning an education degree path via online. Very much like the curriculum.
Niche User,4,"I've enjoyed my time at Post, it's been a very enlightening experience in many ways. The courses I've taken haven't been exceedingly hard, they just require good focus, planning, and collaboration.  I've only experienced it through the online portion, but I still have a positive opinion about it.  I've gotten to better know my own strengths and weaknesses from my experience at Post, and nearly every course I've taken I have been able to glean some useful, practical information. The staff is very friendly, which was a major factor of why I applied to begin with. I've been taking courses since 2015, and so far it's been paying off well."
Junior,4,"I love the courses and curriculum. Price is however too high. I cannot comment much on the actual atmosphere of the school itself because I am taking courses online, but I am very happy that they are offering an option for distance learners who are working full-time and unable to sit in a traditional classroom setting. I just wish it was more affordable."
Junior,4,"Overall great experience. Courses are fantastic and very educational. Professors are well versed and very helpful to all online students. Advisors are overall okay, sometimes it is hard to contact them given you can only call or email them so many times but overall I’m happy with my experience."
Freshman,4,I enjoy going to Post University. I’m a online student and it very easy to navigate around. When I call or email someone always answer or respond the same day. I wish there just as most activities for online students as for on campus students.
Freshman,4,Post University offers the best opportunities for those seeking Emergency Management and Gomeland Security degrees because Post is the midpoint between New York City and Boston- two major hubs for this line of work. The teachers are all well connected and countless students have received federal jobs after graduating- despite Emergency Management being a new major at Post. I would consider that an outstanding record.
Sophomore,4,"It's has a great support system. Great instructors. I appreciate the support staff. The on line classes are challenging but the tutor center is willing to help at moments notice, and the instructors are easy to work with. Overall I'm happy and like the school. However it is a tad on the pricey side."
Freshman,4,I’m a student online and I like that they are very well organized. They have a lot major to choose from and are very welcoming to all their students. I like that online work on your time and you can pick your classes. I didn’t have that  option  at my other college.
Niche User,4,"I liked how it's a small campus. A lot of one on one help available. With small campus's you can get more hands on help from your peers and professors. Everyone greeted me  when I was there for my interview and that made me feel very welcomed. I enjoyed the tour of the campus. I loved how everything was right next to each other , that makes it easier to get to everything. The library is always opened to students 7 days a week and that's a plus! I want to play soccer in college so to know that they work around your practice times is great! Post is only 30 minutes from home which will be easy to get to. I hope I will be able to play soccer and attend Post University!"
Freshman,4,"The first year at Post and I'm loving it. The teachers are excellent, small classes so its perfect for a 1 on 1 conversation with the teacher. The facilities are excellent and the sports are great. Top class coaching and teachers with an awesome background. Simply one of the best schools."
Alum,4,Convenient. Professor's are great and are available to you all the time. The staff are very helpful. The information that they teach is very helpful especially going into any of your classes. They prepare you for all adversities within your classes.
Senior,4,I currently do online classes and I enjoy the ease of it. Post has very helpful employees and makes deciding on classes easier.
Freshman,4,They have been very patient and caring. Very active in seeking all the information I've needed to further my education.
Sophomore,4,Beening about to do my coursework around my work and family life is very beneficial. The only thing I would change is having the modules for the class be a little bit longer.
Freshman,4,"I love the availability of the staff. They are all so helpful and supportive. Keep it up the good work and we can all go far. The instructors are 100% available, 100% helpful, and 100% supportive. Not to mention how understanding and willing to listen. I also love my advisor, Julia Hoke. She is truly delightful every time I speak to her, and she gets done what needs to be done, on my behalf. Mad props!"
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Post University. Although I have encountered some difficulty over the course of time I have been there, they have helped a lot and were very understanding!"
Senior,4,I am very happy with Post university overall. I have learned a lot and my professors have always been there for me. I feel that their tuition is high and should be re-evaluated.
Freshman,4,"I am enrolled in online courses at Post University. Post has so far been a great experience in enrolling and meeting your advisors. It has offered many resources like Tutor.com and Lynda.com. Your admissions advisor and academic advisor are great with keeping in touch with you, and making sure you are focused. The only downfall are their financial aid advisors, they are short in describing your fees and tuition. You have to add it up by yourself. Overall, I would recommend Post to any student willing to advance their horizons."
Freshman,4,"My admissions counselor was amazing... As is my Academic Success Counselor.. I don't know about my financial aid adviser she doesn't seem invested in my future and is very difficult to talk too. She will email and once I reply, her response is vague and unsettling. Other wise my experience so far ha been GREAT."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the online program that this school offers. The staff is very considerate and caring. They call me and check up on me at least every month. The professors are also very helpful.
Freshman,4,My experience was and still is great here at Post. The best thing I like about Post is that I can do my homework at anytime.  What I dislike the most about Post is how the instructions on how to upload isn't to clear to me. It can be improved.
Freshman,4,Just got the account and I am finding so many more scholarship opportunities than I did when I was in high school! 
Freshman,4,"Post University is a good school. They have small classes , which gives you more 1 on 1 time with the professor. Also they have a very friendly and small campus so you would actually meet majority of the people so you wouldn't feel like your left out. Post also have fun trips and activities on campus to bring the students and workers for Post together. Dorms are nice size and new Ac/ Heating system. Sports is Division 2. Post is a good school to look in to and go to. "
College Freshman,4,"Teachers take the time to help you become more familiar with the work,and they make sure you are understanding what they are teaching."
College Freshman,4,"Post is literally like a second home for me, everyone is so nice and friendly."
College Senior,4,"When I walk onto the Post University campus, I immediately feel comfortable and at home. I have trust in my counselors and teachers that I will be in safe hands. The students are there with open arms; and that's even coming from someone with severe social anxiety! I've never been happier than at Post."
College Junior,4,Counselors and all staff was very encouraging and always respond to emails when a issue arouses.
Freshman,2,I enjoyed Post University except for the constant phone calls and the school trying to keep in touch multiple times throughout the week.
Junior,2,"They should waive some of these fees, and take a percentage off of tuition since everyone is online now, and online students DO NOT qualify foe emergency funding for school under the CARES act. It is only fair."
Niche User,2,Our son was a freshman last yr.  It was a HUGE learning experience for our family.  He is thankfully now transferring.  Basically Post is an on-line university with some real life students at a primarily athletics dominated campus.  Most professors and staff are part-time.  The biggest positive was how great the majority of his teammates were.
Freshman,2,I'm taking online classes through Post and this is my first time taking college courses. And personally it has been very tough to say the least. I can honestly say the professor's are great but for the financial aid advisors( I've had 3)  and the academic success counselors(I've had 3) definitely leave me very worried since I've only been attending class for less than 2 months!
College Sophomore,2,Its bad right now because I dont know how to go about things the best yet. Personal issues have really kept me from being able to focus on this first class.
College Junior,2,I feel that the tuition needs to be lower for undergraduates and the financial aid should let students be more aware of the financial aid situation before it all runs out.
College Freshman,2,its okay can be better
College Freshman,2,"one person tells me one thing another tells me something else
"
College Student,2,Don't know about the student government I do online courses.
College Junior,2,Requirement to take career planning classes are not flexible.  These classes don't fit with my needs and are frustrating to have to pay for when I have career experience that trumps the info that will be covered in the course.
College Junior,2,"I wasn't informed that they weren't receiving my GI bill payments until after I owed $4,000 in class fees."
College Junior,2,They do not have a wide variety of majors for the masters program.
College Junior,2,"The education I am getting is very expensive, as other colleges or universities. I hate that school is a little less than 30,000. It hurts after you graduate and realize, "" I need to pay more than 60,000.00 in school loans when I graduate."" Its really tough. Sometimes I wish I went to a state school, I feel like I still would have learn the same material."
College Senior,2,"The classes are either too easy with not enough assignments, or with a lot of assignments that the teachers do not help with if you need assistance. The big majority of my teachers do not reach back out to you when you have a question, and expect you to learn everything on your own."
College Senior,2,"I am very disappointed in the quality of my peers. I spend time doing my work dilligently and it seems most of them write responses that took them five minutes to think about. Many have poor writing skills, not even using capital letters at the beginning of sentences, some have the wrong book, and many do not follow instructions. Peer interaction is important. I feel bad for our professor."
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one athletic center and the spotrs teams are always using it to I choose not to go since its always occupied. There's a workout center, a gym, racketball court and a pool. The student center is very small as well as everything on campus. So when there are activities going on I have to make sure I come early or late. The library is ok. the libraians are very helpful and the selection of books is limited, but its all we have. There are always activities to do on campus"
College Junior,2,"My employer pays for my tuition and books up front.  However, I think it is very expensive if I had to pay for it myself."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm in the process of doing FASFA, since i was laid off from my
employer so i'm not sure how it works yet."
Niche User,1,Terrible school. In my opinion they are scam artists they will take your money and run and show just enough concern to make you think they actually care.
Niche User,1,"Although they have one great teacher and one great Dean this university lacks everything that a university should have and consist of. This school in my opinion lack the knowledge, respect and confidence, which in return can only lead to failures and disappointments.  You would have thought the relationship between the two of us was over when I left the university as they were ordered by their accreditation department as well as the US Department of Education to fully refund any and all funds. Nope you guessed it I got a phone call and text messages 6 months latter telling me that I owed them over a 1,000.00 and needed to make arrangements. Immediately I got on the phone and defused this situation."
Junior,1,"The curriculum for Legal studies was thrown at the students to learn on their own. Most professors would not leave feedback when grading the work so the student didn't know what to fix. Most professors did not answer emails regarding the coursework either. The financial advisor that I had did not do his job by alerting me that my federal aid reach it's limit therefore costing me $2,000 out of pocket. I have to pay for his mistake. I do not feel that I learned as much as I should have and now I am in a financial bind due to the advisors lack of responsibility in advising me. The $2000 is now in collections and I can't buy a house. So thanks to Post University I don't have a degree nor a home."
College Junior,1,"I haven't been contacted by financial aid services yet. I did write them an email but I did not receive a response. I am now four weeks into my program and that is how long I have been waiting for the school to process my FAFSA. I am contemplating withdrawing because I am worried I will be billed and I cannot afford to be in debt $6,000 for two online classes. I was also never told how much tuition was before I enrolled (only myself to blame for that). Usually advisors make sure to have the ""affordability"" talk to make sure the student can pay."
College Junior,1,Very Frustrating – Post is very costly when it comes to tuition. They are not on the ball when it comes to finiancial aid. I am still waiting for my financial aid to post to my account  and its July already. It should of posted in May of 2012. I have attempted to contact the office several times regarding this only to get the run around. I am very frustrated with this process.
College Student,1,"Good School – I go online and my module is almost up in 2 weeks and Im still waiting on my financial aid to be completed. So I was not able to get any books for this module and I actually needed my books but thanks to search engines I made it half way through the module. The classes I took was actually helpful but I believe I would have gain more knoweledge if I had my books. Its a good school but the financial dept needs a lot of help, they don't communicate with you. I do not recommend this school."
College Sophomore,1,"Think Twice Before Attending! I attended Post because it was close to home, not too much money and I thought I wanted to go to school here. I feel as though I've wasted my money because some of the classes and teachers are in a sense a 'joke' to me, and not taken seriously. I got no need based financial aid, but was awarded an academic, annual, scholarship. While I am not struggling with the cost here, I think this school costs way to much for what it's worth. I will be transferring at the end of the semester."
College Freshman,1,"I have done 4 classes and ordered 4 books just fine. Then, I got a new enrollment person and it went straight down hill. They are saying they never got my transcripts when I was told they got them. They are saying they have an unofficial copy that was faxed over a couple weeks ago (when the person became my enrollment) and that they can't use it for my acceptance and matriculation process. I am already in classes and I have ordered books (which means they did get my transcript because of the book vouchers). My advisor has been trying to get things settled, but it's not being settled yet. Another thing it, I am always getting someone new. The only person that has stayed the same since day 1 is my advisor. I am not sure what to think on this. It's causing nothing but stress for us all."

College Freshman,1,Financial services and problems have been a hassle because that causes stress throughout my schooling and outside life.
College Freshman,1,"My school is what I called an old beginner. Post University has been around for a long time. Students have come and students have gone but Post stays the same most of the time. I have been to overnight college fairs and programs that have better facilities, programs, and services. Post is not all that bad though. There are some good things abut Post like its shuttle services that drive you to one of the 2 weekday or 4 weekend spots. It is not dependable but there is a service that drives you. Also I think Parking is free and they allow freshman to have cars. The social life on campus is really low and countless nights one will be bored. I did enjoy the fellow males on my floor. Most of them were fine young men that acted as relatives to me. The cafe was not the best place to eat at but they did provide food at specific times. They did however serve the same meals several times in the same week. The sports teams were trying, that is all I can say. They did try to make themselves known throughout the NCAA world. Academics were hard to find. if someone wanted to take the best classes for they majors, it would be best to ask a teacher who teaches a class of your major or a fellow student. An advisor choosing ones classes is alright but is best if chosen on your own. Classes are fairly easy if one can concentrate in class.  Financial aid services is useless if there is debt on your account. All Post really cares is your money. Money, money, money, money. If you don't have money don't even bother because they will hold you education from process."

Alum,5,I loved Florida State because it allowed me to pursue numerous unique opportunities. I was able to do an internship in their Herbarium. I did an independent study under a professor in evolutionary biology. I was able to participate in their IM sports and on-campus activities.
Alum,5,I only took a few courses online but they were easy to navigate. The professors were helpful and easy to get ahold of. The course work was reasonable and laid out in an organized manner.
Junior,5,"FSU already had wide experience in online learning and I can say that FSU offers one of the most qualified online learning experiences in the US. Since I'm working on my BS in Computer Science, I can say that online learning works better and more flexible for me with FSU."

Senior,5,"Love being a Nole. This school has helped shape me into the person I am today, and I will forever be grateful for the fact."
Freshman,5,"The dorms on campus are relatively close to the other important buildings on campus. The professors are fantastic and care about the students. There are plenty of classes to choose from. There's a club or organization for everything, so it's easy to get involved as a student, even if you're not on campus. The campus itself is absolutely beautiful. I haven't felt homesick at all since my arrival."
Freshman,5,"I love their Afrotc program. I’m looking to enjoy myself in a different state, while still fulfilling my education through what I love (ROTC)."
Graduate Student,5,"It has been a little difficult as all online classes tend to be but I think this is a good step towards making college accessible to more people. Terrible circumstances, but the way professors have adapted has been impressive."
Graduate Student,5,"My time at FSU was great as an undergraduate, met with a lot of challenges and had to change my viewpoints to the new area. Overall I would love to do it again and coming back for my graduate degree is exciting."
Freshman,5,So far at Florida State university I have really enjoyed my experience here. I’ve only been here for about a semester now and all of my professors were great and very knowledgeable on their content. I have recently used tutors and other teacher assistance to help me work my way through each course. I feel very successful with all that I have completed so far.
Freshman,5,everything about FSU screams party. If you are not one to party I wouldn’t recommend going to the school considering everybody that you will meet will love going out. As long as for the classes you will do great all of my professors have been extremely helpful and understanding of many different circumstances.
Alum,5,"Throughout my four years attending this university, I completed multiple courses through the online method. I found both Blackboard and Canvas to be very easy to use once I obtained access to it. The professors I had were very communicative and stayed in the loop with the students very often. Open forums, as well as discussion boards, are often used to enhance collaborative learning and class communication. I enjoyed taking courses through this method as it allowed my schedule to be flexible and I was able to expand and dive deeper into the Florida State life."
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed attending this university. I was connected with so many and different types of mentors, opportunities, and have learned so much from them all. The faculty is great and resourceful. I am thankful to be a 'nole'!! I enjoyed living on campus in my freshman year. I felt very connected to student life and campus activities. I felt as though I had many options for where to spend my time and connect with others. I was given all the tools I needed to succeed, and so I did."
Alum,5,Florida State was a very inclusive and diverse experience for me. I had wonderful teachers that invested in my success and great support throughout the administration. My undergrad experience was challenging but I felt confident in completing my degree with all of the resources the faculty and campus had available.
Alum,5,"Unfortunately, I took all of my classes on campus and in-person. I did have a roommate that was very please with the user-friendly experience she had."
Alum,5,"FSU has something to offer for everyone with world class academic, research, sports, and even a circus. FSU has programs that range from sciences to arts and everywhere in between. I will always consider FSU home."
Alum,5,"I took a variety of classes throughout my time at FSU, some on-line, mostly in person. The professors thoroughly challenged me through academics, sometimes what felt like too much. In the end, I feel better prepared for my future."
Junior,5,"I love the beauty of FSU's campus. It is a such a pretty campus to walk around, especially in the fall. I love the family atmosphere of the football games."
Senior,5,"I love everything about Florida State. The teachers, the staff, the students all make it seem like one big family. Due to COVID-19 there has been some issues transitioning to the online but nothing the professors and administration can't handle. They have done everything in their power to make this transition run as smoothly as possible."
Senior,5,Teachers work hard in making sure everyone is feeling conformable and at ease with this new online transition. Professors have spent a lot of time making sure the information is properly being taught and their idea is being shared thoroughly enough through posted lecture videos.
Alum,5,FSU's online courses are very challenging but it allowed me to work and go to school. The professors are great and give the time and resources you need to be successful.
Alum,5,"I love Florida State so much. I had the best time of my life during undergrad and I got a great education as well. I made friends, went to as many athletic events as I could and made so many great memories."
Alum,5,Online classes are fair and very interactive. Wide selection of online classes and professors! 10/10
Alum,5,Great experience! Great resources and programs! Campus has plenty of space and areas to study!!!!!!!
Graduate Student,5,"Due to COVID-19, I have had to take multiple courses online. The way in which the professors adapted and made a learnable experience out of the situation was great."
Graduate Student,5,"Florida State University has great teachers, great athletics, and great opportunities available to help you find a job after graduation."
Senior,5,"Florida State is an amazing place to get a higher education. Staff and faculty go above and beyond in making sure students are on the right path in the most professional way. The campus is BEAUTIFUL and SAFE. Parking is the only problem you may run into, but if you show up 30-45 minutes early you should find a spot in no time!"
Senior,5,"FSU has done a great job with the transition to online classes and everyone has been very helpful/supportive. Professors are very understanding during this epidemic and work really hard to help students understand the material to the best of their abilities given the circumstance. Although I miss on-ground classes, I am very appreciative of how Florida State has handled the COVID situation."
Freshman,5,"I love this school and want to go so badly. If I were to change one thing, it would be the out of state costs as I don't know if my family could afford to send me there."
Freshman,5,Better than other schools. Teachers cared for students. Awesome school. Best southern education in the USA.
Freshman,5,"Florida State University has great diversity and acceptance within the college. I started FSU during the Summer 2020 Term, while the virus began and did not allow me to go to campus. However, FSU was not fazed by such occurrence and has made the experience worthwhile."
Freshman,5,"Professors are very helpful and are not bothered when students have questions, Resources are always available and open!"
Alum,5,I loved online learning more than learning in the classroom. Online classes were very convenient for me since I worked two jobs and worked over 40 hours a week. I also felt many classes I took in-person were spent listening to a professor either not going over content that will be needed for assignments or exams or the discussion was spent going over PowerPoints word-for-word so I felt there was no point for me to be there.
Alum,5,"I took a few classes online. All of these were easy to navigate using Canvas and the professors did an excellent job of making sure the information was presented in a way that the students could understand. I also enjoyed that we could complete the course on our own time because I worked and by having online class, I was able to do my assignments before or after work."
Alum,5,"I loved Florida State. I was extremely welcomed during the first weeks of school. I also felt it was easy to navigate the campus, interact with other students, and rely on the professors to be there when I had multiple questions. The extracurriculars offered are just a bonus really. The overall student life is great and I would recommend this university to everyone."
Junior,5,"Obviously, online classes are not the same as regular face to face classes. However, the online courses were very well-organized and the professor were very helpful."
Junior,5,"I like everything about it. The campus is so pretty. I like the city. I like the student life. This is an amazing University to attend. The instructors are friendly and informative, pushing each student to do their best work. The staff for each building and the groundskeepers collectively keep the school beautiful and maintained. The community around the school also gives a great environment to grow up in and mature."
Sophomore,5,Florida State offers a supportive environment to guide students in whatever path they wish to pursue.
Junior,5,"I loved Florida State, and am excited to complete my senior year there and take advantage of all the amazing resources that I might've missed out on Freshman-Sophomore year."
Alum,5,Florida State allowed for me to take courses that sparked my interest with professors that really helped me figure out what I see myself doing post-graduation.
Sophomore,5,I like that every online class at Florida State is also offered in person. It really allows you to keep your options open.
Sophomore,5,Florida State University has changed my life for the better. I have never had so many opportunities presented in front of me at once. You can tell all the faculty really cares about the student's success. I would recommend anyone to go.
Alum,5,I took one online class and it was great. The professor was very reasonable with grading and assisting students.
Alum,5,I love everything about FSU. This school and city became a home. There is something for everyone here.
Alum,5,Great school atmosphere and teachers. Best years of my life. I have dreams about FSU and being on campus again.
Sophomore,5,"I took one class online before everything transitioned online in the Spring; it was really nice because all the notes were constantly available, and contacting my professor was easy. The transition was a little bit more difficult as we were not entirely prepared to go online, but it went more smoothly than expected. A lot of time has been used to prepare for summer classes that were not meant to be online, and while it is not quite the same, they seem to run very well and it is nice to have reliable access to the resources that we need in class."
Sophomore,5,"FSU has so many great resources and clubs for the students and the professors really care for their students. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do. I'm not even a huge fan of sports, but the community really draws you in and creates a strong sense of pride to be a part of FSU."
Freshman,5,"Staff are quick and dedicated to making your college experience as skill-learning as possible. Teachers are dedicated to aiding you if you ask for it and there are several groups and organizations that offer tutoring and support through out your journey. The campus is stunning and well taken care of and the student organizations are eventful and offer an opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. 

There is mental, spiritual, and physical guidance if necessary. If you have any questions someone on staff has the answer and can help you with whatever you need. Academics are top notch and the food is delicious. The kitchen staff is kind and makes some of the best meals around, even if you are looking for a quick snack. 

 One interesting thing about Florida State University is that there is a circus that is student run and there is no prior experience needed! If you are interested and want to learn they will teach you what you are interested in learning."
Sophomore,5,"Florida State University is known for it's energetic atmosphere and strong school spirit for good reason. The environment is very welcoming and creates a high sentimental value for all of it's students. My education to this day at FSU has been challenging, however the school's available resources and extensive support have facilitated my experience tremendously."
Sophomore,5,"Because of COVID19, all of our classes were moved to online for the last half of the Spring 2020 semester. The professors were very understanding of our circumstances and began grading much more leniently. Lectures continued on Zoom video chats and some professors had us participate through iclicker questions, which I personally liked to keep me engaged."
Sophomore,5,"I had an amazing freshman year at FSU! I experienced the dorm life and would choose to do it again if I were to go back in time. I also had a meal plan and was overall pretty happy with the variety and quality of food at the dining halls and on-campus restaurants. The landscaping is always well-taken care of and makes walking between classes and relaxing on landis green very enjoyable. There are so many free events that take place at FSU such as belly dancing lessons, paint-a-pot on special occasions, food trucks, concerts, and socials! There's always plenty of options to find something fun after classes."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any online classes with Florida State yet, but I have read that the professors are able to adapt classrooms to online environments pretty well and I don't think there are any issues with Florida State's online classes."
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman at Florida State University and the campus life seems amazing. The tour was great as the staff was very helpful and the campus is beautiful. Very excited to start at Florida State.
Junior,5,FSU is a great fit for people who want a large school environment with student services that make you feel indivdually supported despite the size.
Alum,5,Excellent university with incredible faculty and staff who care about their field and the students. I am proud to have represented my college in student government and am excited to return for my J.D.
Alum,5,FSU was the best university. It has a culture that embraces students and strives to help them succeed in whatever they are passionate about. Courses are challenging but thought provoking. School spirit is inspiring. The best school ever!
Alum,5,Online platform (Blackboard) was easy to use and professors were good at explaining assignments and expectations.
Senior,5,The professors are very accommodating considering the situation. The transition to online zoom meetings was very smooth and the professiors seemed to have adapted well to it. They aren’t just lecturing as they used to in the classroom. It seems that they are putting more of an effort into their teaching methods.
Freshman,5,"Florida State offered me a huge variety of academic opportunities, both in a classroom setting and in clubs and and organizations.  FSU also made me feel like I was a part of a community, one that was working together to advance our futures and create once-in-a-lifetime memories.  I gained a huge amount of experience at FSU, both academically and socially."
Freshman,5,"I took all of my classes online during the last month of the spring semester.  I was very impressed with the professors following the shift to online classes because they all were willing to adapt to the new circumstances and were dedicated to making sure the students still received a quality education.  I took a lot of online classes during high school, but the ones I took at FSU were by far the most impressive of them all.  I personally prefer to attend classes in-person, but given the circumstances, FSU did a good job transitioning to online."
Senior,4,"While annoying at times due to technological difficulties, almost every professor is truly trying their best to accommodate students to this new online environment. It sucks that it has to be online, but nonetheless, it has not been a negative experience."
Freshman,4,"I've taken all classes online for my first semester due to COVID, and, admittedly, I do have some mixed feelings on the subject. While I do not enjoy online classes at all, the professors have done a fantastic job. I have no complaints about them, since it's not their fault we're in a pandemic. They've done the best with what they have, and the professors I've had are top-notch."
Senior,4,"Florida State is a beautiful university filled with great people. I can only speak on behalf of the business courses but I felt as though that they were challenging and prepared me even further for my future career. Diversity is a bit lacking but in recent years I've noticed a boost in diversification and inclusion of poc at FSU. The football team for the past four years has been on a rapid decline but our basketball team excells.  The local area of Tallahassee is somewhat disappointing. For a capital, Tallahassee is pretty barren however it is filled with a tons of governmental opportunities for students."
Senior,4,I would highly recommend taking classes in person rather than online. There was often a time where the online professors would give you a textbook and gave no further aid in the course.
Junior,4,"I enjoyed my online experience for the most part. The only way to really reach the teach is through email as opposed to in person, which isn't that difficult, just something to get used to. As long as they answer their email in a timely manner then the online class isn't too bad."
Alum,4,"Florida State recruited me for their First Year Abroad program. The administration was wonderful and worked with me to make sure I was able to graduate, even with personal issues making things more difficult."
Alum,4,I only took a couple of courses on-line but the professors were engaging and worked with the students to ensure the best possible outcome.
Junior,4,had a good experience with the faculty and staff. This goes for the students as well. Everyone is there and ready to help with all you need
Sophomore,4,"Florida State is an amazing school with a culture that is easy to fall in love with and dates back generations and generations. The academics are quickly on the rise, breaking the top twenty national public schools for the first time at the offset of my sophomore year, and much of the staff is devoted to student success. However, the financial aid can be confusing to navigate, and the financial aid office at FSU can have a lack of clarity that will be frustrating. Moreover, many of the leadership and traditions at FSU, while being rooted in traditions that go back to the early twentieth century, may need positive change, and many facets of FSUs community are resistant to that. Tallahassee, outside of Florida States campus, also is not really the best city to live in. It has rampant unsolved homelessness and gentrification issues. Over all, though, great school."
Sophomore,4,"Besides going online because of the COVID 19 pandemic, I did not take online classes. Rona was handled mildly well, though."
Junior,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and there is rarely a bad day to go and spend time there. For the most part, the professors are caring and try to create a healthy learning environment for their students. The best part about the university is definitely all of the resources they provide for you: the career center, the Rez, the professional closet, and the list goes on. The staff truly wants you to be successful in your life and if you utilize all the resources it is very hard not to."
Freshman,4,The university uses Canvas and I find it pretty easy to navigate. My professors have a planned schedule for the class and assignments and have available resources for contacting them
Freshman,4,My professors and advisor are very approachable and give opportunities to contact them if needed. My advisor and one of my professor seem like they actually care about the student’s education and learning.
Alum,4,"I love FSU and have since I was a child. There are so many opportunities for students, faculty, and staff. I didn't realize how many resources were available to students until I started working for the university. I'm not sure if this was because I was too involved in working or if it was because these resources weren't presented to me (or a mix of both). This university is #18 in the nation for a reason and is also considered a ""Diversity Champion"" for a reason. You will meet people of all kind from all over!"
Alum,4,I had a great experience at Florida State University. I double majored in international affairs and psychology.
Junior,4,I'm currently taking classes online because of the ongoing pandemic and Professors have been incredibly understanding and helpful in adjusting and providing us with a similar learning experience.
Alum,4,"Online classes were pretty average, but I always felt I could communicate weel with my professors and classmates while doing courses online."
Alum,4,"Florida State University (FSU) was my school for undergraduate studies, and I will also attending graduate school here in the fall of 2020. The best things about FSU were it's international program opportunities and the research opportunities.

I was able to go on a exchange program to South Korea for one year, which was provided by FSU. The credits that I took were able to be applied to FSU directly and thus, it was a relatively easy process. Plus, the one year of experience that I got through this program was life changing. Though I did not go on an international abroad program, I have heard great things about this also. I was also able to work in a biology lab as a student researcher, which also led me multiple opportunities to work with other professors. 

One I would like to see changed is the professor to student interactions. Though I had many great experiences, there were many science professors who were not as readily available. This could be done by decreasing class size."
Alum,4,"I did not take that many classes online. There were one or two classes that I took. They were well organized, and straight forward. However, I prefer in person classes and thus, I have an underlying bias towards online classes."
Sophomore,4,I love Florida State! It is a beautiful campus with so many extracurricular opportunities for students. The campus is always so lively and full of fun activities for the students.
Freshman,4,"Online learning with Florida State University was at first, seemingly difficult, especially if you are not adjusted to how online classes work. The Professors will answer as swiftly as possible in regards to anything you may need help with. 

Quick Hack: Some of your textbook material can be found online! If you need something specific don't be afraid to look up a pdf version. As for extra help, there is always YouTube and your classmates! Making a group chat and communicating regarding assignments and any confusions may be very helpful!

All responsibility with due dates and assignments fall solely on the student. It is important to remember assignments must be turned in on time and to study the material on your own as well! Exams are a huge portion of grades, so it is best to know the material thoroughly and study a couple hours a week.

Online classes are slightly more flexible, but it is important to watch your lectures and attend Zoom calls as it may help ease confusion."
Sophomore,4,My online experience at FSU is unlike many would expect. FSU's staff members and professors have done everything in their power to ensure each and every one of their students is learning the material. They have supplemented their lack of in-person dialogue with extra documents and resources to help students truly understand the learning objectives.
Junior,4,I've taken several online classes at FSU and they've all gone well. I wouldn't recommend taking a particularly difficult class online though.
Junior,4,Online classes are really easy and simplistic. Some of the professors give an alarming amount of coursework for this reason though
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, but there is a lot of construction going on constantly. A lot of professors are researchers, and not professors so you have to learn to teach yourself."
Sophomore,4,"Transitioning to college was initially hard but making friends with new people especially when I got involved with Delta Nu Zeta made it better. Although life in the first year was interrupted by Covid19, I’m excited about starting  my sophomore year."
Sophomore,4,"Put in a position to use online experience was not what I expected but after being forced to use it during the lockdown, I’ve grown accustomed to it.  But I’m definitely better in a classroom setting."
Junior,4,Florida State has really good programs and academics. They also have some really interesting professors that always want you to learn. My professors have always been extremely qualified. The party scene at Fsu is also quite good.
Junior,4,Online learning has been a breeze at FSU. I have yet to use zoom and all my professors have recorded lectures and powerpoints on canvas to view at my pleasing. My professors all respond very quickly if I have a question and they hold Zoom office hours weekly.
Alum,4,Canvas is great and easy to use. Switching to online classes after corona was stressful but FSU made the transition smooth. It was not hard to transition to all online classes.
Alum,4,A lot of student clubs so it is easy to get involved and make new friends. All the professors I had were engaging and helpful.
Junior,4,Florida state does a good job giving the student an opportunity for distance learning. They have multiple campuses and opportunities across the globe.  They also have a lot of classes offered online. Florida state needs to improve on their professor to student connections. Most students just go to class then leave. They never have a social conversation with their professor unless they are in need of something.
Alum,4,"Overall I had a positive experience during my time at FSU receiving my bachelors degree in biology. Going to college away from home I was worried about acclimating but I found a home at FSU and in Tallahassee. Their is space for everyone to find their family at FSU and the small city has a lot more to do if you know where to look. My only disappointment was in some of the science professors on campus. Unfortunately, even after  speaking to the head of the science department they did not seem interested in hearing about certain students struggling with certain professors; in my opinion a class average below a 30% is not acceptable."
Senior,4,"If you want to feel like you're going to Hogwarts, FSU is the place to go. Not all of campus looks like that but a huge chunk does.  Research is very important to the university yet I wish they put more resources into some of the departments they like to ""brag"" about (Physics is what comes to mind). Overall it's a good college and they are constantly trying to improve."
Alum,4,"Florida State University provided me with the perfect college experience. They offered so many programs to prepare me for the working world, and now, I am continuing my education by attending law school."
Niche User,4,The campus is very clean and everyone there was extremely friendly and helpful. It was easy to navigate around and was not difficult to get where I needed to be. Great Food!
Niche User,4,"What I liked about FSU is that they have a family feel and the number of majors that are accessible to me. The college is in my home state, that was also a plus. the school is active in the community."
Graduate Student,4,"I have a love/hate relationship with Florida State. The program that I belong to is quite prestigious, and I am grateful to many of the professors in the department. However, many of the buildings are getting very old and the A/C is insufficient for the Florida heat. Traffic and parking are quite terrible."
Freshman,4,"Florida State has many opportunities for its students. From clubs to greek life, there is always a chance to get involved. I am a part of Kappa Delta sorority in which I am surrounded by a group of supportive sisters who strive to make a difference in the community. One thing I would like to see improve on campus is the availability for classes and safety on campus. There are several threats to our safety that typically take place at night. By providing transportation for students at night to take them home, whether off campus or not, this will ensure the safety of students at all times."
Niche User,4,I would like for a better housing contracting system. The lottery system makes it almost impossible to guarantee that you will get the room you need.
Sophomore,4,"I really like how all of the classes I have taken, and am currently taking, challenge me and allow me to improve myself. I also like how helpful their case management services are, while on the other hand I don't really like some of the counselors at the counseling center."
Freshman,4,Love it here at FSU. Great campus and plenty to do and thousands of clubs to get involved in! Bunch of opportunities here on campus. I have gotten involved in  many Intramural sports teams and have been involved in FSView a newspaper on campus.
Niche User,4,I toured Florida state and my opinion changed on it very much. People usually think its a major party scene but there is a wide variety of students there. Some students are interested in other things there and FSU allows students to express themselves in anyway. By allowing students to express themselves they it allows a diverse campus and campus life.
Senior,4,"FSU was the best university for me, both distance and career wise. My teachers were generally, if not all, outstanding and the campus is beautiful. Its location lends itself to a cooler climate as compared to the rest of Florida and that's a big win for me."
Freshman,4,"I am a big fan of FSU. The student body is fantastic, it is an honor to call yourself a nole and you will always be one. The academics are great and they have fantastic academic pathways you can go on."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Florida State University has a lot to offer. As a student,  there are plenty of opportunities offered that appeal to everybody. Whether you plan on joining the Greek community or forming a club of your own, you will meet people with like-minded people. I am proud to be a Florid State seminole."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, so welcoming and kind to all students, they give us so much stuff for free and take care of us"
Freshman,4,The education is fantastic.  I came from a public high school in South Florida where I didn't really learn much.  At Florida State I have been given the first real opportunity to learn from experts about the subjects that interest me.  The social aspect of the school is centered around Greek life which can either make or break your experience depending on whether those organizations interest you.
Freshman,4,I am a first year college student in 2019. FSU is a great campus. It is beautiful and clean and walking is never bad. Students have ample resources to be successful and grow. I live off-campus and parking can be a little stressful since the garages usually fill up by 8:30.
Niche User,4,very college like feeling. Tallahassee revolves around the University and the prominent presence of being in the Capital of Florida.
Alum,4,"I very much enjoyed my time as a student at FSU.  Coming from South Florida, it was so wonderful to have change of season and rolling hills!  Athletics and game days were amazing!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity I experience on this campus and the overall support that can be felt throughout the campus as a whole. You could walk up to anyone campus to ask for something as simple as direction to as big as how do I go about getting an internship. Florida State is a really motivational place to be where determination and persistence help you achieve your dreams. The only complaint I have about Florida State is that it does not always feel safe, and sometimes it can feel like you get lost in translation since it is such a large university."
Sophomore,4,"Love my school! Apart from a less than stellar experience picking my first classes, the school and staff are wonderful! Everyone is so passionate about their school."
Freshman,4,Florida State University is a very big college but the staff there do really care about there students. There's a lot of resources to help out students in a lot of different ways. It maybe a lot to take in but the people there are really supportive!
Freshman,4,I love the inclusion and diversity that the campus of FSU offers as well as the numerous events and entertainment offered to the students.
Sophomore,4,Student. Overall great experience. The campus is beautiful and the professors work hard to provide students with the best education. Tallahassee is not that great of a city though.
Niche User,4,"I visited FSU over my spring break junior year. I liked the open campus, I loved that the campus is multi-faceted it has the capabilities to nurture any major, and I love the hospitality shown during my college tour."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy being at FSU. The campus is beautiful and all my professors are very nice! They have lots of activities that students can participate in. They also have tons of extracurriculars to try out for such as club sports or any type of club you can think of.  They also have several resources to help students succeed academically such as tutoring help, library books, and study sessions."
Niche User,4,"I love the campus and the students and staff are very friendly. The living quarters aren't amazing but it's not that bad. Other than that, everything else is great. The cafe has really great food, and there are a lot of awesome places to sit and chill and do homework."
Freshman,4,"So far, so good.  Just started classes the end of August 2019.   Great Campus life, access to transportation and walkability of campus is good.    Classes schedule is ideal with advisors available."
Sophomore,2,"If you want to party and don't care about getting a quality education, this is your school! Unless you're in a S.T.E.M. major, you're not going to be taken seriously. Also very dangerous campus, there was a stabbing in one of the dorms my first year there."
Niche User,2,Most students care more about partying and fraternities/sororities than academics. It is hard to find friends if you are not a extroverted kid with a lot of money
College Freshman,2,You basically have to drink to fit in.
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of greek life.
College Junior,2,"They tend to have all the same personality, the girls are barbies and the guys are jerks."
College Senior,2,The people here are not the type of individuals I would ever willingly choose to surround myself with.
College Senior,2,"Buildings are old with mold and leaks. Rooms are very small and community bathrooms are always disgusting. Rent is over $800 a month for a room a little bigger than a closet, shared with another person.  FSU finally tore down one of the worst buildings but the rest are still barely up to par."
College Freshman,2,Sexual assault is an issue that college administrators want to shove under the rug but it is a real problem and if the administrators cracked down on sexual assault it would show potential parents that they care rather than there never being a sexual assault on campus which everyone knows is false
College Freshman,2,"Dorm life is terrible. Smith should have been demolished ages ago and if you have a clean room, you probably have an awful roommate."
College Sophomore,2,"There have been multiple sexual assaults on campus while I attended FSU. There was also a gunman my first semester at the library. Also, many attempted abductions have happened near and on the outer edges of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I hated my first two years of college because of unhelpful professors. Also, students were picked for my major without their academic achievements in mind. It was all about who you knew and if you went to high school in Tallahassee and had the ""in"" with the athletic trainers."
College Freshman,2,"Considering the fact that I spent my first year in the oldest dorm on campus, I did not enjoy campus housing at all. I was in a dorm that was built in 1941. Smith hall was community style living. I lived on the 10th floor which meant I had to take a flight of stairs because the elevator did not go that high. Many of my friends who lived in the building had cockroaches in their rooms along with mold and mildew. To be honest, this residence hall was a huge health hazard and should not have been open. When I tried to switch halls, Florida State denied me the opportunity due to a housing ""overload"" so I was stuck living in Smith Hall for the entirety of my freshman year."
College Freshman,2,It costs a lot compared to the much nicer apartments just a mile from campus. You never know who you'll get paired with roommate wise either.
College Freshman,2,"I didn't get the worst dorm on campus but I still really dislike it. The amenities in Bryan Hall are pretty clean but my room is a closet in terms of space. It's very difficult to move around in there with my roommate. Also I never see my RA and people do not adhere to the rules about noise at all. Almost every night I'm calling down to the front desk to ask the RA on hand to get people to be quiet and it works for all of five minutes and the RA never follows up on it. Furthermore, when I brought these problems up to my floor RA she did nothing about it and so I'm very upset by that. I have many tests that I need to sleep for. I usually spend more time sleeping in my friend's dorm than I do mine."
College Senior,2,I lived on campus one year and it was okay. Wouldn't recommend it but everyone basically lives off anyway.
College Freshman,2,"There is no privacy due to the fact you don't get a room with a door. Also some residence halls have mold. Additionally, living with roommates that you sleep right next to could cause problems with disagreeing on bed time."
College Freshman,2,"Unbelievably expensive for a crappy room.  3 girls, 3 desks, 3 beds, 3 dressers, 3 broom closets, one sink, one shower, one toilet all in a 14ftx14ft room for a ridiculous price."
College Freshman,2,I am in Smith Hall with the severe mold problem....
College Freshman,2,"I moved here from Baltimore, MD, and it was practically a culture shock to move from such a liberal, diverse, and poor community. To me, everyone here seems rich, white, and Christian. I'm very accepting of other cultures and open to poking fun (in good taste) at others, and my friends from the area are so not used to seeing such openness that they believe I'm racist."
College Senior,2,I lived in a very old dorm so it was dirty and smelly. It was the cheapest one but still very expensive and you basically had to buy  a meal plan too because the kitchens were small and gross too. I miss living so close to my classes and my job. The atmosphere was really friendly and it was easy to make new friends.
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in a horrible dorm. Cockroaches, floods, and mold. Some are great, I got the worst"
College Sophomore,2,"I recognize that this is a good university, however I feel very strongly that it is the wrong fit for me. It's very overwhelming, and it seems that students and faculty alike are more concerned with themselves than with being friendly and welcoming. I feel like I would be better off elsewhere."
College Freshman,2,There really arent that many and they arent updated its pretty much a nightmare.
College Senior,2,Make sure to take care of any financial problems early because if you wait until the semester starts you'll be waiting in huge lines in the financial aid office and become very frustrated with the whole process
College Junior,2,They took away my aid last minute
College Freshman,2,"I just happened to get a not so good dorm and it is disgusting. But there are alot of great dorms on campus! Broward, Gilchrist, Degraff, Landis, Reynolds, Jenny are the good ones. Plus, they are opening new dorms next year so that's good!"
College Junior,2,I am out-of-state and the school will not give me any money everytime I apply. Unless your independent you don't get a dime out-of-state.
College Freshman,2,"I did well in HS, was actively involved in sports and activities and am in three honor societies at FSU and don't have many scholarship offers other than bright futures and loan options."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid department is filled with a lot of incompetent people. Be prepared to have a few headaches and/or messed up aid. Also, in the beginning of the semester, financial aid office lines are going to extend to the outside of the office and you'll wait a little while. In the middle, there will still be a line but a short one."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is extremely expensive, particularly if you want to live within walking distance to campus."
College Freshman,2,"There have been many issues with financial aid.  When I tried to purchase my books for the new semester the Financial Aid office glitched saying that I, along with several other students had no financial aid for the semester."
College Freshman,2,Very confusing and unhelpful people.
College Freshman,2,The surrounding city is downtrodden and unkempt. It gets sketchy late at night and you can find yourself in the middle of a neighborhood you don't want to be in very quickly.
College Freshman,2,The campus is not very well lit at night so walking home alone is quite unnerving as a female.
College Freshman,2,"There's a Mcdonalds within walking distance, But everything else is two miles down the road and is all big name fast food chains like Jimmy John's and Burger King."
College Freshman,2,A few of the financial aid staff did not thoroughly explain what I needed to know and were also clueless about some FAFSA information. They messed up my disbursement a couple times and the line for the Financial Aid office is always long.
College Freshman,2,FSU is prestigious and is therefore very stingy with it's financial aid it gives. For me all I had is Bright Futures and still had to go down to the Financial Aid office multiple times in order to get my financial aid disbursed. Make sure with financial aid you have everything on order for the university as they seem slow when it comes to dealing with financial aide issues.
College Freshman,2,"They don't offer my major so I am taking courses that don't apply to my future, kind of feels like a waste of time."
College Freshman,2,Campus dining is pretty bad. Not much variety and not very good quality.
College Freshman,2,Heard financial aid was a pain to get.
College Freshman,2,dinning sround campus isn't very healthy but it's duable because it's not too expensive but it adds up after a while
College Freshman,2,I didn't even get half of my tuition covered so it's difficult for my parents to pay the rest without struggling. i only get a minimal amount of money from FAFSA
College Freshman,2,they'll give you aid but you have to harass them to disperse it
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive much money from FSU. I applied for FAFSA and got a mediocre amount, but I still need loans. I applied for external scholarships and did not receive much."
College Junior,2,"Looked at a few places last year, and decided to stay on campus. Anywhere close to campus (within walking distance) has serious crime issues and lacks basics (i.e. kitchens) which essentially make it the same as just living in the dorms."
College Senior,2,"It's so hard to get scholarships for ""normal"" people. The financial aid people are the most miserable people to talk to when you can finally get through to speak with someone. Willing to tell you what you're looking for, but completely unwilling to help with any further questions or finding financial aid money."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't have an east side, renovated dorm, you're wasting your money. There's so much off-campus housing in Tallahassee that's close to campus, affordable, and more spacious than the dorms to be worth paying thousands to live on-campus."
College Sophomore,2,I have a hard time finding healthy options when eating out in Tallahassee. It's disappointing that there isn't more nourishing and delicious food off-campus. I am just trying my best to take care of my body and give it what it needs.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is nothing to do off campus because this is a college town.
Recent Alumnus,2,The dorms are disgusting and small. They are close to class buildings.
Recent Alumnus,2,I have not received any financial aid; I receive bright futures which does not cover much.
Recent Alumnus,2,The dining halls on campus are not open often and the food is disgusting and expensive.
Recent Alumnus,2,Criminology is boring and repetitive. All the classes talk about the same things over and over.
Recent Alumnus,2,The facilities are mostly rundown and old; only the new buildings are nice and there are very few of those.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are mostly fast food places around campus.
College Senior,2,"In this review, I am only addressing the campus dining halls, Fresh Food and Suwannee. I got so, so sick of them. They are okay at first but they get very old."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms pretty much suck wherever you go. But if you are lucky and get a dorm near Landis, then it's not that bad. The rooms are super small and way overpriced but I believe it's worth it to live on campus freshman year."
College Sophomore,2,The ticket you so much and it is really hard to find a convenient parking spot.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid office takes so long to complete something on your todo list.
College Senior,2,Don't get a meal plan unless you enjoy quantity over quality. It's very expensive and the food is terrible. I can live off groceries on $150/mo that taste way better and are much healthier than cafeteria crap. The dining halls are also very loud. The best thing about them would probably be endless desserts and drink refills. If you do get a meal plan go to Fresh Foods instead of Suwannee. Chili's is the best place to eat but is also always EXTREMELY slow for whatever reason so only get to-go there.
Alum,1,"Terribly disorganized, say they send transcripts and never do. Athletes get the hook up.  Professors are pompous do not care.  Registration is always a nightmare.  Campus is nice and athletics are good. Tallahassee has become a very unsafe place to live."
Senior,1,"Came here in 2011 as a Freshman. Got robbed my first night in Tallahassee during Rush week at Paddy's Beach Bar less than 500 ft away from the UPD. Experienced a lot of discrimination at FSU. I was kicked out of a Frat for the color of my skin (no I'm not lying)-Sigma Nu. There were little to no resources for my Major (Actuarial Science). No tutors at ACE tutoring for anything past Calc I. There weren't even any online tutors I could find for a reasonable price (less than 50$/hr) online for Calc II. No help for Math students who don’t learn from conventional University teaching methods. AKA copy notes in class, study at home. I found that they were quick to accept my Financial aid money yet reluctant to offer any aid or funding to Math majors. There’s two business buildings, but the LOV building is a piece of crap. There are no rooms for Math majors to study and the computer labs are for CS majors. There’s a reason why 2 out of 14 AS majors actually PASSED COLLEGE here."
College Senior,1,If Greek life didn't exist on Fsu's campus I feel I would have enjoyed my time here a lot more. Greek life allows for this atmosphere of hierarchy and self-entitlement that I do not agree with nor do I support.
College Senior,1,They get away with crimes.
College Freshman,1,"I hate living on campus, my stuff is moldy for no reason and they lied about the spacious living conditions in Landis. They are way over priced and force me to buy an expensive meal plan that I do not use AT ALL. Such a waste of my money."
College Freshman,1,The topic of money is one that is always relevant when i speak to my parents on the phone. Financial aid is the hardest part about being in college. I would take all of the hardest classes on campus in exchange for not dealing with financial aid.
College Freshman,1,I am not offered enough money as an out-of-state I don't think.
College Freshman,1,If you do not get in one of the few good dorms you are stuck in a cramped dirty room. My friend had mold growing all over her things in Smith Hall.
College Senior,1,then i'm ok with living with i'm offerd
College Senior,1,none of the greek are  in the school
College Freshman,1,I didn't get any scholarships. I am paying almost all of it out of pocket and I really didnt get any grants.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is stupid and a ripoff. You will be paying for your ""friends"" that are all backstabbers and fake."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is free on campus, but it's basically a fight to the death to get a spot. The on campus police constantly give out tickets which sucks because sometimes students have no choice but to park somewhere they're not supposed to. You don't really need a car because there is on campus and public transportation."
College Senior,1,Campus and city buses are terrible. They don't stick to their schedule so you have to arrive 30 min-an hour before you need to be somewhere. Buses are always breaking down which means the replacement bus can't be tracked on the TransLoc app. I am constantly missing buses because they are totally UNRELIABLE. However you pay the transportation fee online.
College Sophomore,1,Still trying to get aid
College Sophomore,1,"Recently my father passed away and I lost half my income and the school did not want to give me any aid or grants when the year before i was given aid with 2 incomes. Their reasoning for not giving me aid was because I have Bright Futures. Bright Futures is a scholarship that I earned, not aid."
College Sophomore,1,"FSU is ranked the #1 party school in America...need I say more? I don't partake, but it is very noticeable especially with anyone involved in FSU's vibrant Greek life."
College Senior,1,"After my problems with the engineering program, I lost my bright futures scholarship. Now they are trying to kick me out and not give me the financial aid awarded to me because of those engineering hours. The money they have allowed me to use as loans are not enough to sustain my life and pay for my rent and tuition. It sucks"
College Senior,1,"Greek life dominates the campus. Any and everywhere you go sorority and fraternity clones pass you by in masses. The first thing asked upon meeting someone is ""So, what sorority are you in?"".. None, I'm a GDI- a goddamn independent! As a non Greek, i dont appreciate their pastel long sleeves, khaki shorts, and sperry boat shoes. Greek housing is available in their houses and in Heritage grove."
College Senior,1,Campus housing is the worst. Avoid it if you can. Most expensive housing option and good luck finding a place to keep your car on campus.
College Senior,1,"Living on campus is the worst, you pay the same amount to live in a shoebox and share a room with 2-3 other people, often strangers, as you would for a private 1000 sq. ft.+ apartment a mile from campus."
College Sophomore,1,"FSU is a drinking school. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. When we won the championship, the entire city was engulfed in the a riotous rampage of drunk college kids. This is not a rare occurrence. During football season, there will be people drinking, vomiting, and falling over. It is a fact of this school. If you want to focus on your studies, or you want your children to attend a school that is less tolerant of alcohol, avoid this school. FSU is located in an area that so much underage drinking occurs, that there is really no way to police it. Sure, the police will attempt to scare anyone attempting to use fake ids during the first two weeks; but after that, it's pretty much free for all."
College Senior,1,"EVERYONE drinks and if you don't, you don't go out and enjoy the social life with other FSU students."
College Senior,1,"I received financial aid in the beginning and after the first year my financial aid decreased for unfounded reasons. I applied the same time as the year before, yet I was told I applied too late to receive my university's scholarship. Also, I was told my parents made too much money so my grants were taken away from me despite the fact that I pay for my school expenses ALONE. It is very frustrating when I am told that I can not even claim myself as an independent to get the necessary funds. I am an excellent student yet I have to bury myself in an overwhelming debt with student loans and can barely afford to pay my living expenses."
College Senior,1,"I do not like living in Tallahasse because it is definitely a college town. There are too many students in such a small area so the traffic is horrible. Also, the only things to do in Tallahassee near the school is to go out and enjoy the nightlife. I am not interested in these activities so it is hard to find things to do that fit my lifestyle."
College Junior,1,"I am from Atlanta, GA. It is very difficult to get a flight out to Atlanta without paying sky high prices for a ticket. There is some bus transportation but not like the Red Coach bus that is a luxury bus and takes you to major cities in Florida. Many people are not from Georgia so it is difficult to catch a ride with a friend or someone that is going home"
College Junior,1,"There are not nearly enough parking spots for students and staff. Finding parking is so stressful and very difficult. And the parking rules are totally ridiculous(no backing in to some spots), I hate parking enforcement. "
College Junior,1,"Although it's free to park on campus, spots fill up quickly. It usually takes me twenty to thirty minutes to find a parking spot...if there are any."
College Junior,1,"So much drug usage, its like drinking water"
College Freshman,1,"no national respect, cliquey, shallow, stereotypical"
College Sophomore,1,The lack of strictness in attendance allows students to be responsible for their own time management and grades in the classes. 
College Freshman,1,It is incredibly expensive to live off campus. Hardly any apartments include electric in their monthly rent and most charge $600+ per person per month.
College Senior,1,"The only times it is easy to find parking is at night on the weekend.  During the day, especially on week days, finding a parking spot is next to impossible.  Friends of mine have relayed stories where they've spent 45 minutes just driving around campus trying to find a parking space.  Thankfully the need for a car is pretty low on campus because there is a university bus system. This school-sponsored bus system can be extremely helpful since a trip across campus can take 20-25 minutes on foot, depending on how quickly you walk.  "
College Freshman,1,Greek life is basically just a way for girls to be mean to each other. I don't have much respect for any of them. It's all about who's the prettiest.
College Freshman,1,"Kellum is terrible, but at least the people are great. Way too expensive!! You're not paying for the nice living... you're paying for a great freshman social life."
College Freshman,1,"THE WIFI HERE SUCKS, you have to have an ethernet cable!! If you are living in the dorms, forget about wifi. Make sure your ethernet ports are working, too."
College Senior,1,Alcohol and drug visibility is really high at my school. Drinking is the most popular activity but I have witnessed other drug related acts such as smoking.
College Senior,1,"This grade of F reflects what most people associate this with: failure.  FSU delivers on the aspects of a good college experience, from social settings to academic settings, yet the prevalence of drinking and marijuana usage around and on campus is staggering.  Underage or of age, the amount of usage here in Tallahassee is overwhelming."
College Sophomore,1,"The substance abuse scene at the Florida State University is pathetically open and obvious. The ""hipster/hippie"" community on campus is very large, and smoking cannabis is common on and around campus. There are few roads within campus, but the Police only patrol these roads, so anywhere between the roads/behind dorms/inside dorms is extremely common. I cannot walk through the Union without smelling weed. Other drugs are much less common and I have had little exposure to these. Alcohol, on the other hand, is massively popular and obvious. I have sat next to students in class before noon who smelled of alcohol. The Greek life on campus is obnoxious and prevalent, seemingly perpetually drunk. The ""strip"" that is most popular for students to party is directly across the street from campus, so intoxicated students stumbling through/around campus is also very common."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In my opinion, Greek life is simply an extension of high school popularity wherein students are willing to pay to be a part of a select group that stands out among the rest of the student body. They do annual philanthropies but it is simply a dog and pony show to justify the flagrant disregard for academics as a priority."
College Senior,1,"Parking is HORENDOUS! It is almost impossible to get a parking spot inbetween the hours of 8:30-4:00 in the parking garage in the center of campus. The ""sketch-lots"" are always full. The psychology/medical garage is always full after 10:30 as well as the other two garages. Tickets are easy to come by if you're not smart about where you park. Just follow the rules, and you'll be ok. Permit costs are free, which is nice."
College Junior,1,horrible old buildings with tiny rooms for more than one person
Recent Alumnus,1,Cost of permit is included in tuition but still isn't cheap and at times you aren't guaranteed parking because freshmen leave their cars in overnight garages for entire semesters so commuting students have to struggle during prime hours to find a spot. They also took away first level parking for students and are now designated faculty spots which limits out spaces. You can get lucky w parking of you pick garages far from the main campus buildings but it is a tiring walk during the hot days in FL.
College Junior,1,There is a big drug scene at FSU. Almost everyone you meet in Tallahassee could hook you up with drugs of any type. Alcohol is of course the number one drug of choice next to Marijuana and MDMA.
Recent Alumnus,1,Fight to the finish... Often would pick up strangers and give them a ride to their car to steal their spot.
College Sophomore,1,"Our school is pretty adamant when it comes to [being caught] using drugs (this includes alcohol). I've heard from people that you'll likely have to pay a fine and take a Drug/Alcohol course for your first offense. If you're caught again, it's likely you'll be suspended from school and you will probably face more extensive legal charges. 

In terms of being caught, if you're not being overly public about it, you're probably okay. I know students who hid alcohol/drugs in their dorm and never got caught because they can't actually look through your belongings or do a ""room search"" (unless given reason to)."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible, especially during prime hours. The parking office gives out many parking tickets, which cost $30, and deny most ticket appeals. I give it a D- instead of an F because there was a parking garage opened this year which seems to always have some available spaces. FSU has recently stared taking over the top floors of some of the popular parking garages and reserving them for guests, in the morning and middle of school days when students need the spots most, with no prior warning. It is frustrating because the students are paying for these spots to get to campus and get to class and FSU parking is getting in the way of that."
College Sophomore,1,The availability of parking spots close to classroom buildings is ridiculous.  You have to leave about an hour before class to find a spot and walk the long distance from the garage to campus.
College Junior,1,Buildings are pretty rundown and the dorms are nasty and bug ridden.
College Freshman,1,"The parking on campus is awful. There are hardly any spots open and often times you have to drive around for a while before you find anything, if you even are able to find anything."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is one of the few things I detest about FSU campus. I appreciate that they have built more parking garages since the last time I attended, but it hasn't seemed to do anything to alleviate the problem. If you have classes near the Union, forget about finding parking in the Woodward garage or scant surrounding lots past 8am. I would advise you to be prepared to own a bike, live on campus, be ok with parking far out and walking, or using the campus bus schedule. Don't rely on having a car and your life will be easier."
College Sophomore,1,"FSU has been notorious for their lack of parking spaces for over 20  years! If you are not onn campus by 7:45, you will not get a parking space for the rest of the day. Luckily, the buses to campus are frequent and highlyy recommended."
College Freshman,1,"Living in Smith Hall for four months, I thought I was going to die. My room was literally the size of a prison cell, with my bed about six feet off the ground...with no ladder!! Every night I went through a complicated gymnastics routine just to get into bed. We shared our bedroom with about fifty other girls with NO sense of personal hygiene; it was common to find bodily fluids, undergarments, and waste products strewn across the bathroom floor on the weekends, and everyone hurried to shower first on Saturday so that they wouldn't have to shower after the showers were disgusting! While I was there, I became very sick and could hardly get out of bed, let alone go to class. Since then, the room I used to live in has been found to have BLACK MOLD, which I was allergic to; something they did not notice on THREE different occasions when they inspected the room! I was so sick and had so many infections when I left that the doctors told me I couldn't leave my parents' house; I've only just been cleared to go back out in public, and it's been two months! Every day I'm glad I transferred out of this school and this dorm hall!"
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is a daily challenge for any student who drives. If you drive to an 8AM class parking should be OK, but anything after that time and you are guaranteed to find full garages everywhere you look. Make sure to save a good chunk of time before any classes to try to find a spot. Your best method is to wait for other students walking to their cars and then take their spot."
College Freshman,1,"The school is predominately either white and christian or  white and hipsteresque. Due to this, there are rather few minorities on campus. Not to mention that many of the students essentially look the same and seem to come from the same middle class family background"
College Senior,1,"They build a lot of dorms, yet don't add parking"
College Freshman,1,Parking at FSU is infamously terrible. The common rule of thumb is to arrive on campus at least an hour before your classes start in order to ensure a spot.
College Junior,1,Parking is horrible at FSU. There is not enough parking spaces and it usually takes a long time to get a spot if you are not there at 8 am.
College Senior,1,worst ever. Not enough spots but then you get ticketed if you park elsewhere
College Sophomore,1,"There are quite a few parking garages, but you have to get there early in the morning to even dream about getting a spot."

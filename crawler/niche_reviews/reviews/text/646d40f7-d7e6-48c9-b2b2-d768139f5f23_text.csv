Junior,5,"Presentation College is a very family oriented campus atmosphere.  It is small and personable, which is what I like."
Graduate Student,5,Pc was a great campus. It’s constantly growing from when I first started there. They are adding sports which is very helpful and you get to meet a lot of people fro all over.

Sophomore,5,It's a decent school but it's very small and the town doesn't have much to do but nice staff and locals.
Sophomore,5,"I like a lot about Presentation College, the environment is very calm and the teachers are very flexible. They always are there to help the students. Presentation College is a very diverse campus for the place that it is located in. The one thing that could be changed is food because it isn't much of a variety to choose from."
Junior,5,"Presentation College in Aberdeen, SD as been an overall pleasant experience. The experience will be what you make of it, just like at any other college so you.

Freshman,5,"I haven't had much experience here at Presentation College, I have only been here for about 3-4 months but it has already been a great and life changing experience. The campus is beautiful and so is the weather (but I heard I wont be saying that come winter time.)The small campus lifestyle is also nice because with a small campus means smaller amount of students which means your professor while remember your name and I have already experienced this in a few of my classes where my professors remember my name but will also help me one on one outside of class with anything I need help with, it has a feeling as if we are all family, everyone treats you with kindness not only on campus but even people in the community. I haven't been here too long to have a change in mind for the college but if I could change something it would maybe add more to the campus."
Junior,5,I really liked using Niche and how easy it was to access. It gave good information and helped me compare other colleges easily. I would add more scholarships for people to apply for. They are very helpful for broke college students!

Junior,4,I like the small college feel and how everyone is so close. It is like one big family. You aren't just a number and professors actually care and want you to succeed. Maybe a little more organization would be nice.
Sophomore,4,It is a good college. The teachers and coaches are very understanding and since it is a small school it is easier to get one on one with teachers when you need additional help. I play soccer and I am majoring in nursing. It is hard with balancing them but the teachers and coaches work good together to help out as much as possible.
Sophomore,4,"Presentation College is a great college to attend. The small classes and small campus really help those who don't do so great in bigger situations.

The Sisters still run the college and are such a delight to see all over campus. Also, I'm a Resident Assistant at the college and work a lot around many of the students."

College Freshman,4,I havent seen any drug activity on the campus. The usage seems to be pretty nonexistant to anyone who doesnt partake in driugs
College Freshman,4,The Radiology department is good. The curriculum gets you into your specific classes right after your first year. The workload looks like a lot but manageable.
College Freshman,4,Parking permit was free. Tickets are only issued to cars that do not have a permit after the allowed visiting times. The campus is small and car would not be necessary. Parking is always available

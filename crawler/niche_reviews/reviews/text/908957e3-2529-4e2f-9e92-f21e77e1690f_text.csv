Junior,5,To tell the truth I was scared at first and thought it was going to be alot of drama etc but all in all its a great school and everybody there makes it feel like home.

Sophomore,5,"Philander Smith is an HBCU which I like, there’s a lot of people from Louisiana , Chicago, even New York. The Classes are very much small so it’s an easy learning environment a lot of one on one time with your professors.

Their academics are amazing, entertainment is fun, safe and friendly, and their staff strives to make sure every student gets the most of their education.

Even the dorm supersivisors and staff came together when help was needed . I plan on finishing all 4of my years at Philander Smith College . I strictly advise everyone to attend Philander !!!!!
Sophomore,5,I have been at Philander Smith 💚💛 college for the past 3 1/2 years and I have experience nothing but greatness
Freshman,5,"I love that it’s a small college, and you get that family environment. I also love that I can get one on one time with my teacher due to the small classroom size. My favorite experience with Philander Smith College is that they have a summer bridge program call START. The program allow students that SAT’s or ACT’s scores wasn’t high enough to attend philander in June for six weeks and get a semester out the way. Another good thing about it is it’s free. That’s a few positive ways why I love my school"
Freshman,5,I love Philander Smith College. I am enrolling now for the spring semester and the staff has been great. The cafeteria has friendly servers and a clean environment. I would definitely recommend this college to anybody willing to work for a successful future in education.
Niche User,5,I believe that this HBCU is an excellent University where students are guided into productive citizens. I am pleased with the relationships students have with peers as well as the overall culture of the campus.  It was an outstanding experience to witness a university that provided opportunities for engaging topics that are relevant to the changing world we live in.
Sophomore,5,"Philander Smith College Is a great opportunity for any person out there . we pride ourselves to excel in our studies and keep forth to our goals . The first thing about college is meeting new friends and you really find more about yourself in college. the second would be learning and the Independence you have for your own grades. The third would be joining clubs here at PSC for more interaction . Coming To PSC everything will be alright , there are plenty chances and acces to get around however connect with people for what you want to do ."

Sophomore,5,"Philander Smith College is the best thing that every happened to me. The staff is amazing, including the cafe workers. They joke around with you about little stuff,they try to make you feel better if they see you don't look like yourself. The professors really engage with us. If we need there help we can call or text them about the work. Philander is good school in general, I love attending the school."
Freshman,5,"i love my HBC, from the teachers to the friends i've made around campus. its so many opportunities for individual students if they just strive to suceed. Philander Smith College makes you feel home in everyway."

Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Philander. The staff are very supportive and wants you to become successful. The students are friendly and I guarantee you will be know. I'm an athlete at Philander and most schools they show favoritism towards athletes,PSC doesn't. Which I'm not upset about. At Philander you aren't given anything,you work for them. Just like real life,jobs not going to be handed out to you. I love my HBCU and wouldn't trade it for any other!"
Freshman,5,"I like how the housing is set up. I would like to see change on the food menu. Overall, Philander is an good HBCU to attend if you're trying to get away to an different scenery."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Philander is that the professors truly do care, they will try to help you as much as they can and so will the advisers. Honestly all of the staff there is very friendly and helpful, I love my HBCU. But what I would like to see change is more diversity and more job opportunities for students who really want to go to college but seriously can not afford to take out any loans and weren't fortunate enough to get any scholarships."
Freshman,5,I like philander because they gave me an opportunity that no one would. What I would change there is probably the sports and more freedom for freshman.
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus is a great experience because you get to see all your friends everyday in one area and the visiting hours are convenient.
College Sophomore,5,Greek life shows that you are a all-around prestigious man or woman willing to help out the community or make the social a better experience for the students.

College Junior,5,"Greek Life is amazing to me.  I am actually apart of a Greek Organization and many students on campus love our organization and we stand for.  They generally respect us, however, some students may feel indifferent about us (Greeks in general).  Greeks make up 2% of the campus and a lot of activities revolve around them, which makes it very entertaining."
College Freshman,5,The people here are amazing and easy to work with.  If I had to chose I will do it all over again.
College Junior,5,Philander Smith College honestly has some of the absolute BEST dorms in the country.  They're the most spacious dorms that allows you have as much privacy as you want.  All dorms rooms have their own personal bathrooms in the rooms for just two people to share.  It's much better than communal bathrooms!.  There's also a Resident Assistant on each floor that really ensures that harmony exists everywhere within the dormitories.
College Freshman,5,My experience with receiving financial aid was very easy
College Sophomore,5,Everyone accepts everyone for who they are and not what they like. Nobody really asks or cares abot each other's economic status.
College Freshman,5,There are absolutely no crimes on campus because of the college's small size
College Junior,5,Well the work load is okay at this point. It is not very difficult and we learn as a class. I feel as if all students needs are being met and no one is being left behind.

College Junior,5,Living on campus is great you get the full college experience.
College Senior,5,"In the internship that I have done there was no monatary value, but the experlence was wonderful. I love working with the elderly and youth.

Printing on campus for students is free which is really a blessing in college. Personal computers are nice to have, especially for entertainment, but I haven't needed to use mine yet."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Psc Night Life – Three short words, Its FUN, ENERGETIC, and ALWAYS MEMORIBLE! Nothing like the night life of psc!!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Guys and Girls – the male to female ratio at philander smith college is about 3-8. There's more females that are mature and successful upon there freshmen year entering philander smith college then there is males. The males seem to mature and become more prominate during their sophmore or some even their junior year. Nevertheless, by their GRADUATING senior year philander smith college shows off just how grand they are able to produce the best students for graduate school as well as for any career feild."
College Senior,5,GOAL REACHED – Philander's goal is to graduate their students academically prepared for  the real world and a real job. Once I leave Philander I will be fully prepared.
College Senior,5,There are plenty computer labs all over campus. The students use them and print for free. Its awesome.
College Senior,5,GOOD Diverse – Philander is very diverse. The staff is diverse and there are a lot of different people from all over the world. It's like no other HBCU I know of.
College Sophomore,5,"There are plenty of academic opportunites as for as leadership programs, tutoring sessions, and even new ideas"
College Junior,5,My experience with financial aid went smoothly. The school granted me a scholarship which took care of tuition it was registered on my accounting from the beginning.
College Sophomore,5,Students have access to computers all day and until late into the night.
Junior,4,The online class was pretty simple and easy. There is not a lot of classes that can be taken online that would qualify you to graduate and recieve your bachelors degree.
Junior,4,My overall experience at philander is a great one. I made alot of friends which is really hard for me to do. But at philander everybody treats you as family. No matter what it's like at home when your at philander it feels like new beginnings.
Junior,4,Philander Smith College is a great academic school just lack in housing. Everything else is fine. I encourage anyone to come and visit or even attend Philander Smith College.
Freshman,4,"Well I’m only a college freshmen so I don’t know how much you’ll value my opinion, but Philander Smith has been a great college setting for me. I’ve made lots of friends, the curriculum isn’t as complicated as every high school student worries about, and the teachers are very understanding. The campus is rather small but it’s beautiful and it gives you the opportunity to gain relationships with staff members. I would definitely recommend students to apply to this college for the next chapter of their education journey."
Junior,4,The school is lovely. I️ love philander and everything they offer. Especially the people in the school. They are great.
Senior,4,I returned to Philander to complete my degree.  I previously took a break due to very unfortunate circumstances.  The staff and teachers were very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,4,Philander Smith College is very welcoming and very student orientated.  Greek life is very top notch on this campus and they basically run the school. The professors do their job very well and help you comprehend what they are teaching. For the campus to be small it is very spread apart.
Senior,4,"Philander is the very first college I attended in 1995, although I took a break to start a family I have returned to finish my degree. Philander is a great college with great professors I wouldn't change anything about the college."
Junior,4,"My college experience at Philander was great they treat you like family and you would feel so welcomed, as far as my classes and courses that I'm taking are pretty good"
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Philander Smith College has been very good. Since the first day I arrived the spirit has always been high and the campus is very family oriented.
Junior,4,My experience with Philander Smith College has been great. I really like it because it is a small college and everyone is like family. They really have a lot of things in place to make sure someone like me who has ADD is successful. I struggled academically in high school and so my GPA was not that great. Philander Smith still gave me a chance in spite of.  And with the help of the staff an my fellow peers I have learned more and have been able to maintain better GPA here at Philander and I am approaching my junior year when people said I would never make it this far. I am forever great full for My family at Philander Smith College and this wonderful experience
Sophomore,4,"Philander has alot to give back to the community. This Social Justice College has given students the opportunity to fulfill dreams and even make wishes come true. Organizations like The Philander Smith Collegiate Choir, still gives the school enough recognition to be on top of most private HBCUs. The choir is one of the most popular organizations at the school, bringing in funds and notoriety. Academics are great as we all can tell by the Annual Honors Convocation. Greek Life is expanding and Campus Royalty seems to never disappoint their subjects. Philander has taught many people the importance of friendship and loyalty and even about how to live in our best days.  Philander Smith College prepares its students to go out into the world to be the best them and to not have to be scared of whatever challenges that come their way. I love my HBCU!"
Freshman,4,The very first day I visited Philander Smith College I knew without a doubt in mind that this was the perfect college for me. My experience at Philander has been great. Philander is a HBCU that is all about helping you move forward in life. Professors are very hands on and willing to help you with any and everything.
Freshman,4,Down to earth atmosphere is what I like about Philander. Faculty and staff make sure people at this school are comfortable. If there could be a change in the school it would be a better since of direction with incoming freshman. We know the mission but the progress isnt shown.
Freshman,4,My name is Noel Lyons and I am a Freshman majoring in Criminal Justice at Philander Smith College the overall campus like here at Philander is comfortable. But like all HBCU’S we have our flaws. When I arrived at Philander I emidetiatly felt safe due to the campus security who greeted me so kindly. I look at this campus as a beautiful living organism and a family. I love my HBCU.
Junior,4,"What I like about Philander Smith College is the family atmosphere. It's very small so everyone is a familiar face. The fact that it's small, gives us the chance to develop relationships with our professors."
Sophomore,4,Philander Smith is  small home filling school. If you want to be away from home but still have a homey filling this is a great school for you.
Freshman,4,I like the environment that the campus brings. It has a nice way of saying this is an HBCU other than the just looking on the website. The staff and students are nice. The teachers are really involved with helping you if you're stuck on work or just needing extra help with the subject.
Junior,4,"Philander Smith Collegiate Choir came long ways, although the loss of former choir director Dr. Parker was unfortunate the school choir still managed to keep flowing. New Director Mr. Chapel has continued a new path, increasing the choirs Collegiate understanding of music.  Recently Philander Smith Collegiate Choir had travelled down to Fort Worth, Texas to perform collegiate songs for Alumnus, in which, they were given donations for the showcase. Philander Smith's  Choir was also apart of panel discussion for the Presidency inauguration performance, if however, Hilary Clinton won the race. Despite the news of Trump taking the Presidency, Philander Smith Collegiate choir still have a substantial amount of Performances coming"
Sophomore,4,I like how all my professors know me by name ans that i have that one on one with them. i would change the student involvement level.
College Sophomore,4,My experience with the professors and courses at this school is that most courses are fair just have to listen and most professors here can teach.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at this school so far is that everyone here get along very well, I also think that this is a great HBCU. I love the library here, one of the top best 5% black historical libraries in Arkansas. Which makes this school very unique. I would choose Philander Smith College over again because everyone is like one big family here and there are many different opportunities here."
College Freshman,4,Philander Smith has some of the better sounds for HBCU's.  They're very spacious and do not have communal bathrooms.
College Freshman,4,Greek Life is very dominant at Philander Smith.  The Greeks are pretty lively and hold a lot of other leadership positions on campus
College Freshman,4,"I've done two summer bridge programs  at Philander Smith College so far and they've both been pretty fine.  I'm just thankful to have been given the  opportunity to receive 15 credit hours before even attending in the fall.  However, I'm here now and so far it has been great."
College Sophomore,4,The school is a nice environment small but pretty oriented with everyone and it feels like home along with having a church on campus for sanctuary if needed and good people plus staff who are willing to help you.
College Sophomore,4,Getting a Degree from this school is an honor beyond measures because it's a private school and one of the well-known Historically Black College Universities in which has a lot of  history is here.
College Sophomore,4,Nothing has been wrong so far and it's pretty content.
College Sophomore,4,My experience at my school has generally been amazing the people are genuine and outgoing and all want to pursue their goals in becoming college graduates and put a lot of effort into what they do. The professors are nice as well and do their best to assure your that you will succeed.
College Freshman,4,Greek life at my school is amazing and fun; they have a lot of parties and get togethers that attract the whole school to come out and have fun.
College Senior,4,I'm not too much of a Greek person but Philander Smith has had some great people on their fraternity and sorority which made my experiences with them awesome.
College Senior,4,They work as a team and win as one also looking good doing so
College Freshman,4,"The greeks are great, I just think that all the greeks should be on campus, but that is something I think cant be controlled."
College Freshman,4,"Overall I think Philander Smith College is a great school, I just think we need more fun organizations and activities."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. If there are any problems the students get can email from campus security. So I know immediately since my email comes to my phone.
College Freshman,4,I will be going directly to grad school. I do feel that I will be well prepared.
College Freshman,4,I like the fact that the class size is small.
College Freshman,4,One of the things that I like about the Greek life on our campus is that they are require you to have sophomore classification ( at least 30 hours) and at least a 2.5 or higher g.p.a. To me that says that they want you to get used to college classes and college life before you try to get involved with their organization. I think that may help you be more successful in achieving a balance later on after you join a fraternity.
College Freshman,4,"I'm the college's mascot, and I have a great time. However, I am also a cross country runner. I wish the cross country team go as much support from the college as the men's basketball team."
College Freshman,4,The professors seem to really care about the students. If you are struggling you can get help in the Academic Success Center.
College Freshman,4,"Good space , always busy except for during quiet hours"
College Junior,4,"This area is really great for STEM majors.  They have the ability to receive numerous opportunities to receive internships and job opportunities.  However, for me, who is in the Social Science department, they do not have much opportunities for us in this area, which makes it more difficult for people to recruit from our department."
College Junior,4,"It really has been a great experience so far due to the college being a very family-oriented campus.  Everyone is so willing to help and ensure that you succeed; however, I will say that the Psychology department could use just a little more assistance in getting internships and scholarships for it's students.  Other than that, the overall rating for the school is superb.  I love my institution."
College Senior,4,My experience at Philander Smith College has been great! The school is very small and we have a family-oriented campus. The teachers can sometimes be unavailable but other then that everything is great!
College Senior,4,WHEN WE KNOW BETTER WE CAN DO BETTER
College Senior,4,FREE AND SINGLE THE GIRLS LOVE TO MINGLE.
College Senior,4,GET WHAT YOU PUT IN
College Freshman,4,The student body enjoys the parties
College Freshman,4,The staff are helpful when planning career choices
College Freshman,4,The Greeks are very friendly and down to Earth
College Freshman,4,The security on campus are always present
College Freshman,4,The administration is sufficient and effective
College Freshman,4,The athletic department is pretty healthy and active.
College Junior,4,I like the security officers.
College Junior,4,I like this school thus far.
College Junior,4,This school has been very helpful and I am so thankful.
College Junior,4,This school has been so friendly and welcoming.
College Junior,4,"The atmosphere  is great, I feel safe."
College Junior,4,They are very informative a out whats goong on on campus .
College Junior,4,"I had no problems,just make keep an eye on it."
Junior,2,"Philander Smith College is not the place to attend and have the full college experience. I have been at Philander long enough to know that Philander only sells dreams and never promises. Philander Smith College doesn't listen to the students' concerns instead they ignored us numerous times and never gave us true answers. I was brought to Philander under false promises such as more residential buildings would be added, the student parking lot was going to be fixed (didn't get a fix until my junior year and that raised the tuition), etc before coming. Important paperwork would have been lost or misplaced and your process would be on hold. The majority of the staff doesn't take responsibility for their mistake instead blames the student. Philander Smith College felt like going to another high school.

The only good thing about Philander is the students became family and were always there for each other when it mattered the most and we ended up having a good time."
Freshman,2,It shouldn't hurt the teachers to put in a little college encouragement for the students. One of my teachers belittle me cause she knows that I'm not good at her class. That doesn't feel like classroom spirit. And they may want to bring up funds for music. Knowing now a days half of the campus is music savy
College Freshman,2,It's bad because we only have volleyball and basketball. We need more sports.
College Senior,2,No academic rigor at all. You'll start noticing the difference when you connect with students from other schools. Students at the school don't even want to learn. I like the dorms; it's spacious and new for now. The cafeteria food is the worst.
College Freshman,2,I find the students to be unfriendly. No affinity for international students. The students look down on people and talk ill about other students
College Freshman,2,"There are few things available to do off-campus, no cultural diversity. Though the college is in the capital city there are no better views outside. It's really far to get to large shops like Walmart."
College Sophomore,2,"Its ok, but it would be better if we had fall lines."
College Sophomore,2,The food isn't very leasing to te eye. The steak is dry and the bagels are old.
College Junior,2,The facilities on campus are average. The classroom settings are good but my main priority is just learning from my teachers. The campus life here is boring and the social scene is very small and insignificant. My purpose is to earn an education and I do not particularly care for any social scenes.
College Junior,2,"The parking at Philander Smith College is okay depending on the day you park. When activities are in progress finding spots can sometimes become hectic. On average though, Philander Smith does provide students with reasonable parking and tend not to fine people when problems occur. The security are superb and do their best to provide availabilty."
College Sophomore,2,"While security is available on campus, you cannot trust them to be there when you need them the most. Their response is a notch below average. Most of the security guards around campus don't look fit to respond if something big was to break out."
College Junior,2,"My overall experience on campus is quite so-so I enjoy the events, yet I think the curriculum can be Improved."
College Senior,2,Punishment Is Getting Better – Rules and regulations are just not starting to get enforced.
College Senior,2,"Progress Could Be a Little Less Stressful – Going to the financial aid office is very stressful, either because they do not have an answer for whats going on or they are too nonchalant about financial aid."
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of transportation that the school will provide. The only time transportation is provided is for special events. All other needs you kind have to get their on your own.
College Junior,2,"Summer Hot, Everything Else RAINY – Little Rock usually has really hot summers and as soon as it starts to cool off lots of storms come through. Winter doesn't get that cold except for a short while."
College Junior,2,"Relationship Wise – The main focus for a lot of students: hooking up. Even those who were focused on their studies made it very clear that they at least wanted one fling while they were at college. Understandable I suppose, though I remained focused on studies due to a legit long distance relationship. I feel like the main hype was hooking up and if I were single I may have been swept into that crowd as well."
College Senior,2,"I feel if the department was more organize, the school would be in  better conditions to provide more options for the student body.. It would provide a greater since of pride. 

Although it has gotten better as years have gone by, yet still needs work."
College Sophomore,2,Needs Improvement – Don't really have green spaces or a student hang-out area. Very conservative library and studying area.
College Junior,2,OK but Not Much Variety or Options – The cafeteria at school is better now than last year but it is a work in progress and the fact that the dorms are not equipped with stoves make other options such as cooking your meal meal impossible.
Niche User,1,"I want to express concern and great sadness at what your students and Philander frankly are doing to this neighborhood. Philander sucks up the resources of the neighborhood and gives nothing back. The students trash and disrespect the community. How do you dare go out to protest outward injustice when you do such an injustice to your own community. I call B.S. because 
 you can’t clean up the world while trashing your community it doesn’t work. I see new investment coming back to our neighborhood and we need Philander to be apart of the solution to rebuilding our community, not destroying it even more . People are building here again and we need that to continue. I watched a new resident walk the street picking up random trash thrown onto our streets . Where is Philander in the effort, you live here too. It is not easy to get people to invest their own money (not grant money) into communities of color ,and we ask students and school to take apart in building up Our neighborhood ."
Niche User,1,"I learned this 

I live close to Philander, and it’s not easy. Where are the adults and leaders of this school ? Where are the classes teaching students about community? Where are the leaders ? These students trash our neighborhood and then run out to protest injustices. The injustice is how Philander sucks up the neighborhood resources and buys up property around the school and does nothing but allow them to be used and trashed by these (Students) . Where do these students come from where this is ok. Do you treat your parents home this way? This is shameful, and what example is Philander setting , None. Don’t dare preach to me about injustice, because you inflict and bring down this neighborhood with your constant disrespect. You have all this new funding it would be great if philander would do something to improve the neighborhood and maybe start setting The example of community."
Freshman,1,"When I️ got to Philander Smith College I️ immediately realized how small the campus was. This campus doesn’t have any diversity nor accept people who look like them. I️ have been pointed at , laughed at , and even verbally bullied. The dorms are filthy and disgusting. One night I️ say a mouse running down the hallway of the dormitory. Philander advertise 2 to a room when in reality it’s really 3. They do not accept the LGBT community at all I️ tried out for a modeling team and I️ was rejected because they wanted a male or female and NOTHING IN BETWEEN. The cafe food is atrocious and they serve the same food everyday. The cafe has no fresh fruit. Last but not least they don’t have anywhere for students to workout. My friends and I️ ran off campus but that ended once the weather changed. I️ will be transferring from this school next semester because I️ can’t go to this HBCU that doesn’t meet the standards of other colleges. Do better Philander!"
College Freshman,1,"The people have no respect for others. Students running down the hallways or playing their music really loud. I can never get any sleep; however, it's really really bad living on campus."
College Freshman,1,There is almost no diversity on campus. Life style is one way. It's all about only a particular group of people
College Sophomore,1,Our school is not safe. The security guards do nothing to prevent students from being in harm's way.
College Junior,1,"The campus dining at Philander Smith College is appalling. The food does not tatste appealing, there is no variety, healthy food items seem to not be a major priority and students spend money eating off campus too frequently. The problems are myriad but my main concern is the food does not taste appealing. I never find something I like so I tend to just eat off campus."
College Freshman,1,"The dining halls do not serve enough food, the drinks are out most of the time, they need more variety in the cafe."
College Junior,1,There aren't any off campus options provided by the school.
College Sophomore,1,"The food at Philander Smith College is questionable at best. If you have money, your best option is to order a pizza or go off campus. The dining hall should only be eaten as a last resort. The are making steps, however, to turn the dining hall around in a new direction."
College Junior,1,"The campus does'nt provide tranportation at all so I can only rate it an ""F""."
College Junior,1,There isn't any off-campus housing available. If you plan on staying off campus then you will have to find your own apartment. They actually would be less-expensive than any school housing.
College Sophomore,1,What Night Life? What night life? The only parties that are consistent are the kick backs and hang outs people throw in their rooms.
College Junior,1,Philander Barerly Has Internships on Camous – I have never heard of students getting internships at school but if they do it is quite rare....
College Junior,1,Pretty much if you do not have a ride or a friend with a ride you are generally on campus unless you are going to walk to where you are trying to go.
College Junior,1,Money Hungry – FINANCIAL AID IS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL AT MY SCHOOL....THEY DO NOT REALLY HELP WITH SCHOLARSHIPS IF THEY DO THEY FAVOR ONE MAJOR OVER ANOTHER AND IT IS RIDICOULOUS AND I DO NOT TRULY DEPEND OR TRUST ON FINANCIAL AID AT MY SCHOOL!!!!!
College Junior,1,"Security Sucks – I do not feel at the most safe at my campus...we have had alot to happen on our campus since my freshman year of being there. Numerous of things that were on that list has happened at my school so it is very insafe and security does a very poor job of keeping us safe. They are barely available, they sleep on the job, and do anything but make sure we are safe."
College Junior,1,"We Have Gotta Do Better – In general our ca,pus does need A LOT of help when it comes to the athletic department and student center and other places go on campus. However, the best thing that we have on campus is our dorms which are suite style like dorms that come with a microwave and washing machines and dryers. Also, we have one of the best libraries in AR so I do appreciate that but that even needs help also."
College Junior,1,Boring Campus – I gave it a D+ becasue Philander does not provode much for the students which leads to negativity around the school like drinking and smoking...even unprotected sex. Sometimes they have certain parties and events around the campus but that does not happen often.
College Junior,1,"More Girls but Few Women – The women on my campus usually do not carry themselves in a great manner to me. most curse, smoke, and disrespect a lot of people on the regular even by simple gestures by men such as hello. Truly disgusting and egregious!"

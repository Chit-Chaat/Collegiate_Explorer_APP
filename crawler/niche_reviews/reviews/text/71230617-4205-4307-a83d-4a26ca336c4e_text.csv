Freshman,5,So far my experiences at The University of the Southwest have been great. The campus isn’t over crowded. I like that the classes aren’t crowded too because I can communicate with my professors more easily. They can talk to me one-on-one without having to stress with many students having problems in their classes. The professors are helpful and they offer me ways to improve in class. The environment is different from my home town but I like to try different things. If I could change one thing at my school it would be more activities in the classes. This helps me learn better and have a better understanding in my class.
Graduate Student,5,Faculty and staff very involved and understanding. Interact with students well. Students are also very caring and interactive online and on campus. I recommend anyone who is looking to attend college for the first time or return for a higher degree to join the Mustangs. This school is all about uplifting each other and excelling!
Sophomore,5,"This is a great University.  It was free to apply,  I transferred here to finish my undergrad and I received a free laptop computer at orientation.  Most of the staff and faculty on campus are very personable and helpful. They get to know you pretty quick, so you can't get by with much.  haha 
One of the required classes is ""Servant Leadership"".  There are always opportunities to volunteer somewhere in the community.  There are also work study jobs available.  The campus is small and the security is good.  The dorms are new and clean with walk in closets for each person.  There is always something going on and something to do."
Graduate Student,5,I have enjoyed my experience with the faculty and staff through the courses I have taken.  Everyone is eager to help you succeed in any avenue you choose.
Sophomore,5,University of the Southwest is a good school. All of their professors already have their masters degree or are currently working on their masters. The athletic rate at University of the Southwest is 95% and of course as always accademics always come first. The coaches there have study halls so that the athletes can stay on top of class. There is only classes Monday through Thursday so we have the weekend off to catch up on any work that we may and attend any student activities or games. Classes are only based on your major so you won't just get thrown into some random class. Classes are typically done by about two o'clock in the afternoon that way the sports can practice.
Graduate Student,5,The online instructors are wonderful. The classes are easy to follow and the content is very informative and rewarding.
Freshman,5,"The classes were very easy to take as long as you show up to class and do all your work. The teachers grade very easy and will help guide you through every essay, quiz, test, project, etc..."
Alum,5,"I completed an online Master's degree in School Counseling with the U of Southwest.   I chose this program because I am living in Europe, and needed to find a program that didn't require me to be in a 'cyber' classroom during specific times of the day.  The professors were all very accessible and responsive and the coursework was interesting and well delivered.  Additionally, the registrar department was exceptionally helpful and kind."
College Freshman,5,I haven't attend it yet but i will be attenting this yeat
College Junior,5,This so far has been my first semester at the University of the Southwest.  I am so glad I started to go here. They offer me a program which is called NExT. new experienced teachers aids. This is where I am working at the school and it is going towards some of my credit hours. Every time I have had a question about the school it was quickly answered. Another thing I appreciate is that it is Christian based. I was completely discouraged with starting school and I believe I was directed towards this school. I was discouraged because I have a 4 year old daughter and it is stressful at times to work and go to school. I didn't know when I would have time for her.   Thank God it has all worked out thus far greatly.!
College Sophomore,5,"There's Asians, mostly Hispanics, African-Americans, and Caucasians. And Everyone gets along."
College Sophomore,5,"It was really easy to get into, of course the GPA appeal letter I had to write was a little tricky.  Tips: Go for the college you want to go to and don't get discouraged"
Alum,4,"My overall experience with the University was positive. My professors were amazing, I made life long friends, and some community members were the sweetest people I have met. The school itself needs improvements. More rigorous academics, higher investment quality in it's coaching staff, and investment in some good food. The people are what make this place great."
Senior,4,"If I could give the campus food 0 stars I would. Other than that, know that USW is a small campus in a small town but overall I love my school and the athletics programs are amazing. Academics could use some improvement on the part of the professors but overall, great school."
Senior,4,"My experience here has been pretty good so far. I got to play baseball here and go to school as well an its helped me make great life long friends that I will forever be grateful for. Its a pretty small town so there really isn't much to do when I am not playing baseball or doing homework, but having close friends is what mad it more fun outside of school. Not only did my teammates become close but we became a family and that's another reason I enjoy it here. It is pretty small so it would be nice to see it grow some more even though it has grown little by little in the time that I have been here."
Sophomore,4,"Small college which is great for learning, giving you a chance to interact with your professors on questions you may have on learning."
Sophomore,4,"It was a definite good experience. Got to do so many travels, activities with my team, and met good people."
College Junior,4,I am on online student.
College Junior,4,"I believe what makes University of the Southwest unique was the fact that everyone on campus is an athlete. Walking around from class to class, you know everyone; it makes it a whole lot easier to adapt because you have a lot of things in common."
College Freshman,4,what makes university of the southwest unique is that every student is an athlete and participates in a sport they have here.
College Sophomore,4,"There's a lot of variety, some are small business."
College Sophomore,4,The majority of students are into sports.
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have seen, campus is safe."
College Senior,4,I am an online student so I am not familiar with the campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm in the grad program and just started, but from what I've experienced so far its not too bad.  The system doesn't crash, I enjoy it because it works around my time and the professor didn't take off points for not 'checking' in everyday a big kudos on that"
College Senior,4,My instructors are ready and willing to assist with any question or concern I may have.
College Senior,4,"Online Student – I am an online grad student, so I can't comment on campus life. However, my experience so far has been great. The instructors are knowledgeable and caring."
Freshman,2,"USW is a University located on the border of NM and TX. USW for me wasn’t a good experience. The teachers didn’t teach much, just read off of presentations that they would find online. They never explained anything just expected us to know things, never asked if we understood or needed help, or even bothered to be interactive with us. Academically the school wasn’t great, but the people there were like family. The environment was great and I loved being around everyone there."
Freshman,2,"At USW I liked that it was a Christian University and that it was centered around athletics. The coaching staff is very supportive and hard working, they are also professors. The classes are small and very intimate, meaning that the professor can answer all my questions as well as knowing my face and name. The school overall is small and everything is a short 5 minute walk to any building. I love how USW is surrounded by nature and is very protective of the wild life. However, the academics could be more challenging, meaning that I as a student did not grow much in knowledge. The housing leadership could be more stable. Student life could be more involved and active with athletics and campus over all. Sadly, there was not much school pride so I felt unimportant and bored more time than I wished.  Overall, my personal experience could have been better I USW would have made school more challenging, stable in leadership, and active on campus and in the community."
College Junior,2,I graded University of the Southwest as a C because I think the professors have a hard time explaining what objectives and assignments they need for the students to accomplish and finish tasks.
College Junior,1,It is really bad food. Some kids get food poisoning.
College Junior,1,"The restaurants near University of the Southwest has no student discounts, every fast food is unsanitary full of flies and gnats, service is poor and there is not one favorite place I can name and the cost is average."

Graduate Student,5,"I am not a fan of online learning, especially at my age (45) but they have made it very easy to navigate and pretty user friendly."
Graduate Student,5,"I love Marymount. I can't say enough good things about it. You get an excellent quality education, it's a small university so the professors actually know you. It's just outside of DC so you get some of the BEST internships and the alumni are very well connected. Well known for producing excellent nurses. I got my bachelors there, my son is going there, and I am returning for grad school. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for and they are very generous with their financial aid. Beautiful campus. Marymount takes good care of their students."
Junior,5,"Marymount has one of the best programme for interior design in Virginia. Professors are very professional and helpful. Since it is a close-knit community, you get to know professors and classmates well. However, I wish we have more events on campus."
Freshman,5,The campus is small but it is so nice.  The class sizes are small.  I love the closeness to the Washington DC.  I can see the capital building from my room.
Junior,5,"Marymount University is a great institution that provides their student with the best education, great professors and great college experience."
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience with Marymount was a result of COVID-19. Marymount responded to this extremely well and promptly. It is not easy to switch an in-class format to an online one, but all of my professors did so smoothly and were very cooperative, understanding, and communicative along the way."
Graduate Student,5,"The academics are superb and the professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Class sizes are small which allows for greater student participation. The building is very clean, in a safe area, and lead certified. There is a good amount of diversity and culture, and a lot of opportunities for student involvement in the school."
Sophomore,5,Marymount is an awesome school. Very diverse so everyone can experience how other people may go about doing daily activities.
Sophomore,5,The online transition was handled very well by the teaching staff. Constant updates were sent out via email and social media and professors made sure we passed our classes.
Senior,5,Amazing school With great diversity would be much better if we had more and better professors. Amazing campus newly built.
Sophomore,5,"I love Marymount University!  It is a small school with small classroom sizes, which works well for me.  The Professors are very helpful and want to see you succeed!  Great location and many of school activities to choose from.  I'm not sure why some complain about the food, I love it!"

Junior,5,"Better food experience, but overall my experience has been great. I have been seeing the school therapist with for my mental health and it has improved my school performance immensely."
Alum,5,"Marymount University is an exceptional institution of learning. My transfer experience from Northern Virginia Community College was seamless and I was amazed at how many credits transferred. The faculty and staff are beyond helpful. I learned so much both within my major and outside of it due to their expert guidance. Most importantly they strongly advocated on my behalf and helped me find a valuable internship.

Marymount's campus is pure eye candy, and the little touches like seasonal flowers help make it one of the most beautiful campuses in the area. The classrooms are also state of the art and feature the latest technologies.

Lastly, Marymount is a fun school to go to. The students are all very friendly and the school creates no shortage of activities to do with them"
Freshman,5,"Marymount University is a small, private university. The best part about Marymount is how all the staff, and students, treat you like a family member. Everyone knows who you are, and takes time and importance to your problems, whether it be, classes, a professor, work, course load, anything, Marymount staff will be there to help you."
Sophomore,5,"I really feel blessed to be part of this university. Even though it is expensive, I love that they care about their students and how they are doing which is rare in most colleges and universities."
Freshman,5,"Marymount University is a great school for education, student life, and athletics. However, things they can improve on is better campus food and housing. Overall, Marymount University is a nice private school where people get along nicely."
Sophomore,5,It is a great community that is very diverse. The school offers NCAA Division III sports and has a lot of student engagement. The school cares about the students a lot and you can tell by the way the faculty and staff interacts with the student body.
Graduate Student,5,I've had a great experience getting familiar with Marymount as a newly admitted students. Faculty and staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I was made to feel very comfortable and welcome.
Freshman,5,"Marymount is a school where there is always a new activity to try out and something new going on at the campus all the time. With the smaller campus and class sizes, you feel like a real close connection with everyone you see around the campus. Everyone is so friendly and it's been great."
Freshman,5,Marymount is very welcoming and a great environment to learn and grow in. I can't wait to start there in the fall!
Graduate Student,5,So far I have loved the people! The administration and professors have been extremely helpful throughout the admissions process.
Senior,5,"Attending Marymount University is one of the best choices I have made in my life. While tuition is slightly more expensive than other local colleges, the long term impression of graduating from Marymount University makes up for it. This school has a great reputation and I am happy to have attended."
Niche User,5,"Marymount University is very fast and efficient in assisting students, especially with financial aid. They take your concerns into immediate consideration and follow up with you as well to make sure everything is set."
Graduate Student,5,"Marymount University is in the heart of Arlington and has a great location. The Ballston campus for graduate students is a new, very nice facility with a library annex as well. The tuition is relatively expensive but the school provides a lot in terms of financial aid and grants."
Alum,5,Small class sizes and  great location for internship and job opportunities! One of my best decisions in life was to join the Marymount family!
Senior,5,"Small class sizes, personable professors, community feeling, dc proximity, and exciting athletics, what more could you ask for in a college?"
Alum,5,I thought it was a great school in a great location with a great staff. It was extremely diverse and I feel prepared me for the real world. It was in a nice area and I never didn't feel safe although it was ridiculously expensive for what it had  to offer. I don't feel that anything on the campus made it worth the price. I wish it offered better food places.
Sophomore,5,"Marymount is a private Catholic university that welcomes all religions and ethnicities. The school is small which encourages intimate class sizes and increased one one one student and teacher assistance. A very involved student body, participating in on- and off-campus service projects and initiatives."
Sophomore,5,The small campus gives me a chance to explore every part of it! The classes are small so the professors all know you by name and not a number. The food is absolutely delicious and everyone seems to be supportive and smiling all the time!
Senior,5,"At Marymount everyone is so helpful and kind, especially professors. I like the student- professor ratio because professors can easily focus on each student in their classes."
Junior,5,I like Marymount a lot! The professors and other faculty really care about their students. Everyone is really friendly and care about your experience at school. Classes are a nice size so you get to actually know your peers and professor. I like the student life activities and the school campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"Great professors, they are there to support and they care about their students. There is free tutoring and the staff is always there to help. The counseling department is great they helped me out when I started the first semester. The school is small but the diversity of culture create a viable learning environment. I highly recommend Marymount University."
Niche User,5,"Marymount is situated in a very safe neighborhood (North Arlington), right next to a historic country club. I find the academics to be on par with other top universities in the area as many of the professors who teach at Marymount also teach classes at other schools like GW and Georgetown. The local are offers many resources is you know how to work it. For instance, the school is affiliated with a lot of heavy hitters in the DC area which makes it quite easy to network your way to a job after graduation. Students who live on campus are tight knit, which gives Marymount a very pleasant small community feel. There is a slight party scene on campus- as in free beer and wine at campus events like homecoming, but in order to go crazy you have to go to Clarendon ($5 Uber ride) or DC ($10 Uber ride)."
Niche User,5,"It feels like home, teachers are nice, they have good sports teams (except not having a football team)."
Junior,5,"I love the small campus setting. I enjoy the one on one time allowed to each student. The small class setting allows me to fully understand the material. At larger Universities the student can often be forgotten about but Marymount does not allow that. The faculty and staff are very welcoming and willing to help in any way that they can. 
The only thing I would like to see improved are the facilities. Some of the buildings are starting to show their age. On another note, they have been updating the buildings and it looks as they are attempting to slowly get all of the buildings updated."
Sophomore,5,"I like that the school is smaller than most. The 13:1 student to teacher ratio is truly a gift. It allows the student to really connect with their professors and get the additional help when needed. Being at a smaller school gives the individual that ""at home community"" feel. I love it!"
Senior,5,"The professors at Marymount made my experience memorable and beneficial. The professors are very attentive and work hard to make sure they know all of their students well.  Also, they work hard to make sure their students are taken care of in and out of the classroom. For example, I have had multiple professors extend invitations to me and other students if we did not have anywhere to eat for Thanksgiving. Extra time after class for more help is always offered and they are always willing to go out of their way to make sure their students are comfortable and receiving more than the average help that they need."
Freshman,5,"This is my first semester in Marymount, but everyone is so friendly and the professors teach the course up to standards."
Freshman,5,What I really admire about Marymount University is how professors really put the effort in helping students obtain their ultimate goal. The support is phenomenal and I really appreciate their efforts.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Marymount University has been great so far. People at Marymount come from all around the world which creates an opportunity for everyone to learn more about someone else’s culture as well as respect others with different backgrounds. Everyone is helpful and extremely friends. Marymount gives everyone a sense of a second family. Classes are small which enables establishing a good relationship with profesors as well. I would not change anything if I had the opportunity because once you get to know everyone there, you feel like you have found your second home."
Sophomore,5,I'm a rising sophomore and my experience at Marymount for my first year was a variety of emotions. It was definitely a stressful year balancing out school and just transitioning from high school to college. Its an amazing school and I wouldn't want to go to any other university. The professors are very caring and want you to succeed. The environment on campus is super friendly and everyone is so nice and welcoming. Its a great environment especially for those who like to be in a small classroom setting and a small campus
Niche User,5,I will be attending Marymount University in Fall of 2017. I have visited the campus and have met some of the staff and faculty of Marymount. Marymount University also has a vast amount of departments for undergraduates and graduates. I had a wonderful experience hence the reason I applied and will be a student at Marymount University.
Sophomore,5,The professors are very friendly and willingly to work to help you excel. The student life is always active and there are so many things to do. The facilities are great however could be updated. However an amazing school with great academics and student body.
Freshman,5,"Marymount University has many professors that care for the student's education. I enjoy that each class only has up to 20 students max so students have the oppurtunity to be one on one with students. It allows the professor to keep a closer eye on their students. The university offers many oppurtunities that most colleges don't offer like the connections they have in the work field, most students are offered internships. There are also many clubs for students to get involved on campus which gives them practice towards their work ethics."
Freshman,5,Marymount university is a great school to go to if you want small teacher student ratios and help with your work. All of the professors are willing to go the extra mile and help you succeed. The location is great right by Washington DC. Great small school !!
Niche User,5,I really like the professors.  The class sizes are very small so you can easily get one on one help. You have to be accountable for classes as well which really help your gpa in the long run. Overall I really love this school #GoSaints
Freshman,5,So far it has been a great academic experience. The professors are at every students disposal because the school is so small. They are extremely helpful in everything we need help with. The faculty and staff are very kind and joyful people to be around. If anything needs changing it would probably need to be the commuter parking situation. There is a mass overflow of commuters and not enough parking spots available
College Student,5,I know many of students who have jobs on campus!
College Student,5,"All of my professors are interesting and helpful, they never deny a helping hand."
College Student,5,The safety is no joke here! They make you feel safe and secure no matter what!
College Student,5,"Everyone is treated nicely and even if you do not agree with your roommate or you want to change your room the option is there for you, they make you feel as comfortable as possible."
College Student,5,"I see the sports students working hard in the field and in the weight room, they are all so passionate and are great to watch!!"
College Student,5,Marymount University makes you feel welcome and at home. All the professors care about your success and are willing to help you with anything you may need.
College Junior,5,The academics that Marymount offers is very nice. It correlates with each of every students major. The registration process was very simple and easy.
College Junior,5,My experience of living on campus is amazing. The room is very spacious. I always socialize with my roommate.
College Freshman,5,Marymount University has a small and friendly environment. Since the school is full of diverse students it makes it a little easier to try make friends and fit in. The upperclassman that worked as the orientation leaders were kind and willing to help when it was needed.
College Freshman,5,"I think this school offers a lot for the students. The students at Marymount are friendly, and striving for the best in their field."
College Junior,5,"Marymount has been voted the most diverse school in the South. We have an extremely diverse student population coming from all different backgrounds, religions, ethnicities, and parts of the world. On campus, students are very accepting of these differences and regularly participate in international student activities such as International Club meetings, International Banquet, etc. There are always class discussions that encourage the topic of diversity and how we all differences in our cultures and beliefs. There is not as big of a variety of economic background, probably because our school is pretty expensive. However, it's not too hard to find other students that are different from this background because Marymount does offer a good amount of financial aid to students."
Junior,4,"Expensive, course offerings and availability aren’t always the best. Great partnership program allows you to take courses at other local institutions, but even if at the much less expensive community college, for the same cost as attending the home school directly."
Junior,4,"Expensive, course offerings and availability aren’t always the best. Great partnership program allows you to take courses at other local institutions, but even if at the much less expensive community college, for the same cost as attending the home school directly."
Junior,4,"Currently, I am taking hybrid courses during the covid period.
Professors are very helpful during online lecturers."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are extremely qualified and are easy to contact.  The business school has a new building and has the best technology available .
."
Junior,4,The online experience at Marymount University is great. The professors have transition in the class experience to virtual learning.
Niche User,4,"I personally did not take any classes online but I only put this rating since Niche told me to, this was my friend's review. She also went to MU but she actually did online classes and enjoyed them since she could go at her own pace more."
Alum,4,"Education wise, Marymount has a good student to teacher ratio with an array of classes due to being a liberal arts school. There needs to be more recognition of diversity among the campus and the faculty."
Junior,4,"I think that all around everyone adapted pretty well in the online learning experience. Most professors were understanding and given the circumstances the best they could be, unlike others who did not care. It was helpful during the transition to know that our professors were in the same boat and willing to help us and make sure we would succeed in this pandemic."
Junior,4,I overall like the school and the opportunities we have but I just feel that I got stuck in a situation where this is just too expensive for me to pay and there is no help
Freshman,4,"Like any school, marymount has its flaws, but it has great academics and great location, what more can you ask for?"
Sophomore,4,"Marymount is a community-driven school, as an Honors student, it is quite fulfilling how the staff and faculty are always trying to help you succeed. The scholarship opportunities could be better especially for international students."
Junior,4,I like the small class sizes so that education can be individualized. The professors really care about your success at Marymount and are able to give individualized attention. They are willing to help you through your college experience.
Sophomore,4,"My experience is pretty bland, besides the high cost of tuition the courses are fairly well managed and taught. The main issue is with how other students tend to take on everything too lightly."
Junior,4,You have the advantage of having tiny classroom which allows professors to give you their full attention
Freshman,4,I like that it is a small school so you get to know your teachers and the teachers get to know you. Since it is a smaller environment there is more opportunity for one-on-one learning.
Graduate Student,4,"Nothing.  Cost of Tuition and more scholarships.  Graduation assistant programs can be more robust as well.  Overall, the experience has been decent.  I have yet to take a course."
Sophomore,4,"While there is people in Marymount that are not willing to help the student. The majority of the faculty's priority is our well being. Teachers are so conscious of our mental and physical health, inside and outside of school. As an International student i have been welcomed into this beautiful community and i am so happy being here"
Senior,4,"Marymount is a small school that values intimate professional relationships. The campus is beautiful and you can see the monuments off of the Rowley deck. It is very close to DC and its an ideal spot for students who can live on campus and get to the city without problems, and safely on provided shuttles from main campus."
Freshman,4,"Marymount has challenged me to balance academics and athletics.  I like the small on campus feel.  There are additional campuses, so always a way to meet new people."
Sophomore,4,I love the small school feel. You get to know or recognize everyone from every class. Being close to DC is great for trips into the city with friends or for a new place for dinner! There is always something fun going on on campus for everyone.
Senior,4,"I love the size of MU. I love that I was able to create close connections with my professors and that each of them knew me by name, it held me really accountable and also made asking for help really easy."
Junior,4,I definitely think that Marymount was the right place for me. They are NCAA Division III so it's not too competitive but still really fun. The teachers are great and there are many opportunities for getting job or student worker positions that make it easy to earn money while at school. The dinning hall is just okay but there are other locations are campus with a range of other foods that make up for it. Plus the location is awesome! There's many fun things to do in the area for cheap!
Freshman,4,"If you like a small, intimate college experience, Marymount is the school for you. Best for Criminal Justice, Interior & Fashion Design, and Nursing- good for networking. You will get to know your professors well (great Philosophy dept.).  Standard freshman dorms are average, but upperclassmen apts. are nice. Dining done by Sodexo. GREAT wifi as of 2019. There is a mall close to Ballston center, many clubs and cafes accessible by metro. Most of the people who complain about MU have unrealistic expectations for what college should be like. Best experiences come to Athletes and Honors students. The staff, professors, and student leaders make a legitimate effort to make your time here good, and care about your well being. I love MU, despite it's quirks, and know it'll help me succeed."
Niche User,4,I Love the overall vibe of the school and i love their campus. From what i have learned from my visits they seem to have a very good business program and have a great reputation.
Freshman,4,Marymount has a small school life style if you’re into that then you’ll love it parties aren’t really all that people just go to the Howard or Mason parties if you want to have fun it’s really an acquired taste in terms of schools it’s quite on some weekends which is nice but it has its good and bad days just like regular college I enjoy it sometimes the people are friendly sometimes if you get to know the right people it’s not a really bad school just some things the university does isn’t on the best side of students
Junior,4,"Marymount University is a college that you can make your experience your very own. There are plenty of on-campus resources for all of your needs. This is a great place for anyone who loves to show their leadership or aspires to be a leader in any way. Faculty and Staff are amazing and love to have an impact on their students in many ways they can. Here you will not be another number for the school to have you will be an individual person; people will know you around campus by name! Yes, including your professors! I love MU Apply now and have an amazing Experience!"
Sophomore,4,"I’m a sophomore right now. I love Marymount! I’m really glad I picked this school. The professors are super nice and always there to help. There is free tutoring and there is always someone available to help you in your studies. The counseling department is nice and I recommend going if you’re struggling with anything. If you came to college to party, this one isn’t for you. The party scene and Greek life are basically nonexistent."
Niche User,4,"I liked Marymount and its close proximity to DC. I enjoyed the people and fun area. As far as the school, they need more scholarships that pertain to a wider range of students.They have a great mix of culture on campus but not enough scholarships to pertain to each. Also, i would have better events on campus. Follow suits to other schools. The events feel like high school! We need sororities. More relaxed dorm rules. Everything is uptight. We need a football team and to maybe buy a field out for it. I know Marymount could be so much more. But especially, better cafe food is needed!"
Sophomore,4,The Marymount experience is good. The classes are small and the teachers are always available for outside help. The school offers many activities for students to participate in every week.
Junior,4,What I like about it is how professors can be really helpful and have time to talk to you thats why i love being in a small school
Junior,4,"I love that it's a small school in a big city because you really get the chance to know a lot of people and have lots to do. The professors seem to love what they do and because D.C. is in its backyard, there are so many connections within the MU community to jobs in D.C. I commute from where I live, which is 30 miles away from school, and I still feel involved within the community. I also love the fact that it's such a diverse campus for how small it is. There are so many international students, so I feel like there's a lot to discover and learn, even just by talking to classmates. I'm so happy I made the choice to go to Marymount."
Niche User,4,"I visited the campus for basketball, but I must say that I was very pleased with how the rest of the campus was laid out. They have a very nice athletics center also."
Freshman,4,"What i like about Marymount University is that they are very different, they're organized, the environment is just peaceful and nice. The school isn't crazy nor hectic."
Freshman,4,"Marymount University is a very good college. The people treat like family, they well help you with anything you need. You will feel safe on campus don't have to worry about anything.  The professors there really take there take and teaching you the lesson and not just go fast and move on. If you need to stay after to have a meeting with professors they will let you know when would be the best time for you and him/her both."
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with Marymount has been okay. Its a great place for job seeking since D.C. is not so far away. The party scene is usually at the many sports houses nearby where people their tend to go wild and ballistic. the food is okay for its taste but not if you are trying to eat healthy.
Sophomore,4,Marymount is amazing. Small classes with small numbers of students which helps you to know your classmates and professors more in depth and also it let's your professors know you individually. That is an advantage because the less students in the class the more the professors focus on and also have time for one on one studies. The only thing that should be improved is mean plan.
Senior,4,The programs are very well designed and the faculty is eager to teach. I wish there had been more food options though.
Freshman,4,"Marymount University is a small school in Arlington, Va. It is a good place if you are looking for a decent government job and trying to focus on your studies."
Junior,4,"A Great school, the professors are extremely helpful and can cater your college experience to your personal needs! Although the dorms are a bit outdated, Marymount is doing construction and should be improving soon! Athletics is a great way to stay connected with your community here."
Junior,4,"Marymount is a great school if you arent looking for an extremely large campus , yet you still have that university feel. In terms of resources for your education  there is a lot available ."
Freshman,4,I'm currently a student and am so far loving my experience. The teachers are very friendly and help you to succeed. The diversity and over all size of the campus is great as well.
College Student,4,We don't really have one though.
College Senior,4,The free career and counseling center is there to help support students with various needs.
College Senior,4,"Marymount is a small and intimate school. The faculty members are passionate about the field that they teach, which further inspires the students to become fully emerged in the educational experience inside and outside the classroom. The campus is also well-kept."
College Junior,4,The nightlife at my school is pretty empty. There is not much around unless you are able to drive or have any type of transportation.
College Junior,4,Diversity at Marymount University is very nice. Everyone comes from a different ethnic or racial background and everyone is accepted.
College Junior,4,The career center is very helpful and they always help students find jobs that they are comfortable in.
College Junior,4,My experience at Marymount University has been great so far. Everyone is genuinely kind to each other. They accept everyone for who they are. The courses I chose relates to my major and the class sizes are very reasonable so each professor can have one on one time with each student.
College Freshman,4,So far my experience has been great. I've felt welcomed to the school and have felt comfortable.
College Junior,4,The safety and security on campus is very secure. I always feel safe walking around.
College Freshman,4,I feel pretty safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,The dorms for most freshmen are good. It doesn't take long to get to classes because they're close to my dorm.
College Junior,4,Marymount is a great school. Everyone is very helpful and kind. It's a small environment where it is great for me to find my classes.
College Freshman,4,The guard house is occupied 24/7 and is easy to get in touch with. Security officers take turns walking around campus every once in a while to make sure nothing suspicious is going on.
College Freshman,4,The classes are small. There are never usually more than 15 people in a class. There is a lot of one on one time available with your professors. There are interesting courses to take. Some of the courses here have been made up by the teachers so you won't find them on any other campus.
College Freshman,4,"You are required to have experience in an internship in order to graduate. There is a website called jobs4saints that has a bunch of local listings of internships, full time, and part time jobs which is really easy to navigate and filter to fit your needs"
College Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore, the school has met all of my expectations to date."
College Junior,4,"The academics at Marymount are challenging but manageable. The professors are passionate, engaging, and resourceful. The curriculum is well suited for each major but could be varied even more. The registration process is very easy and manageable. The academic advisors are not the best at helping with this process though. It is very common to have an advisor that knows nothing about your major and so it is up to you to make sure you are taking the required courses since the advisor often doesn't know how to help with it. The workload is challenging but it is just enough to feel as though you are getting the most out of your time and money. There are a lot of options for study areas including private study rooms, common areas, dining cafes, and the library. The computer labs are excellent and the study rooms in Rowley have monitors, HDMI cords, and lockable doors."
College Junior,4,"I have had a pretty great experience overall with courses and professors. The majority of my professors have been so passionate about what it is they're teaching and they strive to make the material exciting and engaging for students. Many of my classes have been discussion-centered to foster more interaction between students and between students and the professor. I wish that there was a larger variety of classes offered, sometimes it seems as though they stick with the expected classes for each subject rather than branching into some more unique class offerings. The class sizes, however, are great. Small class sizes of about 15-25 students really create a more valuable education. I have gotten so much more out of my education by being in a smaller class setting, able to have one-on-one time with the professor. They get to know each student by name and learn their story - something that is impossible to do in a large university. I have had a few experiences with unprofessional teachers, but overall the experience has been positive."
College Junior,4,"I personally have lived on campus for three years and plan to live on campus for my fourth as well. Factoring in the free laundry and cleaning services, common areas, access to study rooms and computer labs, and meal plan options, campus housing is a great deal. Ostapenko is a great option for those wanting an apartment feel without having to leave campus. Berg is probably the worst, but it is in a great location on campus. The housing process is a little stressful, but if you plan ahead and know what you want, it is usually easy to obtain. I have had a wonderful experience living in Rowley, Gerard, and now St. Joe's. All of them have been kept very clean, including the bathrooms. Currently, my living situation is great - bathroom has been completely renovated with all new fixtures and doors, my own controllable heating and air conditioning units, and a large desk and dresser. The RAs do a great job of encouraging students to participate in programs to get to know new people and create a welcoming, comfortable environment."
Niche User,2,"I attended MU from 2018-2019 and decided to leave since my parents were moving to Michigan and I just decided that it was not worth it at all to stay, unfortunately. It was hard to make friends. Since this school was small, cliques were a thing, which you would think would stay in high school. The food was terrible and so was the dorm life. They charged so much money for such small rooms. However, the professors were extremely nice and actually cared about my education."
Junior,2,"Marymount is basically a community college for the price of a private school. The school seems to accept anyone who will pay but once you're there they don't care about how you do as a student. Parking is notoriously difficult and instead of fixing the issue MU invests their money in the athletic facilities. 

There are some really great professors here which is a plus, but the majority of students don't really care about academics and several students act like they can just buy their grades. The outside of the Ballston campus is one big cloud of cigarette smoke which the school also doesn't seem to care about. I try to avoid coming to campus as much as possible because it's just not a pleasant place to be."
Freshman,2,"Very small school with urban/suburban surroundings. No college town, but easy to get around through Metro, the school shuttle, or Uber/Lyft. Food options could be greatly improved."
Sophomore,2,"Marymount University only made me realize I had to leave it. The students here still act as if they were in highschool, which makes sense since the campus is smaller than a high school. MU is always dead. People are extremely clicky and not open at all. The financial aid office is the ABSOLUTE WORSE! They will never help you whatsoever. And not only am I speaking for myself but for many of the students here. The food is revolting. Only 2 places to eat on campus; the dining hall and Bernies, which will make you sh*t every time you eat there. The only good thing I have to say is that since it is such a small school, it is easier to have a relationship with your professors. I was lucky to have 5 great professors in my time at MU but other than that, it really feels like you are in highschool. It won't prepare you for the real world. Save yourself and your parents the time and money. Community College is better than MU"
College Junior,2,"Parties are pretty lame at our school. It is usually the same crowd of people and they usually always get busted. The best parties take place on a day that people don't expect it because they're more spontaneous and don't get busted. There are always negative student interactions at parties and personally, I think that nightlife in the city is much more appealing."
College Junior,2,"Living on campus is very convenient, especially for the proximity to classes. However, living on campus tends to feel like boarding school, especially since it is a small school. Enforcement rules are very strict and the floor plans are very constricted, lacking privacy."
College Junior,2,I would not choose this school again if I could do it all over again mainly due to the lack of opportunities and activities for all students.
College Sophomore,2,"The general area is in close proximity to the Washington D.C area, thereby giving the students access to the party atmosphere in D.C"
College Sophomore,2,Dietary content of food is inadequate for the general development of the brain.
College Sophomore,2,The gym is outdated and does not have enough equipment to accommodate the growing athletic program.
College Sophomore,2,I currently live in the smallest dorm on campus and pay way to much for a shoe box
College Sophomore,2,"I received a $13000 when my GPA was a 3.4 now that my GPA will be 3.8 I've asked if they can increase, and they said they can't. I thought it was based on your GPA"
College Junior,2,My financial aid experience was better this year then last year.  Last year they were very rude and hardly offer any help or suggestions for my bill for school.
College Sophomore,2,"If you are looking for tailgates before football games or packed student sections at a basketball game you will be hard pressed to find that here, especially because we don't have a football team. Our gym is a basic mid-sized high school basketball court in which we usually seat more away fans than home fans during a game. As for the soccer, lacrosse, and baseball teams, I have no clue where they actually play seeing as we have no baseball field and our practice field is not regulation for collegiate games and can't hold more that 12 fans at a time. But if you are looking for that sports fans paradise there are 4 large schools easily accessible by metro with a great sports atmosphere including, George Mason, George Washington, Georgetown, and Howard University. If college sports aren't what you want don't worry because DC is home to the Nationals, Redskins, Wizards, Mystics, and Capitals so there is no shortage of sporting events in the area."
College Senior,2,hard to find any housing type (house/townhouse/apartments) that will rent to students and expensive.
College Senior,2,I wish there were more opportunities for nursing students.
Recent Alumnus,2,I was pretty much on my own as a grad student to find housing and/or the pries for grad housing was way overpriced.
College Junior,2,Housing is way too expensive which is why I commute to school
College Sophomore,2,We don't have good teams we're a division three school.
College Junior,2,"I don't personally live on-campus housing because its very expensive; $1,200 to share a room with someone else is a bit much."
College Senior,2,"The main campus has parking that is almost available, however the Business School has very limited parking. you can spend about one hour in line waiting for parking. the cost of the permits is average, about $70 per semester. Marymount, offers free shuttles every 15 minutes though. So if you have class in Ballston you could park your car in the Main Campus and take the shuttle (about 10 minutes ride). I've never gotten a ticket but I've seen cars getting towed for not having a permit."
College Junior,2,"Its difficult, i am still dealing with financial aid. "
College Junior,2,There is no Greek Life available on this campus. The Greek Life at Marymount depends on what club or sports team you are apart of.
College Junior,2,There really isn't a lot of financial aid available for working people.
College Junior,2,Most of our sports team aren't the best and our school spirit could be so much better.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office were not good with responding back quickly. Also, other than mail, they didn't try anything to reach you (they did not email me to inform me of my situation)."
College Senior,2,Academic strictness is not even real.  The middle eastern students are always cheating and hiring people to sit in the classes for them. Not fair and they never get in trouble!
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing tends to be very expensive because of the area the we are located in. There are a few off campus housing provided by Marymount, but they are reserved for the graduate school."
College Junior,2,"We don't have the facilities for a lot of our sports on campus. Women sports are much successful/popular, but we are adding more and more sports and trying to improve the facilities."
College Senior,2,"Marymount is a fairly small university, meaning we do not have as many students as you would say a state school may have. This of course means that ""everyone knows everyone"" is kind of the deal here. I would say there are many interesting people and lots of circle or friends ranging from sports teams to fashionistas in the fashion program at MU. College is what you make it so if you come here looking for a certain aspect, then chances are you will find it."
College Junior,2,With the financial aid department they toss you around a lot with how much you actually earned.
College Sophomore,2,"The registration process is pretty average, but the problem is getting the financial aid sorted out. For the upcoming semester I've gotten my billing statement with the wrong amount due! I've earned a scholarship through the school for academics, & they forgot to include it twice on my statement even though I've called in. The change of major process is also a bit complicated since getting all of the forms sorted out is a long tedious task. But workload, curriculum, & professors here are great. Yet to have a class I've hated!"
College Sophomore,2,"The restaurants near by are pretty good in variety, Starbucks, McD, Chipotle, and other student favorites. But without a car, they're hard to get to. Walking to them are inconvenient. The area doesn't really have other swanky or trendy restaurants. If that's what you want, you'll have to take a shuttle bus, walk to the Ballston metro center, then go off into the DC scene."
College Sophomore,2,There are a variety of restaurants near campus but the prices vary.
College Sophomore,2,"Marymount University is located in Arlington, VA, a small family oriented, upper middle class neighborhood. This area is close to the D.C area which is a big attraction to the students."
College Junior,2,"The only team that usually generates some kind of buzz is the Women's Basketball team. They are the best team on campus, and visits the NCAA tournament often. Unfortunately, they don't receive as much support as the Men's team, and they haven't had a winning season since before I began attending MU."
College Junior,2,We don't have greek life. We like to focus on clubs within the school. There are some DC area greeks that involve many different universities in the area.
College Student,2,"The parking at Marymount is very limited causing for on-campus freshman and sophmores to not be able to have cars on campus. Lots of commuters try to arrive early in order to get their desired parking spaces. But during busier hours, there have been some students who stated that they had to wait hours for parking. There are costs for parking which can be paid per semester or per year. Even though there are several different parking lots, the campus strongly encourages the students to use the free shuttle service that travels around and off campus."
College Sophomore,2,Sports aren't a big thing here... its a D III school . But I will say that they do try to get people to attend the games.. people just don't.
College Junior,2,"The campus is small so in order to have a nightlife you have to go off campus. If you have a car it is much easier to head to the nightlife located in the Ballston, Clarendon or Rosslyn areas of Arlington."
Alum,1,"I wish I could give marymount zero stars. It’s not a real college. It doesn’t deserve the title “university”. Don’t waste your time and $ at this sad excuse for a school. If you want to attend college and not feel like you’re stuck in high school, do NOT come to Marymount!! There are many, many things wrong with the school and the administration is not committed to improvement. During my 4 years I saw many things about campus life get worse and not better due to the decisions that were made, and through friends I know that it’s gotten worse since. Students are not valued at the school except to suck as much money from you as they can, and you do NOT get a good return on your investment. The ONLY good thing I have to say about the school is that the study abroad opportunities are amazing, affordable, and possible for students of all majors. But the amount of times I studied abroad while at MU was a testament to how much I hated being there. I repeat, DO NOT COME HERE!"
Senior,1,"I have been a student at Marymount University for several years now. I am what should be a graduating senior but have been prevented from graduating due to an internship. One that has now been taken THREE times. After receiving an email informing that payment was not on time when I have proof that it was and just being nonchalantly brushed to the side is not acceptable. I am outraged, angered and frustrated. Before this I thought Marymount would help my achieve my goals and provide me with a wonderful college experience but instead it is now replaced by these dreadful memories and hardship with trying to simply graduate. Rather than recommending my several nieces, nephews and cousins to this school I will now be steering them and anyone else I know away. Marymount has not been accommodating, understanding or helpful especially with the current climate we are faced with. It really saddens me to be going through something like this."
Junior,1,"Marymount is a terrible school and it hurts me that I wasted my time and so much money here. The staff are some of the most rude people you’ll ever meet and I can not stress this enough, you will get no help with anything here. All they care about it how much money they can squeeze from you and they will do that the best they can. Please save you time and money and do NOT come here."
Niche User,1,"I was only here for the summer, but thats all it took for me to realize how terrible this place is. The facilities are out dated, the food is atrocious (moldy, not cooked, and not many options).  Everyone stays in there room for the most part. The RA's are always annoyed to help you. This place is a disgrace. The only good thing is that it was close to the office."
Freshman,1,"I was a freshman at MU. I would wake up crying because of how much hated going here. It is a commuter school, if you're not an athlete there is a huge divide and you WILL NOTICE IT & u are constantly judged by your peers. People are very stuck up and rude. The food sucks, there is constantly rats in the cafe. After 8 pm on a weekday, there is nowhere to eat. The social scene is nonexistent & the little bit there is it's the same people in the sweaty basement & the cops ALWAYS come. I was actually told one day I could not go to a darty (the only one of the year) because I wasn't an athlete & the door shut in my face. The professors, you will know them all because the 3 full-time professors are teaching all your classes. There is no community, there is no school pride, this is high school. I became so depressed since attending Marymount THANK GOD I'm transferring. About 75% of the freshmen class drops out or transfers. The other half wishes they could. Go 2 community college than here."
Freshman,1,"Here at Marymount University there is a lot of racism that goes on that doesn't get addressed, and it's some of the faculty and workers. there are good resources here if I do say so myself, just be aware of the people you call your friends because they are sneaky and snakes"
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Senior,1,There is no Greek life.
College Freshman,1,The campus food is absolutely terrible.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few late night dining options besides Afghan Kabob House, which isn't that bad."
College Sophomore,1,Marymount is frequently compared to a jail or a high school. Sadly I think the neighboring high school students receive more freedom then we do.
College Sophomore,1,"There is usually nothing to do on weekends, I have strong socialization skills that Marymount is unable to fulfill."
College Sophomore,1,I know people who have stopped eating completely due to the horrible food.
College Junior,1,"Scholarships are only offered to incoming freshman and are very limited.  As a transfer, it seems quite unfair especially with the amount of tuition demanded."
College Sophomore,1,Our school doesn't offer off-campus housing for undergraduate students.
College Sophomore,1,Our off-campus dining is basically the same as everything on campus.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,This school is very expensive and they don't give out many scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,My school claims to be so diverse but they have more to learn about the meaning of diversity
College Sophomore,1,"I was a member of the women's lacrosse team and recruited to this school to play. Since last year, 12 players and an assistant coach have quit. The head coach is TERRIBLE and the athletics department seems to ignore all the poor coaching."

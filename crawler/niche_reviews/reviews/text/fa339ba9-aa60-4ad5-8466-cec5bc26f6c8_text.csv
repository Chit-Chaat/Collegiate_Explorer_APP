Alum,5,My experience at Georgia Southwestern State University was a fascinating one. My alma mater provided me with the fundamental skills and knowledge of Mathematics and Computational Science. Their Professors were well informative and assisted their students to the best of their abilities. They were encouraging and exhausted all avenues to ensure I was putting my best foot forward. This gave me confidence in my proficiency and enabled me to maintain a great GPA. This experience instilled courage in me to now pursue my Master's.
Junior,5,I’m currently taking 2 classes online. The professors are very attentive to the students. The video posts are helpful as they help guide us through the course work. Also they’re a group rooms that allow us work in groups online.
Junior,5,"The tuition is low and the attention from professors is not hard to get. From student accounts to professors, everyone is very informative & helpful. I feel like my advisor & I are best friends because she has been so helpful with every decision."
Freshman,5,"Honestly, I feel like I picked the right school for me. The teachers are very chill and understanding  they don’t have a lot of rules and also gives really good advice on college. The school itself has amazing staff very nice people. The work is not to much to deal with but of course really expensive. I love this school. I enjoy the environment and really hope I make it here."
Sophomore,5,I am a new transfer from out of state. The campus is very nice along with friendly students and faculty. The admissions office is very kind and try to help you to the best of their abilities. They respond quickly and answer any questions you may have. I felt very welcomed on campus since day one and it has been a great experience so far.
Sophomore,5,"Georgia Southwestern State University is a great school and is full of opportunities. The classes are just the right size for professors to utilize a one on one approach when needed. Although, the best part is knowing so many people on campus and having the ability to excel in all of your endeavors."
Sophomore,5,"The teachers at Georgia Southwestern value the time they spend with you in class and online. The online courses are set up to excel. There is no doubt that the teachers care about the student's education and always use a variety of teaching methods in online courses. In the end, the staff just wants to help you excel in your online course and learn as much as you can."
Junior,5,I enjoy my online classes at Georgia Southwestern. Professors interacted just as much with students as they would in a classroom. It’s very nice.
Junior,5,"I really like the closeness of the entire university and community of Americus, GA. Furthermore, the students and faculty have a very strong bond that is far different from those at large universities."
Freshman,5,"I’ve just completed my freshman year at Georgia Southwestern State University.
It has been an awesome experience and I’m so glad that I choose this school to spend the next four years of my life. It’s an great school and campus filled with great people, teachers, staff and residents. I would recommend this school to anyone deciding on an college."
Senior,5,"My experience at GSW is Excellent! The atmosphere is wonderful and everyone is so friendly. Staff and Professors are easy to locate and talk to when having trouble with an assignment or in class. The students are friendly as well, and everything is so close together. The sports are wonderful to watch in your free time on the weekends or even during the week. The president and the wife are lovely as well. My favorite experience at GSW is Waffles with the Weavers. This event takes place right before finals and the Weavers make waffles for the students at night, you can even win a free t-shirt if you show up early! Downtown is a fun place to explore and go out to eat after a long week!"
Senior,5,"I love the small town location of the school, and including the beautiful campus. The staff in all departments are willing to help students at all times."
Graduate Student,5,"Great online MBA program with flexibility and thoughtful staff. The class sizes are relatively small, and the professors see you as more than just a number in their class. They truly strive to connect with you despite being online and while challenging you, help you achieve your potential."
Freshman,5,"I am attending in the Fall of 2020. If you’re looking for a small school with a large family feel, this is the school for you."
Senior,5,I think that attending Georgia Southwestern State University is a good experience. I know that the professors are a little on the tough side but it is good for learning.
Freshman,5,I love how the campus is so friendly. People just walk up to you and speak. I don't feel endangered when I'm walking around. The teachers are very much so one on one. The dorms is always clean everyday. The food could be better in taste but it's not...nasty.
Freshman,5,"Georgia Southwestern State University is a very clean and beautiful school. In my experience so far, everyone is very welcoming. The professors show that they care about your education, but do more than just teach, they also form bonds with their students, which builds a feeling of trust and security in the school."
Junior,5,I love the school and the teachers are so wonderful! If you need help they are always there for you and willing to take time and help you.
Freshman,5,I loved everything about GSW! Everyone is really nice and they are willing to help you. I wouldn't change a thing about GSW.
Senior,5,GSW provided me with a very personal experience with professors that care about your future and want you to be as successful as you can be. The entire college community is so tight-knit that you feel like you become apart of a family when you attend.
Sophomore,5,"GSW is AMAZING!!! My freshman year was GREAT! The staff is always ready and willing to help you and if they don't have the answers for the help you need they go out of their way to get them. My sister graduated with a teaching degree and I am so happy I chose to follow her footsteps, all the way to GSW!!!"
Sophomore,5,I spent my first two semesters as an online student after transferring from a two year institution but my contact with the Georgia Southwestern State University staff from the admissions office to my advisor as well as teachers has been awesome. They are always available to talk to me about my concerns or anything that I needed help with.  I cannot say that about the college I transferred from.  I plan to earn my Bachelor of Science degree from Georgia Southwestern State University and then move on to acquire my Masters degree in Physician Assistant studies.
Niche User,5,"I love GSW. I have been attending through a dual enrollment program, and my experience has been nothing but positive. The professors are helpful, and the classes are small, so it is easy to form relationships with both classmates and professors."
Freshman,5,Georgia Southwestern State University is a great school! Their academic programs are excellent!!! I feel so safe on campus the entire time I'm there. The college is very diverse and the class size is great. The teacher-to-student ratio is good which allows me to have one-on-one teaching with the professors.
Freshman,5,"I have only been here a semester but everything is great. There are tutors here to help you get an A, ice cream in the cafeteria and it is easy to navigate around campus. Only Biology majors have class on Friday's, so we have a longer weekend and there are so many activities to do when you stay for the weekend!"
Niche User,5,My experience at Georgia Southwestern State University was AMAZING. The professors are very hands-on and really try to adjust to your personal learning level.
Niche User,5,I love the facilities and the staff and faculty are amazing.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Freshman,5,"The college is located in the rural part of GA. I attended the school for about 3 months. I LOVED IT ! The students , and teachers are friendly . They will make you feel at home. The only down side to the school. There isn't many activities for students on the weekends."
Freshman,5,My experince at GSW was the the most memorable college tour I've ever been on. It offers my choice of field of study to become a nurse . The campus is so beautiful and breath taking. The administrators actually take the time out of their day to make sure everything is up to par.
Sophomore,5,"GSW is a beautiful school with a personal feel. Every professor I've had has been great in their own right. They will always make time for you and will go above and beyond to get you the help you need. Americus is a small town, so you can practically live within a ten-minute radius of every store and the school."
Senior,5,This school has a good online program for Business majors. The teachers are really helpful. The  teachers provide video for students to watch . Testing are pretty decent.
College Freshman,5,The professors for a great help . The class styles good . Like the small class sizes .
College Freshman,5,Help you find a job.
College Freshman,5,School work very hard on the safety and security on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Great University! 

Enjoy studying at GSW!"
College Freshman,5,"We have a very supportive faculty on campus. You have plenty of places to go to get help, many study areas to study and the classes I need for my core classes were available when I needed them"
College Freshman,5,Campus safety/police do a great job at keeping the campus safe
College Freshman,5,A majority of my professors were very caring and helpful. If it wasn't for GSW being a smaller university it would have made communication between the professors and students more difficult
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is very new and exciting. It's a great experience and I think everyone should be able to have that experience. It's a great way to make friends and to get to know other people from different halls.
College Freshman,5,For some of the sports not many students attend because the games are during class but we've also had a fantastic student session for how small our school is. The faculty and students are very supportive and it seems like a majority of the students are involved on campus
College Freshman,5,I love that I had he opportunity to go to a university. It's an amazing school and it's not very big so you have more one on one time and it's easier to talk to professors and get to know the community
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy my school I wouldn't change anything
College Student,5,"The school gives you your freedom unless you violate it with loud noise,or drugs or alcohol."
College Student,5,The administrators were always willing to help.
College Student,5,The pizza and salad bar are the best.
College Student,5,"Out of all the college tours I have been on,Georgia Southwestern University is top notch.The dorms are so clean and I love how the rooms are private and you only share a bathroom with one person."
College Freshman,5,Since it is a small school you can get one on one help with your professor. 
College Junior,5,"I love my current program.  I am seeking a Bachelor's in Accounting, and I am taking all of my classes online.  The curriculum is amazing and challenging, which I love."
College Freshman,5,The campus police are real cool here. Georgia southwestern is a wet campus so if you are of age liquor in the dorms are allowed. As long as you are not acting a fool. They don't bother you at all.
College Freshman,5,Its never too hot or too cold here. Classes don't get cancelled because of the weather.
College Junior,5,It was very easy to get into the business management major program. The most important requirement is having a good GPA.
College Sophomore,5,When you don't have a computer of your own its hard to get work done when there are only five computers in the dorm that you live in.
College Junior,5,"$18 decal for parking, parking fills up sometimes and generally its pretty good."
College Senior,5,"I Don't Live on Campus – I do not live on campus but, there are not a lot of places to drink around the school. It is a quaint town."
College Junior,5,"Group Exercise – I love the Group Exercise classes at GSW.  I always attend Zumba classes.  It is taught by a certified instructor, and it is so upbeat! I always look forward to going to the Zumba classes each week, plus they are free to students. The group exercise makes it easy to get involved on campus."
College Sophomore,5,Transportation is available all the time it's schedule to run to all students in the school.
College Junior,5,Nice Size School With Small Class Sizes – I choose GSW because it has the best education program in South Georgia. The campus is small & the class sizes reminds me a lot of high school classes. The professors here really get to know the students individually & are available to answer all questions & majority are willing to give extra credit.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is do nice and happy to help you. Even random students on campus!
College Freshman,5,Extremely Safe – Campus safety is always on top of things! There are emergency call boxes all over campus.
College Freshman,5,With a random thunderstorm every now and then the campus is usually sunny and comfortable.
Alum,4,"For a student who did not adapt well to online learning, Georgia Southwestern State University made my online class experience well accessible and provided thorough information for my courses. Their library, study lounges and dorms were well equipped with computers and programs that would be used daily. They ensured that the students were able to succeed regardless of any hardship. The online professors always made themselves available and their responses were prompt."
Freshman,4,My classes are hybrid. I go to my classes one day out the week instead of two days out the week. I think it’s a good and bad idea. I’m a visual learning so I want to actually look at the teacher and follow what she/he is doing and I tend to stay focus easier. When classes online I zone out and just go about forgetting I have to look at my work online. The professors are doing a great job and keeping us focused in class and out. They send emails to remind us about assignments and try to keep us engaged. The professors are overall great. They look out for us with the best intentions possible trying to keep us in a positive mind state about the big adjustment we just made in life.
Sophomore,4,I love GSW and have wanted to attend since middle school. Americus is a small town but that is what I wanted.
Sophomore,4,"I am going too be an on campus student. But, before attending, the contact process online was very easy. Their online website is designed to help you easily navigate through it. A lot of helpful resources and links are available to help you get the best overall view of the school and what it is all about."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is a comfortable size. The classes are smaller than most colleges. They have many majors available.  The location of the school is convenient to shopping, food etc.  The school has a great basketball team.  They do not have a football team. The cafeteria food could be improved."
Sophomore,4,"I am so glad I chose Georgia Southwestern State University to be my school home. There are many people on campus who are very helpful with whatever needs to be done. Whenever someone needs help, there is always someone near to assist in any way they can. At Georgia Southwestern, I have always been given a chance to show how much I love my school. Whether it's attending the club events or whether it's just showing school spirit by buying items from the book store. The professors are always helping us grow into the adults they know we can be by molding us into responsible adults and I believe that kind of stability is needed for many students. The campus has many activities that help introverts get into, like the food trucks and just simple club activities like tie-dye for example. Georgia Southwestern State University is an amazing school and I cannot wait to continue my next two years there."
Sophomore,4,I like that it's cheaper than most other colleges and the classes are small so you get to know your professors.
Junior,4,"So far, I have enjoyed my experience as a mighty Hurricane. The campus is beautiful. The staff is nice and they help you with what you need to get enrolled and to be and effective student. I am glad I made this choice to attend."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience here is pretty good, the students here are friendly and the professors are so engaging. I love that the school offers free tutoring and that they're able to work around your schedule to get the help you need. Not to mention they inform the first  year students of practically everything, there's no need to worry this school supports you along the way and never hesitates to help."
Senior,4,I am a freshly transferred student at Georgia Southwestern State University. They have a time period where your application fee is free.
Senior,4,My learning experience at GSW has been great. The teachers are nice and engaged. You can tell that they truly care about you.
Freshman,4,"Georgia Southwestern University is a very spirited campus filled with lots of activities and resources that is very helpful to students. What i would like to see more of is diversity and student participation ,also more Greek life on campus."
Junior,4,"GSW is a great school filled with teachers who want to see you succeed (minus the standard few that couldn’t care less.) In the last 3 years I’ve grown to love the small campus and class sizes, along with the ability to know at least one person every time I walk into a new class. My only complaint is the parking situation, which is less than ideal for commuters and on occasion, residents as well."
Senior,4,Being at Georgia South has been such a great experience! All the professors are very helpful and seem to have your best interest when it comes to your education.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia Southwestern State University is a very great school. It very competitive in many ways and the school's standards pushes you to go beyond just passing your classes. Although it is a tough school, it really prepares you for the field that you are majoring in."
Freshman,4,"Georgia Southwestern State University is a nice family school. What i mean by that is, at this school the students feel at home away from home. Everyone is kind and the teachers truly care about the education for the students."
Freshman,4,"Through this first year, it has been hard but also easy. Some of the professors are understanding and love to teach and help students to get a degree. Some of the professors decide from day one that they teach and that's it, they reader there notes for that day and say go study. Overall the campus is friendly, peacefull, and affordable with the help of finacial aid."
Junior,4,My experience at thins school has been really good so far.  The teachers are nice and the tuutoing center is alwasy there for you for whenever you may need them. 
Alum,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at GSW. The professors are amazing, and the school is small enough that you are able to develop close and meaningful relationships with them. I feel that I grew and learned so much during my time there. There is not a lot to do on campus or in Americus, though. If you are looking for a good and affordable education, I would highly recommend GSW."
College Freshman,4,Do not hang out with other people much.
College Freshman,4,Have a good time a the games.
College Sophomore,4,"Georgia Southwestern is a great school with great staff. Some teachers are better than others, but that happens everywhere."
College Sophomore,4,Our school makes sure we are aware of sexual assault and what to do if we/someone we know is assaulted.
College Sophomore,4,I love living in Pines. I have loved having access to a full kitchen while still being in my dorm unlike in Oaks and Mag where the kitchen is shared for the whole building. But the buildings are overall pretty great.
College Sophomore,4,It is available for all students and allows us to get out and do something productive rather than just sitting in our dorms all day long.
College Freshman,4,The university does a great job making things available for students who aren't student athletes.
College Freshman,4,The new gymnasium and arena is the best i have seen!
Recent Alumnus,4,I liked the spacious upper class dorms
College Freshman,4,The school does a good job at supporting students and helping them reach their goals and making sure they graduate
College Sophomore,4,Campus police is on the ball and always on top of things.
College Sophomore,4,I personally have not gotten to that point in my schooling to where I have needed those specific places on campus but I have heard many good things about the student success center.
College Sophomore,4,I have gone to a few intramural games. They were interesting and I was able to meet a great deal of people.
College Junior,4,"Most of my courses have had wonderful professors, with engaging teaching styles that made me want to learn more about the course. However, I have had some professors that have been very hard to learn from, as they are often inconsistent or even outright hostile at times to their students. The variety of courses leaves much to be desired; the course rotation that is offered can at times be very difficult to navigate and make sure that the courses you're taking are what you need. The class sizes are usually pretty good, often with maximum 40 to a class, but sometimes as few as four students."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school. It is 4 hours away from where I live which means I cannot go home every weekend, but I am very involved on campus. I am in Kappa Delta Sorority, I am a Zephyr, I am a member of the exercise science and wellness club, and I work in the admissions building as a student intern. It is in the small town of Americus, but there is always something happening on the weekends and Albany is 30 minutes away. I wouldn't change a thing about my school."
College Freshman,4,"My professors are very easy going and treat students fairly, the cost of attendance is very affordable, faculty is very helpful, and the people are friendly. I have friends that complain about their professors, extreme debt and how hard it is making friends on campus. Relating to them is difficult in those aspects. My favorite experience was the first time I stepped on campus on orientation day. I got to explore the campus, interact with my class, and even get the latest scoops on campus events by current students who knew the school very well. I was offered some advice about prioritizing and working hard, so that I can play hard in the future. I continue to get advice from the leader figures that I met at my orientation."
College Freshman,4,Georgia Southwestern is great campus. It's size is great and makes it easier to meet people
College Freshman,4,"The freshmen dorms are located in a great place that's between the dining hall/ student center, and the library. Also, having the option to have a private room is a great plus as well. Every room offers a great view of the campus and has adequate spacing. The cost, even though it is expensive, is well worth the money for having a private room. Dorm life is very great since we have hall meetings almost every month and other various activities that are planned for us to get to know our neighbors. As long as you apply for housing early, the housing process is fairly easy. The only negative comment that I can make is that the maintenance takes quite a long time to be able to fix the various amenities in our dorm."
College Freshman,4,"Off-campus dining is great because we have easy access to several fast-food restaurants and various other ethnic cuisines. Also, being able to do downtown and eat at fancier restaurants is also a great benefit. The cost is reasonable however there is little to no student discounts."
College Freshman,4,"The school is highly responsive to our academic lives. Anytime you are in danger of failing a course, an email is sent. Also, every student has an advisor that sets up meetings for us to be able to discuss our study plans and for us to ask any questions. Also, the school has several events that are enforced by officers of the club that are hosing the event."
College Junior,4,The campus food is healthy and very good. They provide students with nutritious options.
College Sophomore,4,"Though there are only a couple options other than houses, it is worth living off campus. There is more parking options and freedom for those off campus however it can be pricey at times."
College Sophomore,4,The fraternity houses throw parties every once in a while and they are open to all students as long as you bring your id. Student Government also organizes tailgates for basketball games and homecoming week. All of these events are open to all students and are a blast.
College Sophomore,4,GSW dorms are so much nicer than the freshman dorms of most other schools. The environment is friendly and helpful and they are located close to classes.
College Freshman,4,"I received numerous scholarships from the college itself, the state, and outside independent scholarships. The process of my financial aid went smoothly with no trouble. They took care of everything without any worry."
College Freshman,4,It is typically very clean and has a very well social atmosphere with weekly group activities to participate in. The dorm rooms are really nice with adequate space and amenities.It is excellent housing to amend your needs and wants.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe, even walking around at night."
College Junior,4,Georgia Southwestern is a great school and you really feel like home there. I feel completely safe.
College Sophomore,4,There are no requirements except to have a 2.5 GPA or higher.
College Senior,4,It wasn't very difficult to get into the program
College Senior,4,I have not taken an internship. I work full time at an accounting office and go to school full time online through GSW
College Senior,4,The academics are pretty hard but that may be because everything is online that I take. The registration process is easy and the workload has been pretty heavy at times.
College Freshman,4,"I have to say ""strongly agree"" for most because there are such a wide variety of people."
College Freshman,4,"The academics at GSW are challenging, but if you work hard you can get the grade. I am proud I go to a school where you get the A if you work hard, at the end if each semester, I always feel more accomplished working hard for an A instead of getting an easy a"
College Freshman,4,"Since I commute I haven't had time to make it to any games, but the sports seem to be fairly successful and people enjoy going to games. They are encouraged by the staff and faculty and I really like that."
College Freshman,4,"The computer lab is very accessible and  organized. It is always quiet so students can get what they need done without being distracted. There are a god number of computers as well. I love going to the computer lab to do my work, being a commuter, it is very helpful to me."
College Freshman,4,There is off campus housing literally right outside of the perimeter that offer students low rates.
College Freshman,4,The small town keeps me focused and I have met great people. 
College Freshman,4,It depends on where you decide to stay. 
College Freshman,4,It generally stays warm. But when it rains it pours. 
College Junior,4,I would definitely do the same thing again.  I would advise my friends to do the same.  This school has been a great transition from high school to college.  From home to college.  It's been an easy move.  The Fraternity scene has been good for me.  It has helped me to become more out going.  Ive become more independant.  
Sophomore,2,I enjoyed the small classroom atmosphere of GSW. The professors showed that they really cared about my academics and many of them saw my potential to excel past GSW. I was able to be successful at GSW and maintain a 3.85 GPA which allowed me to transfer to UGA
College Freshman,2,Most students do not get a job pertaining to their major.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is reserved for the students who are well off.
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough classes that are required for the amount of people that go to school. Advisers are not there for you and do not do their job effectively.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I hate this place and really wish I had applied to more schools and looked at other options. It is as cliquey as high school, if not worse. It is not a well known school and half the people that go here are from here. There is not much of anything to do at all since its in the middle of no where. Dorms may be nice but housing staff in general is HORRIBLE."
College Freshman,2,they don't help you find an apartment unless you are an athlete
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are very loud. The RAs can't seem to keep the residents under control. Students aren't considerate of other student's peace.
College Sophomore,2,"Peer pressure is pretty severe here. If you don't become a part of the crowd, you are an outsider. It's pretty sad."
College Freshman,2,"Our town is tiny so there is not much ""nightlife."""
College Freshman,2,"Drug use is pretty widespread at my school, especially marijuana and alcohol. Policy enforcement is very strict, but it's relatively easy to get away with drug abuse on campus. "
College Freshman,2,"The computer labs are generally alright. They're relatively fast and efficient! However you only have ten dollars in print credits to use per semester, so it's probably better to buy a personal printer. The campus also has wireless everywhere, but it's very slow and often cuts out for no reason, especially in the freshman dorms."
College Junior,2,there is a little bit of everybody but some groups are bigger than others.
College Sophomore,2,The transportation is fair. Most of the time I just ask a friend if they can drive me to town. Since there really isn't any other transportation besides they one the school provides and specific time that may not necessarily be good for me.
College Sophomore,2,the computers can be a little out of date but they work fine. But there are newer computers in the library.
College Freshman,2,"The school maybe one of the most exciting places to be. Because we are located in a small town, there really isn't much to do, and if we want to do something fun, we will have to travel 30-45 mins to Albany and majority of the time we don't want to do that. However, because there is little to do, you end up making a lot of friends and at that point whatever you do together is a blast."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the apartments are great, some not so much. There are one or two that are always great, in walking range, and the owners are awesome. However, others are ore for partying (not my thing), and loud."
College Junior,2,"Given the right  occasion, you can have a great time. There's one club, a bar(connected to a hotel) and you can count on frats having parites. However I tranfered from a larger school in a larger city so this comes very low on my scale."
College Senior,2,"Not Much to Do – The town is friendly but, there is not much to do around town. It is more of a historic type of atmosphere."
College Sophomore,2,"Little to Do Off Campus – Has some fun places, but it's not the best location."
College Senior,2,"Just Barely Anything – The nightlife is tinkering on non-existent, with the exception of two local bars and the fraternity houses. We have to create our own fun times... which can make the fun even better sometimes."
College Junior,1,"If you get to school late, you will loose your place to park."
College Sophomore,1,There is not a variety of guys at GSW. Most of the guys are more interested in how many females they can sleep with and how may parties they can have or attend than having an education and what they want to do with themselves. Girl they are just like the guys. They don't care either except the few I hang with but other than that no ambition or goals for themselves and defiantly no self respect.
College Sophomore,1,The food was just not great. We had the same things day in and day out no change up in the food. Also some of the people who work there do not care and just give a slop. The food could be better with more options and changing up what is provided just as if you were at home.
College Freshman,1,Security is about pitiful. Keep doors locked. Nobody obeys rules.
College Senior,1,"Attendance Policy – The attendance policy for classes are strict.  If you miss more than two days, you will recieve a letter grade drop.  So, if you had an A and missed three days, you will automatically recieve a B letter grade.  If you miss more than three days, you get a failing grade.  Yes, if you miss more than three days, you will recieve an F letter grade.  There are no special circumstances."
College Freshman,1,It's Just Not Me – I have never seen myself at such a small school and staying at home just to save money was probably the worst experience and choice I have ever made.
College Freshman,1,"Go Greek or You're a Geek – There is absolutely no nightlife in Amricus, Georgia. The only time to have fun is when you are going to the Fraternity houses. However, if you are not Greek affiliated, be prepared to get glared at."
College Sophomore,1,The Town of Americus – Small town.  Many small family owned businesses.  No malls or attractions.  Some restaurants.
College Student,1,"Diversity on campus is ok, everyone pretty much mingles, but this is all that I have seen between freshmen. I went to a Frat party last semester and a few of my friends and I were looked down upon because me were black they didn't physically force us to leave, but they did things like turned the music off when we walked through the door and just stared at us. It was clear to me that we weren't wanted there. Also there was an event called flour wars given by a sorority, we were told not to come because we were black, even though this event was advertised to the entire school."
College Student,1,"Off Campus Activity – The college life off campus is very boring. My friend Kristen and I go off campus every weekend to look around town. There really isn't much to do. Everything closes around eight o' clock mainly and there are a few resturants that don't, being fast food."
College Sophomore,1,we don't have any public transportation but only a school shuttle which can only take you to limited places in limited time.
College Sophomore,1,Not at All – I would say this campus is not safe at all cuz everyone can get in and out the dorm really easy and my stuffs was stolen but no one cares
College Junior,1,"Poor Performance – we go to the game because, always because the oppoisite team is pretty famous. Pathetic"
College Junior,1,"It's Just Boring – Imagine you eat the same thing everyday and you have to stick with the meal plan, isnt it against humanity?"
College Student,1,Not to Good – I can say i really i am not in love with this school and im going to be transferring soon if you like small towns then this is a good school for you
College Student,1,"Not Much Available – The shuttle bus will take people to Albany once every now and then for free. Other than that, it is such a small place that no other transportation besides you own or your friends car is available."

Junior,5,"I transferred into Northwest University, coming from a school where I did not feel like I belonged. The community welcomed me here with open arms. Not once have I felt like people were critical of me or that I made a mistake in my decision to transfer. I am so thankful to be a student at this school!"
Alum,5,The professors were encouraging. They prayed with us every day and wanted to see us succeed beyond our academics.
Junior,5,"It has been great! I enjoy going here every day, worth standing in traffic every morning. A great place!"
Freshman,5,"Northwest University has an excellent online program that allows me to reach my academic goals from my home town. The curriculum structure is very organized, straightforward to comprehend, and has many tools that help me succeed. Specifically, their online library and access to an online tutor has helped me tremendously in my academic journey. The professors I have had have been accommodating, critical, and understanding in my first year of college, and I can't wait for the rest of my journey."
Sophomore,5,I really like Northwest University. It has a great campus and I am able to grow my faith and also go towards an excellent career and be able to have strategies to take my faith with me.
Freshman,5,"Northwest University  has great community! They really push that concept because they want everyone ,whether it be students or faculty, to feel like they belong at Northwest University."
Freshman,5,"I fell in love with this university university since the moment I visited its campus with my highschool class. A Christian environment along with a faith based curriculums is all I ever wanted to be a part of. My experience here has really changed me, it helped shape the way I look at the friends that I chose to hang out with, as well as the way I have always viewed the Bible. Northwest University really changed me for the better, and I will never regret making my choice to attend this university."
Freshman,5,"I attend Canvas School of Ministry, which is a partnership program with Northwest University. The administration is so incredibly helpful and meeting new people is so easy! The class schedule is perfect because I don't have to be there for too long which means I can work a bunch! The classes are super interactive because there is a smaller amount of students within those classes. The assignments are very interactive too which helps you get to know people more personally and build bigger and better relationships with those you learn with."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere and I felt like I was home! The campus is well taken care of and the is surrounded by beautiful Pacific Northwest.
Junior,5,Northwest University has a ton of great people and they're all on your side. All of the support staff are excellent and the teachers are knowledgeable.
Alum,5,"I love this school!  Great family atmosphere, with chapel every week.  Loved the professors, and the small class sizes."
Sophomore,5,"Almost every single person at Northwest University is friendly. I never thought I would be in this type of environment. On my first day at the campus in the Spring Semester, I walked up to a girl named Fiona and told her I was new and have no idea where anything is because I didn't go to my orientation. I was busy visiting my family with my dad. I also had to drop my dad to the airport at 3 am so I didn't attend my classes on the first day, either. I was jetlagged and did not get any rest that would help me stay awake and attentive in class. Fiona helped me with no hesitation and I was so afraid to even ask someone if they had time to help me find my way around. She was very nice and did not make me feel bad about the circumstances I was in."
Senior,5,"I have appreciated Northwest University's Adult Evening program due to its feasibility with my work schedule. In addition, the professors are excellent, and the integration of Christian perspective in classes is a plus to me."
Freshman,5,"In the one semester that I have been at Northwest University I have never felt more welcomed in such a new environment. All of the professors have such hearts and passions to teach their students and it shows through the high level of academics at Northwest. It truly feels like a community here, as there are so many fun activities to do and things to get involved in."
Alum,5,"I recieved my MBA from NU through their online program.  I have only visited the campus a few times.  It was an excellent program and has helped me in my career.  I am thankful for the overall experience.  R.Lockhart, graduated 2016"
Junior,5,"I love absolutely everything about Northwest University! I love my professors, the campus, the people, the events, the environment, and the clubs on campus. It feels like home to me and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else."
Senior,5,"Northwest University and the well-trained professors provide courses that challenge students to better themselves and prepare them for competitive careers. The professors provide excellent feedback on each assignment, making it simpler to know how to improve in your educational journey."
Junior,5,"Listen, nothing in life is perfect. We all know that. The trick is to focus on what makes whatever it is enjoyable. For me Northwest University does have some shortcomings and when I focus on them it distorts my view of what is otherwise a phenomenal school! I mean the food is great, the dorms are more than decent, the people are genuine, and the teachers are invested in their students. Yet when I scrutinise the tinniest things I forget all that. Needless to say everyone is different so maybe others have more problems with Northwest than I do. But even I (who is not attracted to “the college experience”) have loved my experience here at Northwest."
Junior,5,"What I like most about Northwest is the integration of faith into our studies. They help and encourage students to build a strong relationship with God, professors, and peers. Not only that, they also help you prepare for life after college by providing multiple experiences such as volunteering, and mission work. Northwest University is very focused on the student and helping them achieve their goals both inside and outside the classroom. The community on campus promotes a positive environment to help students grow into the individual they are meant to be. I would recommend this school students from all walks of life!"
Sophomore,5,Northwest is an amazing school and I have absolutely loved my time there. It is a very specific and unique school that will grow you throughout your time there.
Sophomore,5,"I am a fresh Transfer Student to Northwest, But I have had nothing but an excellent experience with them so Far. Everyone is so kind and accommodating. I am so happy I found this place, I know when I finish I will actually be sad to leave."
Junior,5,Northwest University is a school that takes it's students seriously. They are prepared and capable of equipping their students with everything they need to be successful. They also care personally about their students and make sure people are being emotionally and mentally cared for.
Freshman,5,"What I love about NU is that the culture is so unified. You truly build community that will last, and it's close community."
Freshman,5,"I am enrolled in the online church partnership program! It has been really amazing so far, and allowed me to earn credits while interning with a non-profit. I am happy to work in ministry while earning a degree!"
Niche User,5,"I have gotten lots of information about this school in the mail as well as email. During the summer of 2017 I visited the campus and the people and school itself was amazing. Any questions or issues I have, there are people at the school more than willing to help."
Junior,5,I am currently doing the online program and I absolutely love it. It is clearly structured and there is not any surprises or catches from class to class. Everything is fairly organized and the work I had done helps to prepare me for the real world because I have been able to apply the knowledge already.
Niche User,5,This is the best college ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Freshman,5,I loved the community Northwest creates among its students. The staff are always welcoming and willing to advise on any classes. Any events with sports or arts is a must to attend!
Freshman,5,"I love the Christian perspective in classes. I love how safe the campus feels; I can leave my bag in a common area for a few hours, and it is still there when I return!"
Sophomore,5,I love this school. The professors and other staff make you feel like you matter! They truly want to see there students succeed. I really enjoy the campus and the arie café as well. If you want to learn in a Christian based atmosphere this is the school for you!
Alum,5,"Great school with small class sizes and professors who take the time to get to know and work with individual students. Christ-centered campus life including chapel, ministry/outreach groups, and weekly nights of worship. Rigorous academics that challenge you and make you think outside of your own personal experience."
Freshman,5,"Northwest University is such a welcoming school filled with caring professors and uplifting students. Everyone attending Northwest can ensure that professors and workers are there to see them succeed. With that they willingly take time out of their busy schedules to meet with students. Northwest is what they say they are, a university that not only guide students towards a career but guide them to grow spiritually, something that is so unique to this university."
Freshman,5,Northwest University is an amazing place to attend college. The faculty all want you to succeed and are more often than not very willing to help you when needed. The community is great and it's really easy to make friends here!
College Sophomore,5,Northwest University is a wonderful school. Just registering for classes is a great experience! The staff was very helpful and patient with all of the new incoming students.
College Sophomore,5,"The security is very strict on campus. The security cars are always driving around campus, checking up on students and walking through buildings to make sure everything is in order."
College Freshman,5,The campus is very safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,Lese in financial aid and Chris Cowan my academic advisor are so through with me. They have explained the application and financial aid process in terms that I understand and have prepared me for what is next.
Recent Alumnus,5,I am going to be an online student so I won't be going to campus seeing or attending sports.
College Freshman,5,"24/7 security, right by police station, very safe community!"
College Sophomore,5,"After being on this campus for three semesters, I have never stepped on a campus where I've felt completely safe and secure. For example, I can leave my belongings on a table or wherever for a long period of time and come back without worrying someone will steal it. You hardly ever hear about any student getting drunk, high, or getting sexually assaulted. However, there are a few instances in the past theft had been an issue, but the president and heads of the school have done a great job addressing such problems and being firm about the consequences of such actions. I believe that staff and students hold each other accountable and do their best to follow the right conduct. In terms of health and safety, I am very proud to a student at Northwest University."
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus, and would not worry about walking anywhere alone, even at night."
College Freshman,5,I love it and would not change much. If anything I wish we had smaller Gen Ed classes such as Bio and Chem 101. But I understand why we do not.
College Freshman,5,"People love going to the football and basketball games and it is a big part of student life. The athletes are also very present on campus, and most people know at least one athlete personally."
College Freshman,5,"There is a perfect mix of studying, but also having fun. People love to stay in and study, and are always open to helping each other. At the same time people love going out and doing other non-school related things. In addition there are so many talented people at Northwestern. There is always a play, musical, or some sort of student activity going on."
College Sophomore,5,Classes can be challenging but the professors make it very possible to succeed and are generally very clear about what needs to be done to pass and get great grades. Every class I've taken is interesting and a great experience and I've been able to fit the material into my future life which makes it meaningful and worthwhile.
College Sophomore,5,"So far all my professors have been amazing. They are obviously very knowledgable and experienced in the subject they teach. They make class fun and interesting while providing all the necessary information. They are approachable and understanding when unfortunate life situations take place, willing to accommodate."
College Sophomore,5,"There are many things that are great about NU. It's a small school, so the classrooms are intimate and encourage discussion which is something you can't find at the larger universities. The sense of community at NU is amazing, and everyone (whether living off campus or not) is made to feel included and there are many chances to get involved. NU offers many experiences such as holiday festivities, improv, and a weekly worship service."
College Junior,5,I have loved being in school and I really enjoy the environment it provides.
College Junior,5,"My overall experience at Northwest so far is excellent. The professors want to see you succeed and are there to help you and answer questions. They aren't trying to trick you or prove they are smarter than you, which was an experience I had in undergrad (at a different school). Everyone is respectful to one another and the learning environment is fun and hands (or brains) on."
College Sophomore,5,From chains like Menchie's to small family run Sirena Gelato.  Kirkland is filled with wonderful food!
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of places in Kirkland and furthermore in Seattle, and all very different.  Some places will offer student discounts."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is great, especially due to the social atmosphere.  I have met so many incredible people and lifelong friends by living in the dorms."
College Freshman,5,A lot of my friend leave off campus but it is require that for your freshman and sophomore years to leave on Campus.
College Freshman,5,We have a lot of options to choose from.
College Freshman,5,I will say that I have the best professors in the world. They will pray with you if necessary and will help you make decision just like you were their own child.They actually care about you they want you to success and they want to see your dreams becoming true. However you have the responsibility to work hard.
College Freshman,5,The school offers a lot of scholarships to students.
College Freshman,5,"We don't have any parties because Northwest University is a Christian school. Therefore they don't allowed any dancing, drinking or any sexual activity on campus. However, we have the evening and Roomies where guys ask girls for a movie night and it is so much fun."
College Freshman,5,We actually don't have a lot of fruit in the cafeteria.
College Freshman,5,"Leaving on campus is the best because you can to make friends and being involve with a lot of activities. Most of the time the RA are amazing, people who love Jesus and will always will cheer you up."
College Sophomore,5,"You have so many options just within Kirkland, plus even more options if you are up for a quick drive to Bellevue or Seattle!"
Junior,4,"With the current restrictions from Covid-19, our classes have been in Hybrid structure. My teachers have been incredibly patient and flexible with all of the technical challenges. They have been understanding when zoom videos crash or assignments fail to upload. They have a determined attitude to help students be successful in their learning."
Freshman,4,"I only took my spring classes online due to COVID and they were just fine, thanks to zoom. The connection was always pretty great."
Alum,4,"I didn't take any classes online, but I've heard good things about their counseling and education programs that are online!"
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the university. The community and Christian culture has impacted my life so much! However it is very expensive and the school is not clear about their prices.
Senior,4,Great christian school that is welcoming to all students. Small one on one with the teachers and chapel service twice a week. Great people and like a small familiy.
Sophomore,4,"One of the things I like about Northwest is the location. Located in Kirkland Washington. Kirkland is very suburban, but still close enough to Seattle that it feels like the city Something that I wish was run differently is the on campus only option. You are required to live on campus unless you fit specific circumstances. As someone who is responsible and requires less community immersed living, I would have prefer to be able to move off campus. Another is the pricing of the school. The aid given definitely helps, but it has been a hindrance wondering if i'll even be able to afford to go here all four years. When it comes to the school aspect, I have really enjoyed my experience here. The classes are smaller and more intimate, and I really feel as though I am able to come to my professors for help, where as in a bigger class, I may feel differently. Every school has its pros and cons, and overall despite the issues I have with it, I have really enjoyed my time here at Northwest"
Freshman,4,I love the community and how welcoming the staff and current students are. I love the religious background NU has to offer.
Junior,4,"People there are a community. Making long-lasting relationships is better here than almost anywhere. However, because the school is smaller in size, the opportunities and majors offered here are limited. If you are looking to go into nursing or music, then this school has everything you could ever want and more, but some of the other majors like economics or accounting are so small, they practically do not exist. If you have some clear direction for your life, and are aware of the slightly high price tag, and are looking for a good experience that is has less of a party atmosphere, then this is the one for you."
Niche User,4,Very friendly and helpful and it has good education opportunities. The campus is beautiful and gives many opportunities for students.
Sophomore,4,The professors have a genuine investment in you as a person. They take time to care about you and help you when you need it. I got a concussion a month into my freshman year and all of my professors went out of their way to work with me to help me get caught up and understand the material when I got back. I also LOVE the campus. Res Life works hard to make the dorms a great experience. My RA cared about me and wrote me cute notes before some of my softball games to encourage me. SAB also works hard to make it a fun experience on campus with all the events they plan. They try to put on events that cater to everyone's interests. Campus Ministries works hard to make chapels and Pursuits amazing. The whole campus is centered around Christ and Northwest is a great school to grow in your faith.
Junior,4,"I like that its a christian university and I can share my beliefs with others. They give a lot of opportunities to grow in your faith and challenge you to grow in your faith. everyone in that university is friendly and like a family. It was always hard for me to balance school and church/faith, but in this university you are required to attend chapel, so it is easier to have that balance. Attending chapel and going to classes where you learn about the bible and faith, definitely makes it impossible for you to forget to set time apart for God. It makes it possible to have God in the center of your life. I also enjoy the prayer nights that the school has. The whole community is like a family because you know that they will be there to support you in prayer and be there to lift you up and encourage you when you need it the most. Being part of this community definitely takes a lot of stress away and makes the college life a lot easier."
Freshman,4,"Northwest University is small in overall size of student body, but the university works hard to create a welcoming community."
Freshman,4,I ama freshman at Northwest University. I decided to go there because of the atmosphere. Everyone is extremely friendly. I appreciate that I have the ability to talk with my teachers one-on-one. This has made testing easier because I understand the subjucts more.
Sophomore,4,"Northwest university is, in my experience, different from any other college in the nation. I know a lot of people say that about their school, and usually it isn't true. But I fully believe that, in the case of NU, it is absolutely a fact that this University is, in many ways, completely unique. The community on campus is like nothing I have ever experienced. The people I have met in the last eight months have become better friends and closer allies than anybody I had met in the eighteen years prior to my attendance to this college. Academically, socially, and spiritually,  Northwest University is in a league of its own."
Alum,4,"NU prides itself in a strong, interconnect community in student life - there is a very positive atmosphere amongst students. NU also provides its students with a holistic education that (I believe) has prepared me for my vocation. The College of Education has great professors which set me up for success in my field. Not only this but the majority of graduates have teaching jobs within a year of graduation. I personally don't fully agree with a liberal arts education at the collegiate level, but NU formats the degree programs in a way even my disbelieving mind could substantially benefit and grow. // Dorm/apt life is . The remodeled lounges are very nice. The opened-door mentality people naturally bring to the dorms offer a very warm community experience. // A great university. Highly recommended for a believer in Jesus who wants to grow academically and spiritually, while expanding their worldview, in order to impact and carry their specific calling into their vocation or field. "
College Senior,4,"It also depends on the degree that you are getting. Ministry, education, and nursing degrees are highly helpful."
College Senior,4,"It's a great school to get a positive, Christian experience."
College Senior,4,We have a free health center and I don't feel like there is much in the way of crime around this area.
College Senior,4,I really like it. You can talk to people freely and it is just a big community.
College Junior,4,I love my school because I received the one on one time I needed and I was always supported by the staff and students.
College Freshman,4,They really seem to care.
College Freshman,4,I'm really enjoying it so far.
College Senior,4,"The design of the courses is suitable for all kinds of students, including working professionals and parents. The classes are engaging and the teachers are very knowledgeable. So far the books and topics have been very engaging and relevant to the courses. I have been far more involved with my classes and discussions than in my years of undergraduate studies."
College Freshman,4,"I know nothing of the quality of the courses, classes,and professors. However, I am very aware of the extensive number of different courses offered."
College Freshman,4,"Northwestern University is well known and high sense of prestige and therefore, the alumni network is extensive and supporting and the connections created are very helpful for finding jobs and internships."
College Freshman,4,"On Campus living in dorms is very convenient and well down at Northwestern. Since the majority of students live in dorms, there is a wide selection of different dorms and communal styles of living available and they are very well put together."
College Freshman,4,"I dont know much about the athletics at our school since I dont have a particular interest in sports; however, I do know Northwestern has a passionate, supportive crowd since out sports teams are rather good."
College Freshman,4,"Though I have yet to experience the school firsthandedly, from stories from others and accounts online and my own  research, Northwestern University offers so many opportunities to truly expand my knowledge and pursue my interests. The location is also inviting and the culture of the city and like minded individuals makes my school unique."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses sound great! Taking a tour through Creatio Studios, it was clear that the professors for that program were passionate about their classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Northwest is great at helping students obtain internship opportunities and help them with their careers. In one of the programs, there was a 100 percent job placement in the last few years."
College Sophomore,4,The overall feel of safety and security on campus is good. I have never felt in danger of any kind of assault while on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere is great, students are given a common room where there is a seating are, fireplace, and a piano in just one of the buildings."
College Sophomore,4,Students are strongly encouraged to participate in extra curricular activities.
College Senior,4,"Since I live off-campus, I do not know much about the nighttime health, safety, and security of students."
College Senior,4,The process was very easy to understand and the admissions office was accessible if I had any questions. Very helpful.
College Senior,4,The sports at Northwest University are very popular and seem well-attended.
College Senior,4,The professors at Northwest University are definitely approachable and show genuine interest for their students. Their lectures are engaging and useful for real-world issues.
College Sophomore,4,Northwest University creates great opportunities for students to find a career. Especially those in the ministry field.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Northwest University. It's a great school where I am encouraged to express my religious beliefs every day. The professors are very hands-on and only wish to see their students succeed. The community of very students is very small and because of that, at times news gets around campus very easily which can be annoying and discouraging. Also, financially, this school is very very VERY expansive and Northwest University doesn't give out very many scholarships and the ones they do give out are not very big ($1,000-$5,000 scholarships for a $36,000 school)"
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of options for students careers after college.
College Freshman,4,I have yet to have a bad experience with a professor or a class.
College Freshman,4,I have had a very positive learning experience here. I have learned a lot and grown spiritually as well as academically.
College Freshman,4,"Depends on your major, but certain majors have a plethora of connections for students to receive job shadows and internships and even jobs."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like if you are going to spend the kind of money you do for Northwest, you need to live on campus. It gives you an opportunity to truly get connected and be in community. The housing isn't very nice but the amazing RAs and ACs make the experience great and worth it."
College Freshman,4,I'm in track. And everyday I am getting stronger.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, apart from the academics I have thoroughly enjoyed the people and the extracurricular activities that this school offers. This school is very faith driven and that is very well represented through their choir that I was fortunate to be a part of last year where we traveled to California for a couple of weeks during Spring Break. As a nursing major, there has been a lot to do and  and a lot of ups and downs getting things ready for the nursing program which has been currently a trying period in my life. I know that the hard work will be worth it in the end, it's important to just keep pushing through. What is really uplifting about Northwest is that since it is a small school, you engage with a range of different people who don't just care about the field that they study in but also the people around them. The great thing about the nursing program that is offered at the school is that even though each student is constantly in lab or lecture, when times get tough, each person does not have to get through it alone, but able to use our abilities to nurse each other on the right track and to hope for the best outcome and this is a prime example why I would choose my school again if I had the chance to do it all over again."
College Sophomore,4,All the degrees offered at NU are important and they make sure to emphasize that. Professors are good about relating class material to real life scenarios to emphasize the importance of the things they teach in students' future jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"First off, Kirkland is a very safe town in itself and NU has a great relationship with the local law enforcement. There are security officers on campus 24 hours a day more than willing to help in any situation they are needed. The doors to all the dorms have ample security so that only residents have access to enter. NU definitely takes security very seriously and most students feel a very strong sense of safety and security at NU."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the dorms on campus has been a great experience, much better than I imagined it would be. My RA is awesome, she is constantly organizing floor activities, study nights, and always there for us when we need someone. The roommate system at NU matches you to someone who fits your personality and living habits, obviously there are occasional roommate issues but for the most part everyone gets along great with them!"
College Sophomore,4,"There aren't a lot of different (varsity) sports, but the ones that are there are very supported and there is much school spirit regarding them. The sports offered are basketball, cross country, and soccer. There are many intramurals such as football which are also popular and many participate in them or go to events for support."
College Senior,4,"The first college I attended I didn't have a many complaints. I enjoyed my classes and the teachers were all very helpful. However I wanted to attend a more prestigious school that was in the same time zone as currently am. When I started attended my second college, I felt it better suited what I need. I'm glad I made the switch."
College Freshman,4,The professors are wonderful. They truly want to help you succeed.
College Junior,4,My school is a Christian university that is intentional about building a strong community of believers. Northwest University helps me to ask questions about my beliefs and challenge my faith in an environment where I have the resources to find the answers I need.
College Sophomore,4,All of the staff from the admissions to the financial department are very kind and helpful. They make you feel valued.
College Sophomore,4,"When a student decides to attend NU they know what they are signing up for, clearly told rules and such.  These are enforced, as they should be."
College Sophomore,4,The people in the office want to help you and they do.  Although for a lot of students it is a lot of work with multiple meetings to actual organize and figure out details.
College Freshman,4,"The strictness on campus is good and helps create a good atmosphere, I think.  There are very strict values and codes that must be regarded upon entering this school, especially about things like drinking, but a student should be prepared for that when applying."
College Freshman,4,"The people who work in financial aid are really good about getting students what they need and dealing with any problems.  But, I have had communication problems with them, which has caused some stress, but it got figured out in a timely manner.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and email/talk to someone in financial aid if you need help, because they will do their best."
College Senior,4,There is an average amount of restaurants in the area.
College Freshman,4,"i love the places around the city, toshis terriakye is the best"
College Junior,2,"Again, we are a small campus of a Christian school so there aren't any fraternities or sororities."
College Junior,2,My school is very small so there are not a lot of athletic activities
College Sophomore,2,I wish I would have applied to more colleges. Graduation day for me will be such a sigh of relief!
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus at Northwest University feels like living at summer camp. Although it's fun and exciting at first, it gets old really quick. Being on campus during the weekends can be boring and feels somewhat like detention. I wouldn't recommend living on campus to any of my friends."
College Sophomore,2,Not aware of any Greek Life at the Texas location
College Senior,2,I have never been to a party at this school or any other.
College Freshman,2,to be honest it isnt that good. It also is not the best quality
Recent Alumnus,2,I have not received the education I expected from this school
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have not been impressed with the classes offered, both in variety and how hard they are."
College Sophomore,2,"I think the school is way to strict on all their policies. During the school year, they accused someone of taking the toilet paper and outside visitation was cancelled."
College Sophomore,2,"The caf is not a very healthy place to eat. I would say it is hard to get the right nutrients as an athlete to stay up to par. I would like more fruit rather than just on ""Student Appreciation Day""."
College Junior,2,"It is Washington, need I say more?  If you love the cold and rain you will love it here.  The area is amazing though.  There is skiing, snow tubing, and other fun activities to do here."
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes there is good food, but for the most part it is mediocre at best. "
College Freshman,2,"The strictness here gets on my nerves.  Things like drinking are a serious offense, while simple things like R-rated movies are not allowed.  Even though there are rules like that, we all watch whatever we want, whether it's rated PG or R.  The visitation rules are way too strict and need to be revised.  "
College Junior,2,The ratio of guys to girls is three girls to one guy.  I know that a lot of the people that are going there are to be going to a Christian college and to get a good education from a Christian standpoint.
Recent Alumnus,2,I received a decent amount of financial aid. Although the late fees are astronomical and the numbers are tedious. It is important to speak to the financial aid office in person and to ask specific questions otherwise fees will go unnoticed or accumulate with out you being notified.
College Senior,2,"The variety of majors is somewhat limited because it is such a small school, and course selections can be somewhat limited as well, but if you find a program you're interested in it's very nice to have such a small cohort and class sizes."
College Freshman,2,Didn't get as much as I would have wanted. Lack of communication.
College Junior,2,"On campus, there is only the caf, which is a buffet breakfast lunch and dinner that is included  in the school tuition, there is the aerie, which is a coffee shop, but sells snacks as well. The caf isn't the best food, but it is better than most schools. The aerie is a great place to hang out and do homework"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Only 2 Options – There are only two options for food on campus, the Caf and the Aerie. The Aerie is the coffee shop. I never ate in the Caf cause I was off campus."
Freshman,1,"From the first day on campus, I felt out of place. This school is filled with very sheltered white students. Many of the professors push their personal opinions into their lessons. Not that discussing different viewpoints is bad, but when you’re only allowed one perspective, it’s impossible not to feel like a sheep in a herd. I am very passionate about intentional equality and justice and this school infuriates me to my core. Homosexuality is openly condemned in their lifestyle policy (which each on-campus resident has to sign). This school is not adhering to the truth that Christianity bears. If you’re not in a ministry team here, you don’t matter. If you miss a chapel credit at the end of the semester, you owe the school $25 PER missed chapel credit, up to $500. This school is an absolute joke. While I have had few professors that were wonderful, I have had way too many that have been negligent of the responsibilities of being a professor. Don’t give this school a dime."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have Greek Life here at Northwest University. This school is not diverse at all and is very stereotypical of non-white people. The majority of the campus is white, and of those white students 80% of them are very sheltered and have no knowledge of racial identity or ethnicity."
College Freshman,1,We do not have any greek life on our campus because of it being a private university.

College Sophomore,1,Not aware of any athletic department at the Texas location
Recent Alumnus,1,"From the beginning, things were disorganized.  I was enrolled in classes that I did not need to take.  Most of the teachers are reasonable, but some have personal vendettas against their students.  Many teachers were ill-prepared in their subject matter.  The Technology and Education teacher knew far less about the topic than I did.  Classes in the Adult division are far too rushed to actually learn anything of purpose.  They will lie on your grades, lie on your payments, and lie on your graduation requirements, all in an effort to extract more money.  They don't tell you up front that the adult teaching degree will be totally worthless unless you intend to take a year off work to get your Masters.  I would recommend any college above this one, especially if you are considering it to be Christian and would be devastated to here that it reflects no christian principles in their business practices."
Recent Alumnus,1,I did not get enough to pay for school and had to work multiple jobs which hurt my grades
Recent Alumnus,1,One of the most strict schools I know of
College Senior,1,this is a christian college so they frown upon drinking and clubbing

Sophomore,5,"I am a student in the computer science department, and my experience has been pretty positive so far. Since the department is quite small at Seton Hall, it provides a very tight knit community with very good relationships between students, faculty, and alumni. There are also many opportunities available to students. For example, in my freshman year I was able to become a research assistant and teaching assistant. The classes for computer science are very small, probably only reaching about 20 students, allowing a personal connection between professor and student."
Sophomore,5,Online learning while not preferred has been great. I feel that my Computer Science professors have done a great job of providing a great learning experience for their online classes.
Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore at Seton Hall University. I absolutely love the faculty in the Computer Science Department. Every professor that I have had has been excellent. The best part is the tutors for Computer Science. These tutors are amazing. They give new perspectives on how to approach difficult topics of programming that really work. Every day I feel my knowledge of programming growing exponentially and I know that this knowledge will help me be successful.
Junior,5,"The school has set up joint online and in-person classes, where students can take their courses from wherever they feel most comfortable. With help from the school, the professors are able to teach all students comfortably."
Junior,5,"Coming to Seton Hall was the best decision I could have made for my future. I have encountered amazing professors who have worked the exact jobs that I am striving for. They are all very enthusiastic about their field, and they strive to prepare their students for the workforce. Between the connections that professors offer and the opportunities provided by the career center, Seton Hall is one of the best schools for career preparation. In addition, most students I know have received very generous scholarship packages, so this school will not break the bank. I feel very at home at Seton Hall, and I'm proud to be a pirate!!! If you're reading this, I truly recommend putting in your application."
Senior,5,"I am a part of Seton Hall’s BSW program and have been blessed with career opportunities I wouldn’t have received elsewhere. Professor Mary Landriau found me an internship in my desired field of family therapy and I am learning such noteworthy material that will influence my success in the profession. Our program starts field experience in Junior year, something many schools wait on so we stand out from other students in other social work programs."
Works Here,5,"Seton Hall is great great place with different places to explore on campus, it is near lots of places to walk to and many things on campus that are open to students like basketball courts and a work out facility."
Works Here,5,"Seton Hall is great great place with different places to explore on campus, it is near lots of places to walk to and many things on campus that are open to students like basketball courts and a work out facility."
Sophomore,5,Love the academics and other kids that attend.  I also love how close it is to where I live since I commute. I firmly believe this school will have an excellent return on investment.
Junior,5,"Seton Hall is an amazing place to continue your education! They offer plenty of ways to be involved on and off campus, but most importantly they strive to not only ensure you have an education, but that you enjoy your college experience as well. Choosing Seton Hall was one of the best decisions I have made and I have been able to make many personal and professional connections on this campus! SHU will certainly challenge you, but the challenge will help you grow! I also think it’s important to note that even though SHU is a catholic college, it is not pushed onto the student body at all. Seton Hall is diverse, welcoming, and involved. Go Pirates!"
Senior,5,"During the pandemic, all classes were online and Seton Hall did a good job adjusting so quickly to the circumstances. It was a different kind of learning style, but with Microsoft Teams and Zoom, online learning was still effective."
Senior,5,"Choosing to attend Seton Hall University was one of the best decisions that I made. The academics are stellar and the professors are passionate about what they teach. Furthermore, the community is very welcoming and this place is a second home to me."
Senior,5,"There are many different computer programs that are offered to students. Further, since we are given a laptop for school it makes access to class easier as well."
Senior,5,I really enjoy how friendly everyone is there. It feels comfortable in that professors are easy to reach out to and willing to help in any way.
Graduate Student,5,Great new health professions campus with state of the art equipment to help with learning and a great staff and support system
Junior,5,"I'm currently a rising junior here at Seton Hall and choosing to attend is one of the best things I could have done for myself. It has truly given me the best college experience I could have asked for, in so many different ways. The academics go above and beyond I believe many other colleges can, really being able to gain a better experience in smaller classroom settings. My professors and advisors have never been anything but insightful and helpful, and I can not thank them enough for that. Seton Hall has also given me the opportunity to grow as a person both inside and outside of the classroom, and that experience has been truly unmatched."
Junior,5,"My online learning experience was amazing, really considering the circumstances of everything going on in the world during these present times. Professors continued to remain diligent and helpful, and many being very understanding of any issues that could have personally arisen in their students' lives. While I think any student would have preferred to have been in the classroom, Seton Hall and its professors really did an awesome job holding things together and making online classes as resourceful as they could."
Junior,5,"My experience at Seton Hall can be summed up with one word, home. Seton Hall has been a second home for me, surrounding me with tons of people that care about me and want me to succeed. The Hall gives every student the opportunity to become the best version of themselves and is a very welcoming environment."
Sophomore,5,"I can honestly say that choosing Seton Hall was the best thing for me, both academically and personally. The professors are very insightful in their lectures and are caring towards the student body, and their extensive knowledge has allowed me to learn aspects of my major in much more detail. Not only that, but the leadership experience I am receiving in beyond what I would get at any other institution due to the expertise of the amazing professors who are willing to get involved with us. The atmosphere at the school is very friendly and accepting, and I have felt nothing but welcomed by my peers and the surrounding community. Seton Hall isn't just another college, it's a place to learn and grow in both a  professional and individual sense, and I can't wait for the next couple of years!"
Freshman,5,Professors are always there to help whenever you need even online. There are plenty of resources that can be utilized to help.
Junior,5,"My online learning experience was far better than I had assumed it was going to be, especially considering the circumstances with Covid-19. Professors went above and beyond to make themselves available and to accommodate the syllabi to the new changes and student needs."
Junior,5,"I am a rising junior here at Seton Hall in the 3+3 Occupational Therapy program. This school has gone above and beyond for me in so many different ways, and in more ways than I ever could have imagined. The academic growth and opportunities my college, program and advisors offer me is unmatched, and the community at SHU is the most welcoming and kind group of people I have ever come across. Seton Hall has done so much for me and I can never thank them enough. This school is so exceptional, it has me excited about the fact I am taking on an extra two years of schooling. I absolutely cannot wait to be back in action and return in the fall. Go pirates!"
Sophomore,5,"Attending Seton Hall was one of the best decisions I have made! The community along with the networking opportunity is not comparable to any other university. I have been able to do research much earlier in my undergrad and gotten to know my professors better, allowing for me to learn more! Not to mention, going to basketball games is a great time!"
Sophomore,5,"Seton Hall has truly exceeded my expectations. As an in-state resident student, I felt like I had my independence while still being connected to home. The small class sizes made it easy to make friends, and I felt confident that I had a trusting relationship with my professors; the faculty truly care about each student's success. I am very happy with my time at Seton Hall thus far; the campus community is wonderful and I am proud to be part of it!"
Graduate Student,5,"Professors and classes online were great. The workload was perfect and didn't overwhelm you while taking other classes. Professor Pirog was incredible, highly recommend taking him."
Graduate Student,5,"As a recent grad of Seton Hall, my experience has been everything and more. Seton Hall truly became my second home. The small classes, tight-knit community feel, the proximity to NYC was just a few reasons of why I chose Seton Hall! There are so many ways to get involved on campus, and I definitely believe there is a club/organization for everyone to be a part of. Seton Hall also stands out with its alumni network and internship opportunities. I have had a few alumni mentorships and had an amazing internship that I was able to get through the career fair!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity within my university! Not only are there multiple people of color at this school, there's people of all different kinds of sexuality, religions, and ability there. The school is incredibly accommodating to each individual student and I feel really connected to the faculty and professors at this institution."
Freshman,5,"Seton Hall has an amazing student body, state of the art facilities, and professors who are truly engaged in the topics they teach."
Senior,5,"Professors were super accommodating and understanding; learning curve didn't slow at all, we kept up to date on coursework, and faculty was always available for help."
Senior,5,So grateful to the University for being actionable and supportive during covid; class size makes learning easy and the faculty are always eager to help. Always and forever my top choice :)
Senior,5,My professors made the virtual learning very simple and very easy to follow given the circumstances.
Senior,5,"Going to Seton Hall was the best decision I have ever made. The class size and personal attention I receive in class have made it such an incredible learning experience and have made the transfer process much simpler. Being from Florida, Seton Hall feels like home."
Senior,5,Seton Hall has become a second home for me in a way I couldn't have ever imagined! I am continuously blown away by how willing the community is in helping you achieve your goals. I've had professors invite me to conduct research with them and volunteer to write recommendations or serve as references. I've been able to study abroad twice thanks to my amazing advisors. I met my lifelong friends at Seton Hall and I feel very confident that I'm ready for life after graduation with this strong community in my corner.
Senior,5,"While I didn't take any online courses at Seton Hall, the switch to online platforms due to COVID-19 only reinforced the commitment of professors and advisors to their students."
Freshman,5,"I had a great online lectures .
An the professors online were amazing. I will recommend seton all to everybody"
Freshman,5,Seton hall university is a great school with an outstanding professors who are committed in impacting knowledge to students
Senior,5,I love seton hall because it provides a lot of opportunities with internships (found me 4 different internships!!). Seton Hall also has great professors who are extremely knowledgeable and helpful to their students!
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at Seton Hall University has been great unfortunately I have to pay 12,000$ per semester with my financial aid and that amount of money is way too much for my mother who doesn't receive any help. I really do like this college a lot and I wish to keep attending it however with the increasing amount of debt I am already faced with, it makes it harder and harder for both me and my mom everyday. I will do whatever it takes to get my education at Seton Hall University however I need as much help as I can get and I've tried to reach out to my school about help but I haven't had much luck in doing so hence why I am trying to apply for scholarships. I want an education very badly but it is hard for me and my mother at this time to do it on our own."
Sophomore,5,The opportunities available are unmatched and the school truly works to help the students thrive beyond college days.
Freshman,5,"At SHU there will be something (organizations, events, etc..) that will remind you that you are welcome in the pirate's family. You cannot be sad in this environment unless you decide to not get involved."
Sophomore,5,"Ive been a student at Seton Hall University for 2 years now and while there are many things that I would like to inform you of the main factor you must understand before committing here is how awful the housing system is. The University admits far more students than they can accommodate in housing and as a result many students are left with nowhere to live. The office of housing has even gone as far as advising students to move into a hotel nearby if their home is out of reach. Furthermore the university also heavily restricts parking permits so when you are forced to commute you will likely receive $50-$75 parking tickets. Why the university chooses not to build new housing? Thats unclear. This is not an issue at other universities and could explain why the student body is as depressed as they are. Lastly, the university is patrolled at night by Securitas workers who make students very uncomfortable and sometimes harass us when we are out on campus."
Freshman,5,"Seton Hall offers a warm , close knit environment  which is conducive to learning. The size of the school helps to make the students and faculty seem caring and similar to that of family . The feeling I felt as I walked through the campus left me feeling warm and as if I was home. I just know Seton Hall could be the start of a wonderful future for me."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and the community feel. Walking onto campus felt like home. The environment is inviting and everyone on campus has a high spirit. The students and staff that I talked to on campus were very helpful and knowledgeable.
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore here at Seton Hall, and have enjoyed my last two years here! One of the main aspects of the school that helped with my decision to come here is the school spirit. I love how everyone is always wearing Seton Hall attire, especially at the basketball games! I also love the size of the school. The basketball games give a big school feel, but with a small campus. The classes are a perfect size, making sure that every professor can get to know you and your strengths and weaknesses. I am really looking forward to the next two years here at Seton Hall!"
Sophomore,5,I love Seton Hall. I'm currently a sophomore and couldn't imagine being anywhere else. There is a sense of community and home when you're on campus. I love going to the basketball games and being surrounded by the high energy and sense of school pride! The small class atmosphere gives me the individualized attention you can't find out anywhere else. My professors know me by name and I'm not just another student. They truly care about the success of their students.
Niche User,5,"The campus was absolutely gorgeous. Even though the surrounding area is not as safe, the campus security is really tight and can be trusted often. The classrooms are just the right size also. They are not too big nor are they too small. I think they just need to renovate their dorms and make them cleaner."
Junior,5,"Seton Hall was my first choice for college and I am still glad with my decision to come here, three years later. I was quickly able to get involved on campus and pursue numerous academic opportunities that my advisors provided me with. Seton Hall is a very tight knit community, where I've made many lifelong friends. I feel like the connections I've formed with friends, professors, and advisors allow me to grow professionally. I am also highly satisfied with the diplomacy program and the intensity of that curriculum."
Senior,5,"I love Seton Hall University! Coming from such a small highschool town I was nervous that college life was going to be overwhelming for me. At Seton Hall this was not the case, the small campus provided a warm and friendly environment for me and I instantly fell in love with the university. My professors are the sweetest human being I have ever met, one professor even let me leave class temporarily to run to the cafeteria quickly because I was hungry and wanted a muffin. My favorite thing about Seton Hall university is how much pirate pride we show to our athletic teams, the games always have so much student attendance and everyone promotes such a fun and entertaining environment. I really enjoy the fact that although we are located in the suburbs we are only 14 miles outside of NYC! So many friends I know got internships in the city and I look forward to having an internship there as well! Overall Seton Hall has provided me with an AMAZING college experience."
Alum,5,I liked the ratio between students and professors. Small class size helped me stay engaged in class. More diversity and appreciation for the efforts of students of color who tried to make campus more inclusive would have helped my experience be better.
Graduate Student,5,I loved my undergrad at Seton Hall with the Psychology Department! The psych department is amazing and are so supportive in your academics and life.
Senior,5,"Seton Hall University has become home for me over the past few years. From the first day I stepped on the campus, I knew I was somewhere special. The campus is gorgeous and is beautiful to watch through the changing seasons. It is easy to be proud of SHU, and we have a lot of reasons to be. Not only academically (we are consistently rising in the rankings), but our participation in the Big East Conference, our close proximity to Manhattan, and our location in the beautiful village of South Orange, NJ. As a social work major and a student in general, I have access to some of the most wonderful professors I have met. Class sizes are small, so developing a professional relationship with your professor is possible and allows for great networking. Further, professors actually care about your performance and you as a person. As a transfer student, I know you don't get that at other schools. Seton Hall University is special. I encourage you to visit and see for yourself. You won't regret it!"
Junior,5,"I love Seton Hall University, it is easily one of the best choices I have ever made. I would highly recommend Seton Hall for any perspective college student (especially if they are a criminal justice major, like me.) The student/staff ratio is incredibly low; which is good for those who learn better in smaller class settings. I love the professors here, especially the criminal justice professors Their vast knowledge on the criminal justice system stems from their years of experience from working within said system. Overall, if you have the chance to come to Seton Hall, TAKE IT!!! Trust me, you will not regret it one bit."
Sophomore,5,"Great school, a really great community especially for out of state students. Since it is a small school, the professors are very helpful and really give you one-on-one attention. Another great aspect of Seton Hall is the fact that you can be involved in as many clubs or organizations as you want."
Junior,5,I have been at Seton Hall for three years and wouldn't trade my experience here for anything. The professors give you their full attention and really want to see their students succeed. I am excited for the rest of my time and look forward to the future after I graduate.
Freshman,5,Seton Hall is very welcoming and they seek to educate students on all resources on campus. The classes are well organized in which they have their schedules and homework assignments easily accessible online. The professors are also very reliable in regards to questions that students may have.
Sophomore,5,"Seton Hall University is a really great school that offers a lot to its students. They give students a lot of resources, especially in academics, and they always have different types of events on campus. They also have a lot of clubs and orgs on campus that there's everything for anyone. The caf could still be better, but they added so many cooking stations, so you can make your own food. Dorms don't allow tapestries or string lights, but it's just additional precautionary measures. Overall, I think that Seton Hall is a really good school, both academically and socially, that successfully prepares you for life after college, and truly supports their students so that they are able to succeed."
Junior,5,Seton Hall has given me everything I need to succeed in and after college. Academically all of my professors are supportive and helpful. Socially I always have something do whether it is going to an on campus or going into NYC for a concert I am never bored here. Going to Seton Hall was on of the best decisions I have ever made.
Sophomore,5,"Coming to Seton Hall is one of the best decision I have ever made. Coming into college, I was so worried about making the wrong decision, but Seton Hall is, without a doubt, the best choice I could have made for me. The community here is so welcoming and made it so easy for me to get involved from the moment I stepped foot on campus my freshman year, Every professor I have had here has known my name and has been willing to help me with whatever I need to succeed in the class, and there is always something to do.  As someone who grew up hundreds of miles from SHU and New Jersey, I can confidently say that I have found a home on this campus."
Freshman,5,"Seton Hall has a beautiful campus. The people who live on campus are very kind and they help you out as much as they can. They want to help you succeed at a school that costs a lot so doing well is important. The classes are hard but some of the teachers are very hard to understand. The food, however, is not the best. Overall, Seton Hall is still such a great school and I would never go back and change anything."
Alum,5,"As an international, Seton Hall was home away from home. Our campus was extremely diverse and very inclusive. There was always something fun to do to and new friends to make. The student board and international office did a great job with helping me settle in a new country by providing information about housing, obtaining a driver's license and important cultural differences. It was such a smooth transition moving from home because Seton Hall made it easy."
Sophomore,4,Seton Hall transitioned very smoothly from in person to online classes. Most professors were properly prepared for the new environment and adjusted their curriculum accordingly.
Junior,4,"As a history major I have been able to take a variety of courses with professors that truly care about the subject matter and the students, each one always being open to take time to go through material one-on-one and offer further help and discussion if needed. The courses I have taken have had a great emphasis on developing writing and research skills. Seton Hall's library has often been the main source of beginning my research and the resources/services provided through it are immensely helpful."
Junior,4,"Despite everything, the Seton Hall professors adapted to online learning very well. They are constantly keeping up with a students progress and are very understanding about the difficulties that may occur."
Junior,4,Seton Hall has wonderful professors and a beautiful campus. They provide real world experiences and have great resources put at your disposal. Their business school is one of the best. My only problem with Seton Hall is their administration. They have nearly no regard for their students and every year they raise tuition even during a global pandemic when many of their students were struggling. Otherwise it is an amazing university.
Senior,4,I was weary about online classes but my professors have utilized tools and techniques to make sure our classes are lively and active. They are very interactive and professors encourage for us to share our opinions in order to gain different perspectives and promote discussion.
Sophomore,4,"With the Covid19 crisis, we are at home taking our classes.  I like the ease of staying in my house and attending classes.  I do miss seeing my friends though and hope to eventually return to campus."
Junior,4,"SHU did the best they could at transitioning to online classes! Although it was unexpected, the online learning was sufficient enough to get through a semester. However, it certainly depends on the major and courses you are taking. STEM professors tried their best to accommodate us and make labs possibles, but classes such as philosophy were an easy transition!"
Sophomore,4,"After already completing my first year at Seton Hall University I can say that it was an interesting ride.  Being a commuter, the drive over time became less and less tiring (the drive for me was roughly 40min).  The first few weeks as a student were awkward since I stepped in to a new environment that is more open than high school ever was.  But a few weeks is all that is needed to get used to a college like Seton hall because of its size and how the overall school experience is.  From my schedule for both fall and spring, every one of my professors were great.  Each one super helpful and intelligent in their subject.  I don't usually look up teachers on rate my professor as the main important matter is to get a spot in the class you need.  Sometimes the ratings online don't justify how they really are.  I can't speak much about the food or dorm life as I am a commuter, but overall Seton Hall was a great choice for me.  I hope it is as well for whoever is reading this."
Sophomore,4,"I took a few classes online to end the spring semester and they were not as bad as I thought it would be.  Every class started at the time the professor set, and instruction was still good.  Of course having a class on campus has a whole different feel to it, but with the mandatory shift online due to Covid-19 it was not so bad."
Junior,4,"Online classes have been a very positive experience through the pandemic. With limited time, Seton Hall adjusted well utilizing Microsoft Teams on such short notice. Microsoft Teams has given the Seton Hall community an easy alternative to in class sessions and has been very beneficial when communicating with faculty and other students."
Sophomore,4,"Transitioning to an online setting was difficult at first, but after getting used to being back home I continued to make great strides in my academia. Most of the professors I had were willing to continue with lectures during the time periods in which in-person classes would take place, so I did not miss out on that person-to-person connection. It was harder to fully grasp the lab components of the classes I took for biology and chemistry, but the teaching assistants were able to help us through many of the issues I had concerning data or other related work. Overall, I definitely continued to learn while at home and if that were to be the case again, I know I would be able to handle it because of how well Seton Hall handled the situation."
Freshman,4,Seton Hall has provided me with challenging classes as well as leading me to some of my closest friends. The environment is so welcoming and has changed my view on life.
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience was a learning curve for everyone involved, but Seton Hall did a great job at transitioning to online and the professors were understanding of the difficulties involved. Overall, although online learning is not my preferred method, it is certainly manageable at SHU."
Graduate Student,4,It was my home away from home. Wanted to be at school with my friends more than I wanted to be home.
Sophomore,4,I love Seton Hall University.  My first year gave me a lot of great and learning experiences.  I am not the girl i was when i arrived on move in day.  Joining the Army ROTC program through the university was one of the best decisions I've made.  I have been given many opportunities to grow as a leader and student.  I became physically and mentally fit and knew i could always go to some one.  I have had some of the best professors and established a healthy business relationship with some.
Graduate Student,4,I took two online classes during my undergrad before going completely online during my last semester due to Covid-19. All of my professors clearly outlined assignments and adjusted the syllabus accordingly.
Freshman,4,"I did not take any classes online, however from the people I know the classes were generally very good online, but some professors were not accomodating with the Corona pandemic."
Senior,4,"This is a very great school. They have so many opportunities to really learn, participate, and get acclimated to their school. Class sizes are on the lower side. The only downside about this school is the price because it is so expensive."
Senior,4,Id say the school is known for its academics and its alumni post grad experiences. Otherwise as a college experience as a whole Id say it lacks being that the campus does become very dry.
Sophomore,4,Online classes are not as effective as in-person but Seton Hall did a good job with the transition when the pandemic started. It was so smooth that in a matter of a week students were back in the “classroom.”
Sophomore,4,"When it came down to finally choosing an university, it was the toughest decision I had to make as an 18-year-old. But now, as a rising sophmore at Seton Hall University, I can definitely say that I made the right choice. One of the things I love most about SHU is their curriculum. It is so diverse and flexible that even Biology majors can take a class on art. So far, the classes I’ve taken have been nurturing and fun. They have allowed me to explore new passions and even reconsider a different path. The professors are also very helpful, always willing to explain and lend a hand. Go pirates!"
Freshman,4,It  was  ok  as  I  had  no  choice  due  to the pandemic.  Some of  the  classes   ere  better  than  others  and  also  the experience
Freshman,4,I  have  been  there  for practically   a year   and  I have been happy   ths  far  w ith  the  instruction  provided  but in  the  pandemic th e instruction  varied.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love it. I do not regret choosing Seton Hall to further my education at all. Of course, there are times when it gets boring, but its what you make of it. All of my professors are kind and care for all their students. It is a very welcoming campus and one that I call home."
Sophomore,4,I missed the campus life when we had to return home to do online learning. The dorms are nice and felt safe.
Sophomore,4,The online learning took some getting used to. I prefer the interaction with students and professors in person. It was just hard getting used to looking at the computer all the time.
Freshman,4,I mainly enjoy that the classes are smaller hence making it easier to connect with my peers and professors and ensure that any areas of confusion are cleared up.
Freshman,4,My experience at Seton Hall University Has been a positive one.  The faculty care about their students and are always available.  The campus is the perfect size.  The negatives are the dining hall leaves something to be desired and there is nothing to do on campus on weekends.
Freshman,4,"Everything is great at Seton Hall University. The only issue that I had was that it was a little too expensive for my family and since I am a vegetarian, I got bored of the repetitive Cafeteria food very quickly. But they have great programs and mostly great professors."
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of opportunities and I enjoy almost all of my classes. The campus is small which is a personal preference of mine which allows me to get places easily. Additionally, the copious amounts of clubs always means there is something for people to do. However the dining services are not that great and on the weekends the campus is almost empty."
Sophomore,4,The campus is small but it makes it feel more like a second home everytime you're here. The people are amazing and the classes are very interesting
Junior,4,"Seton Hall is a great university who truly cares for it's students! I love my academic journey. The network is huge among this school and throughout the state. I have had plenty of opportunities with this university. The ability that I have obtained to gain knowledge, apply to other classes and life decisions and events has evolved tremendously throughout my time as a college student. This evolution can only get bigger and stronger."
Freshman,4,Security and some buildings need to be renovated. Dining hall food could be better. Faculty are nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,"One of my favorite things about Seton Hall University is its small campus. I have been able to get to each and everyone of my classes in less than 10 minutes, sometimes even just five minutes. In a small campus you do not have to be worried to walk outside in the cold because your destination is not all that far at all. If anything, a small campus such as Seton Hall's encourages students to explore and move about."
Sophomore,4,"Tuition is expensive, but it is a friendly environment and professors are very passionate about their jobs."
Sophomore,4,"Seton Hall is a great school. I recently found the best work place on campus in the Psychology department and all the Professors are very kind. Everyone certainly has different experiences, but I have many close friends through this school. I enjoy my time here and it is definitely outstanding because of the many opportunities available here."
Freshman,4,"Coming to Seton Hall University, I was very anxious about the transition to college after coming from a small Catholic high school and being very shy. I am happy to say that Seton Hall ended up being the perfect fit for me! It's a small school, with many opportunities to be involved and make friends if you  allow yourself. Campus Ministry made a huge impact on my friendships I have made here as well through the opportunities for community building and service. The dorms and food are average and most people do come home on the weekends like myself. The professors do care about you and want you to succeed here along with the various people your freshman year that are there to support you. Seton Hall is a great school that is rooted in Catholic identity, has a supportive community, and has great athletics! Recommend 100% :)"
Niche User,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful! Since I am Catholic, this University is the perfect fit for me! I have family in South Orange and they live like 15 minutes away from the campus, so I can easily come to campus."
Niche User,4,"When I went to seton hall for an open house, I had an amazing time! Even though it was a rainy day, all the students and staff really helped keep the energy high. I got a great inside look at what I would like to study as well as meet the professors and students."
Junior,4,"It's a beautiful campus, and you can very easily find your group off friends because there are many clubs and organizations on campus that would appeal to you. Food is alright, I don't dorm so no real opinion on that, but otherwise a good school to attend."
Freshman,4,"Seton Hall has an incredible amount of clubs and activities to get involved in. As well, it has an accessible way of creating a club for one's self. Academically, the Honors Program has its faults, but allows students to interact with a wide range of fascinating historic and philosophical texts."
Freshman,4,The campus is very beautiful and well kept. There offer a variety of courses that tend to be a small class size. Very good Speech Language Pathology program in New Jersey. The food could be more ethnically diverse.
Sophomore,4,"Seton Hall is a wonderful place for STEM majors. Although it is a very tough and rigorous program, your professors will be there to help you every step of the way if you reach out to them. It is a school with built-in support systems that really wants the best for their students, even if they don't get it quite right 100% of the time."
Senior,4,"I absolutely love the academic culture-- it is welcoming and positive. The professors are exceptionally caring, and resources such as the career center will keep you on track throughout your time here. I would like to see processes change within the financial aid office and registrar. Multiple times I have had scholarships taken away from me, not because of my academic standing, but because I ""no longer needed it"". Things like that are disheartening and discouraging. Multiple times I've had to fight to keep my earned scholarships. Another issue that has come up for me has been classes being dropped from my schedule without notifying me. Multiple times I've had to chase down people for signatures to prove to registrar I was in my classes. I would like to see things like that change."
Junior,4,"I love going to Seton Hall! I have made so many friends that I believe will be my friend for life. I feel like the professors care about all of us, and want us to succeed."
Sophomore,4,My experience in Seton Hall has been a good experience. The classes are challenging and the professors really do care and try to help. The food on campus is disgusting that is my biggest issue with the school.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Seton Hall has been very positive. I have felt at home on campus and have never had trouble when trying to make friends. One thing that I wish was better is the food, but there's no such thing as good cafeteria food."
Sophomore,4,"The environment in Seton Hall is very study-oriented yet relaxing. Seton Hall University some how balances the stress that comes with studying with a lot of events and activities for the students. The dorms are awesome with their lounges/vending machines. The ""Green"" is an awesome spot to chill and hangout with your freinds. One thing I really hate about the university is the food. Although there are variety of food options, it just tastes terrible at times. Also some of the professors are not that great, but all of them try to help you in the end in your academics."
Sophomore,4,"The University takes pride in its top level courses and professors and does a great job challenging and helping students to become the best versions of themselves. However, some of the utilities are outdated because the money goes towards building new buildings entirely or only renovating the new ones. However, the excellent education ones receives at the school tops the cafeteria and outdated buildings that most students study or live in."
Freshman,4,"Seton Hall University is a great college, because it is small and you get one one one with your professors. This college also helps your transfer from high school to college. They offer professors who have the job of answering any questions/worries that incoming freshman have (mentors)."
Sophomore,4,"As a commuter taking three buses to get to school, it was not the best experience in the beginning, but what Seton Hall offered me made up for the stress of the long commute. Seton Hall has numerous opportunities for every major and interest. The professors, at least the ones I had, are willing to answer all questions in and out of class. When not in class, students can always find something to do on campus. Seton Hall has plenty of events going on every single day and almost every event has free food."
Junior,4,"Overall, SHU is a decent school. Some of the things I like about it are the campus, the basketball team, the professors, the religious element, and its proximity to NYC. Things I would like to see changed include the cafeteria food, how easily people can enter the campus, the fact that Cabrini has no overhead lights, and the high price of tuition."
Senior,4,"I have liked most of my classes at Seton Hall. I have been challenged by my teachers in every class to not only learn the curriculum, but to also go outside the box and learn more through research opportunities. This school has given me the opportunities to follow my dreams in becoming an Athletic Trainer."
Junior,4,The classes are small and great for getting classmates and professors. Most people live in NJ so if you come from out of state it is a pretty boring campus. Greek life is fun but don't feel like you have to join just because that is what majority of people do.
Sophomore,4,This is an amazing school. I love that there is so many clubs to be involved in. my only thing is that they need to expand on there sports they should add lacrosse. When it comes to the food I think it's  ok.
Freshman,4,My experience at Seton Hall has been fantastic so far. I currently just finished up my freshmen year here and been exposed to so much. There are truly so many opportunities here at Seton Hall in terms of networking and getting to know many people. I am excited to finally be apart of the business school and look forwards to meeting many new people. The classes that I took for my freshmen year were extremely eye-opening and made me rethink many things about life. Other classes were very challenging and this ultimately made me a better student because of it. I highly recommend looking into Seton Hall University if you are a student who wants to get ahead in life and meet many new people as a result. I wouldn't change much because Seton Hall has everything and is heavily focused on changing the student who can add to society.
Sophomore,4,"I think Seton Hall University has done a great job in creating well-rounded, ethical students and agents of change in society. Beyond the classroom, Seton Hall wants to ensure that the practices learned are applied in real-world situations."
Sophomore,4,"Seton Hall has a beautiful and friendly campus! As a current student, the people and campus itself is so inviting and so full of excitement. The academics are great, having more difficult classes so that the teacher can help you and you learn how to become an even better student. I am so happy I came to SHU!"
Freshman,4,"The School of Diplomacy is a wonderful school and has great opportunities for its students, including summer programs at the UN and working closely with professors who are involved with the UN, NATO, and/or have worked closely with international governments and security. Seton Hall itself is average. You don't get much for your money. The upkeep for the grounds is beautiful, but the food is terrible and the insides of buildings are poorly kept. If you're here for anything except what Seton Hall excels in (International Relations, basketball, nursing, business) then you're either wasting your money, or showing you have money to burn. The university also prides itself in diversity, yet forces Catholicism down everyone's throats. Even though we are a religious university, you'd think they wouldn't force everyone to go to mass during orientation or force the Lent fast on everyone."
Freshman,4,Very welcoming and friendly. The perfect size and feels like home. A lot of school pride which makes the experience that much better.
Sophomore,2,This university is not clear about what is happening with online learning.  they need to work on being clear and direct with expectations.
Sophomore,2,Online learning was hard to adjust to but professors were considerate and tried their hardest to make the conversion easiest for everyone while still providing the education we paid for.  My issue is the 3% raise in tuition for this upcoming year. Many families have suffered and forcing some to pay 50K a year is unfair and no right for a university that claims to care so much about their student body.
Junior,2,"I like the small community for the most part and some of the professors who care about you. There are a fair share of instructors who are ridiculous and have a high opinion of themselves. The tuition is way too high. Bad college town as it's dangerous outside campus. Weekend life is nonexistent on campus. Dorms are nothing special--no kitchen or such, and there tends to be tons of maintenance problems. It is a Catholic University so it's expected to be integrated into courses, but I'll be d-mned if they couldn't be any more obvious with cramming it down your throat."
Senior,2,"These were supposed the be the “best four years of my life.” They couldn’t have been further from the truth. The food is criminal considering how much I’ve shelled out these last four years. When I came back from winter break, in the spoonful of rice that I had, more than half of it was uncooked. The culture is very “cliquey” and, based on my experience, is nothing more than an expensive extension of high school. As a senior who has excelled academically, I couldn’t be unhappier which is really disheartening given how excited I was four years ago and have tried to make do with the choice I made. I absolutely love the professors in my department, but that is as far as I will go. If I could go back 4 years, I would have seriously reconsidered SHU. If you’re interested in this place, think of the food, the culture, the surrounding area, the downright incompetence that is public safety. And don’t trust the robots in Admissions."
Freshman,2,"After completing my first semester at Seton hall  University I would like to say that this school is disgusting in the way they treat minorities. 45% of professors and students are beyond racist. This school is very old fashioned and is not moving towards the future. I was depressed everyday and no i did not stay on campus I lived 2 minutes away so being homesick or having freshman blues wasn't possibility.  I would rather go to Rutgers, Njit or even NJCU."
Senior,2,"There is so much to improve. Seton hall is expensive and they do not help students finding scholarships. There is a huge disconnection with minority students, if you are a minority this campus is not the best option. There has been many faults from the administration on responding on different issues such as mental health and misbehavior from faculty members. Overall, I feel like I could had gone to another university that was more diverse and accepting. Seton Hall is not the place for those that think out of the box."
Alum,2,"Go to the business school; easy degree and job (just apply yourself and you can land one through networking). 

For every 5 professors, 3 will encourage cheating. Everyone cheats. The academics of this school are pathetic. I see a room of 30 with 25 students cheating; who am I? Some high and mighty person to not cheat as well? No, you will cheat too. Anyone who can't get a min of 3.5 GPA is lazy. 

Professors aren't professors. They are weak professionals who have no care for the students. It's abysmal. 

Want an easy A and need a accounting/finance job after you finish? Go to Seton Hall. Get your internship Junior year or join the ""job club"" ALPHA and you will float along just fine. 

Everything else is sub-par. Housing is expensive; area is nice. It's NJ and I love the state so I don't fault anything there."
Sophomore,2,"Seton Hall University as a whole is viewed significantly more negative than positive by the majority of the students. The school borders the city of Newark on its east border and while the campus is gated around the perimeter, public safety and a private security company, Securitas, hired by the school make little to no effort to make sure those entering the campus are not dangerous. Securitas' only use in the last year has appeared to be writing an obscene amount of parking tickets. Furthermore, the school makes no efforts to work with students and their problems, to the extent of which there was a string of protests by a student group. Student life on campus is also close to nonexistent as the majority of students are commuters since dorming on campus comes with very little freedom and a great deal of supervision, treating the students more like young children than adults. The school also lacks nearly any accommodations for people with disabilities/handicap."
Sophomore,2,"I'm hesitant to give Seton Hall a poor rating but I think that is what it ultimately deserves. I think this school is a decent university but that's all it really is decent. Academically SHU ranges from great to poor, depending on what you take (I majored in diplomacy, which was stellar, and minored in environmental studies, which was insultingly bad). I think in terms of extracurriculars SHU struggles, in part due to its smaller size but the administration deserves a fair share of the blame as well, considering it doesn't do a lot to support clubs or programs. The local area is nice but boring (the saving grace with that though being its proximity to NYC). Ultimately, you have to try extra hard to make SHU work for you and even then the school fails to provide everything you might need to succeed and grow. And full disclosure I transferred out after two years because of how limiting the opportunities were here."
Freshman,2,"As a first-year student who will be transferring from Seton Hall, I didn't enjoy my time at the university. The campus itself is beautiful and cozy, but the actual housing is terrible. The campus food is limited and unappetizing. Also, the student life and clubs on campus are inactive because the majority of students are commuters and most kids who live on campus are close to home, so they go home causing the school to be empty on the weekends. It feels like you're in a 9 to 5 job and you're stuck there until the semester ends.  But some of the professors are amazing and genuinely help you in any way to succeed. Also, there is a pretty decent party scene if that's what you're looking for in your college experience. Overall, the cons outweigh the pros, and I advise you not to attend this university no matter how much of a financial aid package they give you, which everyone seems to receive."
College Sophomore,2,I hate the health center at Seton Hall. They should be on campus instead of across the street from the farthest side of campus and they also should be open 24/7 like other schools instead of closing at 5pm.
College Sophomore,2,"The amenities are for the most part very clean and accessible. The process to swipe in becomes ineffective during certain times of the day and you have to line up for a really long time in order to get in. Also, the inspections they sometimes make are extremely ineffective. Sneaking in illegal substances and alcohol is extremely easy which leads to those activities happening inside the dorm. Even though it is sometimes extremely obvious something like that is happening in a room without even entering, the RA's never go in and inspect or penalize those people. A lot of RA's are also extremely ineffective in resolving noise conflicts between rooms. Another problem is that the cost of the dorms is extremely high for the limited space that you get. Off-campus housing is a much better choice, especially if paying for college is a hassle."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of competition to get into the fraternities and sororities people want. They form their little cliques and if you don't belong to any of them, most people will down to you. Greek life forms a huge part of the school but it affects a lot, especially those who are uninterested in joining, since they will be out partying and making noise around campus late at night when they have events. A lot of alcohol and illegal substances are used during the parties which affects the rest of the residents when the attendees come back to campus. The parties are also extremely unsafe environments."
College Junior,2,I'm in a fraternity myself Alpha Chi Rho and there was not really much advertisement or events that grabbed the people in are school or the community to notice any of the fraternities or sororities.
College Junior,2,There are a lot of professors who do not care about their students and who are incapable of teaching their subject because they just do research for the school.  Class sizes are small unless they are large lectures that can be 100+ students.  Most of the classes listed in the course catalog is not offered because there isn't enough demand for it.
College Junior,2,"This year, there was not enough housing on or off campus so students were forced to live in Newark housing."
College Junior,2,"Within my three years here at Seton Hall, I am very dissatisfied with my experience.  This school is overpriced for what they have to offer.  There are many professors here that are incapable of teaching and they do not care about the success of their students because they do research for the school.  However, of course there are great professors here but I feel that the bad outweigh the good.  An advantage I see about Seton Hall, is that it is very close to New York City as the nightlife here is close to none.  Also, the surrounding area is not safe, where students have been robbed at gun point multiple times.  The Biology department is geared towards the Medical Field and if you are not planning on entering the medical field, advisers will be more than reluctant to help you.  Seton Hall is only worth going to if you are in a dual degree program and stay in it until you graduate.  Otherwise, save your money and time and go somewhere else.  You are also required to take religious classes where transferring out will be difficult unless you decide to transfer to another religious university."
College Junior,2,"Seton Hall University is too expensive for a school that is not even an ivy league school. They suck your money left and right. For finals they literally started charging their students in the library study rooms if they stayed too long. It's finals! We live in the library because final exams determine our GPA at the end of the semester. 

I wish I did go to a community college my first two years and then transfer. I highly regret going for all 4 years in Seton Hall."
College Freshman,2,Parties get shut down by the South Orange Police Department every time.
College Freshman,2,"First and foremost, the authorities treat commuters like they do not attend the university. Commuters face a great deal of stress when trying to enter the dorms. To get in, there must be a student resident in attendance to sign them in. This is relatively frustrating considering that commuters are just as important as students who dorm. Although i was a residing student, I would often have to wake up early to sign my commuting friends out. As I am a student who values sleep as much as my education, the act of waking up to sign out a commuter conflicted with my everyday schedule. Even though this wasn't an every day thing, things would be a whole lot easier if commuters were allowed to have more privileges; therefore, dorming is not the best choice for everyone."
College Senior,2,"If you're not in a community service frat or sorority, then it's pointless. They clique up and friendships could be broken over them. If you want to, go ahead, but make sure your org serves some sort of purpose rather than wearing jackets with letters on them."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of a party scene, especially for upper classmen. Most parties take place in Greek organizations or sports teams. There isn't a variety of local bars that are ""student friendly""."
College Senior,2,"Parties here suck in general. Small, cramped basements. They get busted by cops frequently. Host your own if you can. The kids here can't dance (dry-humping =/= dancing) and don't know how to socialize."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining Hall:

I purposely avoid eating meat unless it's in a dish I made myself because I'm terrified of getting food poisoning from all the under cooked chicken that I seen.  There are hardly any options for fruit, especially in the afternoon and evening. Hours during the week are too short.  The food on the salad bar is usually left out all day and it's pretty obvious because everything is wilting, browning, or dried out.  Dishes are frequently dirty despite being in the ""clean"" pile, and many of the cups are cracked so your beverage slowly seeps out onto the table during your meal.  Items are not restocked in a timely manner (out of ketchup and sweet and sour sauce for two weeks straight for example).  

Cove:

Cove pizza is delicious and I practically live off of it.  Staff is nice.  Wish it had more options though and wasn't so overpriced on take-away items (a cup of Jello should not cost $4 when you can buy a box for 79 cents).

Dunkin:

Staff is nice.  Usually either a long line or completely empty.  Food is just ok.

Commuter Caf:

Leafs and Grains is AWESOME!!! The staff there is great!

Pirate Express is way overpriced and needs to be restocked better."
College Freshman,2,"I get financial aid from my school, but not enough so I am still struggling with applying for outside loans/grants/scholarships. I also feel like the financial aid office is not at all helpful and basically just tells lower income students to figure it out for themselves or get out."
College Freshman,2,"Campus is pretty strict.  You really cannot have much fun without breaking the rules.  To get into a residence hall, you need to have your card swiped by a DA (desk assistant) and they have to make sure you are giving them your own card, the I.D. has to match your face, and then you may enter.  If you are a commuter, you have to be signed in.  If you don't live in that residence hall, after 12pm, you have to be signed in.  If the DA suspects you are intoxicated, they call the campus police.  RA's are always on top of you for noise violations.  They do not let you have freedom."
College Sophomore,2,"On the rare occasion that I actually win another scholarship, financial aid swoops in and takes something else away from me. It's completely ridiculous. And I'll also add that my scholarships have never exceeded my tuition bill and financial aid still tries to take money away from me."
College Sophomore,2,The food quality is honestly not the best.  They should look into making it better.
College Junior,2,Not much happens at SHU.
College Junior,2,The campus food is good for about a week. Then from there it gets very old very fast. Make a friend with a kitchen ass soon as you can!
College Junior,2,"The strictness and rule of life on campus are udnerstandable, but can really ruin the college fun and social experience."
College Freshman,2,Very limited and sometimes downsized by the University regardless of the lack of activities on weekend evenings.
College Junior,2,I would say that Greek life could be more respectable.
College Junior,2,I have tried to move off campus for two years in a row and none of the options outweigh the benefits of living on campus.
College Freshman,2,There are very limited options as to finding an off campus apartment.
College Freshman,2,"Security is so present because we live next to a dangerous city however, if you stay with a group of friends and take Safe Ride at night you will be safe. The school does care about your safety."
College Freshman,2,Live in Freshman aren't allowed to have cars which is extremely inconvenient. The food is terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Athletes have own private gym, the rest of the students crown into one facility."
College Sophomore,2,Bad frat parties at bad frat houses. thats it.
College Sophomore,2,Professors are generally unhelpful and terrible at teaching you anything.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not officially recognized by the school so all of the frats and sororities are all in large yet crappy off campus housing. All the guys are douches and all the girls are ugly and annoying.
College Sophomore,2,People get robbed all the time off campus in the morning and at night. Securitas (our security provider) is incompetent.
College Freshman,2,"The school of Diplomacy & the Business school are pretty good. Education and nursing is alright. Other than that, the school isn't really good for anything."
College Freshman,2,"It's okay, but don't expect to even get tipsy unless you pre-game with hard liquor. And traveling around South Orange at late hours of the night, isn't the best idea either."
College Freshman,2,"Since I am an EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) scholar, I receive extra funds which covers the university costs… But other students have a hard time looking for ways to pay their tuition. I know a lot of students who will not be able to return next semester due to $30,000 balances on their account that they have no way of paying. The payment plans are not sufficient, since most students have to find a way to pay $30,000 in just four payments. Then they start charging late fees, putting holds on your account, and they will not let you return next semester after Thanksgiving break if you still have a balance on your account. Loans will only cover about $10,000, then the rest you have to find on your own… Basically, unless you get a really good scholarship that can cover most of the cost, or unless you can literally pay $25,000 right out go your pocket, going to Seton Hall University will only leave you in dirt. Not to mention the cost of graduate school..."
College Freshman,2,"South Orange is pretty bad, but if you're smart and travel with people, you should be fine."
College Sophomore,2,On campus there is so much drinking.  People have no contact orders for sexual assault but the people they are taken out against dont seem to listen to them very well.  i am often scared to go out by myself at night.
College Sophomore,2,"The area in which Seton Hall is located is right next to the bad section o Newark.  We are constantly getting pirate Alerts about robberies at knife or gun point.  South Orange is a pretty town but the locals are not very friendly towards college students, thinking we are stuck up and rich, which the majority of us are not."
College Sophomore,2,The parties are in gross frats
College Sophomore,2,"Being a Catholic school, Seton Hall is fairly strict about which clubs can and can't form on campus if said clubs don't match with the Catholic mission. For example, our Amnesty International chapter will never be able to advocate for gay rights, and Seton Hall will not allow the LGBT club Allies to form or hardly come together as a group of individuals. I understand that there is a level of submission to this when agreeing to come to a Catholic school, but this is still a college campus and I believe all people should be allowed the resources and means to find themselves and demonstrate who they are."
College Sophomore,2,"Being that Seton Hall is a Catholic University, the strictness on signing in opposite genders overnight is the big concern for students. Whether its a boyfriend/girlfriend or good friend visiting, I believe this rule should be lifted to upperclassmen."
College Junior,2,Better than the food they give us
College Junior,2,Trying to receive scholarship money from seton hall is not very easy and it requires applying many times.
College Junior,2,"Security is not that excellent at school seeing as how during the day, anyone can drive on into the campus without having to go through security."
College Freshman,2,"Very windy under Xavier.  Other than that, it's not too bad."
College Junior,2,I don't receive much aid
College Junior,2,They are cracking down more and more every year.
College Freshman,2,it gets a little put pf hand
College Junior,2,The school does provide lap tops however the network and wifi are poor at best
College Freshman,2,"Because it is a catholic school, contraceptives are VERY hard to get a hold of on campus"
Alum,1,"I graduated from Seton Hall and never got a job that pays a living wage.  Their Career Center is pathetic.  It is run by students who have never had a career in their life and they are young and immature.  They give you the worst advice because of how young and immature they are.  I do not understand how students who have never had a career in their life are allowed to give advice to graduates about their career.  Most of the jobs that are listed in the Career Center are very entry-level positions and mostly teaching positions.  And trust me when I tell you they do not pay a living wage, especially for the cost of living in the Northeast.  The school has no connections with any businesses or with any government.   Seton Hall costs over $50,000 a year, which means you pay at least $200,000 for a Bachelor's degree and the school provides you with no job after graduating.  For that kind of money the school should be providing you with access to good paying jobs ($75,000 to start)."
Alum,1,"I did not take any online courses.   Therefore, I cannot comment on the online experience at Seton Hall University."
Graduate Student,1,Please do not go here. They are racists. Two of the staff members sent a racist email. They were suspended but wasn’t fired. They don’t care about the minorities. The black alumni had a sit in and was bum rushed by one of the professors. They only care about their image. So many hidden things about this school that you don’t know. They are greedy for your money. They are never there when you need them the most. The worst experience a person can have during their college years. It can cause a person to go into depression. A waste of your time.
Freshman,1,"Seton Hall University is an institution based on a so called ""Catholic Mission."" Whether The Mission is to help others or simply to discriminate is unsure. If one does not value others who differ in race, gender, sexuality, or religious affiliation then Seton Hall may be a comfortable cave for you."
Alum,1,"I cannot recommend going to Seton Hall.  I graduated from this school years ago and I never got an interview or job as a result of graduating from Seton Hall.  The school does not do anything to help you get a job and the career center is pathetic.  The career center is staffed mainly with students who have never had a real job in life and have no contacts to help you get a job.  The jobs they have listed are mainly entry-level low paying teaching jobs.  Don't believe me?  Ask to see the jobs they have listed in the career center and you'll see how awful the jobs are that they have listed.   And today the school costs more than $50,000 a year for tuition and room and board.  It does not make any financial sense to spend over $200,000 for a Bachelor's degree that only gets you a job making $35,000 or less.  You are way better off financially going to a state school and saving your money especially since there is no advantage to graduating from Seton Hall."
Freshman,1,"Very poor professors. It is like nothing compared to the way that it represents itself. It is a sinecure for faculty, They are bot here to help you. It is not worth the tuition. Think about it."
Sophomore,1,"Ive been a student at Seton Hall University for 2 years now and while there are many things that I would like to inform you of the main factor you must understand before committing here is how awful the housing system is. The University admits far more students than they can accommodate in housing and as a result many students are left with nowhere to live. The office of housing has even gone as far as advising students to move into a hotel nearby if their home is out of reach. Furthermore the university also heavily restricts parking permits so when you are forced to commute you will likely receive $50-$75 parking tickets. Why the university chooses not to build new housing? Thats unclear. This is not an issue at other universities and could explain why the student body is as depressed as they are. Lastly, the university is patrolled at night by Securitas workers who make students very uncomfortable and sometimes harass us when we are out on campus."
Junior,1,"Just like every University, Seton Hall has both pros and cons. Before I explain the cons I will honestly outline that a degree from Seton Hall is very useful and looked upon favorably by the professional community. If you apply yourself you will get a job and likely be happy with your placement. With that being said I need to be fully honest and urge you to closely consider your choice to attend Seton Hall given that most of its students are incredibly unhappy with the atmosphere they live in. The on campus housing is unfairly limited, there is very little to do on campus besides sit in the library or cafeteria, and events are rare. You will not get any college experience while you are here and will likely be unhappy with your decision. Please consider other schools."
Freshman,1,"0/10 do not recommend. We are princeton review's 7th least happy students. Food miserable, off campus is dangerous. Feels like a prison. I'm very social but this school kills all fun. DO NOT and i say DO NOT go there for your first 2 years, you will REGRET IT. VERY EXPENSIVE TOO.... GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE"
Freshman,1,Seton Hall is a place I do not enjoy going to. It has made me miserable for a year and I cannot wait to transfer. It is a school where people only interact with other people in their sorority or club. The doors are always closed and people don’t interact with others and I would never reccomend this school go other people.
Alum,1,"DO NOT GO TO SETON HALL!  I graduated from Seton Hall several years ago and it has done absolutely nothing to improve my circumstances in life.  I make the same kind of money that I would make with a high school diploma.  It now costs $50,000 a year (room, board and tuition) to attend this school and it is not worth what you pay for it.  The career center is a complete joke and has jobs you could find on your own on careerbuilder."
Niche User,1,The money you are paying is going directly in the pockets of the employees and not going to anything else. They are making buildings for admissions instead of more classrooms and dorm buildings and the desks in the academic buildings are literally falling apart. I encourage you to look elsewhere for the amout you will be paying
Junior,1,Terrible school. Faculty and administration show no support or care for their students. I urge you to get off these websites and go to the campus and walk up to a student and ask them how they really feel. Those finely written reviews you are reading are stemming directly from the admissions office and telling you exactly what you want to hear. The majority of Seton Hall students are fed up with the administration here and how much money we shell out to be treated so poorly.
Graduate Student,1,"Seton Hall is a sad excuse for a University.  All the school cares about is growing the student population to make more money, despite lack of resources, dorm space, classrooms, and parking to accommodate a large student body. Seton Hall values their sports teams over their nationally ranked graduate programs... just follow the money. The Physician Assistant program is a prime example. The 2nd year PA students are being KICKED OFF campus and relocated to the SHU Law Campus in Newark, NJ until October, because there is no classroom large enough to hold all 54 students. Students are forced to pay an additional $195 monthly to park at the law campus. One would think that a prestigious grad program would hold precedence over other majors/programs at this school; clearly not. Seton Hall conveys itself as a proud, Catholic University. It's time they reevaluate their priorities and start holding true to their proposed mission statement, vision, and values."
Graduate Student,1,"The students who work at the admissions office write the ""excellent"" reviews. If you want real, honest opinions, look at the reviews under the ""terrible"" category, especially pertaining to the Physician Assistant program and how awful they treat their students."
Graduate Student,1,"Parents: your children are seen as bags of money to these people at Seton Hall. No one cares if they have to relocate to Newark, NJ and experience the luxurious amenities of Newark for over 2 months. Whatever makes them the most money is the decision they will make.
Prospective Students: If you're looking at the Physician Assistant program at SHU, I invite you to go back to collegeboard.com and click on literally ANY OTHER SCHOOL. I'm 1000% sure that they will treat you better than they treat us. It's much more than academics, trust me."
Graduate Student,1,The Physician Assistant Program isn't all it's cracked up to be. The administration often forgets half of us exist (or just doesn't know how to count). They only have enough facilities to accommodate 30 students. Good thing there are 54 of us! There are plenty of other programs who treat their PA students like royalty and for half the price you pay here at Seton Hall...
Graduate Student,1,"The students who work at the admissions office are paid to write these ""excellent"" reviews. the Physician Assistant program has had to fight through the hardest four years of our lives only to end up with mediocre educational opportunities and terrible inconveniences. They don't even bother hiding how little thought and effort they put into their administrative decisions. This is our future career. This is no joke. They are really putting us at a disadvantage compared to other PA students across the country. You would think, for what we pay in tuition (and unsaid fees!) that we wouldn't be asked to bring in our own bananas when we learn how to suture, we wouldn't be relocated to the Seton Hall Law School campus in NEWARK because they couldn't find any other room, and we wouldn't need to fight for a white coat ceremony that works with our academic schedule."
Graduate Student,1,"Money hungry and inconsiderate. The PA students are treated like an inconvenience, but they will tell those who are applying that they are the pride of the school... read the other reviews about this rip off of a program."
Graduate Student,1,"Do not come here especially if you are interested in the Physician Assistant Program. This school is extremely money hungry and the student's needs, let alone conveniences, are an afterthought, if ever even considered at all. Our classes have been moved to the Seton Hall Law School campus in NEWARK!! The parking is TERRIBLE and unrealistic. We have to pay for our own CPR classes and we even had to bring in our own bananas to learn how to suture... Our white coat ceremony was moved to a few days BEFORE final exams so it's no longer seen as a celebratory event, but as something that takes away from our study time. Absolutely ridiculous. Not worth all the money. It really just all goes to the basketball team."
Graduate Student,1,"I am a second-year Physician Assistant student at Seton Hall University. Before I talk about my personal experience at SHU, I would just like to point out that the students who work in the admissions office on campus get paid to write these ""excellent"" reviews. I went to SHU for undergrad and I am in my 5th year of the PA program. SHU decided to accept twice the amount of students into the program. Those who applied outside of SHU were told that the program consisted of 30 students but showed up to 61 students. Our educational time was cut in half. Fast-forward a year, our classes have been relocated to the Seton Hall Law School in NEWARK, NJ. We are only allowed to park at certain times during the day and certain days per week. The parking that we do get is in Maplewood, NJ and we have to be shuttled from that lot to campus every day. We have to pay for our own CPR classes and even our own white coats that we EARN after a year and a half of HARD WORK."
Freshman,1,"I am currently a student attending Seton Hall University, and aside from it being a ""private"" catholic university, it is just like any other university. What I would change about this university is the amount of help they give you. They want nothing but your money just because it is a ""private"" school. They do not help you. There is no one on campus that would find it in themselves to help students in need. They prefer to give the students a run around instead. Personally I believe it is unfair because not everyone is financially stable enough to attend the university and it needs to change. Their lack of help honestly changed my perspective on this university being that I truly loved everything about Seton Hall."
College Freshman,1,"Dorming experience has been awful. The heat was turned on October 15th and my room has been 80+ degrees every day since then. Windows are always open, which hasnt even helped. Housing has been contacted and they told me to spend my time other places where it is cooler, but they neglect the fact that my roommate and I are losing sleep due to the overbearing heat in the room. Do not attend this school if you dont want to lose 5 pounds sweating everynight"
College Freshman,1,"Campus security has a tendency to make students feel as if they do not belong to the university. If a student makes a mistake, authorities treat them like convicted criminals and use interrogation tactics to get information; which is not protocol."
College Freshman,1,"Campus food lacks variety. The food in the dining hall starts to get old after awhile; and throughout the year, the food starts to get progressively worse."
College Student,1,"The food isn't even real food really, everything taste like plastic and there's no options."
College Senior,1,Yeah everything pretty much sucks. You can't go wrong with donuts and muffins from Dunkin but the coffee is pretty gross.
College Sophomore,1,I have gone through the worst and most stressful experience with financial aid. I had grants and financial aids going in and they said they needed a form and I would be given them. Well when the form went through  I lost all of the financial aid I had and immediately had to start taking out loans. They have been uncooperative in any more scholarships despite the amount of work I do around campus.
College Sophomore,1,"As a commuter whose friends all live in dorms, Seton Hall treats me and other commuters like criminals. You have to be out by a certain time or else both you and the host get a violation. I absolutely hate it. Also you can't have a member of the opposite sex sign you in over night because this is a Catholic University. But people do it anyway by just getting a friend of the same sex to sign them in."
College Sophomore,1,In the cafeteria they mix random food items together in order to cut back costs. They put mayonnaise in everything at the salad bar. There are never any spatulas ready when you need them. The only edible thing there is the french fries and sometimes they even mess those up. That's why I dropped my commuter plan this semester. It wasn't worth the money and the food made me sick!
College Junior,1,Move off campus as soon as you can.
College Junior,1,I disagree with peer pressure to go to parties. 8)
College Freshman,1,"I am so sick of the food on campus, I am going broke ordering out. I rather starve."
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus is worthless. Firstly, it is nearly $7,000 for room and board. Most of the buildings are nice, but the meal plan is most certainly not worth $2,000. The dormitories are not that big to begin with, and some are weirdly set up, so the rooms will not always be evenly divided. They take their fire safety regulations EXTREMELY serious. I know a student who got a violation for bringing a lamp that was not in code… We are only allowed to cover 20% of our walls with decorations, and they must be at least 2 feet away from the ceiling… If that is not enough for you, the guest policy is a hassle! The make signing people in, whether it be a friend or a family member, really difficult. I wanted to sign my brother in one night so that he could sleepover and spend the night, and because he was a boy (and this is catholic university), they said unless I could find a male host, he could not stay overnight… HE WAS MY BROTHER, and they would not allow me to sign him in because I am a girl, and they do not allow students to sign people in overnight if they are of the opposite sex. What students usually do is find a male to sign them in, but then that student has to literally be with your guest all the time if you want to do anything or go anywhere. It's really inconvenient. Lastly, HRL (housing and residence life) is run by administrators who take the rules way too seriously. I understand that they want to make the living environment right for every student, but they really will not take it easy on students who get in trouble. They do not understand that we are freshmen, and we make mistakes. They are extremely harsh on students, and do not care about your living situation. I plan on transferring really soon, because commuting is not an option for me, and they do not care. Living at Seton Hall University was a terrible experience, and I would not recommend it."
College Sophomore,1,"there is no parking, people park in fire zones on the daily which shows how much parking there really is"
College Sophomore,1,There are rules for their rules just to have someone help you get something from your room you need 100 different passes
College Freshman,1,Scholarships and financial aid are almost nonexistant.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone looks, acts and dresses the same. Get weird looks if you are not like everyone else."
College Freshman,1,Seton Hall is a pretty strict Catholic university.
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife sucks. Barely any parties but fraternities usually host parties on the weekends which aren't bad at all
College Sophomore,1,The process of getting into the Nursing program is tough. If your gpa isn't a 3.5 or above you must start as a pre-nursing student. Then as a pre-nursing student you are only allowed to register for certain classes; they put a restriction on your account which prevents you from registering for the classes you need. Your restriction is not lifted until your grades post which by this time there may not be any classes left to take besides electives. THE WORST!
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any parking spots. Seton Hall University is known for being a commuter school but yet they have a very limited amount of parking spaces. They recently just got rid of one of the beautiful lawns to transform it into a parking lot.
College Sophomore,1,It takes about an hour to an hour and a half to get a parking spot. This causes students to be late for class.
College Sophomore,1,"no parking past 11 am , youll be late to class every time"
College Sophomore,1,its mostly a frat school but the frat houses area mostly run down
College Sophomore,1,There are alot of parking spots yet when you come to park there are no parking spots available unless your in the university at the crack of dawn and they continuely give new drivers campuses passes to park the parking situation has ALWAYS been a nightmare. Makes me appreciate that i catch the bus to school
College Freshman,1,"Housing for freshman IS NOT guaranteed. Many people I know have waited an extra semester to live on campus. If you want to live on campus here, it is very limited. Even as an upperclassmen you are not guaranteed housing. You need stupid things called Priority Points (on campus activities, grades, good behavior, etc.) to earn housing. Lottery system to pick housing so if you do not get many Priority Points, do not expect to get housing. Personally, I am a sophomore, and I do not have housing on campus for the upcoming semester.   "
College Freshman,1,"Housing is terrible. People who work in the housing department clearly hate their jobs and get annoyed easily when you need help and are confused.  There are not enough rooms and it doesn't matter how many priority points you have, if you can't fill a suite, you won't get into the place you want to live.  LOVE the school, HATE the housing."
College Senior,1,"Unless you give yourself an hour to find parking or have classes before 9:30 AM, you will NOT find a spot. I routinely spend 30 mins - 1 hour circling the campus. School bit more than it could chew with admissions this year and commuters are paying the price."
College Junior,1,"After 10:00, the only parking spots you will be able to find are at the top (5th) floor of the parking deck. Also, the South Orange police are very strict with respect to parking on the streets; one time, a friend of mine received two parking tickets in the same day for parking on the street because all of the lots were full!"
College Senior,1,Parking is a problem at Seton Hall and you can't find a spot during peak hours .
College Sophomore,1,"It's usually a nightmare, no one can ever find a spot during peak hours."
College Freshman,1,"Perhaps I have high standards. But there are very few, very limited vegan, vegetarian and healthy options. On Sundays the caf is literally bare, everything has been eaten. Different food everyday but never good quality and you see their pattern after a few months. Ms. Virginia's breakfast sandwich=best thing you can find in the caf."
College Student,1,"i'm not a commuter, but i hear from faculty and commuters that parking is horrible. if you don't get there early, like 8am, there won't be spaces. and they are very strict with ticketing and the parking passes are pretty expensive."
College Freshman,1,There is armed robberies weekly right outside the gates of campus
College Sophomore,1,THERE ARE NONE – There are really no great options for off-campus dining. The main place for students to go to is Cluck You Chicken. At night students generally do not want to walk into south orange because of the reports of people being robbed.
Recent Alumnus,1,Unfair Advantages – My school seems to cater to athletes in terms of offenses.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I Honestly Don't Understand – My school has lackluster professors who barely understand the topic that they're discussing. The registration process every semester is ridiculous, you basically have to jump through hoops to get a straight answer about any of your questions. The curriculum is not suited for a college student who is intent on finishing their degree in four years, you're more than likely not going to finish for about 6 years, if you have the money."
College Junior,1,"Very Catholic. The school's Catholic outlook means no male-female guests, no gum...on campus, no condoms sold in the book store, you must swipe your card on and off campus (surrounded by an iron gate). It is quite ridiculous"
College Freshman,1,"Just Take the Train – Seton Hall charges any overnight visitor a parking fee to spend the night, and tickets all other unregistered cars with a $50 fee."

Niche User,5,I am being recruited by William Penn for Cross Country and the Coaches are great to talk to and helpful during the application process.
Freshman,5,The atmosphere is great.  The teachers are very good and want you to succeed.  Some of them will even text you to let you know how you did on homework.  They have a open door policy which is great.  They have some newer dorms and a great sports facilities.  They really work with the students.
Freshman,5,I love the small town feel. Having such a small campus and student body brings a close knit feeling. I would love to have the ability to not be on a meal plan and have kitchens in the dorms.
Sophomore,5,I have loved my experience so far at WPU. I like how even though we have a very small student body it is super diverse. I have met people and became close friends with people from several different states and even countries.

College Sophomore,5,The parking on campus is free to everyone. The parking permit costs nothing.  The campus is small and compact so there is no need to drive to class. There are always open parking spaces. There are parking fines you can get though if you take up more than one space or parking in a handicap with no permit.
College Senior,5,A lot of people at William Penn University are in some part of Physical Education. Sports Administration takes you on a path to learn skills that will enable you to pursue different sports management jobs.
College Senior,5,I came to William Penn University from Iowa State University and I love the tight nit campus. Teachers are more accessible and have more time for one on one teaching in their free time. The classes are small allowing time for everyone's questions to get answered. The school website is easy to use and teachers respond to emails quickly.
College Sophomore,5,"Parking on campus is easy. Student permits are free, and there are lots of different lots, none of which are more than a five minute walk from class on this small, private school campus."

Sophomore,4,I like that the campus is small. Though with it being very small the school still comes together and has alot of activities to do.
Senior,4,"William Penn supports students through out their academic time at Penn. They also strongly support athletics and  other extra curricular activities. My favorite part of William Penn University is the relationships built while on campus. Due to its small size, you have the ability to know most of the other students that attend the university as well. The small class sizes allow for you to get to know your professor and your professor to get to know you! These relationships are very helpful for classes, internships, and future job opportunities."
Freshman,4,I love that environment that William penn have to offer with the nice people and the great site of farm to the teachers who taught me so much about William penn history.
College Freshman,4,It was great for me. I like the small class sizes.

College Sophomore,4,"Our athletics teams are very good at this school! They are really competitive and since it is a small school, students always attend as well as parents to give the sports teams big audiences."
College Sophomore,4,"I really do like my school. I know there are some days where sports can get in the way of my education, but the teachers on campus are always willing to help you with that and if you need tutoring it is there for you to take.

College Freshman,4,"The local atmosphere doesn't include many attractions or places to see, but it is a beautiful town that can be  extremely enjoyable if you know how to make your own fun. There is a large park where you can barbeque after a day of golfing just next door. There are few stores to shop at and there are many festivities/events throughout the summer and fall."
College Freshman,4,It is easy to get good grades at this university because of the knowledgeable teachers and the ease of getting help when needed. Curriculum and pace of learning varies among each teacher and topic. Registering starts with the Seniors and works it's way down each class. Workload depends on which major you are but expect to put in a large amount of time each week on homework. The most popular places to study are in the PAC at the tables outside the Café or in the library.
College Freshman,4,"William Penn Campus is extremely diverse. People come from all over the country as well as other countries. All students are treated equally by staff and their peers. Students also come from all kinds of economic backgrounds. Many students come on sports or academic scholarship, paying for most of their schooling but some also attend private university paying the full cost. Political beliefs and religion are not among popular topics on campus. Everyone is accepting to other opinions. Sexual orientation is very diverse as well. There are many same-sex couples among campus along with straight couples."
College Freshman,4,"Off-campus dining is very easy to come across in Oskaloosa. There are a wide variety of fast-food restaurants ranging from McDonalds to Subway or Maid-Rite to Taco Johns. Recently there was added a Jimmy John's, which is a good place for college students to find a job. Along with fast-food, there are many restaurants such as Mi Ranchito, Tasos' Steakhouse, On The Green, Family Restaurant and Smokey Row. All range in price and cuisine. All are conveniently located downtown and few offer student discounts. The best places to check out are Tasos' Steakhouse for a big, filling meal, Family Restaurant for cheap homestyle cooking, and Smokey Row to grab your coffee and study before a big test."

College Junior,4,"Oskaloosa is a nice town. I would live there if I wasn't married and settled in my town. It has plenty of dining options, some entertainment, community get-togethers.  There is a small mall. The town seems to appreciate the business the college generates."
College Junior,4,"I already have a laptop, but if I didn't want to bring it there are computer labs available. I can print at home, or at school.. Wireless is fast."
College Junior,4,"I am not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy some vegetarian options when available. There is not a lot of that, but lots of fast food, some sit-down dining options, coffee shops, diners. There are discounts available at most of the chains. Smokey Row coffee shop is wonderful."
College Junior,4,I have not spent much time on campus yet but I love that my class is small and works around my working schedule. My program is one day a week to accommodate adult working students. It is not too far from my town and the price of tuition is comparable to other programs.

College Sophomore,4,"Very Good And Good People

May Our God Bless all."
College Junior,2,"All girls and guys at school, all tend to love to drink and sleep around. Most of the students are black, or not from the midwest."
College Freshman,2,There is Greek life but it is hard to consider it such. There are know houses and very little events are held. Most people join only to say they are in a fraternity or sorority.
College Freshman,2,There is 1 new dorm.  The walls a paper thin.  The quiet hours are never observed.  All other dorms are really old!  They need lots of updating!
College Junior,2,"There is no covered walkway between buildings, when it rains you will get very wet."

College Junior,2,"Oskaloosa, unfortunately, has no night life... The town is too small. Lots of parties on the weekends."
Niche User,1,"There is nothing I like about this campus or community. If you are not from the area do NOT go to this school. They will lower your financial aid, scholarships and make you pay out of pocket without notice. Not suitable to be open. Administration is not helpful and needs to be replaced or shut down."
College Senior,1,"The cafe is horrible but you have no choice to eat

."
College Senior,1,I really need help and definitely need scholarships. I'm a junior and only have a a year left.
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely no freedom in the dorms, primarily Market. Everyone is an adult but are treated like they are children. You are locked out of the side doors and must pass an RA if you come in after 9 PM, which is early when you are trying to do your homework in the library. The opposite sex is also not allowed in the other sex's dorm past nine unless checked in, which they must leave by midnight. Many noise complaints are issued even when you are simply laughing in the common area because the building was poorly built and walls/floors are paper thin. Don't expect to be treated with respect because all security guards/most RA's will treat you like you are a criminal."
College Junior,1,when its hot it is too hot when it is cold it is too cold
College Sophomore,1,"There are a few bars available to those 21 and older. There are no nightclubs or anywhere for those under 21 to go. There are a number of house parties at the different sports teams' houses off campus, but many house parties are very dangerous to go to in such a small town with tough police officers who know where all the big party houses are located. The best bet is having a good friend that lives off campus and having small parties there."

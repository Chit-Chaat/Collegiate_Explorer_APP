Freshman,5,My experience at The Art Institute of Atlanta is really good so far. The professors are very informative and if you need help understanding the material then they will be there for you. They also take the time out to help the students one-on-one before or after class. The students are also really nice. If they see you having a hard time then they will ask you if you need help. The school also has fun events or people come to talk to the students. There are also a lot of job opportunities/ internships at the school.  The school is very hands on and they make sure you are getting the best information so the students can succeed during and after college.
Freshman,5,"It’s a great environment. As a returning student at 28 years, it’s been a smooth transition for me. The professors are engaged with your learning and wants to help each student to succeed. I would highly recommend for anyone seeking a creative arts degree."
Senior,5,The art institute of Atlanta has been a great college experience for me. They have flexible payment options available for students as well as financial aid assistance readily available. I have learned and experienced so much at this facility it is priceless.
Freshman,5,"I love the people with special and unique talent, the school is well organized and very helpful, Good positive energy is in the school, a lot of love and support upon others talent. The Advisors and Principal are very outspoken. There are nice people there that are dedicated to help and also to their work."
Senior,5,"I have attended Art Institute of Atlanta since 2014. By far, It has been one of my most rewarding experiences.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The faculty and staff genuinely care about my achievements. They do everything to ensure academic and career success. The instructors are career professionals with real world experience in a variety of industries. I have learned a great deal from them. The Art Institute of Atlanta always has job fairs and famous guests speakers for student networking events. I recommend the school to everyone interested in the arts."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. The professors are phenomenal educators who will go above and beyond the make sure you get the material. The equipment and resources we have are state of the art and the same tools you see used in the professional field. Our President is very nice and personable. overall, its an amazing experience."
Junior,5,the art institute is an amazing college most of the work or hand on you get the chance to watch your creation come to life. What I most love about this institute you can walk pass classrooms and you see all the students interact in the discussion.
Junior,5,"From the moment I walked into the doors of  this school, I was instantly in love, it could because I'm a small town country girl. My eyes had never witnessed something so creative. I love the atmosphere and the people inside this school, this school brings my joy and most of all closer to my dreams and destiny for life. However, something I would like to change is the activities and adventure for the students. I would like a more university feel but  also keep the small family feel."
Freshman,5,My first-year experience is that classes are smaller and hands-on which I'm able to communicate with the teacher
Freshman,5,"I had the pleasure of attending The Art Institute of Atlanta's Open House last month. My visit to Atlanta from Florida was well worth the trip! The relations that I made with other people was very interesting. All of my questions were answered, each instructor was very caring about each individual and that made me want to attend this college even more. The housing and accommodations are wonderful; within two miles of the college. Convenience of location for students is also a plus! My admissions advisor and financial planner are so helpful to me and it means a lot. I have applied to this college and am happy to be starting very soon."
Niche User,5,"The best school for learning the major video game graphic design for all creative students! This is my secondary plan, so I can get into this school without paying out of state income."
Freshman,5,"The first day attending class was the best experience since my days in high school, the professors are available for you when ever needed. Students that do not share the same major are the missing puzzle piece to what may be missing in your major or classes. Meaning two differences can come together as one to create a spectacular outcome."
Sophomore,5,"I love the school and how artistic it is. I love that I get to take so many different courses that all pertain to my major. The teachers are great, the location is great and this is the 4th college I've attended in my life. I finally feel like I belong. I also love the networking there, it's so many students with different majors that I'll be needing in the future for my own businesses."
Freshman,5,It will be my first year at the art institute of Atlanta its so much that ive seen and cant wait to do
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience. Very helpful staff and faculty. I like the school look, the encouragement to complete college and do your best in classes. The teachers I have had are great at helping us. The president of the school is open door policy and willingness to listen."
College Freshman,5,They really commit to making a flexible schedule
College Student,5,"Staff is helpful, admissions is very nice and understanding"
College Sophomore,5,Fashion Design is the best to learn about especially in Atlanta since it's big down here.
College Junior,5,"The moment I walked in, I felt welcome."
College Junior,5,Even part for my business!
College Freshman,5,I think the Art Institute of Atlanta is best for me. I think this because the school welcome everybody that is attend the college. They help indidviduals in many ways.
College Freshman,5,I am always leaning something new. I am always doing something to improve my self and learning new skills. I am learning from actual professional and not by people that just studied the field to teach it. I am always meeting new people. I am always being push to do better
College Freshman,5,"Great class size, give you that hands on experience 

Learning new styles new way on doing things. 

Professors have experience in the field.

Great Environment"
College Freshman,5,"Because I am a student first and also employed, the staff has been flexible but not too passive.  I have access to my professors at all times."
College Freshman,5,"Like I mentioned before, our career center is always involved in our student life and the alumni networking is great.  Many of the students that graduate are still located in the Atlanta area and contribute time back to the students and school.  I think that career prospect are high and the quality of the school is great."
College Freshman,5,"The quality of my schools post-grad services is wonderful.  Along with the career center there are plenty of career fairs, the alumni are actively involved in our learning and many teach at the school.  Job prospects are high and looking good."
College Junior,5,"I love it, it's amaz and they really focus on you ."
College Senior,5,"The resources is the best, i used the libraries a lot."
College Senior,5,"They accept all types of students of different backgrounds. They all get along well, this school is very diverse."
College Junior,5,I just knew this is where I should be at this point in my life. it was the next step for me
College Junior,5,The class sizes are great within my field of study. The professors are able to spend some time with each student and really help them
College Junior,5,"For the Interior Design Program we have a resource room always full of materials to use, there is always something new. The staff is great always available to answer questions and very helpful."
College Junior,5,The Art Institute of Atlanta is the best at it's career service.
College Junior,5,The online courses for the Art Institute of Atlanta are marvelous.
College Junior,5,"I honestly feel that game art & design, animation, and visual game programming majors have the best instructors and courses, though obviously that's biased.  Our workloads are large--producing games, creating large animatinons that take intense render times, etc.  But despite our intense work, our results usually make going to class worth it.  I enjoy seeing everyone's finished products.  It also gives a sense of how high the bar is raised."
College Freshman,5,My initial tour of the facility surprised me on how many resource labs and computers the school has for students to work.
College Freshman,5,The administration showed me what I can expect for online courses and they look very professional.  I haven't taken any at this time and do not expect to until October when the school year starts.
College Junior,5,We are very diverse and yet feel so together on so many levels. We work as a unit and separately just as well. We are a great student body.
College Freshman,5,The student body at my school is very diverse. Everyone is socially accepted.
College Freshman,5,There are various computer labs at The Art Institute. The network reliability gets an A+ from me. It is excellent.
College Freshman,5,"The Art Institute of Atlanta's academic programs are top notch. The professors are certified professionals of their field. The workload of these classes are average but can get a bit overwhelming at times. Class registration is a breeze. There are many different ways to register. Online registration is possible. Calling the hotline is also an option. The most effective way to me, is to go to my department leader and he takes us through the process."
College Junior,5,I think its great depending on the life outside of attending classes online
College Sophomore,5,Good job accommodating to my schedule. 
College Sophomore,5,They really care about your education and future
College Junior,5,The Art Institute of Atlanta has a student ran dining room that many major business heads use as meeting place for meetings and other endeavors.
College Junior,5,Im a video production major and it is difficult but it is so much fun. It is a lot of work but if you try to do your best then you will be granted so much assistance from accredited professors from within the industry 
College Junior,5,"Their are many things the Art Institute of Atlanta have to offer including make-up design classes, cinematography classes, editing classes, graphic design classes, etc. all are equally amazing"
College Junior,5,The experiences i have had at my school are like none other and i would not have changed it for anything
College Junior,5,My school is very flexible with having to do other things and being responsible for previous endeavors
College Junior,5,I have not personally taken an online course at the school but I have heard they are great and the professors are just as helpful at if they were there on campus
College Junior,5,Many people at the Art Institute of atlanta get great jobs right when they graduate and they become very successful in the industry they pursue
College Junior,5,Great computer based school with great wifi and up to date equipment
College Sophomore,5,"Throughout the campus students converse with each other. The school has a broad diversity of students with different views on many subjects. On or off campus students hang out, work with each other, and help each other reach their goals. Students have parties but, they focus on school and make sure they continue to keep their grade at an exceptional/acceptable level."
College Junior,5,I love that my scools is located in a safe area and business oriented setting
College Freshman,5,Learned a lot for different things I didn't know before.
College Freshman,5,"Education is so powerful to know because without Education you might not to know what to do. And that money would be for anther, and as you know jobs or work to find. And yes they is Financial Aid but that still might not coverage it. Or it does you still want books, computers, etc. And what if your job you not making enough money so Students if you pay for a class make sure one you want to take it and two do all your work in class, also homework ask questions in class because you every know if someone else in that might have the some question as you."
College Freshman,5,I really liked the overall atmosphere or the school. Both the students and faculty were very nice.
College Freshman,5,I am still a senior in high school and I am enrolled to start at the Art Institute of Virginia Beach in July 2013. I have heard nothing but great things about the post-grad services and will after graduation tap into all the resources availible to secure employment.
College Freshman,5,We have various different ethnicities here. Well all get along well with each other. Sexual orientations are very different here but we all accept each other for who we are. It's is a very friendly environment. I would say that we treat each other as family here.
College Freshman,5,They helped me get my job in the bookstore. I am so glad that they helped me connect with my new manager.
Freshman,4,"I have never taken an online class until the pandemic started. At first it was a little kinda confusing because the school had to transfer all the in person classes to online. After awhile it got better; the professors are more involved to make sure everyone will be on the same page. We use a site called Brightspace. It has all of  our classes and the homework, classwork, textbooks, etc. It also has a roster where you can see all of your classmates/professor and you can email them if you have questions. Teachers can also upload videos they want us to watch and books/ article pages to read. Online learning at the school is very organized so it is easy to navigate your classes."
Freshman,4,"It is a small campus, with the school being only one building, but that gives you a closer experience with the teachers and staff. The school gives the students so many opportunities to thrive in their field and get their name out there in the city of Atlanta. It is always special events and speakers coming to visit the school, so it is a great place to network."
Senior,4,"What I like about the Art Institute is the fact that the professors are currently industry working professionals. What I dont like about it is the cost, and that they dont really teach coding."
Junior,4,In my major of Audio Production my professors and student adviser has managed to get me multiple internship opportunities. Even though I'm in my second year of school here; The credentials on my resume is growing strong.  What I would like to see change here at the Art Institute is more building space.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the programs the school offers. The professors are knowledgeable of the subject matter and care about how well their students do in classes. The only qualm i have with the school is how expensive it is, but they offer a number of plans and ways to pay for it."
Sophomore,4,"My overall review of The Art Institute of Atlanta has been positive. The staff and faculty were helpful, and they were very willing to assist me when needed. They were informative and engaging when I asked questions."
College Freshman,4,The school gives you the creative vibe that i always loved
College Freshman,4,Learned so much that i never know about
College Freshman,4,The school is really good the teachers and students are like one big family
College Freshman,4,they have internships involved in the program which seems to help get my foot in the door.
College Freshman,4,Its going to teach me exactly what i want to do with my life
College Student,4,I will be able to capitalize off of the skills I obtain here
College Student,4,"Overall, I am glad to be going here and think this experience couldn't be better"
College Student,4,I am learning so much and I can use my knowledge in the real world
College Sophomore,4,My experience with this school has been great so far.
College Sophomore,4,It's great knowing big time people went to and graduated from my school. I one day want to be a big Designer known for going to school here.
College Sophomore,4,They're good. They all intervene with us students.
College Sophomore,4,I like this school so far because it taught me a lot of new things in Fashion and I'm glad that I have knowledge about them.
College Freshman,4,This school is fun and intresting it makes you feel at home and the atmosphere there is wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,Its very creative and the professors are helpful and want to see you succeed.
College Freshman,4,It's a very creative school filled with talented students who take great programs to help them be successful in their career.
College Junior,4,I can't wait to go in August
College Junior,4,Ms. Renee K. Is the best she is trying to hardest to make me happy
College Freshman,4,"There is a big diversity in the school with different skill levels. Everyone has there own belief and its all accepted. No one is make smart remakes because your Muslim or Christian they welcome it. Now there may be some challenges and that is natural, but to be honest I haven't seen them yet. The student body is great and not for the student but for the class room as well. the classes are not really big classes there may be 20 to 15 students. so its easy to meet people and it easier to interact with the professor"
College Freshman,4,You always leaning something new. The work load is fair and the professors work with you. The facilities are friend and always checking in on you making sure things are ok and if you need help with anything.
College Freshman,4,The school do a lot of fundraiser also other activates to help students get more involve and help them net work. There are tutors that help you and the professors them self will help you as well
College Freshman,4,Very Hands on school. Learning from people that have been part of the field or has experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As far as I know, the services are just fine.  I'm not entirely sure, though, since I'm only entering my fifth quarter."
Recent Alumnus,4,The tuition is about average for a school of this type.  The Financial Aid people are great and always work with you to determine the best solutions to any problem you may have.
Recent Alumnus,4,The only hassle I've had here is with a teacher that wouldn't teach the real curriculum.  I quit his class in the fourth week.
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything's fine.  Not sure what to say here.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a lot of great opportunities here in Atlanta.  And the film equipment is almost always readily available.  My problem is that I commute, and are therefore unable to check equipment out over the weekend."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Some courses are difficult for me, but overall (with few exceptions) the teachers here seem to really care about the success and well-being of their students."
Recent Alumnus,4,"They expect you to do most of the work, but they have plenty of resources available."
Recent Alumnus,4,"We're a really eclectic bunch.  All types of people looking for all types of artistic opportunities.  Other than that, I'm not sure what to say."
College Senior,4,"Its my first semester so i have no favorite experiences yet, but i know i will, because i'm already enjoying it."
College Senior,4,"The courses are easy and interesting to learn more, the professor is helpful and patient. The courses offered are, media production, photographic imaging, fashion design, culinary arts , animation, advertising, computer graphic design, illustrator drawing, web design. The classes are in labs with mac computers, each computer for a student for hands on learning, class size is at least 30 students."
College Senior,4,"The professors are helpful, they take their time to teach you and make sure that you understand what is being taught. The curriculums are good, class registrations is an easy process, workload are challenging but good enough, the programs are all up to date with todays technology."
College Senior,4,"Commercial Photography is my major, the professors teach in depths, they even teach you a little bit of computer graphic design, the curriculum is awesome, everything we learn goes had in hand, the facilities and clean and organised. The programs are great and up to date with todays technology. I haven't yet got internship or job opportunities but, the feedback from classmates who used career service have said that it has been successful."
College Senior,4,"I use online to complete home work, check grades, student careers and financial aids. I love it it is so convenient"
College Senior,4,In my career field the career service have had 100% students employer in their major.
College Sophomore,4,You really have all the tools you need to at least set you on the path you need to be on to get where you want to go.
College Sophomore,4,They are very hands-on with looking for internships and work studies.
College Sophomore,4,I've learned many new things as well as improved on things that I learned through experience.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very seasoned in there fields and many of them are still very active in there field which makes for a better background in teaching.
College Sophomore,4,The kids at my school are the next generation for entertainment.
College Junior,4,The students come from all walks of life and are so different. a wonderful mix here
College Junior,4,"From what I understand and hear, Having a degree from here is high status on its own. Will get you in the door or a lot of places"
College Junior,4,they are all focused on the arts and design and that is wonderful! even the general courses let us be creative in learning the subject. Everyone there wants to do whatever it takes to help every student succeed!
College Junior,4,The workload can the a bit overwhelming but we as students understand what it will take to be successful and get through it all.
College Junior,4,The Art Institute of Atlanta flexibility is quite reasonable.
College Junior,4,"The Art Institute of Atlanta has many opportunities to get a job, start your career and start with internships.  It is great with many of the teachers that all have worked in the field. Although, some of the rules I wish could be different."
College Junior,4,"Most professors/instructors at our school are great.  There are a few that are absolutely terrible, so watch out.  If you get stuck with a terrible instructor for an introduction course, chances are you'll struggle in the next course similar.  That was my problem with my first and second 3D modeling courses, because I bounced from an instructor who barely helped to an instructor who expected far too much.  Other than that, the curriculum is pretty good."
College Junior,4,"If you want to know about athletic centers or campus activities, let me go ahead and say that those two categories alone will get poor ratings.  But the one thing keeping my rating so high is the list of available software for us to use for both projects and extracurricular activities.  We have the entire up-to-date Adobe Creative Suite 6 as well as most to all Autodesk products and a few game design engines."
College Junior,4,"Our school has connections to many industries.  While I can't approve the pre-grad job aid, the post-grad tends to be a very big deal with much credit to it.  We have a portfolio show for every major.  We even have multiple portfolio classes to prepare every student for graduation and life after graduation.  We get prepped for business cards, media-ready work, dos and don'ts, nice touches for our display, etc."
College Junior,4,"We have students from all over the country and even some from various places across the globe.  Two excellent examples are my Colombian friend and my Saudi Arabian friend.  While we all have various ethnicities, sexual orientations, economic backgrounds, etc., what sets our school apart the most is our major.  Various majors have stereotypes for personalities.  Anyone who goes to our school will probably notice this after two or three months.  Other than a possible intolerance of certain majors, most students are perfectly accepting of anyone's sexual orientation or beliefs."
College Senior,4,My major gives great programs.
College Senior,4,"Good technology, great ways to learn more."
College Freshman,4,So far its been great!
College Freshman,4,No foreseen issues.  Looking forward to October to start classes.  Everyone said hi and was friendly.
Freshman,2,"I do not like the online classes. I barely get notifications, it's difficult to keep up with and I'm barely learning anything."
College Senior,2,Not really helpful they forget about you.
College Senior,2,A degree from here is not really taking seriously by alot of industry professionals.
College Senior,2,"This school is great upon entering but once you are a student EVERYTHING changes. The teachers are great! Accounting and Financial Aid is a nightmare and unorganized and they make it hard get the classes you need. Major headache and about 100,000 in debt."
College Junior,2,"There's barely a campus.  We are now down to only having one building with five floors and a small parking area.  Our library is fairly small and we surprisingly don't have any area for performing arts, despite being an art school.  At least most facilities are in good condition.  And I can't complain about our animation lab or the several computer labs with 3D modeling programs to use."
College Junior,2,Tuition is waaay too expensive and the housing is not worth what Im paying.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process at The Art Institute of Atlanta is bad due to the lack of financial aid advisers. The process can become tedious because they have the potential to lose your paperwork and you will have to start the process all over again. Tuition at The Art Institute is expensive due to the fact that it is a private college. I do however think the education I receive is worth the tuition I pay.
College Senior,2,"Again, its one building, not a typical college experience."
College Senior,2,I would probably go to a different school knowing what I know now
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many things to do around campus outside of scheduled events. The school lacks the standard university feel and if that is a major concern, this school may not be for you. However if your chosen major is here than that's the only activity you need."
College Freshman,2,"I don't like the surroundings of the school, it's just a plain 5 level building and even though it's an art school there's not much creativity around. It actually makes me feel dull and not many activities."
College Senior,2,You'll get a lot from the school as far education but this school is EXPENSIVE and it seems like after people's financial aid start messing up after their 3rd quarter here
College Sophomore,2,Tuition is high. Nothing to do in between classes. Great teachers. good online subscriptions such as digital tutors.
College Freshman,2,the tuition is too high for the kind of education given there.
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of my time at Ai was spent watching tutorials on the internet.  I could have stayed home and done that for free.  I also had to do a lot of independent study outside of school because most of the instructors were not knowledgable on some aspects.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Computer Labs – Thats what resources translates to at Ai.  There are lots of labs.  They may not be functioning properly but they are there and thats all you need to worry about as far as the technology staff is concerned.  They do just enough not to get fired and upgrade when the school allows it.  Students break the rules and eat and drink in the labs, watch porn on the computers, use facebook instead of doing actual work, play yugioh, and just misuse everything."
College Junior,2,"Very Minimal Campus Activities – No athletics, since it is a private school. Very few clubs, and often they come with hefty membership fees. Very minimal campus activities. The Library is a great resource, with current magazines in every field, and books in every field, though these are often outdated. General aesthetics are decent, with gardening and landscaping, and the school being in a nice part of town."
College Freshman,2,Not Really Unique – Its an arts school. It is what it is. The school doesn't even feel that much like college because its very very laid back and there isn't just high school graduates in attendance. The school is very mundane actually. There is not much variety (the average Atlanta people attend this school)and there's not much stuff to do other than school work.
College Sophomore,2,"The Dollar – The education I'm getting is well worth the money I'm paying. I got a little bit of financial aid, which helps, but I'm fine with the expense because I know my degree will make a difference in my career. I learned the hard way that it's very important to get all the right financial aid forms in on time-so don't make that same mistake! The only thing I wish the school would do differently is make its fees better known."
College Freshman,2,"Strict Professor – The class could have been better if, I had one on one time with the teacher. I was just learning the basics for this illustrator program  and when I told her that she said no exceptions. I really would like for the teachers to know that all students are not on an advance level and help students when they are having problems."
College Sophomore,1,I didn't like taking online courses. They were harder for me since I am a hands on person.
College Junior,1,"The tuition is extremely hard to manage.  If you skip a quarter and come back, your tuition is now far higher, which I don't mind because I don't skip quarters, but I can see how it would affect some.  I myself struggle with paying monthly payments (yes, monthly payments to my college on top of loans).  I get financial aid to knock off quite a bit of debt, sure, but even that is just enough to save me from failure, not give me stress relief.  If the school itself gave out more scholarship money, maybe things would be different."
College Freshman,1,It's good if you get a grade you doesn't like try harder next time.
College Sophomore,1,"The career services office at my college is useless, aside from getting a card to a site that may--on a miracle day--show new job openings.  Usually the site shows old jobs that have definitely been taken.  Tutoring jobs on campus are difficult to obtain due to the several ridiculous requirements."
College Junior,1,i had to do most of the work on my own to make sure it was done right and on time
College Senior,1,They do not have any post grad services that I am aware of.
College Freshman,1,"Athletic centers are for student housing members at specific locations, given we have apartment complexes as dorm regions.  There's a library and a few activities, but very rare."
College Freshman,1,"They have a monthly card you can buy from the school for 68 dollars to ride the  MARTA unlimited for a month but if you buy the card late in that particular month, you can only use it from the day you bought it until that month is over. It doesn't go by days like (30-31 days) it goes by months and that's a waste of money kinda like a rip off. need a discount"
College Freshman,1,Campus Life – I have to admit that the campus life sucks here... There arent any other centers to go to except the ones you have classes in. I at least thought there would be like a place to workout and stuff.
College Freshman,1,i wish it were like a rac center . some place to hang/ do something productive if you have like an 2hr break between classes.
College Sophomore,1,"Art Institute of Atlanta- Decatur – They don't hardly have student activities, very small school (shares building with two other colleges, so one floor for all), sttudent lounge is terrible, some of the student body and faculty is FAKE, housing is a rip off at the penalty and financial aid is no help......"
Recent Alumnus,1,Conform or Fail – Job prospects?  Thats funny.  I keep up with job prospects on my own because the ones they give us at the school are either for a bellboy at a hotel or a vendor at the Georgia Dome.  And if it's in your field of study be prepared to conform to the mold they give you or else you wont be getting a job from them.
Recent Alumnus,1,Worst Educational Experience of MY LIFE! Part 2 – I think the school is a joke.  It's a scam.  All they want is your money and once they get it they basically don't have to do anything for you because you can't speak up.  All you are is a number at this school and thats all they care about is getting as many kids into the school as possible to meet the quota.
College Junior,1,"Near Failure – The Financial Aid process is lengthy and confusing. The staff are disorganized and unaware of how much of the process some students have completed, and require you to repeatedly fill out the same forms. Tuition is expensive, and pigeon-holes you. Once you go into the school, you are pretty much stuck, considering credits rarely transfer. The only reason I did not grade it as a fail, is the redeemable quality of being able to network with other students in your major, and that a lot of the professors have know people in the business."
College Junior,1,"More and More Money – My financial aid process with AIA is very depressing, they are not helpful with helping you understand your financial aid, they just want money and more money. They lock you in payment plans and don't tell you all the stipulations. Very poor communication and non helpful."
College Sophomore,1,Too Expensive – The school is great but just too expensive. Its impossible to attend without getting a ton of loans
College Senior,1,"Difficult to Get Answers – The financial aid office at the AIA is always very busy. The staff in the office are never friendly, act as if the students are inconveniencing them and work with no sense of urgency. It feels as if I'm walking into a zoo at times. Tuition is very expensive and I do not feel the finaincal office works with me to help me find the best possible options for my situation."
College Junior,1,Must Self-Motivated – Most of the information is for jobs that are non-paying (for the internships).  The graduates that I know of this quarter have not gotten jobs.  They are ALL unemployed (in the field they studied).
College Junior,1,"Very Expensive for the Quality – At The Art Institute of Atlanta, the equipment is very dilapidated and the computers go down frequently.  The dean does not listen to complaints from students and ignores letters about the conditions at the school.  There are very few scholarships and grants for students even for exceptional students with high averages.  The only scholarship I have qualified for so far is the perfect attendance scholarship which really just helps to line investors pockets.  I have a 4.0 average."
College Senior,1,"I do not like the career services at my school. I've only heard one person say good things about it and that is it. I've tried to get a job while attending my school and I'm having a very hard time. I once landed two internships and that is about it, but finding anything that pays is hard (While being in school) I hope around my graduation period my school can help me find a serious paying job once I leave the school."

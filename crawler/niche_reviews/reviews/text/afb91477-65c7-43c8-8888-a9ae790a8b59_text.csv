Freshman,5,Central's campus has an amazing home feeling everywhere you go on campus. With Central being as small as it is each Professor will go out of his or her way to make sure that you succeed and show your full potential in and out of the classroom.
Freshman,5,My first month I honestly hated it here but then I got out and met people. Almost everyone on campus is friendly and it's more than likely you'll take classes with a lot of your friends!. Campus is the perfect size so I felt like I was at home. I love it here!
Freshman,5,"The community and campus give a welcoming feeling. You find your place at Central College. Anyone is willing to help you in anyway. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get help. There are plenty of friendly faces, and you won't fall without someone to help you get back up. Everyone helps everyone out, whether that is students, professors, or other faculty. It really is one big community."
Freshman,5,"I love how easy it is to get involved at Central, in sports, music, and clubs. There are many events going on every weekend which make it hard to go home at breaks."
Niche User,5,"They have a very fun, welcoming and family oriented environment. This led me to choose Central College. It is overall an amazing school."
Niche User,5,"I love the visit! It honestly feels like home. The professors are very knowledgeable and confident about what they teach. In addition, the student life is fantastic because it is so easy to make friends and to adjust to student life.  Another reason is that the faculty/admissions is supporting and willing to help any student. They take you step by step through financial and academic help. I cannot wait to adapt to the new student life in 2020, to make new friends, and pursue my academic career."
Junior,5,"Central is an incredibly homey experience. You are included and accepted. As an RA on campus, I had the ability to meet so many people while also being involved in many activities."
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently a sophomore at Central College, and I could not imagine any other school for me. They have great faculty and staff. Students on campus are always extremely nice making Central a super welcoming environment."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here, everyone specifically all of the faculty works for the benefit of each student. I have lots of health problems which requires me to miss classes from time to time and all the professors I’ve had at Central want to make sure that I am successful despite all of the different obstacles in my path."
Sophomore,5,"While expensive, the community makes it feel like a home away from home, and the professors are incredibly attentive to anything a student might need. It's also an amazing school for study abroad and internship opportunities. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the people are incredibly kind."
Senior,5,This college has a great small town feel that allows you to be open and try new things. The town is very homey and friendly with the college being a large part of it. The instructors are welcoming and helpful. It is a great place to expand your horizons.
Niche User,5,I'm not a current student but was impressed with everything I saw during a visit. Especially the athletic training facilities and staff.  The unlimited AE chocolate milk is a bonus too!
Niche User,5,"Love this place, can't wait to attend this fall! Everyone there is super friendly, the professors actually care about you and your work. They care about a lot, have fun activities and arent a party school, which was really important to me. The students are hard workers and really nice to everyone, and the admissions counselors are amazing! Everyone is kind and helpful and they make you feel at home. It can feel like they are a little expensive but they give you a ton of opportunities for scholarships! They even have a scholar day where you can earn even more money for college!"
Niche User,5,"My experience at Central College was absolutely amazing. On my campus tour and athletic facilities tour, the staff made me feel like I belonged there so much. I love how within the college there are so many tight friend group and how big the sense of community is. The college is built in a small town that has a major Dutch influence and the school embraces it and makes it part of who they are. It also has very new facilities and has the best stuff for their students to succeed. I also really like the fact that the class sizes are very small and the student to teacher ratio is really low because i like to be able to connect with the teacher because I learn better that way."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the wonderful student-to-teacher ration at Central College (approximately 10:1) and the various resources available for both academic and personal health, such as the writing center and free mental health counseling services. The dedication to academics exhibited by both students and professors here is truly spectacular as well. However, I would like to see a greater emphasis on diversity and intercultural learning at Central College with more events and classes dedicated to these subjects."
Niche User,5,"Central has an amazing atmosphere and the perfect campus for its students. Residents halls are clean, and students are nice and friendly."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere is that of a family. Everyone is close nit and friendly. Professors are more than happy to answer any questions, and help you to succeed in whatever major you are interested in."
Freshman,5,The whole experience has been so much fun! The atmosphere and friendliness of the college as a whole is needed due to the fact that I live 16 hours away from Central. The college really makes me feel at home.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus. Great professors.  Decent food. Friendly people.  Caring staff.  Many opportunities. Gorgeous town.
Junior,5,"I love being a student at Central! All my professors are amazing, the dorm I live in is great, and the campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so nice and very accommodating. It's a beautiful campus and a great city! I love that the professors take time to answer questions and their doors are always open. The city is very cute and everyone is very friendly, there bakeries and shops that can keep you entertained."
Freshman,5,"I have loved every experience that I have encountered thus far in my career at Central College. Everywhere you go, you are welcomed in as a family member. You are included in every opportunity available. I have planned some scholarship and service learning opportunities in the next couple years and I can not wait until I get to take part in them."
Senior,5,"Central College provides a great liberal arts experience. It's big enough that you don't know everyone, but you still recognize a few friendly faces on your walk to class. The professors are great and take the time to get to know each of the students in their class. This makes it much easier to ask questions and get help outside of class. There is also a great tutoring and writing center available for additional help. Central provides a variety of activities and groups for students to get involved in. Being in the middle of Iowa, this school is lacking a bit in diversity but is very intentional with it's programming to raise awareness about different issues. Central College could benefit from more student involvement in planned programming. There are many great events planned, but the student turnout is often low."
Freshman,5,"The students are wonderful and the professors are incredibly helpful.  There are a lot of opportunities to get involved, seeing as it is a purely undergraduate school."
College Senior,5,don't have Greek life wish we did
College Senior,5,"It is the best because the professors take there time to make sure that there students understand what's going on , I have been out of school for a while and starting back has been a little difficult but my professors showed me were I can get tutoring and help ."
College Junior,5,Professors challenge your thinking and want the best results for you from the class. They are more about you having a knowledge base than getting good grades because if you have the knowledge the grades come right along with that.
College Junior,5,"I've lived in most every place you can live on campus (as a female) and though each dorm or house is different, there is value in every place and perks to each. I would recommend any one of the housing options."
College Freshman,5,great at helping you find internships and jobs
College Freshman,5,I'm just starting my second semester and so far I  has been an amazing experience. Me and three other girls became really close instantly and I also love  my golf teammates. As of now If I could do it over I would choose the same school.
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe walking around campus, even late at night. Its very safe."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are more than helpful and are generally passionate about their courses, which makes the courses more interesting and engaging. It was also easy to register for classes and get into the classes you want. The workload is manageable and the professors are always accommodating to students' needs. There are also opportunities for independent studies, honors enrichments, and a great study abroad program."
College Freshman,5,"Since Central has such a community atmosphere, everyone looks out for each other. There are very few campus crimes aside from minimal vandalism by drunk students. Campus security is always available when its needed night and day, so if there is ever a problem, they are easy to contact. It is a dry campus and they work hard to enforce that, but when drinking does occur it rarely results in crime. Overall, I feel much safer on campus or in town than I do in my hometown."
College Freshman,5,"There are more opportunities available to students who attend Central than most other colleges. The majority of students have had at least one internship before they graduated and are more than likely to receive a job in their field after graduation. The career service center is very helpful if you are proactive. Other than that there are a number of career and internship fairs that offer numerous different opportunities. The alumni of Central are also more involved than any other college, often returning and giving back to the community or offering internships to current students."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing and I haven't met one I didn't like. Their courses are engaging and informative. Class sizes are small, that way you get more attention from your professor and it requires you to attend because you get to know your professors on a personal level."
College Freshman,5,"Central College is a small and community based school. Everyone there looks out for each other, the professors always help students to do their best. The lessons are relevant and engaging and there's huge variety of interesting courses to take. There is also a great honors program where you can do a senior thesis, which is a great opportunity. Overall, it is the perfect school for me because of the friendly, helpful, and educational atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Central. As my first semester is coming to a close I can safely say that this has been the best few months of my life so far. All the professors are amazing and everyone is so happy and ready to help you! I love it here. Go dutch!
College Junior,5,Central has been the perfect school for me in my two years there. The professors are always willing to work with students outside of class. We also have very small class sizes that makes learning much easier and more hands-on. I would never trade my education at Central for anything.
College Freshman,5,I'm a cheerleader and I love it.
College Sophomore,5,We have very strong academics and a variety of majors available and our core curriculum lets a student experience a little bit of everything.
College Sophomore,5,"There are plenty of options for housing. Each has their perks and downfalls. The cleaning staff for the bathrooms do a great job. The Resident Assistants and Housing Coordinators are very helpful. The housing process is a little odd, but it is worth it for the nice housing."
College Sophomore,5,"The computers in the labs are always kept up to date and running well. The internet can be a little slow at times, but runs well on the lab computers. There are computer labs in every dorm and many of the education buildings as well. You can always find a working computer if you need one. The wireless can be a bit unreliable but the labs take care of that. The college does give you a printing allowance, but it's pretty hard to reach it within the semester."
College Freshman,5,You can do what you want.
College Freshman,5,I love all the seasons. Beautiful place year round.
College Freshman,5,The science program here is wonderful.
College Freshman,5,Everything on campus is in walking distance. Longest walk is roughly 8 minutes.
College Freshman,5,"Such a fantastic place to get a education at. As an Environmental Science/Biology major, I am pretty busy academically. The professors are so helpful and nice, they always encourage me to ask for help if I need it."
College Freshman,5,"I love every minute on campus at Central. The professors are great, the study abroad options are amazing, there is so much to get involved in, and the food is even edible most of the time. You get what you pay for and Central is worth every penny!"
College Freshman,5,"The study abroad program is the best in our area. The class sizes are small and the professors are always available. Unlike the feeling I got from visiting a big school, the professors here really want you to see the world and do well."
College Freshman,5,"Our facilities are cool and also some of them meet standards that make them environmentally friendly. Central has some cool traditions like the lemming race and the Christmas Candlelight concerts. Also, on birthdays, students get thrown in the pond on campus!"
College Freshman,5,Living in a Dutch town is the best. there is so much culture in such a little town and it is great! Don't go though if you want a wide range of bars and other places to drink though.
College Freshman,5,Getting financial aid from Central is very easy. Everyone is basically guaranteed some sort of aid based off of academic performance.
College Freshman,5,There are always a variety of activities and traditions that take place on a daily basis. It's almost impossible to be bored and have no where to go.
College Freshman,5,I love where I live. I live in an all girls dorm hall and it is pretty much always really quiet. It isn't too bad of a walk to any of the classes and the cost is pretty average. 
College Freshman,5,I am loving it here. It is great. The class sizes are small so you get that one on one with your professor and many people are willing to help you with things.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on this campus. It isn't very big and everyone is super friendly. We also have amazing campus security that will give you a ride back to your room or a crossed campus if you don't feel safe. 
College Sophomore,5,"LOVE IT! I am a finance Major who wants to work on Wall-Street. While this school is in a small town in Iowa, I feel that this school puts me in a position that I could take over the world. "
College Sophomore,5,"There is a small security team for the campus, yet it is no problem. The town is a very safe place to be. I have no issue walking across campus at 3 in the morning. "
College Sophomore,5,This is the whole reason I go to this school.  They have one of the best kinesiology departments across the nation.
College Sophomore,5,"Most of the professors are great.  With small classes, they can give you the attention you need and want.  They want you to learn so all you need to do is ask for help.  Curriculum is excellent for my major.  Really stress about studying overseas as a lot of student would not ordinarily have this opportunity."
Freshman,4,"Central has made a motion to have every student in the classroom at all possible. When a student tests positive or has been exposed to COVID, Central's team does an amazing job making sure that their online experience is as great of an experience as in the classroom."
Senior,4,"I know this statement may sound relatively stereotypical, but I say it with complete honesty: Attending Central College was one of the best choices I have ever made. I am someone who learns best in a small classroom setting where I have the ability to ask questions and engage in meaningful conversation. Central provided me with the ability to do so and to get to not only know my professors, but develop professional relationships with them. The faculty at Central care about your development not only in the classroom, but in life as well. Central College is the place where strangers smile as they walk by and they ask you how you are. There's a strong sense of community. The campus itself is beautiful (but in the spring, watch out for the geese, those things are mean). All in all if you are someone that thrives in a small school and caring community, I would recommend looking at Central."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with central was subtle but it was still enough to see and understand that the school is very welcoming to incoming students regardless of race, age,religion, and sexuality. Being such a welcoming school allows students to be more comfortable and adjust to the new area without feeling like an outsider."
Sophomore,4,"I did not take classes online however I did stay in contact with Admissions, professors, and deans which were all very helpful during this time and were very dedicated to supporting their students."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Central College, and I absolutely love it. Everyone is very welcoming and eager to meet new people. The professors are amazing and classes are interesting. I look forward to spending the next three years here."
Alum,4,Loved my department professors. They invested in us personally. I did not get a job in my field of study right out of college. Loved the campus and the town as well.
Alum,4,The diversity is increasing at Central College and they are making many updates to the academic and athletic facilities. They have great student to professor ratios and offer many ways to support their students. With Des Moines being about 30 min away there is a good amount to do not only in Pella but in Des Moines. It is easy to get involved and stay involved at Central College with all they have to offer.
Junior,4,Central College offers a rich educational experience rooted in deep tradition in which calls you to a higher standard. I would recommend it for everyone.
Sophomore,4,I like the area. It’s a small town with lots to do. Campus is very nice and easily accessible. Student to professor ratio is small.
Junior,4,Central has given me so many opportunities to expand my knowledge on a variety of subjects. They are equipping me well to become an accountant.
Junior,4,"I love the school! Very pretty campus, and most staff are helpful and nice. Central does have some strict rules with housing and meal plans and drinking. Also, the town is strict.  They are closing the only fun bar in town."
Freshman,4,"Central is located in an amazing town! Pella is a cute little Dutch town with an exciting festival every May. Pella is completely safe and everyone is very nice. All of the professors love meeting with students individually and are interested in your personal growth. The only downside is Pella is a small town, so there isn't always a lot to do, but with Des Moines close by something fun is just a short drive away."
Sophomore,4,Central College is a small school in Pella. The atmosphere of the campus is defiantly that of a small town. When walking around campus you will see people you know and even those who you do not know are friendly and will likely pass along a greeting. Academically after the initial required courses have been met the classes ramp up significantly. Pella is small and does not have a lot of entertainment within the town. Central makes up for that by having something somewhere on campus every weekend. Pella is also about 45 min from Des Moines which makes a trip there and back in a day or night quite manageable.
Junior,4,"Central has been great in all aspects. From professors that truly care about you to wonderful dining services, I have had a great experience at Central College."
Senior,4,I'm a senior at Central and I love the school. Campus is beautiful and small enough to walk anywhere I need to go. The professors genuinely care about and take time to get to know their students in order to help them excel.
Sophomore,4,I am a transfer student and unfortunately they do not prioritize transfers like I would prefer to see. However overall I have enjoyed this school.
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are good.
College Sophomore,4,It is a good small school. The professors and faculty are very caring and concerned about students.
College Junior,4,"For a Music Education degree, any schools that have a knowledge of Central will know how great our teacher education program is and our music program is also great. It is not as well known as the education program but ranks just as high in my opinion."
College Junior,4,There are minor flaws but the security guards and RA's are always there if we need them and will walk with you to your dorm if you feel the need.
College Junior,4,"Sometimes the focus on the sports aspect of the school tends to outshine the academic, arts or student life aspects of the school. This is apparent in where most of the upgrades are on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Central is only a D3 college, but they recruit heavily and are very strong in almost every sport."
College Freshman,4,"Central College has a beautiful campus and it has many professors that genuinely care about the work that they do, and they are willing to help students outside of class."
College Sophomore,4,Always feel safe. Rarely hear of incidents where issues occurred.
College Sophomore,4,Alumni are always supportive of current students and recent grads. Lots of employment opportunities through Central connections.
College Sophomore,4,Great school. Great atmosphere. Great professors.
College Sophomore,4,Huge student involvement on campus with athletics. Not as much support at games as one would hope but school spirit remains high
College Sophomore,4,I love my campus size! Small enough that you feel welcome and know people yet just large enough that there will always be new people to meet! Great professors and staff!
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt as though I have been in way of danger at any time while on campus. The atmosphere is caring and safe, and I feel comfortable walking around alone at night. Security is always available if a student feels uncomfortable, but I feel that they rarely get called to walk with students because most feel as though they are not in any danger."
College Freshman,4,Central College offers a variety of job and internship prospects and gives the students multiple chances to find these things. Alumni also play a large part in helping current Central students find jobs in the field that they have chosen. The services and opportunities on campus to learn and get involved with what you wish are phenomenal.
College Freshman,4,"The courses at Central College are phenomenal and the professors truly care about helping you. There are many courses offered, however sometimes it may be difficult to find courses you are interested in. Class sizes are generally small which allows for more time with the professor and more group discussions. It is easy to reach the professors at any time and they provide many options for you to contact them to get help."
College Freshman,4,"I love living in Gaass, which is a co-ed building around the middle of campus. It is convenient for classes in most buildings, there is a great social atmosphere and the rooms are large. I have made most of my closest friends through dorm life and would not trade living in Gaass as a freshman for anything."
College Freshman,4,"Many of the students at Central College are involved in athletics, as coaches and professors make it easy for students to be involved in many different things. The school spirit is a huge part of Central and the student section is always full at games, meets and matches. The facilities are wonderful and are soon being renovated to make them even better and more welcoming and inviting to non-athletes and community members."
College Freshman,4,"Central College is a fantastic place to learn and grow. The professors are friendly and helpful, the city is open and welcoming to college students, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus and throughout the city."
College Freshman,4,heath and safety is really good
College Freshman,4,The athletic programs here are some of the best in Iowa.
College Freshman,4,"Not many options with what courses you can take, but the professors are amazing and genuinely do care."
College Freshman,4,A lot of students come out of Central College with an internship and or job.
College Freshman,4,"There's a variety of housing options from gender specific to coed, townhouses to dorms, air conditioned to not air conditioned. It was easy to get the building you wanted to live in and the cost was average. There are houses closer to the athletic facilities so they have ease of access to that and there's housing around campus that are at most 10 minutes walking distance to classes. Overall, all of the housing options have their benefits, but it's easy to find the perfect fit."
College Freshman,4,Greek life organizes a lot on on-campus events and offers a variety of opportunities to meet new people and engage in community service. But there's no pressure to join because no matter what everyone works together and treats each other with respect and kindness. The biggest benefit is Greek housing because it allows for Greeks to live together and strengthen their friendships.
College Freshman,4,"I am not very involved in on-campus sports, but I do utilize the facilities. The courts and fields are great; very well kept and in great condition, same for the indoor courts. The sports teams themselves are not the greatest, but the teams are connected and I can see by going to events that no matter what they always have fun."
College Freshman,4,"I really love that upon my immediate arrival I was surrounded by a group of SOS students (an student organization that welcomes Freshman and incoming students to Central) who helped carry all of my heavy belongings up to my dorm room. Everyone I've met in this four-week period has been welcoming, warm, understanding, and inclusive in class. Professors are intellectual and personable, and they know when you miss a class. The campus at Central University of Iowa is so beautiful and peaceful, and the wild squirrels complete the sort of serene atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"There are many places to choose from, and all of them are close enough to walk to. However, late night options are almost non-existent. 

Many places give a student discount as well!"
College Freshman,4,"I don't have any issues with Administration. As long as you don't break the rules, you don't have to worry about them. They're really cracking down on parking, but they seem to be really lax on drinking on campus. But it really depends on your RA's."
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of scholarships and financial aid opportunities if you work to apply for them. The office is incredibly helpful as well.
College Freshman,4,"Okay, I'm stepping into controversial waters here. I'll do my best to explain.

First off, CUIFS is not that bad. I'll admit that it's not excellent, but they usually have a good variety of choices. Overall, the food is pretty good. You have a handful of different stations to go to and the pizza is pretty good. However, the breakfast options are nearly always the same. The donuts are amazing though.

Fred's is probably the greatest place to eat, since you get to build your own burgers, salads, sandwiches, and wraps. There are smoothies, snacks, candy, and you can special order almost anything for meals

The cafe is pretty neat as well. It's like a lower-class Starbucks. You can get breakfast and lunch there as well.

For meal plans you can choose a 14-meals plan or a 21-meals plan. You can only use 4 a day, and you can't use more than 2 a meal. They do not roll over, and renew every sunday night, so you need to use all of them to get your money's worth. You can use excess meal plans at Fred's if you want to stock up on snacks! Very helpful if you haven't reached your max of 4 that day."
College Freshman,4,"There are many options to choose from once you're not a freshman. Upperclassmen can choose to live in houses, 'pods' (four two person rooms with a central living space), and there are five dorm buildings to choose from for everyone.

In terms of cleanliness and comfort, it really depends on your peers who live in the same building. The rooms tend to be somewhat small, but they aren't cramped (except Hoffman from what I hear). Graham and Gaas have the largest rooms.

The process is pretty simple as well."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Graham Hall, all girls.  It's always clean and the staff are very kind and friendly. I wish there was more involvement by each floor, and that we utilized the community space more often."
College Freshman,4,You get really close with the professors
College Freshman,4,It helped a lot for my freshman year
College Freshman,4,Theres not very many parties
College Freshman,4,They gave me a presidential Scholarship.
College Senior,4,We have really up to date classroom technology. Our academic buildings are very green friendly.
College Senior,4,There is always something for students to do on campus.
College Senior,4,"If you want to get involved, you can find it."
College Senior,4,It's a lovely community environment.
College Senior,4,"There are various computer labs found in the multiple buildings with enough computers to accommodate the students. The printing on campus has changed over the years as students were before open to print as much as they needed, but now are restricted to only $18 per semester of printing. The network speed is fairly slow and frequently the students are faced with internet problems throughout the year. The need for a personal laptop is pretty essential for a convenient lifestyle, but the college successfully provides computer access and printing."
College Sophomore,4,I received a lot of help applying for financial aid and was explained everything very well.
College Sophomore,4,There is very little campus crime and there is a great emphasis on personal safety.
College Sophomore,4,We have excellent equipment and teachers available and the workload is not extremely stressful.
Niche User,2,"Nice teachers just the college is too expensive. No one can afford it at all, I know someone who graduated over 10 years ago and will be paying for another 10! 
There is no party scene and not much to do in Pella. Every semester the tuition goes up. There are a lot of nice people there but it just wasn't worth it to me. The teachers will challenge you and expect a lot from you. This is a good school for people looking for the small town and thirty churches vibe."
College Junior,2,"Our Greek life is dying out and if we don't get it the boost it needs, it could be non-existent pretty soon."
College Sophomore,2,Hardly a part of campus.
College Freshman,2,"You have to live on campus all 4 years at Central College. The Pods are the best place to live in my opinion, but you have to pretty much be a senior to get in. The options are very very limited."
College Freshman,2,No one goes to the football games. Or any games for that matter.
College Freshman,2,"Central College is very boring. Although the professors are great, it does not offer the whole college experience which is what I was looking for. Pella is a great town, just not much to do. The academics are great for the most part, but not as many opportunities as I hoped for. Very small campus, so I feel as if I already know everybody. If you don't play a sport, you are constantly asked ""why you chose Central"""
College Freshman,2,Not much partying goes but on weekends you can often find drunk people.
College Senior,2,There are hardly any healthy off campus options.. mainly fast food.
College Senior,2,"The city of Pella and the campus of Central College is extremely safe. There are rarely any sexual assault/safety problems on or near campus. The occasional theft will occur, but I've never herd of anyone being pick pocketed or been in a violent situation."
College Senior,2,I don't think Central has a lot of diversity on campus. A very large portion of the student-body is white-caucausion born and raised in the United States. However we do have a few international students from our study abroad locations.
College Freshman,2,The Fall/Spring is pretty good but the winter is horrible because of the many pathways and they crazy Iowa weather it makes for many slick spots
Recent Alumnus,2,small town with few places to eat -- there are a couple chains that you need a car to get to or a bike if the weather is nice. Nothing is open on Sundays except for HyVee
Recent Alumnus,2,not many local attractions kept me in town if I had another option to go to a bigger city that was close -- it's only main attraction is Tulip Time in May which brings in a ton of people for the weekend of festivities
Recent Alumnus,2,hardly any greek life at Central -- I didn't even know we had greek life until junior year and I met someone in a greek org
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not many bars, dry campus and getting pulled over by cops on your WALK home do not equal a great time for night life..."
College Sophomore,2,"Pella is small, and not to many bars. There is also a lot of people from the town who go to them, not just college students. "
College Junior,2,"If you're going to force your students to live on-campus you should at least have the courtesy to provide quality housing. While some dorms are very nice there are other dorms and houses that are terrible--no air conditioning, no kitchen facilities, outdated facilities, broken appliances, gross carpet, etc. The head of Residence Life is also not very easy to work with, though most of the hall directors are grear."
College Junior,2,"Some of the athletes can be extremely entitled and rude to other students on-campus, despite the fact that Central is no where near being the top school for athletics."
College Junior,2,The lack of support for Greek Life from the administration really hurts the entirety of Greek Life. So many events are hosted by Greek Life each semester but it is still an organization that is never advertised as being part of the Central community.
College Junior,2,"The college is based out of Iowa so, of course, the weather can be unpredictable."
College Freshman,1,"no alcohol, and if you are caught with it, you immediately get written up, despite your age."
College Senior,1,"Greek life at Central is bad! They are not nationally affiliated, no one really goes to the parties they throw. They do small community work only because I think they are required to. You don't have to be a part of the sorority or fraternity to live in the greek housing. Its just a pretty lame situation."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Central is in the middle of nowhere.. you can fly out of des moines, which is 45 minutes away, but it's a small airport and doesn't fly everywhere. you need to find a ride with someone -- not many buses or trains available in the area either.."
College Sophomore,1,"With the low amount of students over the past year, to be a full-time student you need to live on campus. This isn't just recommended but implemented by the school. "
College Junior,1,They sell more parking passes than spaces available for most lots. So if you get back late...good luck finding a spot because your entire lot will be filled.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no options for transportation besides driving yourself with your own car.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no campus life or student life, unless you are part of the campus ministries. With such a small student body many clubs don't have the ability to host cool large scale events. The activity board hosts cool events but there still is never anything to do on the weekend. Many people go home every weekend."
College Freshman,1,most people on campus or white students. Central has been trying very hard to recruit students of other ethnicity as well.

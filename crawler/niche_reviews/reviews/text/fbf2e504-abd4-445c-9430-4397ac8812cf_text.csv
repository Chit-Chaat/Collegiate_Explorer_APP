Freshman,5,I am taking some classes online. The professors work hard to make the online platform engaging and the classes flow smoothly for the most part.
Niche User,5,I visited this school numerous times and it has a friendly atmosphere. The campus is clean and the staff are happy to assist any student.
Niche User,5,My friend did an online course and they were happy with it. They said it helped them for their current job as an accountant. The online platform is easy to use and it is great if you want to study from home.
Freshman,5,I got enrolled this semester so my only experience with Southern Adventist University is online. They are very kind with their conversations. They never use harsh words like many people do. I make mistakes and ask question repetitively but they never say anything harsh in return. They help their students in every way that they can.  There website and e-class is well organized so it's pretty.
Freshman,5,I would recommend Southern to anyone who is planning to attend college. This is the best place you could ever imagine to be. I got enrolled for online class this semester meaning that I did not get on campus but the people are so caring that I can't wait to study on campus. I contact the staff members daily via email and zoom but I feel like I've known them for years. I am international student from Ethiopia and English is not my first language but they tend to understand me a lot. They are very welcoming regardless of your personality. I got on virtual tour and the campus is so beautiful. The professors and advisors are caring and loving too. The school is well organized. If you are facing any difficulty there are people praying for you so you won't feel the burden alone. Above all your spiritual life will grow. So I love everything about Southern Adventist University!
Junior,5,"Southern Adventist University is one best colleges out there. The academics are top tier, and the professor really care about you. They focus on both your education as well as your spirituality. The students are so friendly, and you can find great friends."
Junior,5,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to move everything online. The professors were very understanding and did there best to make sure we were up to date on our work. They were more than willing to work with me, and I truly enjoyed each and every class."
Junior,5,"Southern Adventist University is a great school! If you're looking for a university that is diverse with friendly Christian students, Southern is the place to be! With the university being on the smaller-side, you'll be sure to not have more one on one help from your professors, but  you'll be sure to make life-long friends in the process."
Graduate Student,5,"I attended SAU from 1997-2003, went back for graduate classes in 2012, and will be returning for more graduate classes in the Fall of 2020.  I have always appreciated the family-feel of the campus, the diversity represented in the student body, and the ability for me to learn close to home."
Senior,5,"I love Southern! The professors are wonderful and are always there for you, the staff are friendly, and the resources are excellent for my field. I always feel safe and happy on campus and I have lived in their residence halls for the last three years! I couldn't imagine graduating anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,Southern Adventist University is a great college. The teachers really care about their students and offer a lot of support to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to SAU this past fall from a community college. I was very satisfied on how smooth the transition went. The faculty is so wonderful, the environment is friendly, and the student body is so diverse! One thing that I would like to change is the amount of tuition. It is so expensive and unfortunately, I know students who are not coming back this upcoming spring semester due to financial issues."
Senior,5,Southern Adventist University is a great school to attend. It's a smaller school compared to state schools although you will be paying a high amount for it. If your looking for a school to party at then this is not the place for you.
Niche User,5,"I visited Southern this past weekend and it appeared to be a great school with tons of possibility! The people are nice, the teachers are nice, and the environment in general seems like a great Christian college."
Junior,5,SAU is a great school and they truly care about their students. They tirelessly worked with me to get me the funding I needed to financially clear and that was a great blessing for me. The professors there care about my educations and they go out of the way to give us any help we need
Niche User,5,It has a wide range of diversity which is an important part of student life. The activities held there are amazing and fun. The campus there is beautiful and very close by to a lot of really cool places. Professors are nice and the dorms are pretty well done. There are a lot of opportunities here and they are willing to be very helpful if you need anything. Overall an amazing enviroment and feeling right when you enter. There are amazing students who lead by example and take initiative.  Everyone here seems to be enjoying their time and are filled with Gods love and presence.
Sophomore,5,"Southern is truly an amazing school. There's so many opportunities here, not only academic. The spiritual aspect of it really good, but only if you make an effort to attend worship services and life groups, aka, Bible studies. They could definitely make some improvements on food services, but we're surviving. The professors seem to actually care and want you to succeed. The community here is wonderful as well. Definitely recommend studying at Southern. The investment is worth it."
Junior,5,"The people and the community are excellent. The professors genuinely care about you and seek your best interests. It just truly feels good on campus, which can't be said about a lot of places."
Senior,5,Souther is an amazing environment. Not only for learning but for growing as an individual.  The professor and staff care about you and your education.  Southern is without a doubt been the best college for me. I am so thankful for everything the staff and professor have done and continually do.
Sophomore,5,I love my university. Our campus is beautiful and very diverse. You can get involved easily. SAU have a lot of programs and activities that contributed with the community. The only thing isn't great is the campus food.
Sophomore,5,Excellent Christian Learning institution. Its a great area to attend school because it slowly developing and the instructors are amazing. I would encourage anyone considering especially the nursing program to check out SAU
Junior,5,"I'm currently a junior attending this school and I absolutely love it! Beautiful campus, good teachers, great student life, outstanding academics, and pretty good food. :)"
Sophomore,5,"Southern Adventist University is an amazing campus with a spiritual student Life experience, healthy food options, and professors that truly care about your success. I have found that being a part of this University is like being a part of a big family. I feel safe and well prepared to head into the real world after my experience at Southern. Many resources are provided to all students in order to help provide them with the highest possibility for success. While having excellent academics and dorm life, Southern also teaches it's students morals and good ethics to carry with them after graduation. Attending Southern Adventist University was the best decision I could have made in order to feel the most prepared in obtaining a successful career."
Freshman,5,"It is my first year at Southern Adventist University. When I first got here I was not sure what to expect especially considering how it was never even one of my college options. Being here has definitely changed my view of this university and now I don't see my self being anywhere else. I love the diversity and community, and the spiritual environment provided by the university."
Freshman,5,"The diversity of the student body, how affordable it is, the many opportunities and majors the school offers. I am currently pursuing Construction Management and love it so far. I get use what I learn in class and put it to work later that day. Southern offers so much and is so worth it to whoever is looking for a college. They have everything from Business to Education to Art and finally Construction."
Junior,5,Southern Adventist University has some of the most caring and loving professors in the area. Always looking to help students succeed. Great campus life as well
Sophomore,5,"Everyone here is caring. From fellow students, faculty, and other staff, everyone cares about you and make you feel like you're part of a big college family."
Sophomore,5,"I very much enjoyed the one year I attended Southern Adventist University, and part of the reason I'm applying for this scholarship is so I can go back. There are so many neat opportunities there than you won't find anywhere else in life. You can learn so many new things and participate in so many activities such as sports, 5ks, service opportunities, music, and more."
Senior,5,"I am truly enjoying my experience at Southern. The staff genuinely cares for your success. The atmosphere is like no other campus I have been on. They have a strong religious base but it is not at all “preachy”. As a non-Adventist arrending an Adventis school, I was unsure of what to expect. But what I have found is an enclusive atmosphere where your opinions are welcomed and culture is embraced. This is my second time attempting college. It was a huge decision to make and it was a very freitening experience initially. However, I must say that the love and support that is shown by my professors and classmates has been so overwhelming that my anxieties dissipated very quickly."
Sophomore,5,I love the fact that the campus encourages a Christ like character and around all class material  is focused on Christ. Professors offer real life application to everything that we learn into our personal lives. I would love to see more availability in the parking zones on campus.
Senior,5,"When I previewed Southern, I knew that I wanted to be apart of their community. The campus is beautiful and the student life is a welcoming experience. Everyone is always involved, and it really shows how much the staff care about the student opinions about how the college is ran. I enjoy my time here."
Freshman,5,"It's a relatively small campus with about 3,000 students, which means you get to know a lot more peopke on a more personal level. The staff are amazing; they'll invite you over to eat and talk and are always available if you have quesions. The campus itself is sort of tucked away in its own little community and has a nice feel to it. If you like the outdoors it's even better because of the 35+ miles of biking and hiking trails. There are several restaurants on campus that are worked by the students and have a wide variety of food choices. Finally, the spiritual side of Southern is beautiful. Everyone is so welcoming and always has your back. It's a big, beautiful family."
Niche User,5,"I loved Southern Adventist University, it was super nice. The campus is beautiful and everyone is also very nice and it kind of feels like a home and family is around you."
Freshman,5,"I love this university so much. Great friends, great spiritual attitudes, and a LOT to do on campus!"
Senior,5,"i love southern, its a great place. It is a place i can feel safe and know i am getting a great education. I would recommend this college to everyone i know."
Freshman,5,"I love this school. You can see just how Christ centered everything is, from the events to the professors. The only other thing I would change would probably be the food."
Freshman,5,"Southern offers a great experience, with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Professors are superb, down earth and very helpful. Academically Southern provides a strong foundation in most majors, and also provides numerous services to ensure each student's success."
College Sophomore,5,The teachers help us make portfolios so then we can succeed in getting jobs and internships.
College Sophomore,5,We don't have any professional teams but we do have inter-murals and most people participate in it or support it. Plus we have a wonderful fitness center and a lot of great fitness classes to lead a healthy lifestyle.
College Sophomore,5,Southern has done a really great job in making each student feel important but also the small class sizes with great professors make this school really impeccable
College Freshman,5,The professors and faculty work very hard to give all students the opportunities they need to graduate with a sense of direction.
College Freshman,5,Campus security is very efficient on campus as well as very respectful to the students. They are strict with reinforcing important rules to prevent dangerous situations.
College Freshman,5,"The campus at Southern is what captures most of its applicants. State of the art facilities and equipment to work with are definitely appealing. Gym, recreational and other facilities are also available for round the clock use. Everything that you may need is here for the student's use."
College Freshman,5,The professors at Southern are amazing. They care about each and every student in their class and are more than willing to help them if needed. I have had no problems with asking my professors for help in the class. Each of them made it comfortable to approach them with questions and not once did I feel intimidated to talk to my Professor.
College Freshman,5,"At Southern, we don't have any Varsity Sports but we do have Intramurals. When I heard that Southern didn't have varsity sports, I was very bummed out and felt that they should have varsity sports. Once I was involved with Intramurals, it got me thinking and I realized that we didn't need varsity sports because we have so much involvement in intramurals. There is so much fan support that it feels like we are a part of a varsity team! I love the sports program at Southern and I think that intramurals involves everyone instead of a small group of people."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Southern is unforgettable. I know that I've made lifetime friendships and many memories that I will look back at and wish to do it all over again. Southern is unique because everyone is so nice and caring towards each other. You walk on the Ellen G. White stairs and even though people are out of breath, they still make an effort to smile or even say hello!

I was so scared going into Southern as a Freshman but the minute I got there, I felt a sense of comfort. I felt at home at Southern which really helped me because I thought I was going to get home sick way more than I did.

I know that Southern is the best school for me and I would go back in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,5,Drugs are not a major problem on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Crime on campus is very low, very safe environment."
College Freshman,5,They are difficult but there is plenty of help on campus.
College Freshman,5,It's very scarce. Those who want it go off campus but they can still get in trouble.
College Freshman,5,I feel safe on campus at anytime of night and they have an app to alert students to threatening incidents on campus. The campus safety people do a good job and we are only a few minutes from the fire and police station.
College Sophomore,5,I walk around at night freely without worrying about being assaulted or harassed.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school made a lot of good friends here.
College Sophomore,5,has good programs that lead to careers
College Sophomore,5,One of the best nursing programs. Incorporates God into the program and helps grow their students spiritually.
College Freshman,5,"To the best of my knowledge, there has been little crime on campus over the last year."
College Freshman,5,"The social atmosphere at Southern is great. I've made more friends in one semester at southern, than I did in four years of high school."
College Freshman,5,"If I did it all over again, I would still choose Southern Adventist University. The people at this school are very friendly. The academic programs are very informative. Most of all, the faculty treat the students like adults."
College Sophomore,5,"There have only been a handful of offenses in the past few years, and each were handled quickly and efficiently. I feel very safe with campus safety monitoring the campus. We also have frequent fire drills and escape plans are readily available in each building."
College Sophomore,5,Well put together and great sportsmanship.
Freshman,4,Southern Adventist University is famous for its greenery. The campus scenery is eye-catching and beautiful. The people here are all very friendly to each other and the professors here are supportive and understanding.
Freshman,4,"Southern has this online system called eclass where students and teachers submit and post assignments. This site has grades, assignments, zoom recordings, announcements, and everything a student needs educational wise. Also, the people that can't attend class in person can attend class through zoom."
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere at Southern and how committed they are to have students follow God. I also love the weather here right no though it was hot in Summer.
Senior,4,"Most students come to Southern Adventist University earnestly seeking, or at least expecting, to grow their relationship with God. I was that way. Southern does offer many ways to worship, however, they have a requirement for students to show up to a certain amount of secular worship services. This is one issue I personally have with Southern. Southern has an underlying agenda in these ""cultural services"" where they force you to listen to a one-sided political discussion. I believe that each student should be left to make their own decisions on where they stand, especially freshmen, who are still developing mentally. In my opinion, Southern should focus more on assisting students on their journey of spiritual, mental, and physical growth rather than trying to direct them."
Junior,4,Classes online at Southern are made simple. The professors make sure to give you all of the resources needed to excel in their class.
Junior,4,"Southern Adventist University successfully fulfills its mission: ""Grounded in Jesus Christ and dedicated to the beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, we equip students to embrace biblical truth, embody academic and professional excellence, and pursue Spirit-filled lives of service."""
Graduate Student,4,"While I prefer in-person learning, the online option has proved to be highly beneficial as I have gone back to school to work on my Master's while also being able to still work a full-time job."
Senior,4,"While I would say that the campus normally is set up for in-person classes, Southern does use an online system to work with students remotely, which has definately helped when school closed for the pandemic - in that reguard, the school was well set up for online learning. There was a learning curve to get used to zoom classes, especially since some professors primarily teach in a classroom and were not as familiar with online systems, however, I was really impressed with the amout of effort that Southern put in to making online learning as simple as possible. For my own experience, I think that web-based classes went fairly well, especially for how campus classes are normally approached."
Alum,4,"The classes I had the chance of taking online were good and ran smoothly. Ofcourse there are some teachers who probably had a difficult time leading online, but an okay experience."
Alum,4,"It’s an amazing school, great experiences. To be frank there are some failures, as all schools do; but nonetheless those are years I would never forgets. Some amazing teachers and mentors! Great environment to meet many people from different countries and parts of our own."
Junior,4,"My time at Southern has been great. You get what you look for at this school. The professors are great, and the campus is beautiful!"
Sophomore,4,Southern is an awesome University. The campus is nice and most of the faculty and staff are looking for you to succeed.
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus with a diverse student population. Professors are knowledgeable and caring. The Nursing program is well respected in the community and produces excellent nurses with phenomenal testing statistics. The crime rate is low on the campus and well patrolled by security, providing a safe environment. Being a private christian college the tuition is high, even with financial assistance, it is very pricey."
Freshman,4,I love how friendly all of the staff at Southern Adventist University is. They all want to see you succeed and care about each student personally. It is easy to feel welcome and at home at this school.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Southern has been well so far. I have not been able to find many opportunities to branch out, but also I am extremely shy. The professors are courteous and offer an abundance of help when asked for it. The workload isn't hard for the classes I am taking, it does require a lot of time"
Sophomore,4,Overall it has been a good experience I've made wonderful friends but the school does lack help in the  food areas and although there are some great Professors on campus there are some who truly do not know how to teach and we students suffer because of it. Dorm life is alright  but admin should give more attention to our needs in the dorm.
Sophomore,4,"I would say this is a great school. For the most part, the majors they offer are well rounded. Though they can improve in certain areas. I noticed that they invest more in certain majors and buildings for those majors than others. For example, nursing and religion. I think they can improve others as well. I also think that they can serve better food. They serve such unhealthy food which is ironic for being adventist and for preaching about the health message and all."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Southern Adventist University has been quite positive. The campus (complete with lots of green space) is beautiful, the food is tasty and there are several options, and the classes are informative. Also, Southern does a great job of coordinating fun events for students to attend, from concerts to 5k’s, and they often bring in great speakers. I can appreciate the emphasis on service here, and all the Student Life Groups and mission opportunities appeal to me. I have been assigned an advisor for my major and an advisor for first-year experience, so I am aware of school requirements and fully equipped to meet them. Although I had very fast transition, all the heads of the different departments worked with me to make sure I could meet all the upcoming deadlines.  If the student workers had been better trained on customer service and their job description, it would have been much easier to get the information I needed."
Sophomore,4,"Great school, great atmosphere, great people. Just don't expect a complete Christian experience because some people don't care."
Sophomore,4,Southern is what you make of it. You'll find anything you're looking for. Look for Christ and the right things and you will find them.
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of the campus. Although it was not my first choice, I really came to love SAU and what it has to offer."
Senior,4,I have really enjoyed the Life Groups and making new friends.  Customer service is improving. Better communication noticed
Freshman,4,"I had a good experience, but the only thing wrong was the financial department. They are just extremely stingy with scholarship money..."
Freshman,4,This university has quality professors and a lovely campus. It is a mission-minded school. The cafeteria is one of my biggest concerns simply because the quality is rather a disappointment although it serving an all-vegetarian menu is quite different and refreshing.
Freshman,4,"Southern Adventist University is a fantastic college. If you are looking for a christian-family-like atmosphere, I highly recommend it.  However, for many, the college may feel restricting. No shorts to class, No jewelry, and Mandatory Worship credits are just a few examples. If you are also looking for a killer party scene, don't come here. Most of us come from religious backgrounds in our education, like private schooling or home schooling. That being said, I have never met so many nice and caring staff and students at SAU. Though this college may not be for everyone, it suites my needs, and I am very happy here."
Niche User,4,"I visited this college and I loved the close knit feeling of the community. All the students were very friendly and warm, providing a comfortable atmosphere. I would, however, like to see the dorm rooms improved."
Graduate Student,4,"Love this place! The mountians and the outdoor feel to eveything is wonderful. I never want to go back to Jersey unless God sends me there, but not my own choice! The people are wonderful and very nice and would even give you a ride to your house if they see you struggle with a package from the post office. Overall I do not regret coming to SAU it has definitely been an experience!"
Senior,4,Southern Adventist University is the great college to learn about not only God but also the life. This school gives a lot of opportunities to get closer to God.
College Sophomore,4,There is always things to do on campus and so living off campus you might be missing those fun times!
College Sophomore,4,Most students who graduate get hired
College Sophomore,4,Some of the professors are not the best at teaching.
College Sophomore,4,There have been a few cases of assault.
College Freshman,4,All the professors are fantastic except for maybe a few who should try harder to make the classroom content relatable. Specifically general education courses could be improved. Most upper division courses are amazing!
College Freshman,4,The dorm rooms are very small but the community life is really great! There are lots of fun dorm activities making it easy to make friends. There is a shared bathroom between two rooms which is convenient. The dorm rooms seem a but overpriced but when an upper class man there are other options for housing.
College Freshman,4,I would most definitely choose my school again it is made up of the greatest staff and friendliest people. It is easy to make friends and the campus is conveniently organized.
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have varsity teams but we do have intermurals which is just as fun. Also the gym is super nice, it encourages you to work out."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly love the campus and the events our school has especially Studio 4109. I would say if you're a freshman or a transfer, go to at least 3 events. You'll meet nice people and it's fun."
College Freshman,4,"What I have seen of Southern Adventist University so far has been wonderful. I am an enrolling freshman but during my visit to the school the atmosphere and campus itself became a place where I felt I was encouraged for success and also at home. For me to feel this ""at home"" comfort is truly amazing because I am originally from an island that is at least 700 miles away from the closest neighboring nation. I am pleased with SAu and very confident about my future years to spend here."
College Junior,4,"If your looking to work in an Adventist system, an Adventist degree is the way to go."
College Junior,4,You can easily pick out the professors that are super passionate about the subject they teach and their students.
College Junior,4,"Campus Safety officers are nice, but many students wish they would carry guns."
College Junior,4,"There are no varsity sports, but intramurals are a big thing on campus"
College Junior,4,"Staff and faculty are friendly, although its hard to be able to get in contact with them sometimes."
College Freshman,4,"For me, I am a nursing major and Southern built a nursing building that is partnered with Florida Hospital. I've heard that if you graduate from the nursing program at Southern, Florida Hospital will consider you above people that haven't graduated from the nursing program at Southern."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe and secure at Southern. Before coming to Southern, safety was a big factor for my dad to let me stay. Once he saw that there was ""Campus Safety"" roaming around the campus many times a day, he felt peace leaving me there. I haven't felt unsafe at Southern so far!"
College Freshman,4,To live on campus is amazing! I believe that you get the best social skills while living on campus. Why? I know many many people who live off of campus and they just come to school to go to class and then they leave. Living in the dorm pretty much forces you to be social because you are living with so many people! The dorm is where many of my best memories were held.
College Freshman,4,I have never experienced nor seen a crime in campus. I think that the campus is really safe because there are campus securities all around the campus. They go around the campus all the time to check whether there are any dangers occurring or not. I really do feel safe in the campus.
College Freshman,4,"Living in the dorms was fun. First, getting my stuff into the room and organizing all the stuff was tough at first time because there were just a lot of stuff to organize and move, but I consider that a part of living in the dorm life. The room was nice. The desks and beds and the rest were nicely placed and easy to organize. The best part of living in the dorm was that my roommate and I stayed on the first floor, which made everything so much easier. Whenever we were in a rush, since we are on the first floor, we were able to go to places quicker than anyone else. Also, the people in the dorm socialize a lot that it's really fun! The cost is a bit too expensive for how the room is right now, but it's pretty nice."
College Freshman,4,"I think the intramurals in Southern is a huge part of campus life. I first thought that no one would really want to participate in any sports, but surprisingly, a lot of students participated in the sports and also, there were a lot of fans/students supporting the ones that are playing in the field. 

The athletic facilities in Southern are REALLY nice. I was surprised by how nice it was for both athletic and non-athletic students. It's free for the university students so I enjoy going there all the time and get my workout done.

I LOVE IT!"
College Freshman,4,"My first year at school was great. I first came to school not knowing anything and not knowing anyone at all except for my roommate and several of my friends. But as I started attending the orientations and courses, I got to know SO many people and I am currently friends with them now. Southern Adventist University provides so many activities where students can bond with each other and where students can enjoy and have fun. The worships and convocations are sometimes too much for me to attend every time, but every time I go, it was a blessing experience. I really enjoyed my first year and I can't wait for more fun experiences at Southern."
College Freshman,4,There are many resources in the school that helps us be able to look for different options that we need.
College Freshman,4,When you are having trouble in a class the professors make sure to let everyone know that they are available to help whenever we need it.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy living at the dorms.
College Freshman,4,"Southern doesn't just make sure to give its students the education that it needs, but it finds way to bring people together and to make the student body like a family. It strives to give its students the best overall experience."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are easy to talk to and willing to help students.
College Sophomore,4,Hulsey Wellness Center is amazing!
College Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, great location, amazing professors who care about their students, excellent professor:student ratio."
College Freshman,4,I am a minority and I am loving it. Every once in a while there are random issues but they aren't that bad.
College Freshman,4,I would choose to come here again.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are comfy and if you are in Thatcher South the halls are mostly quiet. The bathrooms are a bit small though. Laundry rooms are pretty nice and you can even cook and get free items there.
College Senior,2,"sometimes, because they are too strict they do not even want to hear what really happened they just see the mistake and practical condemn you or hold it against you for the remaining of your time there and it can get a bit irritating. I also think they they should be considerate that our academics may take a toll on us making it difficult for us to fulfill the requirement of worships and convocation credit. "
College Senior,2,"the internet connection is the poorest connection I have ever had. The school really needs to either fix this one or get a new one because it is impossible to do anywork with such low internet connection. Also the printers are always causing problems, they are super unreliable if i have to print something it will probably take me 20 to 30 minutes to find a pinter that works or wit until they fix the one at hand. I would buy a personal printer but the fact is i wouldnt be able to maintain it with ink and paper. "
College Freshman,2,"My school is very good about having a drug free campus, but you can't blot it out completely."
College Senior,2,"I have not received much financial aid through the school, which is a bummer because it is so expensive.  I had a scholarship but it was only for one semester.  I wish they had more general, all around scholarships for students because I am not a candidate for most."
College Junior,2,"SAU is a private Christian college. There is not any options for bars/clubs, etc."
College Senior,2,"Hard to find off-campus housing, generally fairly expensive, though cheaper than on-campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,"Where Southern is located can be rather boring, it is very different from the city and what I am used to. It can however be fun sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather in Collegedale is best described as bi-polar, I never know what to expect here. It rains a lot, so you most definitely have to buy rain boots, a raincoat and an umbrella or all of the above. As the season change so does the weather, a lot."
College Sophomore,2,The school is very strict on dress code and jewelry which is very annoying. They sometimes take it too far by fining people for every little thing.
College Junior,2,"Great With Race, Ok With Gender, Poor for LGBT Folk – Adventists, for all their faults, are at least a very ethnically diverse church.  You will for sure meet people from all over the world here.  I do think a slight majority of the students are white, but the black community has a strong presence here.  I also see many latino and asian kids as well.  Generally speaking, interracial relationships/friendships are common and accepted.

Women are treated equally with regards to being allowed in all fields, and Adventists do encourage women to have careers.  Many SDA's are fairly egalitarian as far as Christians go.  However, the church does not allow female pastors in all conferences (though that has been changing slowly but surely) and unfortunately you will definitely meet at least a few chauvinistic people with backwards views of gender roles and feminism.  Ironic, because the church's theology is built on the authority of a woman they consider a prophet, Ellen G. White.  

Again, this is a conservative Christian college, so their view of LGBT issues is not very nuanced.  Gay relationships are expressly prohibited in their student manual.  Most students remain closeted due to the hostility they would likely face from homophobic classmates.

While there are Christians of different denominations that attend school here, that doesn't make this a good place for diversity of religious thought. They will shove Adventist propaganda in your face even if you aren't one.  This is by far the most conservative SDA school in the country - if you can't tolerate compulsory vegetarianism and insinuations that you're worshipping Satan for going to church on Sunday, you probably shouldn't come here.  Oh, and good luck if you believe in evolution and want a decent scientific education, 'cause you're not getting that here."
College Junior,2,"Not Exactly Safe – It seems like it would be a safe campus but, surprisingly, it's not. Girls get harassed all the time, there's always a few incidents a year with a student getting violent (usually covered up by the school) and the campus security people are brutal."
College Junior,2,Age Limit – You have to be 23 and a Junior to move off campus. Ridiculous.
College Junior,2,"Getting There – When I first got here three years ago, the racial diversity was limited, at best. Since then, I have seen a marked increase in minority presence, particularly among blacks and latinos. SAU is actually starting to look like the world."
College Senior,2,"The One Thing – The one thing that Southern was okay at was parties.. The little southern bitches drinking for the first time is hilarious. but be careful, sometimes people get killed at them parties!"
College Freshman,2,Same as Last Week – Food is very repetitive. There is no change week after week. The dining hall is a nice place to go but not always the best food. Other places on campus offer somewhat of a variety.
Recent Alumnus,2,"No Car, You Are Out of Luck – Unless you are a hot girl, if you are sans car, you are stuck on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Adventist Life – Southern, good academics, horrible food. Terrible deans in the men's dorm to deal with, made life hell on more than one occasion, and most of the RA's are theology majors so whatever they say will not be contested, so learn and get with the program.  Worship requirements are insane, I came from a conservative academy and the requirements were just as rigorous....but it's college, what the hell.  Piss poor parking situation and an overzealous campus safety waiting to give you a ticket.  Overall, if I had to do it again, I would check the no box, but such is life."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Decent Enough for Off-Campus Students – The two main buildings with classes are 8 minutes apart by foot.  With only 10 minutes between classes, you hardly ever see students taking time to socialize."
College Sophomore,2,"Southern Is Very Strict – Our campus is very strict. We are required to go to 28 worships per semester, we cannot wear jewelry, and we are required to go to all but 3 friday night vespers events (religious). We also are required to go to church on Saturdays if we are on campus (we get 4 skips per semester). All of these things prevent us from extra rest as well as study time."
College Sophomore,2,"The food at the Cafeteria is not bad...that is if you are a vegetarian. If not, too bad, you have to eat it anyway. No meat is allowed to be served in any of the on campus facilities, and the cafeteria menu has a two week rotation schedule-meaning that sooner or later you're going to get tired of what they're serving."
Senior,1,"If you want all the joy of going to the DMV paired with the convenience of a root canal, Southern is the place for you!"
Senior,1,"My teacher this semester was horrible to work with. This is not a school that does online well. Every time I needed something, she found an excuse not to help me or to make the learning process easier. I shouldn’t have to pay extra for a class I paid nearly 1k for."
Freshman,1,Well they're definitely close minded. Trying to transfer out of there is becoming beyond ridiculous getting my transcripts. Maybe I'll see some service from them in the next ten years. Also good luck getting them to deal with your disabilities. There's barely any student life here and there was multiple cases of assault my second semester reported?
College Junior,1,"The dorm has a Greek name, that is never used, but other than that Greek life does not exist."
College Freshman,1,"There is no real Greek scene, but I don't think it's missed."
College Freshman,1,"The rules are ridiculous. They really treat us like children, and I don't think SAU prepares us for real life."
College Freshman,1,"There are NO parties. If there are, they will send deans or RA's undercover to shut them down and tell on everyone who was there."
College Sophomore,1,im community and i can never find a parking. so i have to park the furthest from my classes and it sucks. plus the cost is riducuous
College Sophomore,1,Southern Adventist University does not have off campus housing.
College Junior,1,Southern is extremely strict if you are used to having normal amounts of freedom DO NOT attend Southern. I have never broken rules at Southern yet still when THEY make a mistake they will try to make you pay. I was literally always in the dorm long before curfew at 11PM. The only way I would not be is if I was studying in the library which closes right at 11 pm. On two occasion when I was not seen in my room by the RA I was going back and forth doing laundry in the hall kitchen. When not found at check someone passes by at 4 am. According to them I was not there which was a blatant lie because I am always sleeping at 4 am. I have never ever been outside my room at 4 am so they're check person did not check well. I had a perfect track record yet still they wanted to fine me. I had to have my parents email them because during them times they didn't find me during check I was on skype with my parents when I wasn't in the kitchen doing laundry. Southern is very overbearing and you are essentially guilty until proven guilty with them.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you need to get off campus, better hope you have a friend who has a car and is headed in the same direction. Collegedale has no public transportation and (when I was there) Southern only offered shuttle vans to Walmart on Friday afternoons. Hopefully that's something they've continued to work on."
College Freshman,1,there is stric tthen there is controlling your life strict
College Sophomore,1,I don't go out at night.
College Senior,1,"The parking here isn't great.  Each year more students come and the lots stay the same--no room or it's far from your destination. The female residence parking lots are bigger than the male's lots but both are equally crowded.  The male lot however is designated to only the back of the dorm which means there's a longer walk to get to the dorm.  Parking near the school buildings is over crowded too and most students have to walk across campus to not waste time looking for spaces at the next area. Receiving a parking ticket ridiculously puts a hold on your other school accounts, such as renting books, cameras, and even use of the school computers."
College Sophomore,1,"The rules and regulations at this school pertaining to what students wear, where they go, and where they live are incredibly strict. There is a no jewelry policy, no shorts, no holes in jeans, etc. If you are caught with either of these, you will be fined. Students must sign out if they want to leave for the weekend and obtain a Dean's permission. You cannot sign out to a place where there will be mixed company unless there is a parent or guardian present, and even still, in some cases, the dean will call your parent of guardian to make sure it is okay. You also must live on campus until you are 23 years old unless you live with a parent or guardian."
College Senior,1,Do your homework on your own before applying for financial aid. I have yet to receive an estimate that is accurate to what I qualify for. I believe the counselors are over-worked so they aren't able to attend to the students on an organized or efficient basis.
College Junior,1,The University Health Center is terrible. During allergy season they will blame any sort of sickness on that. (i.e. broken leg - oh its allergies.)
College Junior,1,"This Is a Conservative Christian School – ...and it's what you'd expect as far as the cultural climate goes.  Southern keeps a very tight lid on personal freedoms.  I wouldn't say it's QUITE as insanely draconian as infamous religious schools like the Mormon Bringham Young University or the right-wing fundamentalist Bob Jones University, but it's still pretty controlling.  There is a dress code that is harshly enforced, sometimes sexist and arbitrary (especially regarding gym clothes).  NO jewelry whatsoever.  You have to meet requirements for church attendance and for various programs called ""convocations"" which are supposed to ""enrich"" your time at college.  Miss too many and they'll fine you, or even suspend you.  If you are under the age of 24, you're going to be treated like a child because no one under that age is allowed to live off-campus.  The residence halls adhere to curfews and are of course gender segregated, and there is no TV and internet is heavily monitored."
College Junior,1,"Not Enough Variety – The only thing there is to eat is Chinese food and pizza, well that delivers on campus. The upside is that they do generally give discounts for the students. Outside of those options you have a drive a distance to get a change of flavor."
College Junior,1,No Varsity – Southern does not have varsity athletics. Something about being an Adventist school.
College Junior,1,I should have transferred when I had the chance. Now I'm a Junior so I'm stuck.
College Junior,1,Humidity Gone Mad – Very humid and hot every day. Many buildings do not have AC making them nearly unbearable.
College Junior,1,There is no such thing as culture in Tennessee or Chattanooga.
College Junior,1,"Old and Strict – The buildings are old and not kept up well. Also, they force you to wake up and go to worships or you get fined."
College Freshman,1,"Extremely Strict – Deans are extremely strict about mixed company. Men are not allowed in the women's dorms and women are not allowed in the men's. People leaving campus must always be in groups of three or more, and there is a curfew that dorm students must abide by."
College Junior,1,"We have a severe parking problem at Southern. As a commuter student (which simply means, I live off campus and have to drive to school), I am constantly having to fight to find parking wherever I go on campus. The designated color coded parking lots are pretty much ignored-especially by the dorm students. The campus is not overly large. In most cases, dorm students should be able to leave their cars in their designated dorm parking spots and walk to classes and the various eateries, quite comfortably. In fact, that's what I had to do, when I didn't have a vehicle. 

The solution? Put a restriction on cars being brought in by freshmen until we get more parking. After all, part of the college experience is learning how to rough it.is it not?"
College Junior,1,"We Should Be Doing Better – As an English major, I tend to lean toward Creative Writing as my niche. I can't stand literature and get very frustrated at the constant emphasis on Shakespeare, Milton and all those other very disturbed ""greats."" Unfortunately, my major seems to be designed with a very specific emphasis on those areas. 

I've had the privilege to take two exceptional creative writing courses and am dying inside at the fact that after I finish my current advanced course,there are no more writing classes for me to take.

At this point, the only option for students interested in writing for a living is a journalism track with an emphasis in media writing. Blech.

All displeasure aside, the professors in my department are fan-freaking-tastic!

Doesn't change the fact though, that the program needs fixing."
College Sophomore,1,Living on campus is like living in a prison. You are forced to go to worships and then you are fined if you are late for curfew about 3 times. It is also very expensive to live in the dorms. The rooms are also very small.
College Senior,1,"Its Only Bait – They give you aid the first year, after that, you be on yo own, even if you have good grades they dont care."
College Senior,1,Its the South – Chattanooga Tennessee dont got nothing you want. Its a bunch of red necks and nothing around. Its hot and humid so you can smell everybody.
College Senior,1,Forced Worship – The school FORCES you to get out of bed on Saturday morning to go to church. Really stupid because if they let you sleep in you could go to afternoon church. I thought worshiping should come from the heart.
College Senior,1,"Super Slow Internet – Southern's internet is like going back to the 1990s, be prepared to lose the last 8 years of progress on the internet."
College Senior,1,No Help With Internships – I wanted to get an internship but the school wouldn't help me in any way. They said an internship was useless in getting into graduate school. So I transfer.
College Freshman,1,"I have not received a good financial aid process. Loan not being fully processed, paperwork being lost, and bills coming back more than expected."
College Senior,1,A Car Would Be Best. The school is in a rural location so no buses or taxis run near it. The school does offer transportation on Fridays for people that need to pick things up in town. They also give rides to the air port and bus station in Chattanooga.
College Senior,1,"Don't Take It Lightly. Being an Adventist University, Southern is expected to have conservative standards. The dress code is strictly modest. No tank tops, shorts, or jewelry is allowed to be worn in classroom buildings. Natural colored nail polish and makeup is encouraged, however this does vary according to the professor. A policy form is signed upon applying for the university stating that the student will abstain from alcohol, tobacco products, illegal drugs and premarital sex. Violation of this contract results in suspension or expulsion. Men and women also have separate dorms and are not allowed to enter the others' halls unless signed in for a specific reason,(i.e, helping carry heavy boxes, visiting a sibling, etc.) Curfew is also meant to be kept and any violations result in fines."
College Freshman,1,"This school is a religious school, it focusses on its church and religion. Its more interested in making sure you're kicked out of your room on Sabbath mornings to go to church than helping your learn what you need to know."
College Freshman,1,"Card Readers Often Broken – There's nothing worse than getting to the dorm or your room to find your perfectly fine card won't work leaving you out in the cold or hallway. Yeah, total bull.. just your regular experience as a SAU student. Overall though, the dorms are decent, not good, but decent. The deans are generally douchbags."
College Freshman,1,Not Enough – The majors here suck. There really aren't many and the ones they do have are pretty generic. Freshman advisors are completely unhelpful in helping you choose majors.
College Freshman,1,It beyond stinks. Humid grossness and incessant and ridiculous accents. Damned awful.

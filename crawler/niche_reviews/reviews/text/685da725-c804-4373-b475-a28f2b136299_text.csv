Sophomore,5,"Red Rocks Community College is a fantastic school with a beautiful campus and excellent instructors. Classes are often very small compared to a four year college which I personally enjoy. The cafeteria has nice, cheap food and events are happening all the time. Overall, a very great experience."
Sophomore,5,Very user friendly software and navigation options for appointment making is great! I was doubtful at first that I would be able to actually learn in an online format and it turns out it is very possible!
Sophomore,5,"Online portal through D2L is well organized and provides access to all course materials, discussion posts, as well as links to supplemental materials and resources. Instructors are fair with grading and easy to reach if any help is needed. Overall my experience with online courses through RRCC has been great."
Sophomore,5,"Once you learn how to navigate the online portal, it is easy to get to you courses, view and accept financial aid, make appointments, register for classes and order books. Courses are well organized, easy to follow, and easy to contact instructors. Classes are affordable and flexible to meet your needs."
Junior,5,I just recently found a love for the online school community. The teachers that I have been assigned are truly helpful even when I was stressed out about anything they had planned for the class. I feel like I have learned a lot from taking classes online.
Junior,5,This has been a great first college experience and school to go to. Teachers are super helpful and overall care so much about the students learning as much as they can.
Junior,5,"Red Rocks Community College is an affordable and quality institution that helps students get started with their college education in the best ways possible. The instructors are very knowledgable, and truly care about how their students do in their classes. The small class sizes also make for a comfortable atmosphere. The small campus provides a sense of community. The location is also convenient."
Junior,5,"My favorite aspect about Red Rocks Community College is its community. When you walk in you can feel the presence of the people who attend, and it welcomes you. I would like to see more activities that could unite the campus as a whole. For example, a barbecue or volleyball match (but I am not sure how we can do that now with the Covid). The staff employed at Red Rocks are tremendous. The professors genuinely care about their students, and the knowledge they are passing on. I have enjoyed Red Rocks very much for the past two years I have attended. I have met many wonderful and unique people that have brightened every step of my educational journey, and I am excited to see a future thanks to Red Rocks."
Junior,5,"It has been a great school with helpful staff and teachers. I have learned so much since starting there, academically and about myself. They have an easy transfer program so I am currently preparing to transfer to my dream school."
Freshman,5,"Thus far I have appreciated my time with Red Rocks. The faculty and admissions staff is easy to communicate with and I feel that my education is being taken seriously. In comparison to other local colleges and Universities, the per credit hour is reasonable and payment options are flexible which makes for a huge relief in these hard and unknown times."
Niche User,5,"Red Rocks is great, they offer so much; all of the admin’s are super helpful and nice and I’ve had a great experience within my program."

Senior,5,"I love the small class sizes, it ensures that each student gets proper one on one time with the professor to clarify questions. There are also plenty of opportunities to get more help with tutoring on campus."
Alum,5,I enjoyed the small class sizes and the environment of Red Rocks. Free parking and there is a lot of diversity. Not to mention the cheaper tuition for the same general prerequisites that are needed for most degrees.
Graduate Student,5,"New student currently enrolled. Communication has been easy, helpful, and I love that they have a VA resource center."
Sophomore,5,"It is a very friendly atmosphere, the only problem is it is hard to connect and make friends. Since, it is a community college there are not a ton of opportunities to meet people. What I would change is having clubs and activities that work more with students schedule. Also, I had a bad experience with a professor and was trying to find the dean of students. I kept asking people where I could find the dean of students and no one knew where to find the dean of students I ended up not being able to make a formal complaint of the professor I had. I would change to have a way where if you have a problem with a professor you could talk to the dean of students a more direct contact line between the dean of students and students."
Senior,5,"Red Rocks Community College has made several changes over the last four years. They have changed the layout of the building, added new amenities like a gym, and they have improved on their academics with better teachers. My overall experiences at Red Rocks is great!"
Niche User,5,i really like the people and campus of the school. i also really like the help that we are able to access that is online or from the people on campus aswell. the process to apply was easy and there was a lot of helpful things online to help with the process.
Sophomore,5,"Red Rocks has been a blessing in my life. The teacher at this institution truly care and go out of their way to help students thrive. I used to be terrified of school, but the people here have made Red Rocks a home away from home for me."
Junior,5,Amazing community college- with excellent instructors and two beautiful campuses. Love that they have classes that are convenient for students that work and have families. It has been a wonderful experience for me!
Sophomore,5,"This college has offered me a lot of options. When I first started going here I was pretty unsure about attending. The college Advisors helped me multiple time and were very willing to assists. I wasn't very sure even about what I wanted at the time, but the advisor listened closely and we figured out what field was the best for me. My first class they had people set up to guide us to finding our classes. The professors are extremely easy going when it comes to needing assistance on class work."
Freshman,5,Red Rocks has two locations with a plethora of options for studying. It is highly affordable and has guaranteed transfer courses which makes the college a great transitioning school. The campuses are safe and friendly and the staff is always eager to help. Admissions and Administration always follows their goals of helping students start the best pathways into the future they want. The teachers are qualified and enriching and a lot of them also work at larger institutions.
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at Red Rocks and I am looking into a degree in fire science.  I feel like the professors truly support my decision and are there for me to insure my success in my future goals.
Niche User,5,"Terrific woodworking department.  Facility is really great with all the tools you need to handle complex woodworking projects. Faculty is excellent.  the introductory course is great, giving an overview of tools and techniques.  I really enjoy my fellow students, who come from a wide background."
Freshman,5,Red Rocks is amazing! Small classes and teachers that want you to succeed. My overall experience at Red Rocks has been great so far.
Freshman,5,"I think my college is outstanding, especially for a community college. My Professors have exceeded my expectations and the school does so much to reach out and make sure students always have resources to get their needs met."
Sophomore,5,"I've loved being a student at Red Rocks. The Arvada campus is beautiful, the staff is so helpful and informative, and the teachers care so much about their students and the success they have in school. I've had the opportunity to study amongst a really diverse student body and for that I am forever grateful!"
Freshman,5,"My experience so far has been great. The advisors are helpful, and the teachers I've had so far have been delightful."
Senior,5,"I appreciate the diversity of this college.  The faculty generally are concerned for their students.  The school as a whole offers various programs, events to heighten students awareness and encouragement for all who are connected to this college.  Feel like I've grown and learned a lot more than I anticipated by attending Red Rocks."
Freshman,5,"I love that the environment is very welcoming, you can talk to anybody on campus and they will be generous, help, and talk with you. 
I love that all of the professors work so hard for their students, they are there to help you if you want it, they only want the best for you.
The campus is beautiful and when it's nice outside, there is so much wild life, it is so peaceful it makes it easy to study for all the big exams. 
There are so many resources at Red Rocks that if you need help with any subject and your teacher is not available, there are others who can help."
Freshman,5,Love that it is close to where I live everyone is so nice. I love the diversity that is there love how someone is always around to answer any questions.  Love the culture.
Sophomore,5,"Red Rocks Community College has been a great experience and really helped me get back into the swing of being an adult student. I am thankful for every staff member, professor and administrator as well as every student for making this campus friendly, safe and a way to get an amazing education at a killer price. I will be sad to transfer at the end of this semester!"
Freshman,5,"The professors I have are passionate about their careers and ensuring students learn in a fun and creative environment. The school is clean, in a beautiful setting and has tons of amenities. The gym is well equipped and they have tons of activities. The transfer program to other schools is second to none!"
Freshman,5,So far I really like what I see the staff and teachers are so helpful and the students as well. I think this is a place that will help their students go far and succeed!
Sophomore,5,"Way better than I expected for a community college. Math and science are this school's strong suit, with so many people transferring to Mines. Check rate my professor before you register and you'll find awesome instructors in all departments.

Financial aid and the cashier's office are both a total mess though. For a given question you'll get as many answers as people you ask. And the people in the cashier's office are really rude, to top it off."
Niche User,5,"Great place for people of all backgrounds, whether or not you want to advance to a 4-year institution, get trained for firefighting, or take that math class you have been putting off to advance your career."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy this college. All of the professors are here to help you whenever you need it. They have a vast array of tutors and tutoring material. They are also cheap for what is offered!
Freshman,5,The campus is laid out in an easy to comprehend map. Has excellent transportation from anywhere in Denver with access from the light rail.
Junior,5,"Red Rocks Community College if filled with all students of every age, color, and background which results in a diverse, beautiful community to attend school. The classes are beneficial and programs are easily accessible for any student. I would say the only major change that would benefit everyone would be a better organization of departments throughout the school. First day of class can be a little overwhelming when classes are all spread out in a map that is sort of confusing. But besides that, staff is so helpful and communication between everyone is smooth."
Freshman,5,"Great school! Out of most community colleges, this one really stands out !  The atmosphere, is welcoming,the teachers are very helpful if you are having trouble.  I would recommend this school to any student decided on starting college with a community college first!"
Freshman,5,What I really like about Red Rocks is that they are very flexible with the classes that they offer. It is very convenient for all of the students needs and I am able to accommodate my class schedule to my lifestyle needs.
Works Here,5,"I just began working at Red Rocks Community College and I can already tell the faculty and staff are truly committed to helping students achieve their educational goals.  I have worked at other colleges/universities where that isn't the case.  Everyone, even the President, is committed to helping students!  I understand people have issues here and there and that's where I come in.  Please find me on campus and I will help you navigate any obstacles you encounter.  My job is to help students graduate!! How great is that!   I love Red Rocks Community College!  Again, if you have any issues come see me!  Ask for me at the Admissions Desk on the Lakewood Campus."
Sophomore,5,Love the teachers and staff. So many great resources to help with papers! The writing center is amazing!
Freshman,5,Red Rocks Community College is a great place to get a fair education at an affordable price. overall great classes and opportunities to succeed at this school.
Alum,5,"Loved this place! So many of the teaches are beyond exceptional. The price is right for students looking to get their associates, and the transfer process is easy to 4-year University. The advising department is great and the community of students is awesome."
Alum,5,"The instructors are very helpful in the learning process. Student activities are plentiful, and there are opportunities for clubs to keep students connected to one another and their goals."
Freshman,5,My experience at this school was wonderful. I loved that I was able to get help in all subjects and the free tutoring helped me immensely. Something that I would like to see change is the parking arrangements for students. Only because the parking is confusing to get to. Other than that great school overall.
Freshman,5,This is my first year of college and I chose a community college because I do not do well in big classes and I have enjoyed the experience and it has been helpful having the Arvada campus.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Red Rocks Community College is rather limited, however I took one of the online classes and was highly satisfied. It was easy to navigate and the professor was a delight."
Junior,5,This college has been an amazing time. I am very impressed with the level that the professors work to help us out. And I have learned much more than I thought i could.
Sophomore,5,Awesome professors that care about you learning the material. It's easy to find all the classrooms. Red rocks is a great community college that I would recommend to anyone.
Freshman,5,Red Rocks Community College is one of the best college to start of getting your degree. I came back to Red Rocks to finish my degree and I'm glad I did come back. I've never had a community who was dedicate to help you get further in your degree to pursue your dream career. The professors are genuine and understanding. Advisor counselors are very detail on any degree or certification you want to pursue in. The staff is friendly and helpful to anything you need. This is college is the best and I'm thankful I'm heading towards to my future.
Sophomore,5,"This Community College offers so many opportunities for its students, but my favorite aspect of this school is the teachers. They are always willing to help and make sure that you're getting the most out of your education which means a lot to students. They have a very diverse campus and offer a lot of out of school activities for student to get engaged. It’s not only enough to have great teachers but also a friendly campus. The campus includes a game room for any in-between class time and there’s always free popcorn in the den! Not to mention plentiful amounts of chairs and couches around for a spot to rest between classes of the occasional nap. "
Freshman,5,"I have had a great time learning with the other students at Red Rocks Community College. I have taken all of my courses on-line and found that on-line courses really worked for me. I was able to work, enjoy my family, and never miss out on school work. The teachers were very prompt at answering any questions I had, and designed the on-classes to be very student to student and student to teacher interactive. I am an older student returning to college after many years. When I was in college the first time (which was decades ago), there was no such thing as on-line courses. Actually, there was no such thing as the internet at that time; so, this was a whole new and exciting experience for me. "
College Sophomore,5,I love all of the different courses that are offered here and I love most of the teachers also. The classes are no larger than 30 people which really makes it a lot easier to learn from your teacher and to get help if you need it.
College Sophomore,5,"I am very happy that I chose to go to Red Rocks. Most of the teachers are very inspiring and helpful. The classes are stimulating and interesting to attend, I always look forward to coming to school here. The campus is beautiful and well taken care of. I would recommend this school to high school graduates and people who are wanting to go back to school."
College Senior,5,Very flexible and tons of student care.
Freshman,4,What I enjoy about RRCC is that even tho it isn't as large as a Univiristy (cause it isn't) I found it still shares the same energy and family values as one. So as an African American I'm all about the feeling of togetherness and family it's what I was raised on and in turn has helped me preserver through my academic journey.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently taking online courses with the pandemic and it is taking some getting used to. Overall, the professors have done a very good job of changing how classes and schedules look to make time for all their students. In my experience it has been a smooth transition online."
Sophomore,4,"Great experience thus far, had a slight hiccup with some courses last fall but overall I am enjoying the journey and am looking forward to getting everything together to make a transfer to a four year possible!"
Junior,4,"My online courses at Red Rocks were of better value than other online courses that I took elsewhere. The due dates and expectations of assignments were very straight-forward. The instructors took the time to give quality feedback, and communicate with students in weekly announcements and discussion posts. These courses did a good job of requiring the application of the knowledge, rather than just regurgitation of the material."
Junior,4,"I have taken courses online before Covid and also due to Covid. I am partial to a traditional educational setting therefore I cannot say my online learning experience was preferred. However, the courses that I took online, both my choice and due to the pandemic, were amazing. The professors and online formatting made it extremely user friendly and easy to access homework, online tests/quizzes, and other helpful material. The professors encourage discussion boards and I feel they are crucial for fully understanding the material and course work."
Freshman,4,Most of the professors are very accommodating and understand that things happen. From my experience more than not the teachers are some what strict about attendance. Although I have had a couple professors that have been on the more lenient about attendance.
Niche User,4,"Offers small class sizes, study abroad opportunities, job fairs, and very nice facilities for a community college including a new gym, tutoring center, and relaxation lounge."
Sophomore,4,"I like that almost everyone at this school is friendly and supportive. When I first came to college I was nervous because of my anxiety, but I felt welcomed right away because everyone would smile and welcome me which helped me feel like I belonged. They have also helped me a lot with my classes or even things outside of class, such as expenses. They try with all they can to make sure that I don't have to take loans and can feel safe both with finances and living situations."
Alum,4,Science programs were exciting. The philosophy courses and psychology courses offered great weekend options for working adults and families. I have met some amazing people and made strong friendships.
Sophomore,4,Red Rocks Community College has both pros and cons. The pros being that its the perfect school to get your associates degree or to take your prerequisite classes and transfer to a 4 year university. The cons are that it feels a little bit like high school and the campus culture is not so great.
Sophomore,4,"I really like how easy it is to find the classes I need to take and how much help everyone on campus is. The staff is so nice, but I did have one bad experience with an advisor the first year I attended. All of my teachers have been excellent and I love that it doesn't cost a fortune to go here. I love the experience I have had so far!"
Freshman,4,Red Rocks has an onsite daycare program that has amazing teachers and offers a discount for financial aid students.
Niche User,4,"My experience until now is so far so good, opportunity for online and in class and scholarships.  Beautiful area near the mountains."
Junior,4,"Red Rocks is an amazing community for the student who may not know exactly what they want to go into for a major, and just want to acquire an associates. The advisors are knowledgable, understanding, and are always willing to just sit and talk you through a problem. Then comes the tutoring, its absolutely amazing! The tutors are amazing explaining subjects to you and helping you out. But as with any college, you have to put in the effort  to go to the tutors if you're struggling. 

The college experience is good, i always said that is isn't big enough to feel lost in the crowd, but just big enough as to always meet new people."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time so far at this school. I have liked most of my teachers and I have had good experiences with my class mates. I have found my classes very interesting for the most part, and I don't tend to feel overly stressed about attending school in general."
Sophomore,4,"This is a wonderful school for amazing teachers. They hire masters in their fields, so you're sure to get a very knowledgeable prof and the odds are, a very kind and understanding one. The best things about it are the freedom you have in selecting your schedule, how many classes you take, the communication between you and your professors, the ability to work on campus, and the overall friendliness of all of the employees there. Financial aid, advisors, and tutoring are all very accessible."
Junior,4,"Red Rocks Community College is wonderful. The are always growing, changing, and seeking ways to innovate the college life for it's students."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Red Rocks Community College. Their instructors are great! Location is a bit far, but they continue to add online classes."
Freshman,4,"I have had a mostly good experience though I did have a very rocky start when I was dropped from a class for not participating. This participation drop was well before the first assignment's due date and I had the flu. Once dropped I reached out to the admin office and they reached out to the instructor who never responded to me. This greatly affected my trust for the school when it comes to communication, though other than this it's been mostly great."
Sophomore,4,"Red Rocks Community College has been a great school to attend. Everyone is very friendly, and while the campus is small, there are plenty of things to do and people to interact with. The majority of my teachers have been good as well."
Sophomore,4,I liked how helpful the teachers were and all the resources. Lots of help for students in need. Financial aid was great with keeping me up to date on what needed to be done to get money for my tuition. Also scholarship office was nice to have to get help with money to attend.
Freshman,4,"This is only my first semester here, but I find the faculty and professors very professional.  I am learning what I need and look forward to my next class."
Sophomore,4,"I really liked the professors! They seem very interested in their students succeeding.  They just got a new rec center/gym that is amazing, especially for a comm college.  They are really progressing in things like student life, honors, and connecting with 4 year universities in the area."
Sophomore,4,This is a good school if you are a non-traditional student or need to take school at your own pace. It also has a brand-new gym!
Sophomore,4,"Great school for non-traditional students, or students who need to save money before they transfer to a 4 year university."
Freshman,4,"I mean, it is a community college in Colorado. As a conservative, I personally do not approve all the ""LGBT"" and liberal atmosphere. Yet, I do like Red Rocks as a whole. My instructors are very educated, and as a student, I have a lot of resources. For example, the library, the rec center, etc. Overall, Red Rocks is a good school!"
Sophomore,4,"The school is excellent for preparation for university, also a way to get back into college. The academics are good, however I would like more extracurricular programs."
Niche User,4,"Nice community college. Close to montains, and easy access to light rail that can take you downtown for fun in the city, or to any of the restaurants nearby."
Junior,4,Great education for the money! majority of credits will transfer to other universities! Great stepping stone to a 4 year college or straight in to a career.
Freshman,4,Students are often willing to collaborate and teachers are willing to help if students are unsure of the material being covered in class.
Alum,4,"RRCC provided good academics and transition between Highh school into a University as it wa challenging but not intemidating. There was diversity and some excellent professors and It was safe and accommodating to working with schedules. There were ,outlying commuters there so not much social interaction. Wish there could have been more activities to bind students together. Overall, it was a good experience I would recommend to others!"
Sophomore,4,"I really love this campus. I drive 20 miles just to go to school here, rather than the community colleges closer to me. The class sizes are good and the instructors are excellent. "
College Sophomore,4,I would say that the Anthropology teachers at the school are good not great. They want you to work more independently as a student which is great but sometimes it seems as if I am learning the same thing from the teachers that I could by reading the recommended book.
College Senior,4,I like ithe a lot
College Senior,4,It has been overall welcoming and very friendly.
College Senior,4,They teach a lot and are a convenient option.
College Senior,4,Career placement help is basically guaranteed.
College Senior,4,The quality in the career center and the services that are offered are extremely exceptional.
College Senior,4,Super helpful and very interesting. School there is a genuinely fun learning experience.
College Senior,4,"Location is greatm. They have the program I wanted. Some teachers are terrible. But yes, I'd choose it again"
College Senior,4,My degree isn't the mist popular so classes and scheduling can be tricky. Have to take online and I don't want to. Its expensive and I do much better in a classroom setting.
College Senior,4,"Classes, pretty good. Some professors are terrible. I have been offended and disrespected by teachers at this school. They either seem to be very good or very bad."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not familiarized myself with the topics in question.  however, I know people who have studied at this school and have become successful in their career."
College Sophomore,4,"adult going back to school, from what I have read and discussed with my advisor, this college should help me streamline into going back to school."
College Sophomore,4,"convenient local, laid back environment, affordable and many payment options available to you,"
College Junior,4,the online course give my lots of flexiable to take classes and still work.
College Junior,4,I can only guess becoase my class won't start until August 2016
College Junior,4,I haven't gotten to the post grad part yet.
College Junior,4,So far so  good. classes don't start until August 2016
College Junior,4,RRCC has a great early childhood ed program.
College Junior,4,I enjoy Red Rocks community college.  they offer a wide range of  online classes.
College Junior,4,"Electrical engineering is an absolutely amazing area because i have already studied,and i know this is an area that will revolutionize the world. Red rocks community college is the ideal partner for this project"
College Junior,4,Red rocks is undoubtedly the leader in the training in colleges in the colorado . i was very impressed with their professionalism
College Junior,4,"I am planning to major in Psychology, and the program there is excellent. I have enjoyed the professor that I have had, and his teaching methods are unique compared to other teachers I have had in the past. I have learned and retained more information in his class than any of my other classes."
College Junior,4,"I applied late, so getting classes was a little difficult, but the instructors will quite helpful to get me into appropriate classes. I only took 1 class because I was still working part time."
College Junior,4,"I went to another school and when I transferred over, I had all my English classes transferred over. I did not have to do much. I just had to fill out a paper and get my transcript from my old school and Red Rocks told me that all my English classes that I took would transfer. I had no problems."
College Junior,4,"The class size are great. You have enough students in each, that you do not feel like you are the only one in that class, and you can learn from the other students too. The types of classes are superb. They have a class that you want to take and have a good amount of classes for everyone to be happy. The one thing that I really enjoy are the new classes that the teachers want to create. I feel like the students and teachers are really at their best in the special topic classes. At the end of each semester, the school put on a show. The shows are great to see what each student create and worked hard to finish."
College Junior,4,"Each semester the school have employers come on campus and have booths for students to take to employer recruiting. If you do any to work for someone, they have business classes where you can learn how to open your own business."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy creating the final project every semester. I get to learn so much when making a table or a bow and other items. At times the work load can be too much, but I think it is making us learn how to manage our time much better. Some of us want to open our own wood shops and knowing how to manage our time will be key."
College Junior,4,"My overall experience at Red Rocks has been a great one. The teachers really care about if you need help and that you are learning the material. One thing that makes what Red Rocks is today, is the type of classes that they offer. There are not many schools where you can take woodworking classes. I would choose to come to this school again. The price of classes are mush lower then most and the type of classes that they offer. Also every semester they keep coming up with new classes to run. It makes me want to stay and learn more. The running joke I have is,  ""I have to graduate some time."""
Freshman,2,As a student who enjoys being in a classroom setting then an online one I did not enjoy my online classes. Mainly because I didn't have a chose in the matter and secondly because I didnt feel as connected as ai should have been and even though I passed I wouldn't want to do it again.
College Senior,2,Availability of classes is terrible. And the advisors aren't aware of what the accepted electives are for different majors so I almost almost a semester of classes I didn't need
College Freshman,2,"No one is recruiting, I've never heard anything about jobs, etc."
College Freshman,2,Not enough interaction and they cost more than in-class classes.
College Sophomore,2,"The scheduling is difficult to figure out at first.  Two of my classes from a previous institution transferred, but no one provided me an explanation why."
College Sophomore,2,"I've taken a lot of classes which don't actually contribute to my major, and I blame advisers.  No one has helped me get in touch with the school I intend to transfer to, and I am unsure whether or not I will continue attending this school.  I feel like I'm paying a lot and receiving a lot less."
College Sophomore,2,The school needs to improve their technology offerings if they intend to be a technological campus.  The network outages have cancelled some of my classes before.  It's often a waste of time.  You'll need your own device here.
College Sophomore,2,"The labs are always full, the bathrooms are crowded and dirty, and the library is small for an institution of this size."
College Junior,2,"I am very disappointed with my financial aid results. Apparently, I have too much money in my 401k and savings accounts to be eligible for help. Because I've been working hard, making a living and saving money since I was out of high school... I am penalized and will not receive help. I can't get any grants or financial aid. I refuse to take out student loans. Even though community college is somewhat affordable, I am extremely discouraged in my experience so far."
College Freshman,2,Fafsa and loans are all they have
Recent Alumnus,2,The professors are great and will go out of their way to help you.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have took two. One was very easy and little work the other was extremely hard, way to much work was expected of you in too little of time."
Recent Alumnus,2,They have a very good FYI series that helps you go on and move closer to getting the career of your dreams. PS. the FYI series is free.
Recent Alumnus,2,It has been pretty flexible talk to advisers and know what to take before you take them if you are transferring so you don't waste money on classes that will not transfer.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is very good but computers are limited and if you go during a busy hour it is very challenging to get a open one.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is very good, sometimes I feel teachers expect too much out of classroom interaction though."
Recent Alumnus,2,The school is pretty good could use some more student resources though.
College Senior,2,"I did one semester of RRCC online and it was less than satisfactory. Either the classes were not nearly challenging enough (once a week discussion? Yawn!) or way too challenging to do at home, and not in a classroom. If you are good at teaching yourself your own coursework and are far too busy to sit in a classroom, then the online life is the way to go. However, if you learn better inside a classroom while seeing your teacher, then I highly suggest in enrolling in some normal classes."
College Freshman,2,Most people are just there for school.  Most keep to themselves and don't interact with others.
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of options for my major so I will have to take the majority of whats required when I transfer to a 4 year college
Works Here,1,"Terrible. Kim Klieman, Dean Rathe, Janis Eagan make that place a living hell. The staff are more concerned about the drama amongst themselves than they are the students. Instead of helping students they spend their time spreading gossip around campus this is the reason your emails get ignored, your classes are not registered or dropped, or your residency is incorrect. They are the people responsible for a majority of the admin duties at the college and should have all retired 10 years ago. They hate the students and they hate themselves, making everyone else's life difficult."
College Freshman,1,Not that great. Do not come here if you are an incoming freshman. It is the worst.
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, this was possibly my worst decision going here. Yes it saves money and it was convenient because I could live at home, but I wanted the full college experience and this is just high school all over again but worse."
College Freshman,1,I don't qualify for financial aid
Recent Alumnus,1,"They have fees for a clinic, student fees, parking fees (even if you dont park at the school) along with other fees that are not that reasonable."
College Junior,1,I was denied financial aid for withdrawing from a class even though I received all A's and B's in my other classes.
College Freshman,1,"Difficult to Explain – I dislike my school, and don't take any pride in going there. I am getting a good education but the counseling department is quite difficult to work with if you don't know what questions to ask or what to do-they do not provide that information at all, on initial admissions. However, if there's a degree coming my way, I will deal with it."
College Student,1,"Higher One, Hassle – I dislike the new higher one cap card, system,it is unfair to use a third party and have to give out my personal information. I f you opt out your penalized and it takes for ever to get your paper check."
College Sophomore,1,"Transferring Credits – I chose RRCC for many positive reasons, but unfortunatly i couldnt get credit for four classes i have taken at other schools. I really needed them to count for something. That was a lot of time, energy, and money i put into passing those classes, and i cant get credit for them untill i leave the school and hope that the university i choose will merit them. Some classes i have to repeat here at RRCC just to get credit in their particular school even though ive all ready compleated them at my other school. Thats my only problem with the schools Associates program. I cant grade them very highly sense it took away so much of my progress because of school to school semantics. I couldnt even write why it should count or what we covered in the classes ive all ready took to get some credits to count in their school. There should really be a way to get credit when youve done the classes already."

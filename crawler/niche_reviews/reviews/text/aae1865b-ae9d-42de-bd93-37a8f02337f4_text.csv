Freshman,5,Love this school! Amazing faculty and staff. Everyone is so friendly yet so engaged/engaging. Love the atmosphere and overall feel of the campus. Food is GREAT
Niche User,5,"When I went to my official visit the administrators and staff were very helpful and accommodating. I was traveling from Florida. I had to be there before 3:00 P.M. I got caught in the Atlanta traffic, on a Friday afternoon . All, were very friendly and informative. They brought me to more areas around  campus and I was able to see the football field and the locker room. After we all went out to eat  with some of the team members and other athletes who  came on the visit. I was able to get to know more about the coaches and how they were on a personal level. This is a huge commitment, making that decision knowing that this will be my home for 4 years of college and playing football. I made the commitment to go to Shorter to continue my education and play football. I know in my heart this would be the best decision for me.  I'm forever grateful for the Lord who lead me to Shorter."
Sophomore,5,Shorter is a great school! The small school environment is wonderful for personal relationships with teachers and peers. I also enjoy the campus size being small
Sophomore,5,"In the online degree studies, professors are great at providing comments and input to each week's assignments and reaching out to students with announcements and messages each week. I love that even though not being in the traditional classroom setting, I still feel involved with other classmates through weekly discussions and that the professors make an effort to connect with students."
Freshman,5,Shorter University is a small private college where the classrooms are that big. And since the classes aren’t big your  professors get to know you.

Shorter University has beautiful facilities and grounds. It has a southern charm that cannot be surpassed by any other establishment."

Sophomore,5,I love Shorter University. I am taking online courses for a degree in Christian Studies. The professors are very attentive and are always happy to help. They show a lot of interest in making sure the students are learning the curriculum and are a source of encouragement.
Freshman,5,"Shorter University is an amazing college! The main college campus is amazing because it is all together ""up on the hill"". They call it ""Shorter on the hill."" Everything is all together and the classes are the perfect size. The classes are not too big and it allows the students to create a good relationship with their professors. All the students are able to connect to each other and maintain healthy relationships. This school truly is a place where people can go to make lifelong relationships and start an amazing journey in their life. "
Freshman,5,Shorter University is a small college that offers great educational programs. The best thing about Shorter is that all of the staff really cares about you and will help you reach your goals. I feel as though had I gone to a larger college I would not have done as well. 
College Sophomore,5,"Professors at Shorter truly go out of their way to make a connection with their students. Never have I felt like just another number at Shorter. On many occasions I have had a Shorter employees go beyond their assumed responsibilities to help me with a situation. Class size ratio is typically 15:1, so one on one with professors happen often. If a student feels like they are falling behind Shorter offers a study hall and tutoring for struggling students."
College Sophomore,5,"What makes my school unique is how I feel as if I am in a different world when I am on campus. The students and employees of Shorter University are extremely kind and there is always a smiling face around the corner. If I could go back I would choose Shorter over and over again, it is my home away from home."
College Senior,5,Thus far all have been very well
College Junior,5,"My college is very focused on reaching our students' highest potentials. Also, the college contains an array of staff that are encouraging, motivated and up-lifting."
College Junior,5,Shorter University has everything I want from a school.
College Sophomore,5,"I have made the deans list twice while having one of the hardest majors, Nursing. They are very accommodating and helpful with sports traveling, confusion on material, and overall struggles. Classes are small, and we don't have the largest amount of courses offered because we are so small."
College Freshman,5,There is literally every fast food restaurant you can think of near Shorter. There are a lot of sit down restaurants too.
College Senior,5,Greek life makes up a large population of our University!
College Senior,5,The city has everything I love to eat!
College Sophomore,5,"The architecture and landscape is very good to the eyes.  The grass is nicely cut, and the buildings are kept clean."

College Freshman,5,The biggest sport at our school is Track & Field as it is one of the best in the country. All other sports are praised at the sol and school spirit is not lacking when it comes to sports. They have the schools greatest support no matter what.
College Student,5,I love my major. I am going to take a lot of Biology classes and I'm super excited. Science is my life.
College Freshman,5,i dont hear much about drugs or alcohol at shorter
College Freshman,5,i didn't have a hard time applying for my financial aid. Financial office on shorter are very helpful if i ever needed help or have a question
College Junior,5,I have never personally been exposed to drug use on campus. 
College Junior,5,LOVE the dorms. Love them. 
College Sophomore,5,"Definitely apply for the Scholars' program. I did on a whim and ended up receiving a full-ride to the school--tuition, room and board all covered. Most students are there on financial aid. However, get scholarships before you enter the school as those are locked after you actually begin classes. "
College Senior,5,"I received a competitive full-ride scholarship, very pleased! For most, there are at lease some scholarships that can help supplement the expenses. The financial aid office is very helpful and friendly."
College Senior,5,"I am a mathematics major. I am totally pleased with those involved with the math department. It is challenging, requiring a great deal of work, but professors find the proper balance between preparing you and still allowing you time to do other things. The career center at Shorter does a great job helping to prepare you to advance into the ""working world""."
College Senior,5,"Where Berry College are our rivals in some athletics (we are NCAA, they are not), outside of sports, students often interact. There is also a community college and a technical college in the area, so lots of young folks. The town is very friendly towards college kids. While it is not a big city with the typical city life, there are still plenty of things to do. Activities in the Rome area are about the relationships, not the particular place. I feel very safe in this town. In general, the town is athletic, many sports and fitness aware people. "
College Senior,5,"Rome is a quaint town with Shorter nestled up on a hill in the woods. The buildings are beautiful, the surrounding nature is full of trees and green fields. There is a nice view of the town at night from the top of the hill. The atmosphere is very friendly and the academics are challenging. "
College Freshman,5,I feel very secure in my environment and very happy.
College Freshman,5,The school wide computer are very reliable and easy to access and even include a lab that is open 24/7 hours.
College Freshman,5,Challenging and engaging courses are offered with a amazing set of teachers at the students disposal. We even offer a free tutoring center plus a free writing tutoring center. Shorter definitely offers a great academic side.
College Freshman,5,there are some very nice and affordable apartment surrounding the area. It's definitely worth the invest.
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are very helpful and are always there if you need assistance.
College Sophomore,5,The entire Christian community is very supportive and it is a great place to grow in Christ!
College Sophomore,5,The school has a very beautiful and historic campus.
College Freshman,5,to get into the teacher program is a whole different thing to getting into shorter. must pass the gace 1 
College Junior,5,our financial aid department is caring and patient. they are diligent and work hard to get things done in a timely manner.
College Senior,5,I enjoy being a journalism major. I enjoy reading other stories of different topics so I can learn what's going on in the world. It is very easy for me to find a possible internship for my major all around the world because there are alot of companies seeking great writers.
College Senior,5,"I am extremely happy with my program. My goal is to start my own magazine feature and see where it can take me in the future. My only concern is knowing where I can find a job, even though it's very possible to find employment for a journalist."
College Senior,5,"As a journalism major, I plan to intern for a magazine feature. I can able to learn the edit & design positions as well as publishing my own articles."
Recent Alumnus,5,I really love all the history teachers at my school. They are all cool. Dr. Morris has been teaching history at shorter for almost 50 years and he is smart as a whip and keeps me entertained with his lectures. Dr. Pettigrew is the chill laid back prof that makes things fun and easy. Dr. Pickle is ridicoulously smart and makes you work super her hard but you will definitely  learn a lot in her class if you like political science. Together they form the trinity of the Justice League of the history department. Pettigrigrew = Superman Morris= Batman Pickell = Wonder Woman. Great teachers who take the time after class and after flexible with the syllabus and schedule
College Senior,5,I personally feel very safe on campus because the police are always walking around making sure everyone is safe.
College Senior,5,The police are very visiable and they are alway out walking the school. This allows the students to feel safe which allows the students to focus on their academic.
Freshman,4,"Shorter University is a great private christian university. I love the close knit community, the christian environment, and classrooms. When you walk around campus, you recognize every face even if you don't know their name. There are many christ-centered events to attend or be a part of around campus. The classrooms are small and the teacher knows all the students by name and can help you out individually whenever."
Senior,4,"My overall experience with Shorter University is great. My favorite thing about it is the teachers. Mostly all the teachers were nice, they know what they were doing, and treated everybody with respect. One thing Shorter University might need to improve is probably the quality of the food since most of my peers were complaining about it."
Senior,4,"Shorter University is a very great school for anyone who wants to learn! The school is located in Rome, Ga, which is a small town in the north western part of Georgia. The school is a Christian based school and does not allow any parties on campus, which is great because you can focus on your education more! The sports teams aren’t really all that great but the Hawks spirit is felt through the campus! The school has newer building and some building a that have been there since the school was first built, which is pretty cool! I would highly recommend Shorter University to any student who is wanting to grow in their education and their faith!"
Niche User,4,"Shorter provides a safe, Christian, and welcoming environment with the accessibility of the city. I loved all of the staff and their hospitality. The dorms were nice, but needed some work. However, I temendousley apreciate that they do not have community bathrooms for the girls and that they provide a large variety of christian oppurtunities."
Junior,4,"I really like my professors at Shorter University, and I love the small class sizes because it provides students with a more personal learning experience. The professors care about their students, and they are very accessible. The school, however, lacks facilities, and the dorm halls are a bit lackluster."
Niche User,4,My experience with Shorter is great so far. I am glad that I am able to attend through dual-enrollment. It is a great program with lots of benefits and the fact that Shorter works with this program is amazing! I love the campus. It is fully stocked with necessary tools needed from the library to coffee shops that help the student keep working. I like the benefits it provides for its students. I hope to attend there in the fall of 2019.
Sophomore,4,The foundation is really good to build on.  The athletic scene is a great opportunity to be apart of a growing culture. Every Wednesday students meet at the campus chapel. I only had one teacher I wouldn't rate 5 stars. The town is a nice town with the basic essential.
Freshman,4,"The enrollment process was wonderful.  I do feel like there is room for improvement with the financial aid department.  They have not as welcoming as the other departments that I have spoken with. They are very short when answering questions and they don’t take the time to explain information.  
Ordering books through the bookstore was an easy process. There was a mix up with my books, but it was quickly and easily resolved.  I even received a sweet note with the correct book."
Freshman,4,"I like the Christian environment of the campus. The professors are really nice! However, the dorms for freshman are obviously not that good. I am also a super picky eater so I do not really like the quality of the food in the cafeteria."
Sophomore,4,I like how all of the professors actually care about you as a person and not just  a student. They do their best to help you no matter what. They have great office hours and a lot of professors will help ypu outside of their office hours as well. The library is always helpful when you need to find something and it is also a great place to study. It's peaceful and quiet. Student life on campus is great as well. Everybody tries to get involved somehow. Sports is important at shorter but so is theatre. I like this about the campus because they care just as much about fine arts as they do the sports which is something you dont always see at colleges.
Junior,4,"The school is small,  classes are a great size, they are community service based, but the financial aid dept is such a hassle that it overshadows all the great things the school has going for it."
Sophomore,4,"A lot of people like the big college feel; however, that is not me. I love Shorter University because it is a simple college where everyone, students as well as teachers, help each other at the drop of a hat. My first year at Shorter was a great year. I held a 4.0 GPA throughout both semesters, and I have to credit that to the outstanding professors that we have here."
Junior,4,"My experience at Shorter University has been amazing since I first enrolled in the fall of 2015. The reasonable class sizes, conversational feedback with professors, and peaceful, respectful environment allows for students to focus on the education without feeling nervous, crowded, unsafe, or unfriendly."
Sophomore,4,"Shorter University has been a very good fit for me. Their academics are thorough and the professors really take time to meet with you and help you on an academic level as well as a personal level. Their sports program is a huge emphasis there, and I love sports so it fits perfectly with me. However, it is not the sports or the academics that make Shorter perfect for me, but instead it is the people. I joined the fraternity Delta Sigma Phi, and it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Growing so close to a group of guys I call my brothers has been a privilege and an honor. I have made so many lifetime friends and connections at Shorter that I would not trade for anything."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my school and I don't want to leave.
College Student,4,"The academics at shorter is literally the only good thing there is. The teachers are very linient, they always offer their time for you, and they give other options such as tutoring or study groups"
College Sophomore,4,As a sophomore my adviser is already looking for me to begin interning for the physical therapist in town. The alumni network is huge and provide a lot of money and recruiting for graduates from Shorter. Student that graduate from Shorter University stay true to Shorter.
College Sophomore,4,"Shorter is a closed campus so every one who enters the campus must go through the front gate. All students have a parking pass to enter and exit the campus that is placed on the front windshield. If you ever feel uncomfortable to walk campus at night you are allowed to call the security office and ask for a ride to your destination. The campus never feels unsafe, even at night."
College Sophomore,4,"I live in Cooper, which is a suite style room. I wish the bathroom was larger, especially since I share it with three other girls. It was extremely easy process to apply for a room, receive a roommate and move-in. For better security reasons, I hope that in the near future Shorter will install doors where you have to use an ID key to enter the building, instead of a key."
College Sophomore,4,"As a student athlete I am biased to believe my team and school is the best. Fan support is great and the professors are great supporters of student athletes. The student life center just had a new gym installed for all students, and I know I personally am excited to use it!"
College Junior,4,We have a great academic program!
College Junior,4,We are kind to all who come.
College Junior,4,"There are things going on at campus, but I guess it's unavoidable anywhere you go."
College Junior,4,We don't really have any issues in this department.
College Junior,4,"I quite enjoy my residency on ""the hill"" here at Shorter."
College Junior,4,"I was actually selected to be in a sorority on campus, but the fees were too high for me at the time. All in all, the Greeks on campus are great. I have many friends that are non-Greeks and Greeks."
College Junior,4,My professors have all been wonderful! They are all willing to help and I know they want me to do my best. I can tell they are passionate about the subject they teach and I am honored to be in their classroom.
College Junior,4,"I've already gotten summer jobs in my degree field, so it's not hard to find jobs, just hard to get. The quality of jobs for my field (musical theatre) can be terrible just out of school. But sometimes you need that first poorly-paying resume builder to get to the next job."
College Junior,4,"I love that my school is small. It makes it easier to know and keep up relationships with people, not to mention walking to class on time! The music and theatre department are small, but all the professors know their stuff and are more than willingly to work with students one-on-one. The small classroom settings for me as a performer means more stage/working time ad I love that."
College Junior,4,About 70% of the students on campus are athletes.
College Freshman,4,We have a lot of campus safety
College Freshman,4,There should be more money into the football program
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt unsafe on campus. The biggest crime issues we've ever had that I've known of are stealing and marijuana/alcohol possession. We have an emergency notification text system that keeps everyone informed. Campus safety can be slightly unreliable at times, they don't answer the phone occasionally and there have been miscommunications at times."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a small school, so classes are usually pretty small. Usually a 25-30 student maximum and a 6-10 minimum. This allows the professors to build good relationships with students, even those who have different fields of study. Professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. They could offer a larger variety of classes."
College Sophomore,4,I love a Shorter for the community. The professors are great and there are many areas to get involved in. The professors I've had have been very knowledgeable and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never heard of any kind of sexual assault or violence on campus. We are a drug, alcohol, and weapon free campus. I have also never felt threatened or scared for my safety."
College Sophomore,4,People and professors are greatly helpful with internships and jobs. They really care about your success and want to see you achieve in your field.
College Sophomore,4,Sororities and frats are not as popular at shorter as they are at other major universities. Shorter's greek life is not known for parties or snobs. They work hard for the community on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally play softball for Shorter and last year was are first year eligible for NCAA Dll. We ended up doing extremely well. We were ranked number 3 in the country and landed a spot at nationals, which was held in OKC. All of are student-athletes are very well rounded."
College Sophomore,4,"Shorter is a Christian based University. It has small classrooms and everyone feels like family. 80% of us play sports, so the work load is very reasonable. Up on ""the hill"" professors are very kind and want you to succeed! I would recommend this school to anybody."
College Student,4,Our Greek life has won many awards & are very prestigious
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people come here for sports! I
College Freshman,4,Health and safety is a huge priority on campus
College Freshman,4,Ive heard great things about it
College Freshman,4,The facilities are important and they do a good job of showing students that athletics are important
College Junior,4,"The teachers are phenomenal. Our education is phenomenal.  The food is good about 4 weekends out of the year when parents are going to be on campus.  

I wanted to live on campus while being married to my husband, but they will not let me because neither of us are RA's.  If they supported their students who are living for the Lord, then I would have rated my school as The Best."
College Senior,4,"RA's, campus safety, faculty, and staff all take measures to make campus safe and healthy."
College Senior,4,"Sororities are more popular than fraternities at Shorter, but greek life is a big part of Shorter's campus."
College Senior,4,Rome has a variety of very good restaurants!
College Senior,4,They are very helpful and friendly.
College Senior,4,"Living on campus at Shorter University is great. However, I wish that I had the option to live off campus because it would alleviate some of the finical burdens of my college education off of my parents."
College Sophomore,4,There are so many places to choose from. I love eating off campus
College Sophomore,4,"So much to do here in Rome, Ga. The night life is great as well."
College Sophomore,4,Off-Campus housing is really good and plus it is nice.
College Sophomore,4,The students here work really hard and they are really friendly.
College Sophomore,4,My school is very strict when it comes to drugs and alcohol.  They will give tickets to those in violation of visitation in dorms.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the desserts and how the food tastes.  There have been some instances of food poisoning, but I have not experienced it."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not involved with Greek life, but everyone is still nice to me.  They do not ignore me or treat me poorly due to the fact I decided not to join.  However, it is very expensive to join."
College Freshman,4,"its really fun because not only do you have great proffesors, but you also have study groups of your peers in the same major as you, so it helps you study and understand the cirriculum better"
College Freshman,4,"Getting into a major is easy, honestly. Shorter has a website just for students and their information. They send emails to you and let you know of any information that you have to do to help with admission. They also have different days at Shorter that help you get to know other students to make friends before you step into the classroom"
Freshman,2,"The teachers were great, staff were always nice. The food, dorms, and school in general needs an update. Campus life not very great, not many students attend the school."
Junior,2,"The school overall is not great. Food is bad, dorms are old and gross, and leadership is sketchy at best."
Freshman,2,"The professors are mostly good and want you to succeed. Also, there are some great people at Shorter, if you look for them. On the other hand, the facilites at Shorter are sub-par, the administration is terrible, the security is scary, and the classrooms are outdated. In addition, the cafeteria food is bland with little selection to choose from. The athletic program is cheap and does not support their athletes. Most students at Shorter that I talk with are transferring to another school. There are far better schools one can attend at the steep-price Shorter charges. ~Michael Carew"
College Student,2,"The teachers aren't so bad, the food is gross, its so expensive, the campus and dorms are less than par, the greek life is not what it should be, the sports (except track) are trash"
College Sophomore,2,barely any parties but that is good
College Freshman,2,it is very small and very lame
College Student,2,I plan on transferring unless I get a full scholarship
College Student,2,"Our track team is amazing, but other than that they are awful"
College Student,2,The school is not worth the money
College Freshman,2,The rooms are mostly terrible
College Freshman,2,The greek life takes over some things and doesnt allow non greek members to be a part of the events.
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria substitutes taste in many cases for quantity, ruining the dishes"
College Freshman,2,"Campus safety likes to give out parking tickets like candy. If you are not parked perfectly, you might get a ticket. Overall, the administration is as a strict as they should be since it is a christian school."
College Senior,2,The weight room is too small
College Junior,2,Safety doesn't do a good job this
College Junior,2,I have decided that some teachers simply do not want to teach.
College Junior,2,I have to use my own computer and net is very slow.
College Junior,2,There are not many places to choose from and of those about half are not very good quality at all.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not feel that I have the full college experience at my school. I do not feel like the student life is that great. I don't hear much of anything that goes on at our school for the students to do. 
"
College Junior,2,"Parking price is average for an institution but the fee of 25 dollars a parking violation is a tad unfair. Also I got a tow notice when I had to bring my parent's car to school (as mine was at the shop) and they(campus safety) were not open after my car broke down and before my first class to get a temporary pass. Some of the closest parking was taken away to be used by faculty and staff, and the lot is rarely half full. where as if I'm unlucky enough not to beat the crowd I have over five minutes of walking. The poor residents are not to park in commuter parking and I am of two minds about this. The shuttle drivers are jerks and are never on schedule, so if someone misses the shuttle or it doesn't show up when it should they can have a ten minute walk on their hands. however, when residents park in commuter parking that can use up all the spots ""near"" the top of the hill. regardless of were you park there is a lengthy and steep climb up to classes. My University must be the least Handicap accessible in the U.S."
Niche User,1,First semester at college they enrolled my daughter in Senior level classes and would not remove her from classes and refund us the money.  Years later still trying to get her to pay for classes that were fully paid for.  Worse experience with a college EVER!
College Freshman,1,Th entire campus gives off a cultist vibe. The staff doesn't want to engage you unless it is about Jesus. The student life needs CPR.
College Sophomore,1,Parties are very tame and Christian like
College Sophomore,1,Food in the Dining Hall is horrible. I took summer classes and it was like I was eating the same thing over and over again. I wish they have better choices of the food.
College Sophomore,1,we have no transportation services here. You must have a car or have a friend that has a car
College Student,1,Even though I have received some financial aid I still fall short of fund for this year. That is why I am applying for this scholarship.
College Junior,1,Really need to work on this
College Junior,1,My high school has 10x better facilities. Sucks
College Junior,1,our school doesn't offer off campus
College Sophomore,1,"The dining hall is the last place you want to eat at my school. It just isn't very appealing. The variety that is at the dining hall is very slim, there aren't many choices through out the day. I feel that it is a repetition of what was served earlier in the day/days. Mostly everyone would choose to go out to eat over eating at the dining hall at my school, unless they do not have the money. "
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation at my school sucks. There is very minimal parking. It is not very easy to find a spot to park when everybody is on campus. I do not feel the need for a car on campus, unless you commute and have to bring your car to school. "
College Senior,1,"It storms majority of the time especially during the summer. There is barely any sunlight on campus. During the fall & winter seasons, it would be so cold to where most of the campus would be freezing. However, classes still mainly close by for all students on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Campus Housing is awful. Shorter needs to rebuild all the dorms because they are old and some have tons of mood.
College Freshman,1,I hate the food on that campus! We serious need to get another contract with a better catering service! I spend most of my money on food off campus. What a waste of a meal plan! I won't be getting a meal plan next year!
College Freshman,1,In Rome there is often a lot of rain and tornadoes.
College Sophomore,1,"New President, New Rules – The new president has very strict rules about alcohol and residence life in general.  It's only a matter of time before chapel is mandatory and we wear uniforms."
College Senior,1,"The Campus Is Majority African American and Majority Female.  It Is a Christain Institution – This particular campus is in a low social economic area; therefore, they do not have the technology and resources that the campus' up north have, but we pay the samr tuition."
College Freshman,1,"never enough parking, must come to school if you live off campus much earlier because you can never find a parking spot, must pay 75 for permit"
College Freshman,1,"There are no facilities / amenities for dining at this campus. IT is recognized that this campus has the highest enrollment; however, only vending machines exist."
College Junior,1,"Very little nightlife.  The only big night is Thursday night, which is college night at a club and few bars."

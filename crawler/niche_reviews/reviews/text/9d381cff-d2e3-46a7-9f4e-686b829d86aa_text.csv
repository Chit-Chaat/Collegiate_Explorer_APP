Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19, all classes went online before the end of the semester.  I had no issues accessing class materials and tests.  It was a great experience for me and all my instructors were accessible and available."
Junior,5,I like the size and location of the campus as well as the class size.   The staff seems genuinely interested in helping you to be successful in your studies.
Niche User,5,I love the environment at Tusculum University!  Everyone is so friendly here and I love the union created with the athletes.
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed Tusculum. Small athletic school where regular students feel absolutely accepted. Teams go and support each other's games and something is always happening on the campus. School has a very good accreditation and professors will know you by your first and last name I can promise you that! 
Location is a little bit secluded but JC is like 30 min away."
Freshman,5,Tusculum University is a diverse campus not only in race and nationality but in sports and academics. There is no push to do something you do not wish to as everyone is free to explore there interests without pressure. As a student the community on campus is excellent as everyone is friendly and positive.
Sophomore,5,"This is my first time at a 4 year University, and a lot of my classes started out online, but I have had a wonderful experience being a part of Tusculum. My teachers are always very hands on and engage very frequently with students. The instructors also respond very quickly when I email them with a question or a concern. I would recommend Tusculum College to anyone who desires an awesome and supportive college learning experience."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior and I went on a tour today of Tusculum University and the campus was wonderful.  However, what really stood out to me was the students and staff.  They were all very friendly and encouraging.  I felt like I really belonged there."
Niche User,5,Tusculum University is a great atmosphere and has a great group of people both working there and attending school there.
Niche User,5,I liked the fact that it was a small campus and small class sizes. Everything around was easy to get to.
Freshman,5,"It is a beautiful campus. The community and family feel is perfect, along with great academics. Student support services and the many extra-curricular activities provide so much for student success. I can't wait to be a Tusculum Pioneer full-time!"
Niche User,5,I liked the feel of the campus. The way the classes are set up are great to really be involved in one specific topic. The school is very small which gives students the opportunity to feel like a family. You get one on one time with teachers because the class sizes are so small.
Freshman,5,Love Tusculum. I graduated with my first degree from there and am going back for my second. It is in a good location. The instructors are very knowledgeable. This is definitely my college of choice and I would recommend it to anyone.
College Freshman,5,I love it here. the only down side to it is the price. I may have to leave because of it.
College Freshman,5,This school does not see a students as an ACT number or an essay. They see them as people who want to become important people.
College Sophomore,5,I really like the school I picked. It is just the right size and the staff is great. It has a block system which means I don't have to overload myself with classes and I really like that.
Recent Alumnus,5,I do not like that
Recent Alumnus,5,it is some time good way to change mode for student
Recent Alumnus,5,yes it is may be help to good peformance
Recent Alumnus,5,It is perfect way to help poor students
Recent Alumnus,5,I do not favorite that
Recent Alumnus,5,It is very good plan
Recent Alumnus,5,like to live in camp best with all students
College Sophomore,5,"This school makes getting financial aid easy. If you don't have a way of paying for school, they will definitely help you find a way."
College Sophomore,5,"This is a very strict school when it comes to alcohol, parking, noise level, etc. They fine you for everything and they annoy the crap out of you with your first two warnings. Most people still drink and violate rules because they can afford the fines. But no one tries to get caught."
College Junior,5,Great variety of majors. Admission is very simple and can be done online. Chances are that if you apply you'll get accepted.
College Junior,5,My advisors are great! Very helpful with obtaining interships and employment after graduation.
College Junior,5,Very advanced. Small class sizes are very beneficial.
College Junior,5,Great experience. I am involved with cheerleading and I love how involved I can be on campus! Great environment for living and learning.
College Junior,5,Campus feels super safe. There's access to emergency phones throughout campus and everytgibg is well lit
College Junior,5,Tons of new appartments of campus! Very close to classes and extremely beautiful living areas
College Junior,5,Every school offers tons of scholarships! You just need to put in the effort to receive them. Everybody loves free money! :)
College Freshman,5,There are always things to do on campus and the people are very outgoing.
College Junior,5,I like that they offer a location in my hometown. This location offers an adult studies program that allows me to work full time and go to school one night a week.
College Junior,5,The campus I will be attending is for adults taking night courses. I do not believe they offer the centers described above in the question.
College Junior,5,The admins have been extremely helpful and have gone above and beyond to make sure all of my requirements are met to be accepted in their business admin program.
College Junior,5,"Tusculum's campus is beautiful with all of the trees, mountains, and pretty lawns. The college is small so everyone knows everybody. There is a minor league (The Greeneville Astros) that uses our baseball field which they help take care, fix, and renovate the field. It looks really good! The library was the old gym (I know that sounds nasty) but they have redone the inside completely and updated everything! it is beautiful inside and out! Intramural sports at TC are so much fun and you have ton of sports to choose from to play!"
College Sophomore,5,"Given a chance to re-decide majors, I would choose the same two every time. I have had hard times with both of them, but at the same time I have grown to trust and respect my faculty over the years. I am going into my senior year and I can only say I love my program more now than I did when I started and it is all due to the effort the faculty put into me as an individual student."
College Student,5,"When a student enters Niswonger Commons, there are so many flags up from the many places students come from to be here. You cannot be here without meeting and talking to people from other countries or races. It just cannot happen."
College Freshman,5,Im very pleased about being able to chose my major and the classes I get to take
College Freshman,5,there it a major diversity and they all get along very well
Freshman,4,Well I had 2 online classes and they were really good. But I just prefer to have face to face classes because I learn better like that.
Sophomore,4,"Tusculum is a beautiful campus that is located in the heart of the Appalachians. The professors are great by having personal meetings with students so that we can be successful and the student life on campus is great because, it is quiet and you can make great long lasting friendships along the way."
Junior,4,"At first I thought Tusculum was to small for me and i need to go to a bigger school, but when I started to go to class and experience college life I started to enjoy it, and it became my second home. the relationships that I made with teammates, coaches, friends and other teachers and faculty will never go away.  five years from now I will be able to look back and be thankful for all my experiences   at Tusculum university."
Senior,4,"I loved the small town feel that Tusculum has offered. I donâ€™t feel like just another number. The staff, faculty, and students all care for one another. I have grown so much here and will cherish the memories I made at Tusculum."
Senior,4,"Tusculum is small and located in a small town. I am from a big city so it is weird, however, I think that I've had plenty of opportunities. There are some academic and facolity issues that need resolving, but there is alot of chang going on right now so I expect it to greatly improve in the next 10 years"
Senior,4,I really enjoy the GPS program that Tusculum has to offer. I am able to continue my education while working and raising a family. Going to class 1 night a week makes it easier for me to be able to achieve the degree I want.
Sophomore,4,"Tusculum feels like a second home from the second you get on the campus, but because it is a small school, it faces overcrowding issues. Parking and housing are probably the biggest issues on campus."
Alum,4,I enjoyed the small school atmosphere and the fact that your professors really did all know you.   I made friends that will last a lifetime.   The location at the base of the mountains cannot be beat.
Sophomore,4,So far at my College everyone has been very helpful with answering questions and keeping me encouraged as I'm a first generation college student in much need of both. :)
College Freshman,4,Nursing advisors are great.  Easy to communicate with on campus.
College Freshman,4,Class room sizes are awesome.  Professors know you personally.
College Freshman,4,Havent had a problem yet
College Freshman,4,I havent heard anything negative.
College Sophomore,4,I am looking forward to getting a job and still be able to pursue a Master's degree to a different college after I get my BA
College Sophomore,4,I like the sizes of my classes. The teachers are great and will help where help is needed
College Sophomore,4,"This is a starter for me to get my BA, so I can get my Master's after I graduate"
College Sophomore,4,"I only read about the sports because I do not go to the main campus, I go to another campus in a different city"
College Freshman,4,"My experience at school so far has been amazing. My professors are fantastic and class sessions are always something to look forward to. The tutoring center, which is provided for free, is great and the tutors always so helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, all of my classes have been pretty great. Class sizes are small and allow more one on one attention from the professors. There are a lot of activity classes offered which are fun to take. My favorite classes are the art classes, and the professors for the art department are wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,Tusculum College has many representatives for internships and other career options constantly on campus. These recruiters get to talk to students and hand out their information to provide students with opportunities for jobs and career paths. There is also a career counselor on campus who is very helpful for students who are struggling with finding a job or career.
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is within close proximity, which is great, I do not have to drive to get to class. Because the residential life is so close knit, students have an easier time to be social with each other. Housing process is fairly easy, I was able to get into the apartment I wanted to as long as I had all the paperwork filled out properly."
College Sophomore,4,The most popular sports at Tusculum are Baseball and Lacrosse. These are our best teams and they win the most games. These are probably the most enjoyable games for students to attend.
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the art program at Tusculum College. The block system creates a lot of time for art students to delve deeper into our projects. Our course system makes learning a lot easier than any other college, and I would definitely go to Tusculum again if I could."
College Junior,4,It has been fine. I know in advance when I am going to have classes. And get notification of any changes.
College Freshman,4,We always have job fairs and future employers on campus
College Freshman,4,I love the block schedule because I am focused
College Junior,4,The safety and security of the campus is awesome. We have campus police ion duty 24 hours a day and also security officers that are out and about all of the time.
College Junior,4,"It was very easy to get into the program, the advisors and professors are very helpful in selecting the classes that you need for the program that you are enrolled in."
College Junior,4,"We go to school on a block schedule. Have one class for 18 days, take a test and then go to the next class for 18 days and so on until the semester ends. Love this type of schedule. I find that you do not stress like you would if you took 3 or more classes. I highly recommend this type of schedule."
College Junior,4,The parking is one of the assets to off campus living. On campus if you move your car them the likely hood of finding a place to park near the dorm that you live is almost impossible.
College Sophomore,4,Students are very involved in all sports. There is much fan support in each sport. Everyone shows school spirit for every team. And all of the sports facilities are top notch and you can tell the school spent a lot of money. Sports are a huge part of Tusculum College.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors here are great. They care and they will do what they can to help. The registration process was pretty easy for me. Did the free application online, paid my deposit, then came to school and signed all legal stuff. Work load depends on the majors. Usually people shooting for professions in the medical field have the greatest work load. You got commons courses on top of your classes needed for your major. Job and internship opportunities are posted round the clock. If you want a school that will get you out for graduate school in four years, this is that school."
College Sophomore,4,"My major is biology. I have to take a lot of math and science based courses. It is a heavy workload considering that it's a lot of information back to back. However, there is two tutors for every class that are willing to help and work with you. The administrators also do everything they can to help and keep you posted about any opportunities in your field of study."
College Junior,4,"From the multiple outdoor fields to the indoor practice facilities and close access to a greenway campus is full of things to keep you active. With the small town feel, people here are close and there are plenty of ways to make tons of lasting memories!"
College Sophomore,4,"I actually play for my college's women soccer team. It's great playing, but it involves a lot of time and sacrifices. Everyone loves supporting the varsity teams and there is always something going on on campus that involves a sport. There is a lot of school spirit. We are a pretty small school though so there isn't a huge fan base like most schools. There are obviously certain sports that are better than others and they usually get way more attention than the sports that don't do as well."
College Freshman,4,"The tuition for this school is pretty high, but from my experience the financial aid counselors are very helpful and will let you know what you need to do. I received what I needed to help me stay in school, and continue to receive help. I would suggest that anyone trying to go to a school with high tuition should start looking for scholarships early and keep their grades up so as to earn higher school scholarships."
College Freshman,4,"What I love about the psychology program is that there is a club and various ways in which students can interact to talk about their interest in the program. I am only a freshman, so I do not know a whole lot about internship or job opportunities. I do know a few of the professors and they are pretty great, and the classes are definitely intellectually stimulating."
College Junior,4,"Tusculum College is huge in athletics and they recruit people from out of state and out of the country for athletes. In the past two years of attending the school I have not known of any disputes because of political beliefs, race, or gender. Tusculum is a very opening and comforting college. They accept all types and personalities which makes for a very ""close-like-family"" feeling. We have female empowerment meetings and we encourage men and women to attend. We are considered a Presbyterian school but we don't force chapel services on anyone, it is optional to attend."
College Junior,4,"My school is set apart by the block schedule. I take only one class at a time for 18 days and then I have a 4 day break to go home or relax without stress and then I begin with my next class. I take 4 classes a semester just like any other college and will have just as many credits as other college students. It helps you concentrate on one subject at a time! Plus, Tusculum is also in the beautiful scenery of the Great Smokey Mountains so waking up to the great view is a definite plus! My decision to move five hours away from home to attend Tusculum College was the best decision I have ever made because I have made friends that I will keep for a lifetime because everyone is so friendly and inviting! Andrew Johnson also attended Tusculum and it was the first college in Tennessee so it has some great history to it's name!"
College Senior,4,"At Tusculum College, the education students are required to do 120 hours of what is called practicum. During practicum, students have to observe teachers and their classrooms for at least 18 hours a class. This has helped prepare me and accept what is coming in my future career. Tusculum has an appropriate workload for their education students as well including making lesson plans, writing essay's on recent topics in education, and letting us be creative when producing our lessons for different grades levels."
College Senior,4,"Tusculum has a great academics program. They always have tutoring option either with peer tutoring or tutoring from the professor. The professors are knowledgeable about the subject, and willing to work extra with their students. I came to Tusculum College because I heard such great things about their education program. I know that Tusculum has helped me prepare for my future career by having such a strong and supportive academic program."
College Senior,4,"I had attended a state university before I transferred to Tusculum College, and my experience from the state university form the private college was a phenomenal transition. The financial aid department was more than willing to help me find money to pay for school, and I actually obtained more scholarships from Tusculum than I did the state university."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm majoring in Physical Therapy, the interesting thing I have to go through Athletic Training to do that. Which is kind of good because I end up learning two trades in the same field. The department is fun and interactive, you start learning and doing your major your freshmen year. There are different trip opportunities to travel to other areas in the state and out the state to further your knowledge of your major. You learn how to help and prevent injuries in every sport and learn about the body constantly. You have fun with good people while building your career"
College Sophomore,4,"The Creative Writing program was easy to get into. At the end of my first semester, I declared my major through a simple form. Oftentimes, professors and advisers will help you in choosing a program right for you if you're unsure where to go. The program itself, however, requires a large amount of dedication, including involvement in the production and publication of the campus-published literary journal. The program is widely respected on and off campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Tusculum boasts a decorated variety of professors across their selection of majors, and each program is dedicated to the success of its students and of the college as a whole. Tusculum follows the one-class-at-a-time block system, where students focus on one course for 18 class days before switching to the next class. This requires a great deal of time management from the students, though the registration process seems a bit simpler; students merely fill in the blanks. However, a great deal of planning is needed to prevent having to stay over four years (as certain classes are only offered certain blocks). Academic advisers are of great help in this, and as long as the student is responsible, the registration process is easy and the homework manageable. In addition, most classes number around 15 to 17 students, and with only one class to focus on, the professors get to know their students well and are very personable."
College Sophomore,4,"My major at the moment is in Creative Writing here at Tusculum, and the program is extensive and to be respected. The decorated faculty personally encourage each Creative Writing student to hone their craft, and the community is known and envied across campus programs. Most students in the program are published - some many times - before getting their undergraduate degree, and often move on to receive fellowships at renowned universities for graduate school. In addition, Creative Writing students are required to spend four semesters compiling and editing the campus literary journal, the Tusculum Review, granting them an immeasurable amount of experience in the literary world. However, the program seems to - especially at first glance - supply a cookie-cutter success; the prominent faculty have found a niche and seek to conform the students in that border of success."
College Sophomore,4,"Both of the programs I'm involved in are relatively easy to join, but require a great deal of effort to maintain.

The creative writing program at Tusculum is one of the largest on campus with an almost all students moving onto graduate school and gaining publications. The professors stay on their students and make everyone work for their grades. Some can be emotionally taxing, but every time a student receives their grade, there is no question as to whether or not they earned it.

Tusculum's history program is one of the best in the region. Its professors constantly work their students to become better historians and to use the right source materials. Every upper division class focuses on the use of primary sources and requires an extensive paper at the end."
College Freshman,4,"The weather is what you would expect for a college located in Tennessee. It pours rain January through April, starts to warm up by May, and in August (when school starts up) it's sweltering. The weather is most comfortable around October."
College Student,4,"The computer labs are usually crowded at crunch times, like midterms and finals, but besides that, you can always find a spot. Most people do have their own computers, and with WiFi, it is definitely nice to have your own. If you don't own one, I don't think it would be a huge problem."
College Student,4,"I wouldn`t feel unsafe or unconfortable campus. This is where I feel like I need to be. It is a small, beautiful, safe place to be. Keep your doors locked to avoid petty theft or late-night pranks. And be warned that Campus Security isn't too happy `bout drinking games, so keep your Beirut games under control!"
College Student,4,"The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to not do it! Definiately don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted!"
College Student,4,"Right now, while you are looking at schools, you may think that a fifth year or spending some of your summer at school is weird, but trust me, I would not change anything in my program! We have a block schedule so you only have to worry about taking one class at a time!"
College Student,4,"Campus life is like no other. The student`s get involoved very easily and some of the campus was newly renovated a few years ago and is very modern. There are fast food joints, places to study, convention rooms, and it's a more than a popular hangout, you can get inlvolved with students that have similar interests, because of the school size. There are tons of organizations to join, and there are always fun activities and events going on across campus"
College Junior,4,"There are a few restaurants by Tusculum, but there are plenty of fast food restaurants"
College Junior,4,"Sports All the Way to an a â€“ The student involvement with sports at Tusculum is great. At each game, there are students who work the gate and pass out papers that discuss the teams playing/ players on the team. The teams all work together and have regular practices. The fans usually paint-up and scream for the teams at games. All of the athletic facilities are nice. Each team has their own trainers and the teams can get to know them on a first name basis."
College Junior,4,The academics is pretty good. The class sizes are not to big which allows students to be able to interact with the teachers and get extra help they need.
College Junior,4,Be in constant communication with financial aid at the colllege
College Junior,4,I believe rules are enforced strictly to all students.
College Student,4,"If you really want to get in here, the financial aid crew will get you in, but some students do end up taking out loans. There are quite a few private scholarships that almost all students are eligible for that make the tuition of Tusculum go down to about 15k. The financial advisors handle a lot of the work, as long as you fill out your FASFA."
College Student,4,"The sports here are serious, because Tusculum is partially sport-based college. Students have several opportunities to get involved with sports, but the basketball games are probably the least-cared about. Even the volleyball teams get more of a crowd. School spirit is a average. The baseball team, soccer team, and volleyball are the most successful. The basketball, football, and tennis teams are heard of but are just averagely successful. The facilities these teams work in are generally great though. The baseball stadium is not owned by the school, but it is very nice. The football stadium is second best, followed by the indoor practice field, the tennis courts, and finally the gyms."
Freshman,2,"The campus itself is so pretty, and the professors really do care about your learning. But the overall campus mood and attitude is terrible. Campus is almost always dead and people really like to start drama like we are back in high school."
Niche User,2,"This is not really a liberal arts college. The sports, clubs, and other extracurriculars are sad. Professors are hit and miss. All of them are very nice, but a lot of them have unnecessary added responsibilities and/or teach classes on subjects that aren't quite in their wheelhouse. Campus security is also horribly unorganized and doesn't do much outside of giving you high parking tickets for reasons that are not always correct and taking forever to get to you to unlock your dorm room if you look yourself out. Their restrictions are very strange. The dorms are sub par. Many students are confused on what they need and the offices aren't much help. Plan on needing a car, there are no sidewalks going to many places, the school is separate from the rest of the town, there is a shuttle service but no one on campus really knows how it works or when it is running."
Freshman,2,"Facilities are lacking, especially in the cafeteria. Overall, people are okay, but everyone is in everyones business because of how small the school is and how few people live on campus. There are not very many campus activities, besides the occasional sports game. Not worth what you have to pay to attend Tusculum College."
College Freshman,2,Dorms are very old.  They are very dirty at times with trash everywhere.
College Junior,2,"I received the highest academic scholarship, which covered about 1/3 of tuition and costs. Outside of that, the college financial aid suggests you look for other scholarships on your own and is of no help. Work study is reserved for those who only get low scholarships, so there are many willing workers who go without. The school requires you to live on campus and pay for a meal plan, so if you live off campus or the food makes you sick, you're paying for something you don't need."
College Junior,2,I just feel like I get the run around sometimes.
College Junior,2,Don't really party. I am school to learn and to get an education.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think there is any Greek life
College Sophomore,2,There's probably about 3-4 decent dining options. Basically the main fast food restaurants that most campuses have. There are no healthy options unless you order a salad. Even the on-campus dining sucks!!!
College Senior,2,"About once a week Student Services hosts events for students, but participation isn't very high. TC is technically a dry campus, but of course the apartments will have parties about every weekend. The only bars in Greeneville are kinda white trashy, but sometimes in desperation college students go there. There are no clubs in Greeneville, for that you have to drive to Johnson City 20-30 mins away. There is no public transportation on campus, but you don't really need it. You can walk across campus in under 10 mins."
College Sophomore,2,We have a few great athletic programs but the programs that usually stand for other college aren't very good
College Freshman,2,the cost of living is two high and the dorms or not that good. most are to small
College Freshman,2,"It's average like most other schools. They are very normal and the whole community is good, so the need for strictness is not that necessary."
College Junior,2,"It Could Be Worse.. Dorms on campus are decent compared to some colleges, but they are not great. But you don't come to Tusculum for dorm-life.. You come for the social experiences."
College Freshman,2,Work Study â€“ The work study program is an excellent form of financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"The wireless here leaves something to be desired. In the Kat dorm building, there is none. Where I live in COG South there is some but it's not great. I really wish it was better. You can usually hold a webcam chat but it'll drop sometimes. Printing is free if you bring your own paper, which is awesome! I have my own printer, and that's what I use but for everyone else it's good too."
College Junior,2,The school has a ton of computer labs. However all of the computers are extremely slow and a hassle to work on. Most everybody has their own computer but the internet service around the school is pretty slow at best.
College Freshman,2,"White Versus Black Students â€“ Other than a few students actually from another country, everyone is either black or white, and it seems pretty even."
College Freshman,2,"There are options to living off-campus and not at home. There are quite a few options that would be convenient, just a one-two minute drive. I personally have not looked into the cost of moving for I stay at home because it costs so much to stay on campus on top of high tuition."
Freshman,1,"Very small school that caters greatly towards athletes. Non-athletic students will not find a place for themselves here.  Almost never any on-campus activities that aren't sport related. Nothing in the area to do unless you go all the way to Johnson city. Students are very clique oriented and aren't as accepting of outsiders as they say during pioneer launch. School makes it out to be way more than it actually is when you come and settle in. Cafe food is awful, I've been served raw food on multiple occasions. In need of a 24 hour place to get snacks and drinks because everything closes very early. Some professors are very inclined to get to know you and that can be very helpful, but there are others who still don't know me and I see them multiple times a week. Staff doesn't fully disclose with the students what is going on behind the scenes, from what I have heard the school was on academic probation."
College Freshman,1,Dorm room halls smell of drugs.
College Junior,1,I am on a secondary campus and we do not have housing.
College Junior,1,I am at a secondary campus and we do not have an fraternities or sororities.
College Junior,1,I am at a secondary campus and we do not have any involvement in the athletics.
College Junior,1,"You have to eat in the cafeteria, which is the cheapest option the college could get. The food is under- or over-cooked, poorly seasoned, and/or drowning in oil. The most dependable option is the sandwich bar, which isn't always there."
College Sophomore,1,"There are basically no options for off-campus housing. Unless someone gets lucky and is able to find a decent house close enough, but that has rarely happened. I know few people who live off campus. There aren't many house close to campus that are even for sale anyways."
College Freshman,1,Tusculum has the worst internet wifi connection in the world!!
College Senior,1,"The pizza bar and panini/sandwich area are always reliable and good, but if you are trying to eat healthy or stay away from carbs the meat and veggie area is very unreliable. About once a week, I will say ""this is actually good!"". Usually though, the food reminds me of Cafeteria food from public school. The Grill station is pretty good too, but can be hit or miss at times. About every other time I go to the Salad Bar, the veggies are old/ slimey/ limp looking. Other times its great. Overall, it is very hard to find healthy, fresh, good, CONSISTENT food at Tusculum College. The only other food options at TC besides the caf is sandwiches, pasteries, and snack food at the Coffee shop. It is overpriced and closes at 10pm. The book store has more reasonably priced snacks, but it closes at 5pm."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at Tusculum struggles to be in existence at all. The one Greek sorority I am aware of is new - having come into existence just in the past year - and therefore hasn't done very much to become prominent in campus life. There is no housing available to them, and as far as I am aware, no parties. Like Tusculum itself, however, the sorority focuses on civic engagement and service, and many students and faculty are looking to improve Greek life in the college's future."
College Sophomore,1,Not enough spots to park especially with commuters.
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife at Tusculum. I barely go to clubs because the closest one is not one that I enjoy. I also don't have a vehicle and there are no buses so it's sometimes a struggle to find a ride there and back.
College Junior,1,I do not believe there is enough parking for residential students in their specific residential area.
College Student,1,"Greek life is almost non-existent. There is one sorority, and these girls are more of a club than anything else. Most students do not even realize there is a sorority on campus. However, the ""leaders-in-training"" are pushing to turn it into more of a sorority for the sisters. This will take at least two years. Year 12/13"
College Sophomore,1,"I'll be honest, the cafe sucks. There are many times where I've walked in and walked out, then go out to eat. It is that bad. But on occasion they will actually have good food out."
College Freshman,1,The computers are very very slow if we can manage to get them to come up at all. Everything is so locked down that we can't even surf the web to do research. Our computer class most of us could not even get logged on so we started bringing our laptops.
College Senior,1,The computers that are in the labs are all slow and the internet is awful on campus.
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation offered at the school! The campus is so small that every thing is within a 5 minutes walking distance of your dorm. But I do suggest that if you have a car bring it!
College Freshman,1,Not Much â€“ There is virtually no campus life. Academics can be overwhelming because of the block schedule.
College Freshman,1,There isn't much to do which leaves students with a lot of free time. If you can manage time it may work out for you.

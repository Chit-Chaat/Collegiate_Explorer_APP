Freshman,5,I took my classes online for the Summer and Fall term. The teachers and school made this difficult time a little easier.
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at USF St. Petersburg and I can say I love the school. The professors and the environment is great.
Alum,5,"The online classes were better than expected, some teachers asked for you to read through a chapter and then take a quiz on it. Others uploaded videos of their lectures along with Powerpoints. One of my teachers used Blackboard Collaborate where everyone can talk to each other and ask questions in a chat room while listening to the teacher and following along with the notes on screen. Homework and group projects could be completed and turned in online or emailed to the professor. The exams were very difficult but often our teachers would allow us to use the notes (so long as we thought we could still finish in time). If we had questions after class then we could email our professor or send them a message through Canvas."
Alum,5,"The campus was beautiful with tons of wildlife and our own little dock where we could take out kayaks and sailboats. The teachers were very helpful and I learned so much from them. Their laboratories were excellent, we often went into the field to conduct experiments, and we were able to design and complete our own experiments. They also had great internship opportunities for students interested in biology and chemistry. Not to mention food and housing were great, my dorm room had a kitchenette with an oven and fridge and the cafeteria food was great, even the grab and go stuff. If there was something I would like to see change, I would like for them to install a better bicycle pump and washing machines for the resident students. Everyone on each floor does their laundry in only two machines that keep breaking and everyone bicycles everywhere but the pump never works."
Senior,5,"My online experience with USFSP has been excellent, but was chalked up to the professors that I have been taking classes with. My professors were extraordinarily flexible and cared for the well being of their students during the pandemic. In the online learning experience that I received prior to COVID, my professor seemed engaged in teaching their students to the best of their ability despite not interacting with them in person. USF provides many online resources that can help students in their online journey in classes."
Sophomore,5,Very friendly and inclusive. Being right on the water is great for calming nerves. The professors I've encountered so far are all wonderful and really push their students to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I love my school All around perfect, from the faculty to the campus everything and everyone is so kind and genuine. Proud to call this campus my home."
Alum,5,"I love this school, I took my favorite undergrad course here with an online professor. Highly recommend any program, staff and faculty are always willing to help with your success."
Sophomore,5,"I am a student at USFSP studying for my undergraduate in Biomedical Engineering. My experience so far with the school has been pretty good, as the classes are smaller and you get to know your teachers as opposed to being just a number in the classroom."
Junior,5,"Absolutely phenomenal! I love everything about USF ST. Petersburg. It has everything a student could ask for, waterfront, great professors, and much diversity. I really enjoy all of my classes and professors, they treat the students very well and are highly knowledgable and passionate about their individual subjects. I am thankful I get to be apart of such an incredible school."
Sophomore,5,the people here are amazing.this truly has become my second home. everyone here is so welcoming and inviting. also the campus is in a great location right in downtown st. Pete. everyone here is very helpful and wants to see you succeed.
Junior,5,I love the small class sizes at this campus. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I   love the amount of activities there are to join on campus. Everyone always feels included.
Junior,5,"The University of South Florida is the number one school in Florida. The location is absolutely perfect and only a 10 minute drive from the house. The resources that are offered are incredible, including free fitness center, heated pool, outdoor water activities, gaming room, health care facility, mental health awareness with direct attention and care. The teachers are persistent and want you to excel and achieve your goals. They provide all the resources you need to exceed expectations in class and put you on the path to your dream job. There are also many study abroad international programs and hundreds over internships you can apply for that are directly related to your major/minor. Another very important aspect of this college is the cost. This university has the lowest tuition rate compared to other colleges in the united states. With many scholarships, grants, school jobs and financial aid, you are able to receive money to help lower these costs"
Sophomore,5,"It is a beautiful campus overall as the students and staff are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable. There are many activities to do around the campus that are created by multiple committees so you would never get bored; it is also a great opportunity to meet new friends as well. If there is any chance that you might ever get tired of campus (which is literally impossible as it feels like home), you can always head downtown and enjoy yourself there."
Junior,5,There’s Lots of help on campus to get you on the right track and help students with anything they might need. There are many free services offered to students on campus which are really convenient. The teachers  are there to help you and as well as lots of services to help with your school work. They want you to succeed and that’s what makes it 10x better. The university makes sure that the students know that they are there to help them in any situation. The people there are overall great and I would recommend this school to anyone who wants a better experience at having a university that actually cares on their success in life and this is emphasized a lot with the teachers and staff.
Alum,5,"During my studies at USF St. Petersburg, I had the incredible opportunity to challenge myself and discover my strengths as an individual. I earned my degree in Biology and graduated with Magna Cum Laude honors. I was proud of the diversity of knowledge and skills that I gained from my experience at USFSP. From the molecular interactions that bind atoms together to the physiology of whole organ systems, I witnessed the complexity of life at all levels. I give much credit to several of my former professors who were passionate about their subject and created a thriving learning environment. 

The USFSP campus is quaint and cozy; it's common to find students studying under shady trees overlooking the neighboring harbor or in the on-campus cafe. A fun, vibrant downtown scene is also within walking distance of USFSP which is necessary for study-worn students needing a break.

USFSP truly has it all to make an impactful academic experience for students of all backgrounds."
Sophomore,5,"USFSP feels like home. Small classes make for an intimate learning experience. The entire campus is very environmentally conscious, and amenities/perks to attending here are endless."
Junior,5,The most enjoyable experience at USF St. Petersburg is how determined the staff and professors are towards their students. One on one time and class sizes are decent!
Freshman,5,"Although I have not started at University of South Florida at St Petersburg, it is a wonderful school. It is small, right near several shopping centers and entertainment places, making it easy to connect with both other students and natives. Go Bulls!"
Senior,5,"Not only is the campus so beautiful that it makes going to class enjoyable, but the professors are exceptional. I love going to school at USFSP and I encourage everyone I meet to continue their education here. 10/10 on all fronts for me. (also there is a bar on campus which is a huge plus)"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful, there are so many resources available to students, and the professors make time to meet and tutor students. This University has many programs, clubs, and activities to get involved in, and allows students to live the real college life."
Freshman,5,When I went on a tour of USF St. Pete I was shocked at how gorgeous the campus is and how friendly and personable everyone was. They really seemed to care about you as a whole person and not just a statistic to make their school seem better. I really loved it.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus at USFSP, it is a perfect size for the people who do not like big campuses and still want to go to a University. The classroom sizes are perfect as well, with being only 20-60 students, and the Professors are always willing to lend a hand in the classroom and outside of it."
Senior,5,"Great school at great cost. Campus is beautiful, you cannot beat having a waterfront view during class."
Freshman,5,The University is amazing. All the staff is very welcoming and ready to help. Campuses are beautiful.
Junior,5,"I would like that the college would offer more social activities to connect students. the academic advisor are very helpful; however, the financial aid department are no very helpful, so it is hard to find guidance when comes to tuition and fees."
Sophomore,5,i would change nothing. Great school. Great location. The teachers are very accommodating. I look forward to my sophomore year. The downtown close to everything lifestyle is Awesome.
Junior,5,"The University of South Florida Saint Petersburg is a small public university located on the edge of Tampa Bay, just south of downtown St. Petersburg. The campus is gorgeous. Dolphins and manatees are often seen feeding along the seawall, and egrets can be found on the shore. Class sized are small, making communication with professors easier than a larger university."
Alum,5,"What a beautiful campus! I loved attending this university and would recommend it to anyone. Not only are the professors available to help, there are many extra curricular activities offered as well."
Junior,5,"I love the educators on this campus, the location - near an upcoming downtown city. Small campus which I prefer. Cool environment, and an excellent attempt at creating/becoming an environmentally friendly campus through projects and education and clubs. Have only met amazing and interesting people."
Sophomore,5,"I love USFSP! The campus is beautiful, and the waterfront has many activities to keep students busy . There is always something to do, and the community aspect of the school is amazing! Making friends has not been difficult because the activities foster a friendly environment. I have loved all of my professors as well. They are extremely knowledgeable in what they teach, and they make learning engaging and interesting. The smaller size of the school supports building relationships with professors, and the school leadership knows many students by name."
Junior,5,"Excellent academics in a beautiful campus by the water. The school is located right by the downtown area of St. Petersburg, FL, which offers great leisure options. Facilities are modern and filled with tools and resources to help the student excel."
Junior,5,I enjoy the small classes because it helps you get to know the teacher and fellow students. The tutoring from each of my professors that i have received is amazing. I continue to talk to my past professors and they help me in some of my future classes.
Junior,5,"I love it! They are so polite and so down to earth. I always go there early and mingle, grab a bite to eat, and take the time in the library to study."
Senior,5,I love this school. Everyone from my high school went far away their first year of college and all have come back to St. Pete and to this school so it must say something about USFSP. Location is perfect and everyone is so nice.
Junior,5,"I just transferred here. The advisors have been very helpful. The professors are great, and my class sizes are small. The campus itself is beautiful. Its right off the water and they have several picnic benches that are solar powered so that you can do your homework out by the water."
Sophomore,5,Life at USFSP has been very relaxed. It is a small school where everyone becomes familiar at some point. It is based in the center of a city where there are always things to do.
Niche User,5,This school is absolutely amazing! I got a tour from them when I was a prospective student and they treated me with so much respect. They were able to explain everything to me and give me the one on one experience I was looking for.
Freshman,5,Usfsp is a fantastic school.  The campus is beautiful and right on the water .  They are very much involved and have every resource you could imagine to help students succeed.
Freshman,5,The experience and the amount of divers people i have met here is amazing. The class sizes are really good allowing for us to have and make connections with the professors. The on-campus living is really good too. It allows you to make friendships not only on your floor but with people on different floors.
Freshman,5,"Great campus, student body, and faculty. More scholarship opportunities, especially for biology majors, are needed."
Niche User,5,"I love the amazing Marine Biology program at University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. It offers hands on experiences, and it also offers opportunities to work with Florida Wildlife Research Institution. The campus has an amazing student center and allows for students to have a real community. The surroundings of University of South Florida in St. Petersburg is beautiful, and is close to a beach. Overall, this campus is wonderful and I would definitely recommend this university."
Niche User,5,"I like the University of South Florida because the energy there is so positive and enjoyable. The faculty cares about the students and all the extra curricular activities are fun. Cool courses , fun teachers , and chill campus."
Freshman,5,"I have already finished my summer semester and am starting fall, and I am so glad to call usfsp my home. All of my professors are so caring and just amazing. I have already gone to some of my professors for personal things and all they want to do is help. During class they encourage you to ask questions and to learn from each other. There are so many organizations to join, you can even create your own! It is right in the middle of downtown so its the perfect place to walk around with a group of friends. This school is not a party school which is great it is solely all academics. USFSP is amazing."
Alum,5,I loved it here! The size was perfect for me- but not everybody. I normally like doing online classes but I chose to attend physical class here because I loved the campus and the people so much.
Sophomore,5,"I love the waterfront view. It's a small campus but a beautiful one. The professors are amazing and the food too. We have amazing security on campus, and student services are great too."
Freshman,5,"Running into an old friend the first day of classes, he told me and the whole orientation class ""get ready for the best four years of your lives"". To this date, it has been the most accurate description of the school, positivity and smiles around every-corner with the willingness to help you achieve anything."
Freshman,5,I love my school I'm so glad to be a USFSP bull. We have the unique program of compass for first year students to get students involved and be mentored.
Junior,5,Awesome school! Small class sizes. Great professors who are invested in the students. Prime location in down town with plenty to do just within walking distance.
Freshman,5,"awesome school if you are comfortable with small campuses, downtown Saint Pete is a fantastic place for the arts and locally owned resturants and shops. the party scene is good if you know the right people but the cafeteria dose not have a lot of options"
College Sophomore,5,"I honestly could not have asked for a better first year of college. This campus was the perfect choice for me, I love the location and my first year proved that the staff (and their teaching styles) were all well suited for any student, it was always easy to understand, or the professor made it easy to understand."
College Freshman,5,"Since my campus is branched off of the main one, most of the varsity sports do no take place on my campus. Even though we don't have sports such as football and soccer, there are so many other athletic groups that are available to join. Intramural sports are advertised so much and sports such as boating, sailing and kayaking are available to any student at any time of the day. The school community works almost like a team, where all parts contribute in order for success. School spirits pushed and suggested, such as certain events that include peer connectors leaders that call out new students in order for them to explore all the different amenities."
College Freshman,5,Beginning school has been one of the most unforgettable experiences by far. There are so many resources that I can take advantage of which help me meet new people and get used to the community around me. Being by the beach provides so many opportunities for studying and free time. Academics are so important and are offered assistance 24/7. Everyone is very helpful and makes you feel like home.
College Student,5,Love that the school is as concerned with student safety as they are
College Student,5,Would chose this college over and over again.
College Student,5,Very helpful and welcoming staff.
College Student,5,Its no secret that sports is a big part of our community; most people start out as Bulls even integrating the spirit into the family pride. That is probably a huge factor in bringing students to USF and upholding our team rank so we can show our gratitiude to dedicated fans.
College Junior,5,In all honesty who can say their school overlooks the Bay? It's not that crowded so you do get some more one on one time with the Professors.
College Sophomore,5,"I love USF St. Pete!  The campus is beautiful and you have access to a gym, pool and kayaks.  My adviser knows me and is very welcoming.  The students are friendly and welcoming!  I made an awesome choice and would do it over again."
College Sophomore,5,"I love USF, the pride and student body is amazing."
Junior,4,"I love the actual classes and experience of being on campus, the campus is great for environmental and marine biology classes because it is right next to the waterfront and I get to pass by the bay on the way to classes. It is a little frustrating when dealing with small things with housing, dining, and financial aid. They aren't huge deals just small inconveniences."
Junior,4,Taking classes online has been interesting. The professors have been very understanding with certain situations and most have spent the summer preparing for this semester. I like the recorded lectures better than live lectures because it gives me a chance to go back and watch them again and again. A few professors are struggling and actually made the classes a lot harder but for the most part online classes have run smoothly.
Freshman,4,"I like the campus, the professors, and the staff. Everyone is very friendly. I also like how we have virtual events since we have to social distance. Some professors have online drop-in sessions where they will answer any questions you may have. There are opportunities to work or volunteer on campus and the career center will help you find career opportunities. The surrounding area is nice with restaurants, art museums, and malls near campus."
Senior,4,"USFSP has allowed me to make great connection on campus, and I got the full college experience I had hoped for. I was happy going to USF instead of UCF which was located 5 minutes from my house. The one complaint I have for USF in general is for the lack of cohesion in campuses. USF Tampa often has little care for it's smaller campuses and I find myself having to pay fees for all of the campuses even though we are ""USFOne""."
Alum,4,"Overall I had a good experience at University of South Florida St. Petersburg. They had great professors, strong courses where I learned a lot and they prepared me well for graduate school. I was very pleased with my experience."
Sophomore,4,"Really good school. Dining hall food is pretty terrible, so if you live on campus, bring a hot plate to cook for yourself or something. Dorms are nice."
Alum,4,I love the campus and the chill vibe that this small school offers. It gives a great sense of community and still allows you to be a part of the larger USF system if you'd like to
Senior,4,USF St. Pete is an amazing college. It is a small campus with closer student and professor relationships. The education is pretty good. The professors at USF St. Pete are fantastic. The wellness center and career center are fantastic. One thing I would improve with at the school is tutoring. Adding more hours to tutoring and finding tutors with more experience would definitely be helpful.
Freshman,4,"The university is in a good area where everything is within walking distance. There is always something to see so you will never be bored. One improvement would be where students are allowed to park, especially commuters."
Sophomore,4,"The location of the campus is right in downtown St. Petersburg. You are able to walk everywhere to: restaurants, shops, movie theaters, publix, CVS,  and the park. The campus is right on the water and the school offers boats , paddle boards, and canoes for the students to take out. Every Saturday, there is the St. Pete Saturday Morning Market. They sell fresh produce and foods from many different cultures, flowers, plants, and clothes. The education has also been great at the school. The class sized are small ranging from 15-45 students. There is a tutoring center that has helped me ace many of my classes. If you need extra help, you can email your professor and they are willing to meet with you one and one which isn't as common at larger schools. So far I have enjoyed all my classes, and I love the school that I go too. Johns Hopkins All-Children's hospital is 2 blocks down from the school, and many students get the opportunity to volunteer and intern there."
Sophomore,4,"The St. Petersburg campus is absolutely beautiful and the staff is quite wonderful. Many of the teachers are understanding and the academic advising staff is more than willing to help. The food at the reef isn't the best, but they do have a table that changes out every day which can be really nice."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my experience at USFSP. There were several issues upon raising the acceptance rate. Parking is so limited that you could go to school and drive around for half an hour to look for a spot, not find one, and just go home because you're already going to be late for class at this point. A lot of what I learned came from outdated sources, and professors were not willing to discuss emerging technologies or information. However, the campus itself is beautiful. Being on the waterfront, students have the option to rent kayaks and paddleboards from Campus Recreation."
Senior,4,The school has a beautiful campus that I always enjoy staying at the study. The professors for the most part are very engaging and the campus programs are diverse.
Freshman,4,"I love being a student at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. We're right on the waterfront and within walking distance of downtown so you should never have an excuse to be bored. All the faculty members care about the well-being of all the students and genuinely want us to succeed. Everything that I thought was going to be stressful and difficult about starting college has been made easy by how caring everyone has been. Being a smaller school, you tend to see the same people every day, so you really get to know who a lot of people are. Connections are everything in college depending on what career field you want to go into."
Senior,4,"The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is an absolutely beautiful waterfront campus located in the astonishing downtown St. Pete area. The campus has such a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere, reducing the common stress of being a busy college student. In addition, the students and faculty are extremely friendly and professional. The instructors are always working hard to ensure students are not only succeeding throughout the  course, but also provide the necessary resources to be a successful student. As I begin my last semester at The University of South Florida St. Petersburg before graduating in December, I know I made the right decision by choosing this school."
Junior,4,I am a transfer student from Saint Petersburg college and USF has been amazing with the academic advising in what classes I should take and how I need to prepare for them much better than any other advisors I have had.
Alum,4,"USFSP is a beautiful, waterfront campus. For those who like smaller, more laid-back environments, USFSP is a perfect fit. There aren't a lot of parties on campus, but it's situated in a bustling downtown area with tons of events going on all the time. There's also free use of kayaks and other water sports equipment offered to students. But yes, to anyone who's wondering, the food really is that bad."
Junior,4,"I have been a student at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus for four semesters. The campus is gorgeous and the location is hard to beat. As an art major, I have many classes in Harbor Hall and pass by the water every day and it always makes me happy. The graphic design professors are knowledgable and incredibly skilled in their work. Because the campus is small, the party scene is equally small, but this allows for a calmer environment and a more work-focused group. Although the food on campus is not the best, the St. Pete area has a wide variety of food options and the kitchens in the dorms are good for student life."
Junior,4,"small, beautiful campus with awesome professors. the class sizes aren't too big and they offer such a diverse range of activities and classes."
Senior,4,I love the campus and the courses. One thing that I would like to see change is the attitude of some of the staff.
Freshman,4,"Being at the university of south Florida Saint Petersburg location is a very wonderful experience, although; I have no attended for a long time I have had an amazing time at this university. The area is so convient because it is rite in the city of Saint Petersburg and is on the bay! The professors are very helpful and always want to ensure every student understands the material. The class sizes are 20-25 people which is small enough for the professors to know your name! I love all the clubs here at USF, there are over 100 clubs. I love all the water activities that are offered for free of students and the apartment style homes are perfect for college students"
Alum,4,"The University of South Florida St. Petersburg is a small school on a pretty campus. The school has nice housing and decent food for those who live on campus, and good amenities. With a small school, I had the opportunity to have the professors give me extra attention and  individualized lessons. There does need to be more student participation in extracurriculars. As a Graphic Design major with minors in both Art History and Entrepreneurship, I experienced a variety of classes in different disciplines. As far as the Graphic Design and Art History departments, the teachers were all very talented in their field of expertise and tried to expand student growth in each of those areas. Unfortunately, as smaller programs they had few teachers or course, if it had more the programs would be amazing. The Entrepreneurship minor was probably the best decision I made going to USFSP. Their business department is top notch and their Entrepreneurship program is in the top fifteen in the country."
Alum,4,"I loved the USF- St.Petersburg campus as well as my professors! I appreciated the ease of registering for classes and the generous list of offerings each semester. I initially was not sure how long it would take me to complete my bachelor's degree as I was also working full time but thanks to the many offerings, I was able to find and take classes that complimented my work schedule and graduate with my bachelor's degree in just over a year and a half after deciding to return to school. I had a great experience here and highly recommend attending! USF St.Petersburg offers most majors and you truly can get a high-quality education at a very reasonable price!"
Niche User,4,"The USF St. Petersburg campus is well known for their marine/environmental science programs and it suits the school very well because the school is located right on the water. It is a much smaller campus than the main campus, but offers the same level of education. This also means smaller class sizes, which means more personalized relationships with your teachers. It is very involved with the surrounding community, and offers many opportunities to apply your learning to real life through internships."
Freshman,4,I love USFSP! There is a tight knit community. It is a private university feel at a public school price.
Junior,4,"Overall, I enjoy attending the school, but some of the teachers just should not be able to teach.  I had to actually withdraw from one course because I could not understand the professor and she was doing such a poor job at conveying the ideas."
College Senior,4,I have never dealt with any issues.
College Sophomore,4,"The career center is great, they work with you on building a resume and job seeking. They even include what position the job is looking for and the hours."
College Sophomore,4,There are emergency poles everywhere to be escorted to your housing by the police if you feel uncomfortable.
College Senior,4,"The University of South Florida is a beautiful campus with a clean persona. The classrooms are often intimate and interactive with classroom discussions. I enjoy the participation aspect of the school. There are many activities to become involved with, helping students to connect and learn from one another. 

Something I would change are the hurdles that commonly occur. Many incidences of miscommunication may happen, causing the student a lot of confusion and unnecessary stress. 

This experience has taught me that the world can be hard, which will teach resilience and patience in a ""real life"" perspective."
College Sophomore,4,"Like everything there are good and bad things. Where my experience has been amazing it has also been challanging. The counselors aren't as great as they could be but they help explain the generalality of what's going on. The atmosphere is amazing, everybody on campus is so friendly even if you don't know each other. They have a lot of events to get involved in and a ton of clubs! Overall this is a big college with a small college feel. You get to know your professors one on one and build a relationship with them."
College Sophomore,4,"There are so many well connected professors at USFSP, and the internship options are endless, your academic advisor can always give you advice where to go and what to do."
College Sophomore,4,"The staff at the Student Health Center are all very friendly and helpful, it can sometimes take a while to get an appointment, but if there's a pressing issue, they'll usually see you right away. I personally never heard any stories of sexual assault on campus, the Police Department is very close and there's always someone around walking the campus and checking in on the students. I never once felt unsafe walking across my campus late at night by myself."
College Sophomore,4,"I would call it a little pricey, but that's the same for most on campus housing you'll find, the rooms in the USC are huge and with their own bathrooms, I'd say it's totally worth it, and a great experience for first year students. The dorms are super close to classes, right above the Reef (the dining hall) and the RA's are all super nice and helpful, same goes for the RHO dorms, just they don't have a dining hall in their building, but they have the kitchens, would recommend for upperclassmen who don't want a meal plan."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know much about the actual sports teams being that they practice and the games go on at a different campus, however, the on campus facilities for the gym, water sports, the pool, etc. are stellar, I love going out kayaking and paddle boarding and I can do it everyday!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love the overall feel of USFSP, the campus is very welcoming and I felt at home almost immediately. The location is gorgeous, minutes from the beach and the downtown and art districts are thriving. The people I went to school with were so easy to relate to and everyone is so nice, the faculty and staff are all very easy to find and are always willing to help, they're also all very well-informed, so they can keep you that way too!"
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is an unforgettable experience, it opens up so many doors to meet new people and different social groups. The dorms are spaced out perfectly allowing each person to get a personal bedroom of their own, and not having to share closet."
College Freshman,4,"My campus does not have much of a ""Greek life"" per say. There are Greek clubs and organizations that are available for students to join, but my school is not revolved around the Greek life."
College Freshman,4,"The faculty works very well with the students. Class sizes are much smaller than the average state university, and the community is very open and welcoming."
College Freshman,4,"The university has partnerships with many wonderful facilities in the Saint Petersburg area, providing job and internship opportunities for many students."
College Freshman,4,"The community is very safe, and the worst crime is petty thievery."
College Freshman,4,"RHO is great. USC is also pretty good, but the concrete floors and ceiling makes you feel like you're in a prison cell."
College Freshman,4,The staff is very quick to getting to know the students.
College Senior,4,USFSP is a safe school
College Senior,4,The overall experience at USFSP so far is great.
College Student,4,"i love my school, although a bit rowdy at times i wouldn't go to any other school than this one. I would definitely do it all over again at my school, the experience was and is wonderful"
College Student,4,I feel safe enough to go about my business by myself
College Student,4,These people will work with you.
College Student,4,I must admit that the athletics here are nice.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. I've met an amazing group of people this semester, and they make my life better. Our RA is amazing as well."
College Student,4,Provides great preparation for the real world
College Student,4,"Truthfully, anything was better than the instruction I received at my high school. I only needed a small amount of help to push me in the right direction as far as understanding the coursework and so far that has all been provided to me."
College Student,4,"My only concern is that there are only 3 LLC's at the St. Pete campus but the Tampa campus has a larger variety. Also, there are only two on campus opportunities and its easy to see the pros and cons between the two as far as amenities. Where one lacks the kitchenette it makes up for by being located directly above the dining hall. Depending on your level of skill and/or health issue, it can be hard to decide."
College Student,4,"After debating between both campuses, I found one that best suited my needs while still allowing me to commute for the classes it didn't offer. Even though its a small school, nothing beats the outdoors and open feel. It's everything I loved about other colleges while still retaining the uniqueness of USF."
College Junior,4,For the most part they do keep campus always looking pretty good
College Freshman,4,They have classes that can help you in the real world.
College Freshman,4,UPD takes crime very seriously.
College Freshman,4,"The professors put you first, and take time to make sure you understand the material."
College Freshman,4,"I love the building I live in. It's very clean, and the R.A's do their jobs."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school, it's a community and people care about others."
Senior,2,"Not a fan. The showers in the dorms take forever for the water to heat up. Also, the shower was leaking all over the floor at one point, and water was coming through the wall into the bedroom. Maintenance said we just needed a longer shower curtain. My roommate’s dad had to fix it for us! Also, ants and lizards hang out in the stair cases. 
As for the parking garage, they love to hand out tickets! Park slightly on the line and you’re screwed. Don’t even bother trying to fight parking tickets. They don’t care; they just want your money. 
The meal plan people also want to take all of your money for the crappiest food. No variety whatsoever. Food is bland. “Fresh” fruit is mushy and anything but fresh. Plus, the cheapest meal plan is over $1200 per semester. Don’t expect a refund if you don’t use it all. It was impossible for me to use it all because I am small and don’t eat much. The Coral Cafe also has some of the rudest cashiers I’ve ever met."
Sophomore,2,The location is amazing. Beautiful campus right on the water and super close to Tampa. Tons to do in downtown St.Pete more so if you are 21 and over. The school itself is definitely not the best. I had a few GREAT professors and a lot of ehhh or not so good professors.  One of the biggest disappointments I have abut this school is how small it is. I enjoy the small class sizes but it is like high school 2 here. There are cliches of people and everyone stays to their own cliche. Also the party scene..... or lack there of.. There is parties at two places with the same people and the same thing every time. It is easy to get tired of the school and the academics are okay.OH and if you live on campus prepare to be stuffed in one bedroom with 3 people or a two bed room apartment with 8 people! The housing situation is out of control so if you can live off campus do it! It definitely has potential with many great clubs and extra curricular activities though!
College Junior,2,"I don't believe anyone really attends any of the sports games at this campus, unless they attend the main campus in Tampa."
College Freshman,2,not a wide variety of athletics
College Sophomore,2,There is no varsity sports on this campus.
College Freshman,2,"Terrible party scene, none on campus all off campus. Barely any 18+ clubs nearby, best for the over 21 crowd."
College Freshman,2,"I received a small government student loan, and was still short $600 for both fall and spring. Because of this I couldn't dorm either, and thankfully I live within the 30 mile radius to commute and was an exception to the freshman must live on campus rule. If I didn't I would have had to take out a private loan and dug myself into a ton of student debt. If you can;t afford to take out a ton of loans or have some sort of college fund, but aren't poor enough for grants, then you're screwed to put it nicely."
College Freshman,2,"Since the Saint Petersburg campus is so small, there is not much in the wake of athletics. The only varsity sport we have is the Sailing Team. All others are at the Tampa campus."
College Freshman,2,Having to pay upfront about 2000 dollars is crazy. Especially when there is only two extremely unhealthy and gross food vendors on campus that allow you to use the meal plan. It's also not kept too clean and they have limited food variations.
College Junior,2,The school itself doesn't have much of a nightlife. There aren't very many parties. Many of the students are commuters. The average age of the USF St. Pete student is also a little bit older so you don't have the typical freshman booze fests. The city of St. Pete has tons going on constantly though. The first Friday of every month there is a huge block party. There is a block of bars and clubs just a few blocks the school.
College Junior,2,Not very good and I hope it improves next year.
College Freshman,2,I know that there are a few Greek things available but not separate housing for them.
College Senior,2,I wish they had more opportunities off campus to help us students apply and get additional scholarships. 
College Sophomore,2,"It is very difficult to receive financial aid if your parents make a certain amount. My parents make ""too much"" so it is very difficult to receive any sort of aid."
College Junior,2,"The USFSP campus has no athletic teams of its own. Those are solely on the USF Tampa campus. It has intramural teams and wonderful athletic facilities, however. Students can rent kayaks, paddleboards, and sailboats for use in the harbor, or can work out in the gym or campus pool."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, the area immediately around the USFSP campus is prime downtown real estate. There are plenty of condos and apartments, but these are typically out of the price range of the average student. Most of the students I know here either live on-campus (the dorms are pretty ok for the price, compared to other schools) or lived in the area already and are continuing to stay at home. There is one local hotel that offers USF students residency options, but the price is still about $600/month and doesn't include the cost of food or other necessities."
College Student,2,We don't really have campus transportation but the school and the town is small enough and easy to get around.
College Sophomore,2,"When I lived in the dorms, it kinda sucked. So costly, and the rules for visitors were terrible. I heard they changed now,  but before you could only have a visitor twice a month....which is horrible especially if you're a freshman and haven't made many pals yet."
College Freshman,2,"Barely any parking for students who don't have a permit pass, and if you do find a parking spot, its meter parking. I've never seen a bus run by the school, so I'm not sure about that."
College Freshman,2,The nightlife in St.Pete are for those that are 21+ and sometimes certain clubs will have college nights that allow 18+ to join. The best bet for younger students to have more fun is to go to Ybor which requires a taxi or a driver but has a lot more to offer bar & club wise.
Senior,1,"I want to first start by saying this was written during a panic attack induced by the University of South Florida Saint Petersburg. This school has triggered me many times due to the fact that they unfortunately value money over their students love for learning. I don’t think it’s right that a student gets dropped purely because they didn’t sign up for enough classes, or pay on the exact date given. The university made up of many adults that have gone through similar processes as we are today should understand the difficulties that go along with this journey and should be there to support everyone not just those who can make the paycheck. I am an education major and yet my current education is trying to crush those dreams."
Senior,1,"I have wasted so much money and time due to lack of guidance here. I had to medically withdraw from one semester because of a traumatic experience. I then enrolled in the next semester and developed some serious health issues. When I attempted to medically withdraw again, I was told I was abusing the system. It took me 3 appeals to get them to accept my request. 

I gave them another shot. Now, this semester, I enrolled in 2 online courses through USF Tampa. Today I have been dropped from both courses without any explanation or reasoning. So I bought the textbook and online homework program for absolutely no reason. I will now be transferring schools. Too many bad experiences with the faculty and staff here. Most of them are absolutely horrible. Unbelievable!"
Junior,1,"USFSP has a beautiful campus. Sadly, the professors are underqualified. It makes sense, the school has virtually no publicity or internal funding. The faculty are mean, and the campus police GET IN YOUR FACE. Really, a terrible experience so far. None of my friends stayed here, except my amazing girlfriend, who's previous Chemistry professor was so bad and underqualified, that she is now being sued by the school. She is also suing the school. Funny, how did she get hired? Nobody has been offered any money towards retaking the class. Very sad, very money hungry. I hope USFSP either changes. The truth is if you go here, you will get an easy degree and do nothing for it but pay $50,000."
Freshman,1,"I wouldn't recommend this school to anyone, it's like the only kids here, and I say kids for a reason, are the ones who were the ones who always look for trouble. I've had lots of visitors come to visit me here that have called this place, a highschool full of juvenile delinquents. If you care somewhat about your education, don't go here. The only thing everyone cares about in this school is drama. Not worth the money or time, go invest your education in a school that is actually worth it. "
College Senior,1,There are no fraternities or sororities.
College Senior,1,The St. Petersburg Campus of the University of South Florida does not offer fraternities or sororities. There is not effort towards raising Greek awareness on campus.
College Junior,1,I don't know because we don't have Greek Life at this campus
College Freshman,1,"Wish we had Greek life, or could be able to join one from another campus"
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,Off-Campus housing is extremely expensive
College Freshman,1,We have no on campus Greek life
College Freshman,1,The Financial Aid office is pretty much run by students and the students are in charge of answering the majority of your questions. I dislike that. I have had countless issues with the Financial Aid office. I do not personally feel as though I am getting the correct information on how to properly take care of my finances. They do not even see the same screen that I see in my online profile and half of the time do not know anything I am asking about or vice-versa
College Senior,1,There is no Greek life available at this school.
College Junior,1,"There have been improvements recently to the dining and eating, however, these improvements don't make up for the overall quality in the food.  Often times, people get sick of eating it or just plain sick.  The food at least tastes good, but in the end it is all still Sysco food being served by Sodexo."
College Sophomore,1,AWFUL. Absolutely terrible. The prices for what you get is ridiculous and the food quality has had people in the hospital on multiple occasions. The selection on campus is VERY limited and extremely disappointing.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall quality is very poor. Unless you're pressed for time in between classes, I would avoid eating there at all costs."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is horrible at our school. I do not understand how the school is considered a commuter school and there is only one parking garage available with tiny parking lots scattered throughout. The parking garage is narrow so you must drive slow around the corners, which many students do not understand. There is two hour parallel parking spaces located adjacent to the the dorms. You cannot park in them for more than two hours, or you will receive a $25 ticket from the city. There way of tracking the two hours is just horrible. One of the agents drives around all day and marks your tire during a certain point on their route. There is no way they can know my car has been there longer than two hours with that system! There are only 20 free two hour parking spaces. The rest of the spaces require coins."

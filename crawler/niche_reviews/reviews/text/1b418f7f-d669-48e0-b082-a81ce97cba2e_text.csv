Alum,5,"Good experience, easy to use online program, fast response from professor, lots of interaction with classmates."

Sophomore,5,I love how the teachers are involved in making there students as successful as they can be.  I wish that there would be more assistance and help from professors in the areas of history and mathematics.
Niche User,5,"Clarion University is a beautiful campus including the Venango campus. There are always security guards around the school for our safety. They offer wonderful scholarships that you can be awarded. They are very local for anyone in Venango, Clarion, or Shippenville. The food is great and have multiple choices for your liking. They have many activities you can be included in, and you can get into the YMCA with your ID."
Sophomore,5,"Clarion has a wonderful atmosphere.  I came from a high school who had a terrible atmosphere with bullying.  Clarion for me has been a bully free zone.  I am part of the band and chamber singers on campus and have made many friends due to participating in those programs.  I would not change anything about Clarion.   Our president, Dr. Dale, is amazing.  She is always out there with students and interacting with students.  Usually you never come across a university president who cares about their students and community.  Dr. Dale is something special and I am very glad to have her as our president for the university."
Freshman,5,"It’s an amazing college and truly the student life is amazing! Everyone is nice and if you need any help in class you can always ask your professors! Dorm rooms are small, but it’s truly like a home away from home! Also the students here are very nice and are willing to talk and hang out with you!"
Freshman,5,Clarion University is a great small town institution. This is my second semester here and I love it!
Freshman,5,"This campus has a great opportunity to meet new people because it is a small campus. The average is about 4,000 people. It may be small but there are great opportunities to know a lot of people and achieve academic achievements. I feel that this is because students get to have the opportunity of having their professors know them by name!! This campus is placed in a small, quiet community with not too much to do unless you're an outdoors person. There are many nature trails to hike, run, and bike. Not to mention, when its warm there are many things to do with the Clarion River like tubing, kayaking, fishing, etc.."
Niche User,5,"Clarion is such a beautiful campus with some of the most amazing teachers and staff. The area around the campus has lots to do including plenty of restaurants to eat at. The teachers and staff are very willing to help with whatever is needed by students and other staff members. I recommend Clarion University to anyone who is looking for a smaller school in a rural area. The smaller school makes a big difference in the education at Clarion. You have a greater chance of being able to interact with other students and get extra help from teachers whenever you need it. With the smaller classes, the teacher can get to know each student personally and what their weaknesses and strengths are for that class. Clarion University is amazing."
Niche User,5,"I like that Clarion feels like home. Some colleges I visited prior to Clarion were in the middle of big, busy cities. Clarion sits in the middle of a nice town. Main street was enjoyable and reminded me of home. The campus itself was also nice. The dorms, gyms, and all buildings are new and nice, which make it comforting."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Clarion and the programs they offer!!! They work with each student to make sure they are choosing the right major for them and if they want to change your major you can talk to people in that specific major and get insights!
Sophomore,5,Tell others about your experience. What did you like most about clarion university? what would you like to see change?
Sophomore,5,The food could be better but I love everything Clarion has to offer and the friend I made there! I love the location and the town that the campus is in the middle!
Junior,5,Clarion University of Pennsylvania is great! The amount of clubs and activities on campus make it easy to be involved. Clarion is a small town and it easily feels like your home when you’re there!
Sophomore,5,I like it here because there is so much opportunity to be successful  within this campus. The professors truly care about you succeeding and they offer many tools in order to do well in their classes. The student culture is comfortable and feels very safe.  There food is very good and I enjoy their dining services.
Freshman,5,"All faculty I have encountered through their satellite site in Pittsburgh have been wonderful and helpful through the application and acceptance process.  Being an older student, they have helped me access resources I was not aware of before."
Junior,5,"Clarion University of Pennsylvania is a well rounded college with kind students and helpful staff. Great University. Knowledgeable  professors. Great college experience, affordable and awesome. Clarion is a great community for the outdoor lover and a great school for education, speech pathology, and communications.  If people gave it bad reviews, it’s probably because they are incompetent. All in all, lucky to be educated and certainly hold my head high."
Niche User,5,I went to Clarion in February for my first college visit. It was a very beautiful college and quite big. I like how it is on main street which makes it really accessible to other places. the people there are also very friendly. For my business major they offer a ton like to triple major which is pretty cool. They also have a lot of activities to getting involved in sports. I liked the idea of playing in a club sport for them. Overall it is a very good college. I  may be there fall of 2018.
Niche User,5,I love the setting of Clarion. I love the small town feel. I also like that I will be able to know my professors personally.
Freshman,5,"Clarion is a very nice college. It is located in a nice town with lots of things to do but it's not too big. There are so many opportunities here and there are so many ways to get help from advisors and counselors if you ever need help. I would definitely recommend this college to others, choosing to go here made my experience so far much better."
Graduate Student,5,"degree and major -- MSLS in library science
This is an excellent university to earn a library science degree. They also offer an undergraduate degree in library science. You may take the degree online. The class from which I have benefited most is Database Searching. In addition to learning about the various databases I had to write a bibliographic essay which I had published in the university's library science peer reviewed journal. This gave me a start in academic publishing. 
This degree is very helpful as a research degree with courses such as humanities sources, social science sources and sources for the business world. 
Go Eagles!"
Freshman,5,"I attend the Venango Campus in Oil City, PA, and I am majoring in Medical Imaging.  The classes are small and I get individual attention with my professors.  They have tutoring available and many activities.  I commute there and have taken advantage of these services."
Senior,5,Online classes are easy to navigate. The professors are all helpful and usually available whenever you need them. Time management is a must.
Niche User,5,I like their Education program. I like the layout of the campus and the activities available.  There food for the meal plan is really good.
Niche User,5,I love Clarion University because of the well diverse atmosphere and the kind professors. Clarion University is an excellent school to attend because of the small class size and you personality get to know your professors.
Alum,5,"I loved Clarion! The counselors and deans were very helpful. I was always comfortable with my class schedule. It challenged me, but it wasn't overwhelming. ALF is the best! The Fall and feeling of the festival cant be described!"
Freshman,5,I am in the enrollment stage but I have had very good personal service. I feel very welcome and proud to be a part of clarion university.
Sophomore,5,"I love Clarion. I came here unsure about the school. I had plans on going somewhere else but I fell in love with the people and the campus. Clarion is a little bit outdated. However parts of campus are under renovation right now. What I would want for clarion is better enrollment, we need more students."
Junior,5,I really enjoy Clarion University.  I like the smaller campus and smaller classes.  I get to know the professors and other students.  The town is also so nice.
Alum,5,"I was an online student living in San Diego, California who graduated from Clarion University. I have never stepped foot on campus, but I always felt like I was having a great college experience. My teachers and counselor were great at communicating with me, and I finished my Bachelor's way quicker than I thought I would. I also applied and will be going to Clarion University again for my Master's Degree."
Freshman,5,"Clarion is a wonderful University to attend. The academics are wonderful. The professors are very nice and do very well at their jobs, and are very connected. The athletics are wonderful as well. The dining hall could use a few updates on food selections."
Freshman,5,"I have only been attending Clarion University for one semester and so far it is amazing. The campus is awesome, and everyone you meet here is friendly. The only thing that I do not like about the campus is the massive hill I have had to walk up and down to class. If you are not in shape before you come here, you will be afterwards! The professors here are outstanding and are insanely nice and understanding. There are many good things about Clarion, and listing them all would take forever!"
Freshman,5,Clarion University has a wonderful Speech Pathology program. I am a freshman and I feel like I already know so much about the major. It is a small campus with cute shops on Main Street. There are many diverse organizations that are interesting to almost all of the students
Freshman,5,I am currently a student at Clarion University and I absolutely love it here! Everyone is so nice and helpful with everything.  The professors are caring and will do everything they can to help you succeed.
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful. The school has a nice teacher to student ratio. It is extremely safe. They allow their students to practice their freedom of speak on a large apple and i think it is amazing. 
College Sophomore,5,I am a double  major and they are extremely willing to work with me that I may graduate on time.  Also wants me to have some enjoyable electives
College Sophomore,5,No drug OR alcohol issues at all! !

College Student,5,The classes are not that big but every professor try's there best to make sure the students are well taught
College Student,5,Housing is amazing and very clean
College Student,5,I feel at home when I'm at clarion! The faculty and students are really nice and make sure to keep me on track
College Sophomore,5,"My favorite experiences are leadership for marching band, my dual majors, for physics and mathematics professors are excellent and enjoyable to work with and collaborate with, and I love having my own suite on campus."
College Freshman,5,Diversity is fully embraced on campus with many groups advocating for all students to accept those who are different. There are several minority organizations on campus that promote looking past the differences among our students and accepting  and integrating them into the campus. We have an LGBT group called ALLIES that works to inform students of the growing minority of students who are among this group and who should not be shunned for their differences. I have attended a few of their events and have found them very informative and helpful in learning to accept their differences and move on.
College Freshman,5,"The campus police enforce the policies regarding drugs and alcohol very well. There are occasional issues that arise, but they do their best to neutralize the situations and address problems head-on so as to avoid them in the future. I have found that the police are more than willing to do all that they can to avoid issues with drugs and alcohol and keep students safe and happy."
College Freshman,5,"Looking at my overall experience with courses, It's fantastic. There's always going to be that one professor or that one class though that you will never enjoy, but I was able to handle it. Quality is great, variety is great, everything is great."
College Freshman,5,I love my program and school. It's the best decision I've ever made.
College Sophomore,5,"Literally the worst crime that has been committed at CUP was an anti-abortion display of fifty small white crosses were thrown into a dumpster during the night. Nothing serious or scary ever invades our campus, and sexual assault is almost non-existent. I've never witnessed or had to stop any sexual harassments; we seem to treat one another with a high level of respect as a group, like a single community."
College Student,5,I love Clarion because the class size is small and one-on-one time with professors is easily attainable.
College Freshman,5,The online courses are awesome.  The professors response to questions is just as great and they will meet via phone if requested!
College Freshman,5,"As an online student, I have been linked to graduates who are in my area locally.  My advising counselor was able to let me know where I can take courses and who I can contact locally if I needed assistance.  I was set up with a network event in my area that several Clarion alum would be attending and I was able to meet them. It has been an awesome experience so far!"
College Freshman,5,Campus security is always around there are safety call boxes that are well lit at night and the response time is very quick
College Freshman,5,"As an online student, my experiences so far have been great. From speaking with admissions to the registrars office and with   the advising team and course professors and other online students, It's as if I am on campus.  Everyone has been so friendly and concerning and wanting the best outcome to happen.  I have felt welcomed and as a part of the university from the first conversation.  I am glad I chose Clarion University as the school to fulfill my degree needs!"
College Junior,5,"My professors are experts in the field who have prepared me to enter the work force. They spent the time teaching the materials needed to pass my PAPA and Praxis exams, an needed to be successful in the real world."
College Junior,5,"Right out of my undergraduate program, I received an interview, training, and job offer as a substitute while I work on my masters degree. During the interview, they made sure to mention how qualified I was for the position and that they were eager for me to start."
College Student,5,I love this school. Highly recommended and the academics are amazing
College Student,5,Amazing places definitely consider them
College Student,5,I love the school. Highly recommended
College Sophomore,5,"We are a very safe campus here.  Almost nothing bad happens here ever.  I do feel safe walking around by myself during the daytime.  However, at night I do feel a little scared by myself."
College Sophomore,5,Alot of the professors are really great. Freshman year classes are usually pretty big but by sophomore year class sizes are small and you can get a lot more of one on one with the professor.
Junior,4,"Well I'm just about to start at Clarion, but they were the kindest, most responsive, and most helpful throughout the entire process of finding a 4 year college to go to."
Junior,4,"Again, I will be just starting at Clarion. All of my classes will be online. Everyone has been kind and helpful so far"
Sophomore,4,"The school is good itself, the campus is beautiful and the classes are not far. It is on a hill so there's a lot of climbing to do. The food needs to get better at eagle commons but Gemmell is pretty good!"
Sophomore,4,Due to COVID 19 we had to finish out the semester online and ti was not bad. The professors really did their best to provide us with everything we needed to be successful. I would not take a full semester online simply because it's too much to handle.
Sophomore,4,"Clarion University is perfect for me.  It is just the right small size, the professors are very helpful, and it is a great learning environment.  I never imagined that professors would be so willing to help you, even with personal problems.  I love the small class sizes because the learning is more individualized and catered to what you need.  If you are looking for a party school, this isn't it.  There also is not a ton to do around town, especially in the winter."
Freshman,4,"Since Clarion is far from me, I had the opportunity to meet people from a different area and make new friends. Also the experience of living away from home helped me grow as a person and this campus helped me do so."
Freshman,4,The Professors there are truly there to help you succeed not to just get you through their class. They make time for you when needed and know your name.
Senior,4,"I am an extremely involved student leader on campus, something that would have likely been impossible at a larger school. The one on one relationships with professors has also been key to my success."
Freshman,4,"CU is a great small school for anyone looking to attend a small school full of friendly people. The education program is second to none, same with the dorms. Making friends with students and professors is easy. There are plenty of clubs and activities to join and get involved in. Food is lacking, and just like every other college, you have to get involved or else you'll hate it."
Freshman,4,Clarion has a great nursing program and cirriculum. I am satisfied with the academics. There are also many resources to use to ensure the success of every student on campus!
Sophomore,4,"I am taking an online degree program. The prices are very affordable compared to other Pennsylvania colleges. My courses have all been with licensed professors, a lot of them with PhDs. I am able to get feedback within usually a day from the online writing center and the teachers are very flexible. The courses are entirely asynchronous which makes working full time at any time possible while pursuing a degree. Most of the courses are relevant or helpful for my English degree and the professors are always happy to help with career advice and plans."
Alum,4,"I ENTERED AS A JUNIOR AND LIVED IN RALSTON HALL.  I EARNED DEANS LIST, MAJORING IN   TEACHING  K-8. EVERY SEMESTER AND WAS A RESIDENT  ASSISTANT FOR FIRST FLOOR IN THAT DORM.   AS MOST STUDENTS DO,  I LEARNED MAN Y LESSONS AND LIFE SKILLS TOO.
I PARTICIPATED IN AREAS OF INTEREST SUCH AS MUSIC AND DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIPS  WITH A  CONCENTRATION  TOWARD  ACADEMICS. 
CLARION OFFERED FREEDOM  TO EXPLORE AND LEARN AS WELL AS CREATE BOTH IN MY PERSONAL LIFE AND SOUGHT AFTER PROFESSION.  UPON GRADUATING, I WAS HIRED WITH THE BLACKHAWK SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE I ALSO EARNED A READING SPECIALIST DEGREE FROM WESTMINSTER COLLEGE.   AFTER  FURTHER TEACHING EXPERIENCE .   I EARNED A MASTERS DEGREE FROM PENN STATE.  MY MOST RECENT ASSIGNMENT IS AS AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF CHRISTIAN  EDUCATION.  I  NOW VALUE  LIFE AND HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO VOLUNTEER WITHIN MY COMMUNITY AS WELL AS RECEIVE AND PROVIDE  CONTINUING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR  OTHERS.  I AM THANKFUL FOR CLARION UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed my time at Clarion University.  The professors are down to earth and actually want to help the students learn.  They expect you to study the material but they also review it and are happy to answer any questions.  This is especially true as you move out of the General Education courses and into the courses designed for your specialized major.
The campus food is delicious and if you can't find what you want in the main dining hall, there are several other dining options all around the campus.
Located in a quiet small town, the campus is extremely safe.  I always felt safe walking home at night after a full day of classes.  The campus also has a fully staffed security team and does not tolerate hazing so there is very minimal danger on campus.
If you are looking for a safe and fun university to get your degree, I recommend Clarion University of Pennsylvania."
Graduate Student,4,I went to Clarion for 6 years and got a master's of science in speech-language pathology. I enjoyed my time there. I wish I was able to find a job closer to my parents but that didn't happen.
Freshman,4,"It's my first semester here but it's going great so far! The professors are good and happy to help. The restaurants around are very good, and on-campus dining provides lots of variety. I enjoyed the activity board events, they put together some really fun stuff!"
Freshman,4,"I like that everyone is tight knit, but is open to every new person. There are a lot of activities on campus, such as movie nights, and other Thursday night activities. The teachers are very hands on and ready to help you out when needed."
Junior,4,"I am attending online part-time for several years, but it is second nature now. My FAFSA is in place and I take two classes in the spring and two in the fall, the summers and winter breaks I take for me. Sure I could get done faster, but I enjoy the classes more when I don't feel rushed. The professors are really great and I don't feel like an outsider, I feel like I am right there in the class with everyone else."
Freshman,4,"Clarion University is dedicated to its students and to the education that it provides to said students. Although the social scene in the town of Clarion itself is not necessarily the most exciting, it is a safe town and safe campus that lets the students focus on their academics. With that being said, the university itself is occasionally disorganized when it comes to scheduling and finances with the students. Besides that fact, the university is 4/5 stars and I am proud to be a student attending Clarion."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere. Since it is a smaller school, you really have the opportunity to get to know your professors really well."
Junior,4,"I love that they offer all of my classes online. I am a returning adult student. I work full-time, over 50 hours a week. The schedule is flexible and easy to work around."
Junior,4,"I’m inlove with the campus. I’m a local so it’s home for me! I never thought that I was going to go there for school since I seen all the time and because it was so close to my home but here I am. 3 years into schooling and I wouldn’t change a thing. The campus is beautiful, the atmosphere is amazing, and the student and professors are so kind."
Alum,4,"I just graduated from CUP in May 2018. My experience was wonderful. Yes I have had some rough and rocky times but who hasn't in college?! I loved how it was located in a small town, had small class sizes, and how it was such a warm and welcoming community on and off campus. Classes/professors; some are hard and then some professors are better than others. Most are concerned with individual success which is what I liked best. Food; we have different selections for food around campus which is great but of course the quality could be better. People/Environment; since CUP is such a small community everyone knows everyone which is good when all of the students are trying to succeed. Clubs; CUP has so many clubs and organizations that you will never be bored! From Greek life to rock climbing to clubs within your major! Overall, I loved Clarion but you have to have a certain personality to be happy with this college: welcoming, adventurous, caring, and willing to get involved."
Sophomore,4,"I've only been attending Clarion University for a year, but I definitely love it there. I love that it is a small campus, and that there are many things to do. I personally have joined a few clubs, and everyone is very nice and open. No one really judges anyone else, and it's a overall open campus. 
 The university professors are very good at what they do, and are willing to go the extra mile to help their students. And they will work with students to achieve their best self they can be. 
I wouldn't really change anything. There are so many opportunities there, the students just has to utilize them."
Sophomore,4,"Clarion University is a great school with small class sizes, many student organizations, a beautiful recreation center, and a great community to live in. The professors make it a priority to get to know their students and access to help with academics is prevalent. Clarion quickly became a home to me!"
Sophomore,4,"I have loved nearly every moment I have spent at Clarion. It's a beautiful campus, all the staff are so nice, and my fellow classmates are all pretty nice. It's a smaller campus that made me feel at home in no time!!"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy attending Clarion University. The campus is beautiful. The professors are friendly and caring! Also, the food is amazing!!"
Alum,4,I loved the small town aspect of Clarion University and how involved the university students and employees got with the locals and vice versa.
Alum,4,"It's been said many times, but the professors really do know you by name. This makes such a difference in your attitude towards class. Clarion University is away from all the big city noise and is in a small town, so you have less distractions from studies, but many opportunities to get off campus. Cook Forest is nearby and offers a great escape from the stress of college."
Junior,4,"I love meeting new people through school events, whether they're students, alumni or members of the community. It feels like we're all very close knit and working together to make this the best place to live. It feels like a home away from home here. The small class sizes were a big part in choosing Clarion University for me, I love the one on one attention I get from my professors. Because of that, I feel I'm getting the best education as possible."
Senior,4,Clarion is a great college for someone coming from a rural background and looking for a small college. The professors are helpful and the classes are interesting.
Alum,4,Clarion has a good online program and has small class sizes that make it easy to communicate with professors.
Freshman,4,"There are so many activities, clubs, and events on campus. There is honestly something for everyone! The professors wish to see you succeed, and they will help in anyway that they can, if you just ask. The one thing that I would like to see change on campus is the food. I would like to see healthier food options, and more food accommodations for those with allergies or medical needs."
Niche User,4,"A well organized institution that values hard work and a good education.  Each visit to Clarion, I came closer to the realization that it was where I was meant to spend the next 4 years of my life."
Junior,4,The professors are amazing and really care about their students. There's tons of opportunities and clubs on campus so there's always something going on and people are super friendly so making friends is easy.
Senior,4,"Clarion is a great little university located in the mountains of western PA. The professors are absolutely amazing and will go our of their way to see you succeed. Night life can be a little  boring. There are activities every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night but sometimes they just aren't the most exciting. Overall though, a wonderful college to attend."
Senior,4,"Clarion University is a smaller campus that immediately becomes a home away from home. The campus is the perfect size, faculty do everything they can to help, and the students come first."
Freshman,4,"I am enjoying my experience here at Clarion University. I have grown so much being here. The professors are amazing! I am also an athlete, I currently play football here at Clarion University. I am truly looking forward to what the future holds here at Clarion University."
Senior,4,"The campus is particularly smaller than most colleges. This is beneficial in a way that allows for small class sizes. Students are able to get to know each other and their professors easily because of this. Clarion University believes in being courageous and confident in whatever you decide to do. They have many resources and support to help give each student the possibility to succeed. They are many ways to get involved on campus and enjoy the small town atmosphere. Clarion University may be small, but it sure is mighty. The academic excellence of students does not go unoticed. The campus, professors and overall university as a whole is wonderful."
Alum,4,"You are not just a ""number"" here! Your professors actually get to know who you are, and are very helpful every step of your academic career!"
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my first year as a college student at Clarion University. I came here for Speech Pathology and I loved the program! Unfortunately, at the end of my first semester I came to realize that the program wasn't for me and decided to switch majors and transfer to a different school next fall. Clarion helped me in every way to find what was best for me. 

The professors here are very understanding with missing class for sickness, or family emergencies, etc. They are also very open to help you with any questions that you may have. I would recommend this college."
Freshman,4,Clarion is a great school. I love the professors. And the student life is fun. Lots of clubs and activities to be a part of.
Freshman,4,"I am a first semester freshman at Clarion University. So far I am enjoying my time here. I love the diversity and how relatively small the campus is. There are plenty of work opportunities, clubs, and activities around campus."
Freshman,4,"I loved the overall campus feel of Clarion University. The buildings aren't spaced out to far so it's easy to get to classes and the professors are very friendly. They want to help you learn and succeed and are mentors to their students. The only downside is that it's not a big city so activities and things to do are sometimes hard to find. In general, though, it's a great place to continue your education."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently attending Clarion University. I had a really rough transition from high school into college. Coming here with a 3.7 GPA only to bring it down to a 0.8. It was bad. I was put on Academic Probation where I got a lot of help from different services that are offered here at the university, and I met some awesome people. Much like the line from Harry Potter, ""Help will always be given to those who ask for it."" words to live by in college. The staff that I had to meet with managed to help me get to where I needed to be and directed me help when I needed it. I love it here at Clarion. The moment I walked onto campus my January 2015 when I toured it felt like home. Our Black Student Union is really nice and has many different actives open to everyone on campus, Or Allies group does a yearly drag show during the spring semester. The Marching band is getting bigger and bigger each year! There's a ton of different religious groups, and groups of other interests."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Clarion University has been pretty good so far. the classes are small, which I like because it allows students to participate more and comprehend the lessons more efficiently. The staff at Clarion is very nice, and very helpful. The dorms are also very nice."
Junior,4,"I think Clarion is a wonderfuk school. I would change the Biology program so that Pre-Med students aren't taking the same classes as straight Biology students, such as Ecology."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore nursing student at Clarion University and I love my school. So far I have had amazing experiences from my classes to the relationships I have made on campus.  One of the changes that should be made is the organization of the college. There have been a few instances where there was miscommunication due to a lack of organization with my program. Besides that, I have no other complaints."
Junior,4,I love this college!  I am a small town girl at heart who loves the country so this small college surrounded by woods in this small quite town is the perfect fit for me!
Freshman,4,"Very nice school and great activities boards! The staff are very helpful and kind. The living is not too bad, Reinhard is the best which is where I live and yes freshman can live here! "
Recent Alumnus,4,This college seems very promising and willing to help their students succeed
College Sophomore,4,"Not party as in alcohol,  but our suites on campus always have some kind if theme parties to  let us get to know others"
College Sophomore,4,"THEY are extremely open to every diversity,  sexual,  politics,  religious and economically! !!"
College Student,4,One of the best around
College Student,4,Good athletics and very good coaching staff
College Sophomore,4,I love my professors! Hands Down!
College Sophomore,4,I believe that the school pushes the issue of sexual assault when it happens. They let students know when something has happened and encourages us to be safe.
College Sophomore,4,Valley Suites is one of the best housing on campus! Many activities created by the CA's
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are convenient to most students.
College Sophomore,4,Clarion is a warm welcoming University filled with intelligent people who deeply care about the success or future success of one another.
College Sophomore,4,"Even now, as a sophmore, I a m sbk e to apply for summer internships thru university.  There is slso a research center available for students off ca mpus, and you ca n research with professionals, a nd if you create something, you have the ability to patent it, for free!!"
Niche User,2,"The food at Eagle Commons would make people sick, and there is not really much to do on or off campus. If you can manage living through those 2 problems, then you will have a great time"
College Sophomore,2,We do not really have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,For my career I feel that we do not have a lot of job recruiters available at our school.
College Junior,2,"I live in the Reinhard apartments.  They are about a mile down the road from the University.  It is still considered on campus, but I don't get the feeling of it being on campus.  I don't have a car, so I have to rely on a bus.  I don't mind the bus but it doesn't run past 10pm.  What makes me angry is that if I need to stay on campus past 10pm, I have to either walk or try to find a ride back to my house.  Another thing that I don't like is that during the winter if the streets are too icy for the buses to run and stop the bus route and if I'm on campus, then I would have to walk a mile in the cold and slipping all over the place because the buses aren't working.  Lastly, Reinhard is the cheapest place to live that is on campus.  Even though the university says that Reinhard is considered on campus, I just think it's reidiculous that the cheapest place to live isn't even on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not enjoy my program, the facilities are old, and there are no opportunities after graduation."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want an education, one that's worth the money you are putting into it, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
College Sophomore,2,"Between the poor facilities, the workload, lack of job opportunities and internship opportunities, the academics are a joke. If you look at the career fair they have, unless you want to work at a local store or internship at the University itself, you will be disappointed."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want a great academic experience, you will want to go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Houses are in poor conditions, and I wouldn't recommend staying in them unless you need to. They are much cheaper then being on campus, so you have to think about what's best for you."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you find something to do on your own, you will be bored out of your mind. If the police hear of any parties, they shut it down immediately. I can sum it up in four words. Clarion University hates fun."
College Sophomore,2,"Other than Gemmell, it's bad. No late night options because everyone goes home on the weekend, and they know this. Unless you want to go hungry, eat before 11 pm. Almost nothing is open past that, not even chain restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,"I came into this school thinking it'd be great. Turns out I was so wrong, and I couldn't be more disappointed. The Administration doesn't care, and often seem to do things to make the school worse. They don't listen to the students, and want to turn Clarion into a ""money making entity."" They spend money on crazy things (a food truck)... The professors are hit or miss. They can either be great, or so bad it hurts. I thought I'd come into a great experience, that wasn't the case."
College Freshman,2,"I hate living on campus, there's too many rules."
College Sophomore,2,"There is nothing to do after awhile, it gets boring quick."
College Sophomore,2,CA/RA  write up people for every little thing
College Freshman,2,I don't go to parties. I hear there are a few. Cops are around a lot. I party in my dorm with my roommate and our friends.. Nothing too extreme.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the Traditional dorms that are being torn down next year. They are awful. Its 100 degrees all the time, they are impossible to keep clean and you can not ride the elevators without risking your life."
College Senior,2,"There is nothing to do around these parts. You pretty much have to travel in order to find a good shopping place, fun events or attractions. Locals have good attitude towards students as they do anyone else."
College Junior,2,"Our campus is very strict. They have nothing to do in town, so they focus all their attention on the college students."
College Sophomore,2,The houses are older looking and don't seem worth living in. I like living on campus where I am near everything.
College Sophomore,2,They do not salt properly during the winter time I have fallen a few times on the ice and nothing has been done when I reported it.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the houses look run down and it is too expensive when I could just live on campus.
College Freshman,2,The off campus in oil city is very small and there is not much else to do but study
College Junior,2,Either raining or snowing. Very few sunny days. VERY windy.
College Student,2,I had to talk to numerous different people who referred me to other people who were unable to help me in an efficient manner or really at all.
College Junior,2,ITS SO COLD ! BUNDLE UP!
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any scholarships from my school. 
College Junior,2,"Weather here is crazy, one day it could be warm and sunny, and the next snow flurries. The winters are pretty cold, which makes walking to class terrible, but the fall and spring are gorgeous. Always loved Pennsylvania's scenary during those season changes where the leaves change color and such. Unfortunately though, if it's not snowing or rainy, it's overcast; campus and the town are packed with students when we finally get a nice day."
College Sophomore,2,I have to walk back to my dorm alone at night because I work late and I am always scared. I feel myself walking faster and faster each night because of the strangers around me. I haven't seen any violence on the campus but that doesn't mean it does not happen.
College Senior,2,I think parking is one of the biggest issues at the school. On campus the lots are separated by permits and only certain people are allowed to park in certain places. Being a commuter I feel like no matter what lot I park in I have to walk the whole way across campus to get to class.
College Senior,2,"Aside from studying and drinking, not much happens at Clarion University.  There are clubs to become involved with, but unless you go Greek (not for everyone!), there is not much to do.  It is not a very lively campus, at all."
College Senior,2,"Clarion University offers good academic programs for a relatively small amount of money.  The downside is that Clarion does not have much for a social scene.  The campus is nice enough, but the University could be so much more than what it is currently.  I don't know of any student who I could say has true ""school spirit"" about Clarion University."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't get there early enough, all the spots may be gone"
College Freshman,2,"Crap, crap, crap! If you don't mind being cold and having rain in your face for a good 3 months straight then you will be fine. Other than that if you enjoy warm sunny weather you'll have to wait a while before the bipolar weather switches over. One day it will be 30 degrees..and the next 75. No joke. It's unpredictable so bring lots of clothes!! Classes don't really get cancelled so don't get your hopes up. However, when the sun does shine EVERYONE is out about doing something."
College Freshman,2,"Weather is crappy here. It is constantly changing. It snows, it rains, the sun shines, just like any other school. The weather does not often affect the walking from class to class. But the nice weather is appreciated!"
College Junior,2,Theres not many spots to park at and most of them you have to pay for.
College Sophomore,2,"Students mostly only pay attention to basketball and football. While our teams aren't that good, it gives students something to do."
College Senior,2,"Clarion's claim to fame is the annual Autumn Leaf Festival (ALF) which is held for a week starting at the end of Sep - early Oct. It attracts a lot of locals and people from the regional area, and it is a nice way to spend the day/afternoon (there are food vendors, rides for kids, and local crafts, etc. for sale) but don't expect it to blow your mind away. Clarion is a small town with Walmart being the key place to shop at. There is also a movie theater near Walmart located inside of a tiny mall. One nice thing is that there is a separate bus aside from the campus bus that takes people to the mall and Walmart complexes."
College Sophomore,2,Many of the facilities are very outdated and sometimes there aren't enough for everyone to use.
College Sophomore,2,"If you live on campus all you have to do is get a parking pass which is $150. If you are commuting, sometimes the main lot gets full, but there are two other big lots you can use!"
College Senior,2,"It Depends. The food is okay for the most part, but when I first came to Clarion I got so sick. They only make the food good during orientation to lure the families in."
College Sophomore,2,Local Town – there us nothing in the local town of clarion pa it is only alive because of the money that the school brings in
College Junior,2,"Do We Have Anything to Worry About? With the exception of a few incidents that have occurred on campus within the last five years, the was never a time that I have ever felt less than safe while I have been on Clarion University's campus. For the most part, we are healthy. If by any chance a student were to become ill, the Keeling Health Service Center is easy to get a hold of and readily able to refer students to the hospital in the event of an emergency. As for both of these amenities on campus, Public Safety and the Keeling Health Services Center, they go above and beyond in providing the best services they can for the students, faculty, and staff of Clarion University."
College Senior,2,"The nice on campus housing places are the Suites and Reinhard. They are expensive, more quiet, and private. 
Wilk and Nair are typical dorms. Bed, desk, dresser and that's it. Good thing for freshman so you have the opportunity to meet more people and make more friends.
The suites, wilk and nair are close to campus. 
Reinhard is the most far, highly recommended to have a car if living there. Best campus housing for upperclassmen."

College Senior,2,"It usually snows or rains a lot the majority of the year, classes never get canceled so walking to classes through that is fun. But, usually the few days at the beginning (Aug) and the end (May)of the year are beautiful."
College Sophomore,2,Prettty Convenient When You DON't Need It – On an everyday basis the parking is easy to pay for and get a space. However my boyfriend got a ticket once for staying on a Sunday night when there was not even a sign saying he needed a permit for the weekend. Interestingly they put one up a month after. I thought it was pretty irritating and totally a rip off of $15.
College Freshman,2,"I would say school spirit is lacking at Clarion. Our sports teams are usually average. The athletic facilities are old (except the new rec center), but they are hoping to renovate in the next few years. There are a lot of athletes on campus and they are close knit with their other team mates."
College Sophomore,2,Meter Maid Madness – Be aware of the meters on campus. If you use them be sure to put enough money in or you'll be sure to find a nice ticket on your windshielf. I think the campus police go around and give people parking tickets for entertainment.
College Junior,2,"Parking is enforced on Venango Campus. The cost is $65 a year and dorm students have individual parking spots and are in walking distance to the school. However, students aren't conscientious when they open their car doors and have damaged my new car. Plus, there are days when you are lucky to find a spot."
College Junior,2,The computers are not conviently located in all of the buildings. There is a computer lab in the business center and small lab in the library. Often the library is full and I do not own a computer so it makes it hard to get assignments done in a timely fashion.
College Freshman,2,The girls at clarion are mostly from western Pennsylvania.  They wear Camo to class and like guys who are giant rednecks who dip and Drive F150's (who are not in short supply).  Most of the people here are very proud of being ignorant.  I have heard people brag that the only time they have ever been to a city was for a steelers game or that they have never been outside of Pennsylvania.
College Junior,2,the weather is so crazy. The weather goes up and down which makes it so easy to get sick. But when its nice it will be very nice and when its bad it gets really bad up here. its like a different air is up here compared to the city
College Senior,2,"I'm not invovled in Greek life but most people don't really like them. The soroities are seen as sluts who like to get drunk and the frats are guys who like to get drunk and sleep with girls. 
The Greek houses aren't near campus and the parties get a little out of control. There is no ""Greek row"" or anything that with all the houses being spread out in random places. Most aren't even offical...just some of the members living together...."
College Senior,2,Apartments Are Expensive – Clarion is a college town and landlords take advantage of the students need for apartments.  Rent is expensive
College Senior,2,Clarion Loves Their College Students – Clarion is a small town with convenient and fast food restraunts near by.
College Junior,2,"Be Careful – The police on campus are always out looking for parties and illegal activites. I have never been in trouble so I don't know their procedures, but I have spoken to people who have had encounters with the police and they said they take offenses very seriously."
College Junior,2,"The parking situation at Clarion University is one of my only complaints of the campus as a whole.  The parking permit costs are reasonable, and a car is not exactly necessary at Clarion, especially for dorms.  Students living at apartments or Reinhard Villages find it easier and more convenient to have a vehicle, but there are buses that will take students to and from campus for free.  Although there are many parking lots around campus (typically one for each area of campus), they normally do not have enough spaces for all the cars and many students must drive around for a long time before they find a space (or give up completely).  Many times I have had to park on side streets fairly far away from the campus so that I would not be late for class.  Around noon is the worst time for parking, but there are not areas designated for a specific class (freshman, sophomore, etc), so everyone has an equal chance to park.  The best bet to get parking is to take early morning classes or afternoon-evening classes."
College Junior,2,Financial aid process if kind of difficult and stressful to deal with. I was able to get financial aid but to maintain it wasn't all that easy. The people of the Financial aid office can be very impatient and rude if you are confused about the process.
College Freshman,2,I dont think its that important but i could be wrong i know i dont care of them
Sophomore,1,"If you're looking for a place that will support you, especially if you're a  non-traditional student, don't bother. My advisor never knew what was going on, the financial aid office is useless and rude, and expect everyone they're talking to has zero life experience and is in their late teens or early twenties. If you're an online student, let alone a functioning adult, they seem to ignore you. The bookstore is a nightmare, almost everyone in the office is rude, and the Dean is absent. More importantly, there is ZERO communication among the office staff.
If you've got at least an average level of intelligence and foresight, go somewhere else. After only two semesters of utter bullcrap, I transferred out to a superior university and I'm so happy I did. Waste of time, spend your money somewhere else.  If you like to be challenged and feel like you're getting a proper education for your chosen field, don't go here."
Senior,1,"Housing is overpriced, they don't help you find a future career, or at least fail trying. They have no regard for your situations and are unforgiving. Take your money, and go somewhere with a better name if you ever want to find a decent job out of college. I got my job through my own hard work and effort, not because of Clarion University, and they will never see another dime from me. Take my advise and go to a name brand school, spend the extra couple thousand and get something worthwhile from it. Clarion is not a good school. Plain and simple."
College Sophomore,1,"It's almost impossible to get an internship, and they don't help at all. If you can get an internship, they try and make you do an internship for the school. They do it so they can get free services, you don't learn anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Basically think of a room full of white people, that's Clarion. Other than a few minorities, it's lily white."
College Sophomore,1,They don't care about the facilities or how things look unless it's New Student Orientation Day.
College Sophomore,1,"I came into Clarion thinking it was the best place for me. I feel deceived. It turned out this was the worst choice I could have made, and with all the things going on with loosing so many people (transferring and dropping out) you can see why the student population has dropped 25%"
College Sophomore,1,"I could write a book about how bad the school is. The professors are okay, but some are just terrible. Out of around 60 credits, I'd say about half of them had professors that were so bad it hurts. They don't update grades, don't put things on D2L, don't come to class, and so much more. If you're looking for great professors, look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"Basically, unless you want to be a cashier, a burger flipper, or any other minimum wage job, go to Clarion. Want something better, go elsewhere. Your degree is basically meaningless, and it will get worse as the years go by."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than the Women's Volleyball team, the athletics are horrible. The facilities are so bad, and the gym is literally falling apart. How they get student athletes, I will never know."
College Sophomore,1,"Only a few good restaurants on main street, nothing much other than that."
College Sophomore,1,"It couldn't be any worse. Basically anyone who in a position of power hates you. They will lure you in, after that, they just want your money and could care less about you."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a state school, so basically what that means to you is that unless you are poor, good luck trying to get any type of financial aid. Unless you consider a loan financial aid, don't expect any money to help pay for school."
College Sophomore,1,Campus police are EVERYWHERE. Feel like I am in a prison on watch.
College Sophomore,1,"Getting in was easy, they lied about how good their communications department was. The smaller professors in the Communication department care about their students, but 2 of the ""higher ups"" act like Gods and treat their students with no respect."
College Sophomore,1,"The value of a degree from Clarion is probably equivalent to a HS Diploma plus about $70,000"
College Sophomore,1,"The students do not care about their sports teams. The only students that go to events it seems are the students from other sports teams that support one another and the students that work at the events. It's a disappointment that nobody on campus really cares about the athletics that the university has. Part of that maybe because the lack of winning and lack of Male sports on campus. The University has 9 (soon to be 10) women sports programs against 6 male programs. Only 3 of the Mens programs are major US sports (baseball, football, basketball). The baseball team cancels half their home games and nobody seems to know where to find the field (back of Memorial Stadium).. The Football team can't seem to win more than 5 games in a year, and it's too cold by the end of the year, and the basketball team is slowly on an incline to hopefully some PSAC Championship, but still 4 years away at least. It would be nice for the University to add a mens soccer program (which they can afford) as another ""team sport"" fans can enjoy."
College Senior,1,First year I have to deal with it and I hate it
College Senior,1,Cops are everywhere on the weekends. They are always looking for someone to give a ticket to or underage. They honestly ruin everything fun.
College Junior,1,It is always raining or snowing.
College Freshman,1,The best place to eat is subway.
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation provided.
College Freshman,1,Walking to class is awful! Its so bitterly cold that by the time i get to class I cant wait to sit down and start learning just to get warm!
College Sophomore,1,This is why I don't have a car
Recent Alumnus,1,it hasn't been that great it could be a whole lot better
Recent Alumnus,1,its not that great but you make fun when you are there so you can have a good time
College Freshman,1,Getting caught breaking any laws or university rules will result in fines and huge punishments.
College Senior,1,"It snows a lot and can accumulate to a good bit. Classes are never cancelled unless there is a state of emergency issued though. Aside from the snow, the weather can be pretty gloomy and depressing. There are some nice days, but they tend to be few and far between."
College Freshman,1,not much diversity very few blacks but a ton of whites
College Sophomore,1,Classes are so boring. What is learning?
College Sophomore,1,It SUCKS! There are only McDonald's and KFC. UGH. Only food for lower class people.
College Sophomore,1,Many of them are snooty and pretentious. The atmosphere here isn't that welcoming.
College Sophomore,1,The teachers are not that interested in their students and we don't have much access to funding and research opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Graphic Design – I majored and graduate in graphic design, however the university does not teach web design.  This limits the students ability to finding a career.  Also, the teacher is not helpful. The computer courses  require a lot of outside of class work due to having to teach yourself how the software works."
College Senior,1,"Unless you're 21 of older there isn't much night life around Clarion. There are a few bars, you'll see the same people in them every weekend. 
On campus has an EFSN (every Friday and Saturday night) that they hold where they watch movies and play games. that underage on campus people can check out
Once upon a time, Clarion had many open house parties, not they are more invite only. Bigger parties are busted by 1 130"
College Senior,1,"If Your Caught You Will Be Charged – Underage: Campus is dry so they are VERY strict about drinking in the dorms, if you're caught by an RA you'll be punished through the school only (more than likely) but if you live in Rienhard or you're in a car you will more than likely be dealing with the police who will charge you and also inform the school so you'll be punished both ways. Those with multiple infractions will be kicked out.
Over 21: Cops ENJOY pulling people over so it's best to not even try, even if you are ""the best drunk driver"" or ""only tipsy"". They will charge you immediately. 
Dorms are pretty strict about quite hours and will write you up.
Rienhard isn't nearly as strict as the dorms"
College Freshman,1,You'll Never Figure It Out – It's impossible to get any good information around here.
College Freshman,1,Expensive 150 dollar parking permit for a s****y school... but then again you always want to leave the town... Police are always ticketing :/
College Freshman,1,"Clarion is NOT what is advertised – There is little to no diversity. There is a bus , but it only rides one route and ends at 7pm. If you do not have a car your are completely stranded, because there is no bus route that at least rides to Pittsburgh. I have found hairs numerous of times in my food at eagle commons. The financial aid office does not help you AT ALL, and doesn't really care if you continue to explain to them, that you don't understand. The financial aid office actually lost my paper work from the summer, so my financial aid didn't go through until the end of fall. There is officially no clubs. There is one pool hall. The town is so small, if your from a city like me you will get bored immediately. "
College Junior,1,The financial aid process there is so backed up and they are always behind no matter how early you have everything done. They tend to ignore you and your phone calls and don't even explain things to you. Theres a serious lack of communication and help. Most financial aid isn't done until the end of the fall semester.
College Junior,1,"The Clarion area is known to be very wet, whether that be by rain or snow. A lot of the time in the spring it's necessary to carry an umbrella with you in your bag and wear rain or snow boots. In the winter, students bundle up and wear hats, gloves, and snow boots to handle the cold and wet weather. If you drive, it's important to start your car about fifteen minutes in advance to warm it up and scrape the snow and ice off the windows. The weather itself does not necessarily get the bad grade, but it is the road care and parking lot care. The roads are not cleared very well and it is sometimes dangerous in the mornings going to class."

Junior,5,"Ithaca college is a great school! Since it is a smaller school, the classes are a manageable size and you can build personal relationships with you professors."
Junior,5,The professors have done a really good job with online classes. The school and professors are very understanding of the difficulties of online learning and give a lot of flexibility.
Sophomore,5,"The online classes were okay, but also, they were as best as IC could offer with short notice.
Most of my classes went asynchronous, and (in quite an organized fashion, might I add) I received weekly assignments which I generally didn't have to complete until the end of the semester, but some by the end of the week.
One class met over Zoom, it was not as good as the asynchronous classes but did what it could.
Extensions became much more available, and professors were patient and available to help. Some assignments were removed and all the grading became much more lenient (I received straight A's and I'm generally a B/B+/A- student.) This was very appreciated considering the stress."
Sophomore,5,"Theres a lot to say about IC. Personally, I love it. It's exactly what I wanted but I'd also been researching a lot (including this site) for colleges before applying. It's a super environment, no toxicity, feels safe, no peer pressure, super easy to make friends. (There are ALWAYS exceptions.) Classes are great, but coming from IB they're pretty easy. I've had some friends who are really struggling, but professors are easy to get in touch with and get help from. They are so kind and interesting (to reiterate, always exceptions.) People complain about the food but it really fluctuates day to day. Frankly, calling themselves diverse is a bit of a stretch. Sure, by skin color, yes. But I'd say max. 90% of the student body is from the northern east. Liberal, but I've seen some republicans. They're fine. Students clap back hard when they hear of injustices on campus, and we had regular climate marches. The Covid response is average, but better than many other colleges."
Freshman,5,I love the fact that I.C. is a medium size liberal arts college and the fact that the school allows me to study what interests me. They also have a very strong alumni network!
Freshman,5,They smoothly shift from in-person to remote classes. The professors and staff members all helped us to learn how to use online platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet.
Freshman,5,Overall my professors were very supportive and understood how this year was difficult for all of us and were very understanding with any issue we had now that we were doing online classes and back in our homes with distractions.
Freshman,5,So far I have enjoyed every experience I have had at Ithaca. The environment is ideal for me and the academics part as well has been challenging yet motivating.
Senior,5,"The theatre program in particular is what makes the experience so uniquely remarkable for me. The training is very focused and there is an emphasis on making sure the students support each other while they grow alongside each other, which contrasts to other theatre programs where the tendency is to be community. The campus holds a vibrant community with attention to diversity and hearing and listening to the students when problems arise and letting it lead to real change rather than stifling concerns. Students here are focused and driven while also laid back, and therefore achieve a really nice balance that highlights that growth happens outside the classroom during these years on campus as much as in it. Through the years, students also have the chance to collaborate with other majors and combine talents to bring out the best in each other. The college consistently churns out confident, capable, and creative people who are more than equipped to succeed in their chosen field."
Freshman,5,"This school was nearly the opposite of everything I was looking for when on my college search, yet it turned out to be the best place for me. The area is beautiful and I love it so much, especially with how close it is to Cornell and the opportunities that provides in addition to the ones provided by the college."
Freshman,5,"As international more in Financial aid as our currency has gone down by 30 % vis a vis US dollars 
Also find work study program to help meet expenses plus a good Co op for future experience in given field"
Alum,5,"I received an excellent liberal arts education at Ithaca College. The professors and coursework challenged me in ways that I didn't fully realize until I graduated. I took courses that I was genuinely interested in and grew from the varied educational opportunities available to me through IC. I also loved the surrounding community.
I graduated a few years ago; while I was in school, I felt that the college could have provided more assistance with finding internships/summer jobs related to my major."
Niche User,5,"I loved the way students talked about Ithaca while I was touring the school. The staff was so wonderful and friendly. But I would say the best thing was how informative everyone I talked to was. A huge barrier I'm experiencing with colleges right now is the complete lack of communication and information given to me when I have questions. However, Ithaca didn't try to redirect me back to their website. They kindly explained what the website said but then furthered the information given and gave me more, which is exactly what I needed."
Sophomore,5,I love Ithaca College! The professors are amazing and truly care about the success of their students. The surrounding area is beautiful. There is so much to do and explore! The only drawback is the cost of attendance. It is very expensive and the cost of tuition rises every year.
Junior,5,"I love attending Ithaca College. Ithaca truly has become my home. All of the people there, (students, faculty, staff) do an excellent job of creating a welcoming and loving community. I originally was worried that I wouldn't like being there because it was too different from my home (NYC) but now I like being there more than I do my actual home. Ithaca has an excellent school of communications which houses my major, Television and Radio Broadcasting. Thanks to Ithaca, I have been able to work on multiple television shows with our student run TV network, ICTV and have been able to work as a Master Control Operator in the school's Server Room, where I gain real life work experience."
Alum,5,graduated in 1996. played sports. got into grad school. met many great people. special place in my heart
Niche User,5,"Ithaca College is, first of all, a visually beautiful school.  The town of Ithaca is a vibrant and fun college town.  All staff at the school are very friendly, helpful, and seem highly intelligent."
Sophomore,5,"Ithaca College is a wonderful school, I would like to see more diversity on campus and also better food services."
Niche User,5,Ithaca was an amazing experience. They really care about your academics and make sure that you're on track to graduate on time. Their sports program is well-disciplined and makes sure that your the best athlete that you can be.
Alum,5,"Loved my time at Ithaca. Great college in a great college town. Strong professional programs along with a lot of opportunities to explore your interests. Winters can be tough, but there's always a lot to do on campus and the Finger Lakes are awesome year round."
Freshman,5,Ithaca College is a place where students can get a great education and have a fun college experience.
Freshman,5,"After getting past being very homesick and lonely the first few weeks I’m really starting to enjoy my time here. Making friends isn’t very easy for me but I’ve joined a lot of very interesting clubs which there are A LOT of and even found my first ever D&D group. Everyone on campus is extremely friendly and I have yet to encounter anyone who isn’t. There are lots of ways to get involved on campus with community events, community council (which I recently joined), clubs, and even events in your residence halls. All of my professors are super cool and fun to listen to and I am enjoying all of my classes so far. Do research on professors in certain classes because not all of them will be as great as the ones I have. Also for anyone thinking about majoring in Comp Sci, the department is very small here but all of the professors are cool and there is a pretty nice community within the department."
Freshman,5,"Ithaca College, for me, thus far has helped construct a safe and welcoming atmosphere that 100% advocates for higher learning as well as career oriented opportunities that in turn help the students."
Sophomore,5,I'm a Theatre Studies Major and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else! Everyone is so talented and the professors are incredible human beings. The alum network is extensive and they love giving back to the school / students. Ive learned so much thus far. I love it!
Freshman,5,"I am excited to say that this fall I will be starting as a freshman at Ithaca College! When I toured the campus, I immediately loved the friendly atmosphere and medium-sized campus. The housing on campus looked really nice. At the accepted student's day I had endless possibilities to ask questions to many different staff members about the school. Can't wait for the fall."
Graduate Student,5,Ithaca College is a really great school.  The professors and staff are extremely helpful and willing to work with students.
Alum,5,"Ithaca College is a fantastic place to go for an undergraduate degree. The most valuable thing that I've gotten from attending IC is the alumni community. As a film major, I recognized the importance of keeping up with contacts. I am proud to say that as a cinematographer in NYC, I can owe a lot of my success to the people I met while at IC."
Junior,5,"Although I do not think Ithaca College is for everyone, I definitely feel welcome and glad that I attended for my degree. The Writing Department is really amazing and I have barely had any professors so far that I did not absolutely love and learn a lot from. The campus is pretty small and the weather can be harsh but it has fulfilled its role as a home away from home for me at least. I would just say your experience of the school really depends on what field of study you're interested in because some departments are definitely lacking more than others. It's an arts school for sure!"
Freshman,5,It's good. Very nice! I really liked the fact that the people their are all so friendly and that they made it so that my stay was enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,I love Ithaca College! They are pushing for a more diverse campus and I’m glad to be apart of that change!
Sophomore,5,"Ithaca College is one of the most welcoming places you could possibly be.  People smile as you walk by, they hold open doors, and everyone there just seems to be whole heartedly kind. .  I just completed my first year there, and I met some of my favorite people.  We explored the community together, tried many new restaurants that I probably would have never gone to and got to see all of the amazing gorges.  Going to Ithaca was the best decision I have made."
Freshman,5,"Ithaca college has been such a great choice for me. There are so many different opportunities on campus to get involved. Ithaca has five different schools within the college, and there is something for everyone. The athletics are high level division 3, and there is also opportunities to get involved with club or intramural level athletics. The dorms are nice, depending on where you are living. Towers is definitely the best place to live for freshman. The downtown area is amazing, there are tons of restaurants and there is a local farmers market as well. IC has been a great school for me so far, I can't wait to return."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshmen I've only been there twice, but that was enough for me to commit to going there for the next four years. The campus is wide and modern, the town itself is lovely. On accepted students day I talked with multiple students and staff and each and everyone one of them was engaging, attentive to my questions and worries, and very informative on all aspects, from dorms to class work to post-education success. Ithaca is also right next to Cornell University, and hearing about all the speakers and events that the two share makes student life feel more exciting. Ithaca is the perfect, isolated place to escape from home and focus on your studies and enjoy the college experience to the fullest."
Senior,5,"Ithaca College is a fantastic institution and highly underrated in my opinion. The area is absurdly beautiful, with a ton of hiking trails within walking distance from the school. The vast majority of my professors have been truly invested in the topics they teach and thoroughly enjoy demonstrating their passion. The athletics are great for individuals who are still in love with their respective sport, but have the foresight to see their is more to life. All in all i wouldn't have made any other choice and am excited to join the workforce and truly utilize the skills I've been developing over the past few years."
Niche User,5,"I went to visit and it's so great!! It is my top choice school because of how beautiful it is up there, the Health Science program is fantastic, I heard it has good food, and its a very lively campus!"
Freshman,5,Amazing!! Ithaca college is a great school for music. The campus is beautiful and I love the faculty. Everyone there is super helpful and inspiring. Ithaca makes me feel like I’m home. The view of the lake is unbelievable.
Junior,5,I love the accessibility of the professors and all of the hardworking friends I have made. I have had so many opportunities to become a better musician and I am so happy I decided to come here.
Freshman,5,It’s absolutely beautiful! The staff is so accepting if the anyone a part of the lgbt community and is very helpful! The theatre community is the best and all of my professors are sweet.
Alum,5,"Ithaca as a city is the perfect place to attend college. The experience at Ithaca College was greater than the academics. By this I mean the people I met, the things I experience, and so on had a greater value in the long run than did the lessons I learned in the classroom."
Freshman,5,I love the feeling I get being there.  The people are so friendly!  There are always activities going on so you won't be bored.  I have met some of my best friends there.
Niche User,5,"Ithaca College is a small four-year liberal arts college filled with amazing down-to-earth students. Ithaca has a unique program called Exploratory, which gives students personalized help in finding the right major for them."
Junior,5,Ithaca College is on the rise to becoming one of the best private colleges to attend. They obtain a wide range of clubs and organizations to keep yourself involved and active on campus. My experience is one that I am still getting to know. The professors make themselves available and truly care about the outcome of their students. I only hope to make my college experience better as each year passes.
Senior,5,Ithaca College has been a great fit for me. I have had numerous opportunities because of IC's small size and professor to student ratio. I've learned a lot and made some incredible friends.
Sophomore,5,Ithaca college does an incredible job of making you feel at home right from the beginning. As soon as I arrived on campus for orientation I was able to find friends and explore that campus. They also do a great job of getting students adjusted to college with their freshman seminar program. I couldn't ask for  better college experience.
Junior,5,"Campus community is friendly, thoughtful, accepting, and active.  Professors go above and behind both inside and outside the classroom.  So many clubs and organizations available.  Between alumni and professors, there are so many connections to build experience and your resume."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Ithaca College for so many reasons! The college has so much to offer especially to undergraduate students so you are getting experience in your major day 1 on of class. The professors there are amazing and I have yet to have one that has not made a positive impact on me. There is always activities and events going on on campus so there is never a dull moment at Ithaca College. Overall, it is an amazing school and anyone who attends will not be disappointed."
Sophomore,5,I am in the Park school and I can honestly say it's one of the best experiences. I feel very prepared to advance into the workforce and IC provides an amazing network of alumns to get me where I want to be.
Junior,5,This is an incredible school for communications and there are so many opportunities to learn but it can feel like a bubble at times.
Freshman,5,"I just completed my Freshman year at Ithaca College. It was a positive experience for me. The professors are top notch, the campus is beautiful, and the students are very friendly. My only complaints are the quality of the dorms (not renovated in long time), and the food. The food is quite poor, and I would like to see changes in the menu choices and quality."
Senior,5,Ithaca College has provided me with an incredible experience. All of my teachers are incredibly supportive and willing to worth with students. The community created among the campus is vibrant and encouraging. I have througholy enjoyed my Ithaca College experience and am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have attended such an incredible institution.
Freshman,5,"I have wanted to live in Ithaca since I was 14 years old. For some reason, I never thought of going to IC. Once I took my very first tour of the school, I fell in love. The campus is gorgeous, the people and students are so friendly and the professors here are really helpful. My academic experience has been really good and even though I am only a freshman I am already considering IC for graduate school."
Alum,5,My time at Ithaca College was the best 4 years of my life! I have met so many life-long friends and have made connections with professors that will help me in the future when applying for jobs and internships. The faculty really care about the students and help us in any way that they can. I have felt supported since I first walked on campus and I still feel supported as an alum. I absolutely love Ithaca and everything it has taught me! I have become a better person since graduating from Ithaca College.
Niche User,5,"I have been to Ithaca a couple times but from the first look I knew it was for me. As soon as we entered Ithaca I saw myself going to school there are walking around town. I love the people there, everyone is helpful and nice!!"
Niche User,5,"I love the campus, my sister goes here. Very beautiful town and great campus. People are so friendly here."
Freshman,5,"I like how welcoming Ithaca is and how helpful the professors are.  If you have a question, it is easy to approach someone to get it answered.  The students are very inclusive and there are so many on campus activities to get involved in."
Senior,5,"I am so happy that I chose Ithaca College. I was originally hesitant because I knew it was the school for me but they didn't offer me as much money as other institutions did. However, I have had opportunities to play music and exercise recreationally, while getting a top-notch education. I am studying physical therapy and have been getting to work with patients from the community in our on-campus clinic, thus gaining hand-on experience while learning incredible amounts about the practice of PT. Aside from academics, I have noticed that the student population is very friendly, caring, and in touch with nature. I get a lot of comfort from the people I am surrounded by, knowing that they are all hoping to help others. I am so lucky to be at IC, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a close community of down-to-Earth students."
Junior,5,"The college overall is a great place to be. It is a safe campus, the environment is not competitive to the point of being toxic but people are motivated here. The faculty is wonderful, except the Computer Science and the Math department. I'm not saying that because I'm a non-STEM person. I am a STEM major and the computer science department sucks horribly, especially their department chair. The math department is constantly changing up their curriculum. The only solid STEM departments here are the Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Bio-Chem departments."
Alum,5,Some of the best 4 years of my life here! Great programs and campus in the most beautiful town. Great campus community with a variety of organization and housing options.
Freshman,5,"I love Ithaca college. I am an art major here and my teachers are so passionate. The parties are pretty fun when you find the good ones. The bars are pretty fun too. I value the saying ""work hard play hard"" and that definitely applies here."
Freshman,5,"Man, this school. It has gone above and beyond my expectations.  As a freshman student, I have witnessed friends from my hometown at their colleges dreading their work, their professors, etc. Not once have I had doubts about Ithaca; the professors are intelligent, helpful and kind and the programs are well-made. The amount of established alumni is incredible. The food is great, Terraces is the best dining hall and SubConnection has good food. Upperclassmen are awesome and enthusiastic. The campus and buildings are beautiful, and the location is ideal. Parties go on every weekend, on and off-campus, and are easily accessible by the TCAT."
Alum,4,"The best thing about Ithaca College would be going to school in Ithaca. The surrounding area is amazing: the town, restaurants, and experiencing the outdoors! Receiving my undergrad degree here, I would say the ROI is average and about the same as any other place you would go."
Sophomore,4,"I loved my time at Ithaca. The surrounding community is what really made my time there special. It is a great place for students trying to find their voice. IC places value on innovation and individuality, which is a rarity to find in many higher education settings."
Sophomore,4,"I really love it at Ithaca College! It’s a very open accepting environment, with wonderful professors. They are good about addressing issues brought up by students and are working to be more diverse and helpful towards POC. The arts programs are excellent, and the academics and sports are well managed and work for a level of high achievement. I highly recommend IC!"
Sophomore,4,The online experience was pretty good. The teachers adapted well and accommodated for students’ mental health by adjusting due dates or rules for assignments.
Senior,4,"I've loved my time thus far at Ithaca College. The local area is incredible, the professors in my department (Sociology) are incredibly resourceful and truly care about their students. I've had quite a smooth experience as a transgender student as well- housing was relatively easy to navigate with the Transgender Housing Form, as well as finding gender neutral bathrooms near me."
Junior,4,"Ithaca College is a great institution many would be lucky to attend. There are several resources for students such as dedicated Career Services staff, Counseling services, lots of sports at varsity, club and intramural levels, along with superior theater arts and music programs. Furthermore, there are a multitude of clubs representing a variety of student interests–every student may participate in an extracurricular they enjoy. Classes are rigorous and professors are motivated to challenge their students, while aiding them to succeed. Professors are very accessible beyond class hours–I have never had a class taught by a TA. However, Ithaca could improve their facilities. Even with their improvements, the school provided food is terrible. Some buildings need updating such as freshman dorms and certain academic buildings. Lastly, they need to improve on diversity. The school is a white majority, but resources are provided for students of color. This demographic is slowly changing."
Senior,4,Online came as a result of covid19. I didn't choose online as I enjoyed in person schooling much better. It was difficult because online learning wasn't planned by the teachers as well as the students. Some teachers were not as accessible as others but due to the situation it was understandable.
Senior,4,Ithaca is a beautiful campus with a great town that is easily accessible to students. The faculty and staff were very helpful and always willing to help.
Graduate Student,4,"I had a great undergraduate experience at Ithaca College. As a student of the Physical Therapy program, I learned to refine my study habits as well as how to prioritize my time between academics, athletics, work, and social life. Ithaca College has made changes since I began there and has been receptive to student feedback. It is also very easy to get involved with extra-curricular activities"
Senior,4,"The professors handled the situation in very different ways, but personally I was lucky enough to have teachers who were understanding and receptive the needs of the students. Some of the classes were actually even able to be enhanced through online learning as the professors worked creatively to develop new strategies of approaching the material."
Sophomore,4,"Adjusting from in-person learning to online learning is difficult for any college student. Overall, Ithaca College handled the transition to zoom pretty well and kept all students up to date with their decisions for the campus in relation to the pandemic. They still held career services, virtual events, and always informed their students on anything new that was happening."
Freshman,4,Online did make discussion based class easier but it made lab based classes extremely harder. Thankfully we won’t be doing it anymore.
Freshman,4,The professors were pretty understanding that we were all in different situations and most opted to recording lectures for us to view after class as to not penalize people for not being able to join a live virtual meeting.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the campus community, the local area as well as my classes.  I felt as if the professors and staff all around truly cared for me to make the most out of my experience at Ithaca.  I enjoyed the people I met on campus, the only thing that wasn’t so great was the food, but it was manageable."
Alum,4,Ithaca College has a beautiful campus.  The professors at Ithaca College are knowledgeable and it is easy to make life-long friends on this tight-knit campus.
Alum,4,"Ithaca is an amazing school for those looking for a small, liberal arts experience. If you love athletics, nature, and the outdoors, you'll love Ithaca! Lots of intramural and club sports to choose from. Fantastic hiking scene too!"
Freshman,4,"I really like the size of the campus and everyone is generally pretty nice. I'm not a fan of the dining halls, as I feel they are too small and understaffed (even with student workers) to keep up with the needs of the student body, which isn't even that big. Otherwise, I'm really happy with all of my professors and have made some of the best friends I've ever had."
Alum,4,The location is beautiful and there is so much to do in the area. There are many activities and clubs on campus and it is very easy to navigate. It felt like I was a part of a community. The campus food isn't that great though for what we have to pay for it.
Freshman,4,"Ithaca College is a great place to go if you're interested in the arts. There are many internal issues regarding residential life snd hierarchies existing in departments, but if you make the most of resources you can receive a stellar education."
Senior,4,Really great school though admittedly a PWI. Great campus life and they really try their best to help all their students.
Freshman,4,"Ithaca College administration is  committed to hearing and understanding all members of its student body, taking into account the experiences of marginalized communities. The institution is making strides toward diversifying its curriculum and faculty in order to better meet the needs of racial minorities. There are portions of the campus that could be upgraded/modernized (ie: the need for elevators in some first-year dorm halls)."
Sophomore,4,"IC has really nice professors and faculty and the city of Ithaca is amazing. There’s tons to do if you really look and campus is usually busy as well. Food is ok though, typical campus food."
Sophomore,4,"Housing sucks and the food isn't great. They're borderline predatory with their housing policies and try to squeeze as many people onto campus as possible to squeeze more money out of them, even if there aren't enough places for everyone to live."
Sophomore,4,I love Ithaca College. I'm currently a sophomore in the Park School of Communications as a Cinema & Photography major and the program is fantastic. The professors are excellent and the club and other programs are great opportunities for students to learn about their desired field.
Sophomore,4,"Ithaca College is a great school, particularly in certain areas around the arts; Theatre, Film, and Music. This is one of the top schools in the nation for Theatre Production and Design."
Freshman,4,"Perfect size school for me, not too big but not too small. The city of Ithaca is a little bigger than my hometown, so the transition wasn't overwhelming. Expensive, but the experiences, opportunities, and education is worth it to me."
Junior,4,"I like the college atmosphere of the town. I would change the way they allocate their money to better help support their students (who pay so, so much money)."
Alum,4,"The college was overall good academically with many clubs and opportunities for involvement outside of the classroom.  However, programs such as the ICC were very limiting as you could only take classes within a theme, even if what your really wanted to take was outside of the theme you chose before your freshman year started and, really, whose interests stay exactly them same from freshman to senior year? The end capstone requirements for the Liberal Arts portion of the degree seemed like a complete waste of time to stroke the school's ego more than something usable for future professional use."
Senior,4,Lots of opportunities for engagement. Great student organizations but also a lot of professional development organizations as well.
Niche User,4,"I love their music department in every way, although, when going for a focus in strings I do wish it were not still a requirement to learn all wind instruments and percussion when trying to focus in strings. On the other hand their 24/7 practice rooms, amazing professors, and massive music libraries make it worth it."
Sophomore,4,"The college is very inclusive and offers many programs. The professors work very hard to create a personable experience. Some programs are very exclusive however, and this can create ostracism where in cases some individuals are practically kept out of contact with individuals of other schools or majors. The college offers many activities that create very open experiences and intermingling, such as bingo and trivia nights, or cookouts in the quads."
Junior,4,"This is a very good school for lgbtq students. this campus is not physically accessible, however. the food has recently drastically improved. the current presidet does have a shady past that the school has swept under the rug. this school is incredibly pricey. there are a lot of very good opportunities though."
Freshman,4,Ithaca College is great place to connect with professors and students.  It's very friendly environment.
Sophomore,4,"Freshman year at Ithaca College was somewhat of a slow start for me but once I found friends and started playing the sport I love, the rest came naturally."
Sophomore,4,Ithaca College is great and so beautiful. However I would like to see a drop in the cost of attendance. Some of the dorms would benefit from some remodeling.
Sophomore,4,"Ithaca College is a nice suburban school in northern New York state. As it is a smaller school it offers ample opportunities to establish personal relationships with professors and many research opportunities, at least in the School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S). The food has been below standard but they are currently in the process of revamping it."
Sophomore,4,"I love Ithaca! As a member of the School of Music, I love the appreciation finally given towards the arts in a school community. The staff is wonderful and all clearly very strong in their fields. The administration is the weakest link of the college overall."
Freshman,4,I love it here! I wish there were more openings for classes because sometimes registration is a hassle. The food isn't great but I am having a blast!
Sophomore,4,"Ithaca is smaller than you would expect. Class sizes can be pretty small. The campus community overall is pretty welcoming and everybody is able to find their place and people they enjoy being around. There are so many different majors and minors available, so there really is something for everybody."
Junior,4,"I loved how I was able to change my major a million times and still be set to graduate on time.
Our London program is AMAZING!
I love that I can double major in music and psych
I love our small campus.
The food sucks, like sodexo is so bad even the chefs don't like it
We have a ton of resources.
The psych department is small but plentiful and is getting me ready for my research career.
It can be quite cliquey between schools and majors.
Lack of school funded transportation for students - we have to use Ithaca's buses.
The TCAT is unreliable.
Its hard to get anywhere off campus without a car.
You feel trapped during the winter."
Freshman,4,"I love how I am able to start learning about my field of study from day one and there are a lot of connections that can help students get internships, even as freshman! The food is okay, but definitely could be worse. There are a lot of clubs and activities that speak to a variety of people, and overall I feel at home here at IC!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience has been pleasant. I definitely think improvements could be made on the part of the school, but I think my views can change as well once I become more involved with student activities."
Freshman,4,"As an international student,  I thought I would feel isolated from the rest of the campus but from the very first day of international orientation, it has felt like a place where I could be myself and where I can get the support I need."
Freshman,4,"Ithaca has a great community and great people. Most of the classes are small and all the professors I've had have been super helpful in all aspects. The only thing is the food is not the best, but it's manageable."
Freshman,4,"could have better resources for students in terms of academic and student outreach, health services/mental health services, but overall a great school where students want to learn and professors care for their students' educations"
Freshman,4,"Ithaca has a friendly atmosphere and is good for people who enjoy the outdoors. Ithaca makes sure that it's students are well rounded, preparing them to be the best in their fields of interest."
Sophomore,4,"My Ithaca College experience has been good overall. The professors in the Park school are very good, and I have learned many skills to help myself in the professional world. The dorms are not the nicest compared to other schools, but they aren’t awful. The food is pretty terrible in the dining halls but there’s other good options, especially in the Ithaca area."
Freshman,4,"I love Ithaca College and wouldn't agree with most of the rankings on here. I think the campus and local area is amazing. The students here are very diverse and not afraid to be themselves. Everyone is so accepting to one another. Most of the dorms are actually nicer than you'd expect (excluding the quads freshmen housing). The only two complaints I can make is the food and the school spirit. The food isn't terrible and my friends who have visited me said our dining halls and food is much better than at their schools. They just don't have many options and its usually the same meals weekly. Also, the kids here just don't have much school spirit so if you're into huge tailgates and football games this school probably isn't the right match."
Niche User,4,"The gorgeous atmosphere helps prospective students really feel like what college life would be like As colleges all over the world are getting more andmore expensive each and every year it is hard for families to be comfortable sending their kid away to one. At Ithaca College I believe the exceptional facility right next to Cornell helps return the investment. Paying that much money for one year of school definetely puts a strain on some families because they might not have the money to pay for what their kid really wants. Ithaca seems to provide help every way possible; scholarships, grants, loans, FASFA and the CSS profile. As a student looking to come to Ithaca I hope they provide me with the best options so I can afford to come, study and live at this wonderful institution for the next 4 years."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty displays genuine interest in every student's success through their engagement in and out of class. Advisors and professors have bent over backwards to accommodate my personal conflicts and struggles, demonstrating their value of success and education over grades and statistics. Ithaca college also boasts a wonderful Exploratory Program for students interested in being proactive about degree exploration. I would not have found my major without the dedication of the program head and the intelligent structure of the program as a whole."
Sophomore,4,"I like how people are very friendly. There is so much opportunity for students to expand socially by joining clubs and such. Students can find many jobs to work at as well with the help of the school, there are so many nice people that are willing to help any student. I do wish to see more people of color at the school in order to make the college more diverse. As well have many cultures from around the world to enlighten the college's spirit."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I'm having a blast at Ithaca College! My overall classes have been interesting and engaging, with good professors. The campus is gorgeous, as well as the surrounding town is cute and has so much to do. The living spaces are good, with many different options. One of the biggest improvements needed is the campus food; there needs to be better quality and more available spaces to get healthy foods. Otherwise, I'm having a great time!"
Alum,4,"I had a really great time at Ithaca College. The campus is small and unique, the surrounding area is lovely, and my program (Speech-Language Pathology) was great. Tuition is really expensive because it is a private college. If you can get the financial aid and it will make you happy, it's probably worth it."
Junior,4,"Ithaca College is a great place for me as a transgender student. The professional staff at the Health Center, the director at the LGBT+ Resource Center, and the college president have all shown great support and efforts to meet the needs of students like me."
Alum,4,"Ithaca College has a lot to offer.  The academics are awesome, the professors are great, and the surrounding area is beautiful and safe.  The small class sizes allowed me to succeed in school and become very close with the professors and other students.  A lot of the classes included lectures and hands-on activities, which is helpful to students who learn differently.  The amount of clubs and activities at Ithaca College were endless; There is a club for each person.  The surrounding area includes great hiking paths, great eateries, and numerous shopping centers.  I highly recommend Ithaca College to all students."
Junior,4,"It's a good school. I really enjoy my classes and professors. I have been able to establish relationships with some of the faculty, which is really helpful in moving forward and succeeding in my field. They have many systems in place that support students and faculty alike. They have campus safety which really work hard at their jobs. However, it is a POW (Primarily White Institution), and while there is some diversity it is lacking. But hopefully in years to come that will change. The food is okay, but not the greatest. Some days are better than others in the dining halls. The underclassmen dorms aren't great but  it gets better once you become a junior and are able go  live in upperclassmen housing. Ithaca a lot to offer ranging from great academics to great extracurriculars. Ithaca college is not for everyone and not everyone is for Ithaca college, but it was right for me."
Senior,4,Ithaca college was a really good stepping stone for me to go out and pursue my dream to study and play music classically.
Niche User,4,"My daughter has really enjoyed Ithaca College. Her teachers have really taken the time to get to know her and she is excelling in her studies. The campus is in a beautiful city and as many great restaurants and boutique bed and breakfasts that make your visit even more enjoyable. She has been fortunate to make real and sincere friendships playing for the Varsity Women's Soccer Team for the past two years. Unfortunately the coaching staff is sub-par. She has received more guidance and encouragement, skilled training, support and encouragement summers away than while on campus with the team. I have observed that if you are not a favored player, you are irrelevant and mistreated. Quite unfortunate for what could be a program that enhances  young college students strengths does the opposite."
Niche User,4,I have only visited Ithaca but I plan on attending in the fall. The campus and everyone there were amazing and I fell in love with Ithaca the second I stepped onto the campus.
Senior,4,"Like any other college or university, your experience is what you make of it. Although I wish some things would've been different, I got an overall great education and experience at my school. I feel prepared to go into my industry and happy to have befriended so many students and professors."
Sophomore,2,"Ithaca College is located in upstate New York, which means the winters are very cold and last for a long time. Ithaca College promotes diversity on its campus, but in reality, the student body is made up of 80% white students. The school itself has good programs for music, communications, and theatre, but other than that, it's just okay. Everyone is really friendly, but night life isn't really existent at Ithaca College, unless you have a fake. The town of Ithaca is fairly small and is mainly made up of Ithaca College and Cornell University, so there's not much to do there. Once you drive five minutes outside of Ithaca, you're basically in the middle of nowhere. The campus isn't the most appealing, but most of the professors are good. If someone were looking for a small campus feel, this would be the place."
Sophomore,2,"Overall, this school is a VERY poorly ran institution. The business courses are far too simplistic ...and a waste of time and money. Also, unless you can deal with cloudy weather everyday, I'd steer clear of this school."
Freshman,2,There is little to do here. It is relatively hard to get off campus unless you have. a car because the TCAT is unreliable and it takes a lot of energy to walk into town. It is also very cliquey here and Whalen and Park students are prioritized. Also food in the dining halls is relatively bad and all dining halls close at 9. There are few options when it comes to eating healthy here.
Alum,2,"I think I had two professors who seemed passionate about their field - the rest gave the impression that they were just doing a ""job."" Student makeup was about 75% NY/NJ/MA, and the balance from the eastern US. In terms of ethnicity, it's very homogenous. Sadly, I haven't recommended this school to anyone."
Junior,2,"Ithaca College physically gives me anxiety when I think about going back there.  What I found was if you didn't make friends within the first week, it was almost like you lost your chance.  So extraordinarily cliquey.  And the hook-up culture is absolutely horrifying.  Once I was in a relationship, I was afraid of going out to parties because of the inevitable, uninvited sexual assault that many of the male students felt entitled to.   Because of these factors, I will not be returning to Ithaca College and am transferring to a more inclusive environment."
Junior,2,"I like the local area and music scene in Ithaca. It is really beautiful, but the social scene is something I've really struggled with. It is very clicky and certain majors almost seem like ""cults,"" and are not inclusive at all. I would also like to see more diversity. While they say Ithaca is 30 square miles of paradise, surrounded by reality, the hippie liberals don't take the consideration of PoC in this town. Overall, the school is predominantly white rich kids who do not consider the experiences of poor, PoC, or queer folk."
Freshman,2,"I came to IC and was pretty excited about the school. But I quickly realized how wrong I was. The campus buildings are ugly, being in the library is incredibly depressing, and the students are unmotivated and uneducated. If you are a driven student, looking for a good education this is not the place for you. It is in a remote location, VERY cold, and too expensive for what you pay for. I knew I wanted to transfer in October of my freshman year. This school is not worth it."
Sophomore,2,"I was enrolled at Ithaca as a Politics major.  The professors and campus environment is ultra-liberal.  If you do not represent the ultra-liberal ideology then expect to have points taken off your papers, be shunned from class discussions, and be singled out because of your views.  
Additionally, the IC to Cornell program they offer is poorly understood by factuality and administrators.  This program is also really available in name only.  After MONTHS of attempting to track down people who could answer my questions, when I attempted to apply for this program I was told that the program doesn't work and that it is hard to arrange a schedule within the IC to Cornell Program."
Freshman,2,"As a student of color here I feel that this school is not diverse in any sense. However it is very LGTBQA  accepting which is always an amazing thing. The biggest flaw i feel is the crazy expensive tuition !!! You pay nearly 60k  a year which is like a mortgage! The services here are very helpful a times, and very rude at times. Kind of a hit or miss. Im actually transferring sophomore year back home to a community college for a year to complete my prerequisites, then to my state school of Rutgers to work towards my Physical therapy degree."
Junior,2,"There are really great professors that are willing to learn from the students and will change the lives of students for the better. However, many of the faculty, staff, and students are intolerant and disrespectful of varying identities (race/ethnicity, LGBTQ+, varied abilties, socioeconomic status...) The school is looking to improve, thanks to student activism and the voices of faculty and staff."
College Sophomore,2,"We are a d3 school. Our football team is small and not very good, and most of our other teams aren't great either. We have a fantastic Crew Team and great club teams. Our(club) rugby team in particular is nationally recognized. But aside from cortaca, no one cares about sports."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I hated living on campus, I moved off campus as soon as I could."
College Freshman,2,we have a few but they are not associated with the school which could make them difficult to get in to
College Sophomore,2,"They want to talk about diversity as if it is a class.  At the end of the day I am of the few minority physics majors in the entire department of physics.  Police officers WILL harass you because of your skin color.  Some students will harrass you about getting in only because you are African-American or that you have financial aid because of that.  Saying ""My parents are paying for this school, it isn't fair that you go here for free"".  Well I don't even have parents to pay for the school.  And I did work hard I got a perfect ACT and a 3.0.  I did work hard despite being homeless.  In the terms of sexual diversity.  We are very accepting."
College Sophomore,2,There is a racist sentiment going around.  Because of the protests.  I have personally had problems with police and other students because I am a student of color.  Just watch your back.
College Sophomore,2,"Weed and alcohol everywhere. If you're not comfortable with it, you probably shouldn't come here."
College Sophomore,2,"Meh. Ithaca College isn't terribly known, I don't think, and the experience itself wasn't great."
College Sophomore,2,Parties don't really take place on campus that often unless you live in Circles or Gardens.
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics aren't really a big deal at Ithaca. Cortaca is the one big football game in the year, other than that, there is no real fan support."
College Sophomore,2,My high school games were way more exciting than an Ithaca College game. Cortica is the only game people go to. I've gone  to a few foot ball games besides Cortica and honestly my little brothers peewee football games are more exciting. There aren't many other students who go to the games. Only friends of players on the team.
College Freshman,2,It's not a huge part of the Ithaca experience
College Sophomore,2,"The weather absolutely sucks for three quarters of the year, there are barely any campus events that involve everyone/are worth attending, and unless you're at the Park or Human Sciences schools you're definitely overpaying for a very average education."
College Sophomore,2,I NEED MORE AID. ITHACA IS EXPENSIVE AND I CAN'T AFFORD IT.
College Student,2,I feel like there should be more available
College Sophomore,2,"Our tuition is rising, but the number and value of scholarships is not.  This causes a disconnect and it's harder and harder to pay tuition."
College Freshman,2,"Yeah, it's pretty bad. The only thing Towers has going for it is Late Night, which is usually always a disappointment unless you like routine, but they have good pasta sometimes. Our bonus bucks are usually killed because everything on Campus is way overpriced, but the students feel literally anything is better than the mush we get served in the dining halls."
College Junior,2,"This school is outrageously expensive to attend, and the tuition increases every year. They give barely any financial aid to the students. Some aren't able to attend for more than a few semesters."
College Junior,2,"The meal plan is extremely expensive for horrible quality. Pizza is the only thing that is always available. The choices are unhealthy, and the only fruit offered is cantaloupe and honeydew melon with the occasional grape. We obviously pay less for our Sodexo services than other schools. The lines are long in the dining halls. Having your own kitchen is much more cost effective, but you are forced to have a meal plan if you live in the dorms. The bonus bucks places such as Sandella's are good."
College Sophomore,2,"The rooms are small, but well heated. Classes are a relatively decent distance where its a pleasant walk, not too far but enough to wake up before class. It's nice to live in Terraces with a dining hall being super close to the dorms, however it's hours are a little weird. I'm rather dissatisfied with the amount of pot smoking that occurs around campus, especially in the dorms, where I wish it was more strictly enforced. I don't mind on campus drinking but the pot causes the entire hallway to smell of it."
College Junior,2,"If you are not a minority and are somewhere near middle class, you get no aid"
College Sophomore,2,"Terraces dining hall is the only good dining hall. I work as a student manager there, and although the food is still not the best (considering Sodexo is gross), it is bearable, and some of the things the guys cook over there are actually pretty tasty. Campus Center gives me IBS, and towers just makes me wanna barf. The meal plans are WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! I have been off them since second semester freshman year. As soon as I was able to move into an on campus apartment, I dropped it. There's no sense in paying several thousand dollars for crappy food. I suppose there's a good amount of variety at terraces, but Campus Center and Towers seem to basically just have 95% carbs. Bonus bucks were pretty cool to have, but I don't mind spending the money at SubConnect or Sandella's once in awhile if I feel like eating there."
College Freshman,2,"You are not giving many options in the dining halls since all the food is produced the same. Almost all meats are over processed and really unhealthy. There aren't many options for vegetarians, vegans, people with religious restrictions."
College Freshman,2,eh. Preparing us for our own cooking i guess
College Freshman,2,"The campus police will generally bust parties in dorms or on campus apartments, but I've never seen anyone get in really serious trouble for it."
College Freshman,2,Circles try their best but parties get busted pretty fast and arn't worth it. Sports houses are overcrowded and not worth the effort. To find any good party you have to go to Cornell and risk being denied because your from Ithaca.
College Freshman,2,"Be warned - everything winds down about one so it's important to come out early. The best places for parties are at off campus housings or at Cornell frats, even though you have to pay to get in. Guys can be really aggressive at Cornell so stay with a close group of friends. Also, the TCAT only runs to 1 AM so get out early or have cab money."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have Greek Life at Ithaca College, but if you want to go to a Greek party go to Cornell! I hear it's a ton of fun, whether you're a boy or a girl!"
College Student,2,"the entire campus is on a friggin mountain, anywhere you pick you're going to end up with the famous ""ithacalves"" and highly exhausted and tired and sweaty by the time you climb back up to the dorm after class. the Towers go up to a 13th floor and the elevator breaks every 2 weeks. if you're a freshman in the quads, you need to be in the right hall because it's either a hit or miss with the people you're with. I hang out in my friend's dorm more than my own because hers is fun and lighthearted and everyone knows everyone, whereas mine is quiet and distant and no one talks to anyone else. The housing process is a lottery so if you get a number really high, you're basically screwed. But the party scene is usually circles, terraces, or upper quads. Everywhere other than lower quads, as a communications major, is inconvenient."
College Student,2,"Generally, there are like no actual good parties here, and if there is one, it's small. Everyone goes to Cornell for any real fun. Parties are a great way to let loose and it's a shame that Ithaca can't have them because the campus is so small that any noise is caught immediately and the party is busted. A lot of parties, ithaca and cornell both, are invite-only so you need to know the right people, or have easy access to alcohol or drugs to be useful enough to be invited and befriended"
College Student,2,"It's technically not allowed but there are ""underground"" sororities and fraternities but they're really lame and have a bad reputation for having ugly weird people"
College Sophomore,2,all the food is the same. no flavor
College Sophomore,2,"There is little to no diversity on campus.  With the diversity that Ithaca College does have, there is always acceptance"
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are definitely not a large part of campus life.  The only sporting events attending are the larger ones, like that of homecoming and the Cortaca Jug."
College Junior,2,Not enough good meats to choose from.
College Junior,2,t's only bad if it ever happened to you.
College Sophomore,2,We do somewhat well in some sports but they aren't very important. Cortaca is our biggest sporting event and the only one people seem to go to. We have a lot of intramural sports that are pretty popular and we have a Quidditch team that is pretty popular. Our theater performances have a higher attendance than our sporting events if that explains anything.
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion it is very hard for me to get into my program. I am in the process of switching majors but I cannot register for various classes required by that major because I am not technically in it yet. I also needed to get at least a B+ in a course to be accepted into the major, which is fine, however, the professor that taught the course this past semester had not taught it in some time and graded unfairly at times. The last professor (who is still teaching on campus) was much better I have heard."
College Sophomore,2,campus pd sucks...it easy to avoid them if you have a good RA but when they make rounds youre f***ed
College Sophomore,2,"The winters are harsh. Bring a couple of warm coats and long-johns. Because of out proximity to Lake Cayuga, the moisture for the lake and the cold mountainous air make it snow all the time. It okay because most of the academic buildings are conceited but you'll have to get there from your dorm which is not bad if you live in the quads but if you live in the terraces, you're in for a world of cold"
College Sophomore,2,The school spend too much money on our D3 sports teams and not enough on other clubs and activities.
College Freshman,2,Ithaca is very grey and snow-y a lot of the time and can depress you easily but that's what it's know for as well so you have to be ready for it.
College Freshman,2,"It is awful, I had financial aid but it was an absolute nightmare to work with."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing is alright, although since Ithaca is pretty expensive, the houses need multiple roommates for affordable rent."
College Freshman,2,I did not get much financial aid and this school is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,There is very little ethnic/racial diversity. Most people are liberal. The school is very LBGTQ friendly.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is VERY cold up here, and it snows quite a lot. Unfortunately this means walking on campus during the Winter (which is most of the year) absolutely awful. However, its beautiful and the perfect temperature in the Spring and Fall."
College Freshman,2,"The town is about two miles away meaning there is really no way to leave campus except for the TCAT, which is a bus system that costs a $1.50. The bus is almost always late and you have to take an unbelievable amount of transfers to get anywhere. Which means that if you want to get to the target which is only 12 minutes away, it could take you around 45 minutes to an hour to get there. Otherwise the taxi's are ok, just taking them can get a bit expensive. Ideally the best option is to bring a car to campus but that also can get a little expensive."
College Freshman,2,"New York is notorious for its harsh winters, especially here at Ithaca. However, those willing to wait it out will be welcomed by temperatures in the 80s throughout the spring and summer with the sun shining consistently and a beautiful view of the town."
College Freshman,2,"Although 90% of students are on some sort of financial aid, not all of them are getting enough. Most scholarships are small and a hassle to receive and the financial offices has been known to tell students to just drop out rather than help with scholarships."
College Freshman,2,IC has no official Greek life except for the honors clubs for music and drama students. There are no fraternities or sororities recognized by the schools with houses off-campus.
Senior,1,An overpriced diploma mill with a worthless alumni network. Save your money and go to a real school instead of this wannabe Cornell.
Freshman,1,"Coming here, I thought it was going to be a good fit. Now, this was a big mistake for me. The fact that I spent a lot of money on this school is absurd and I feel scammed. If you're not a part of Park or Whalen then you're kind of in the dusk. Ithaca is not really a challenge and it is small. But, Ithaca would not meet my professional goals as well. The ICC, I think is not worth it.  However, I am very sour towards the administration because they treat you like Walking Wallets. I'm transferring to Binghamton University next semester and I couldn't have been any happier because I saved myself from a financial debt burden."
Freshman,1,"Ithaca College is a ripoff. I have found countless bugs in my food, finding cooked chicken isn't common and the options are awful. Eating soggy fries and overcooked pasta every day or lunch and dinner gets old. The only thing that matters to them is the Park School. Hammond health center is horrendous. They misdiagnose you, lose prescriptions, and sometimes just refuse care. The professors claim they are there for you, but they do not care at all, I emailed some professors multiple times, to which they never replied. Ithaca College safety is another thing. There was one day where there was a shooter on campus, Ithaca didn't send out an email until 3 hours later."
Freshman,1,"Ithaca college is school meant for a specific crowd. My tour of the campus during my senior year of high school advertised nothing that I saw upon arriving my freshman year. While it is great that the school is LGBTQ friendly, the student body isn’t cohesive and often forms cliques easily. The food is trash, the campus is cold, and you’ll probably end up living next to obnoxious pot heads who fail to recognize that other people live next to them. Professors are encouraging and enjoyed what they teach but their students barely pay attention. Their focus was more on getting their fakes and going to Moonies. The school definitely prioritizes the Whalen and Park students. The school thought purchasing thousand dollar cameras was more important than replacing  the broken bones and muscles in the anatomy and physiology lab. Overall,  don’t spend your money on a outrageously priced school that will always always look small and stupid in comparison to its neighbor Cornell."
Senior,1,"Terrible school, you're making a big mistake if Ithaca College is on your list of schools to apply to. As a graduating Senior I can say with 100% certainty that Ithaca College is a horrendously horrific school more concerned about safe spaces and diversity than the actual education provided at their institution. Do not attend, you will waste your time and money on a school that doesn't give the slightest shit about you and never will. I could write multiple 1000 page papers as to why Ithaca College is such a terrible school but my time is better spent recovering the time wasted at this beyond trash college."
Freshman,1,"Very mediocre student body and faculty.  The students(who are all sheep for the most part) will complain about the dining hall food, which is actually pretty good.  The people are rude and boring, the clubs are rather useless, the professors are just alright.  Extreme dissappointment and highly overrated school. No good parties either, the one frat is not associated with the school and is lame. Choose something else."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life associated with Ithaca
College Sophomore,1,"If youre looking for Greek life, Ithaca is not for you. We have no school affiliated frats or sororities, the only ones we have are independent and no one really knows about them unless they are in it."
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life and I'm totally okay with that
College Freshman,1,We have underground frats and sororities that are awful but none school affiliated ones.
College Freshman,1,There are only unaffiliated frats that live of campus and thats it.
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Reslife is the worst. That being said, obviously the apartments are the best places to live on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Every experience I have had with Public Safety has been dismally ineffective. They don't care about the well-being of students, they just don't want to do anything."
College Sophomore,1,No drug safety whatsoever. Don't attend Ithaca if you aren't comfortable around copious amounts of weed/alcohol.
College Sophomore,1,There are unaffiliated frats at Ithaca College and they throw parties sometimes. Besides that there is no Greek life at IC
Recent Alumnus,1,"Overpriced, over rated, cold, and too remote."
College Sophomore,1,"Our administration does not seem to care about the student body.  Whenever students bring up a topic that would aid the campus population, they deny any form of direct communication.  Our mental health facility was just denied funding, for example, and when the student body petitioned the administration, they responded through an article in the school newspaper as opposed to talking directly with the students about the problem.  This has been the case on a variety of issues."
College Freshman,1,Nobody cares about sports here
College Junior,1,It's like if Glee and Big Bang Theory had a baby.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life. I heard that it was banned from Ithaca College.
College Freshman,1,"I went through some SERIOUS issues and couldn't meet my scholarship requirements and Financial Aid would not even hear me out, my scholarship was taken away."
College Freshman,1,The park school is a real toughie to transfer into.
College Freshman,1,"Taxi purposefully overprice.

TCAT is slow"
College Freshman,1,Be prepared to literally freeze your ass off...Like you don't understand until you get there.
College Freshman,1,"If Ithaca announced they were shutting down athletics, people would feign anger for a week, and then move on. Its not even really a part of campus life."
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife at Ithaca is horrid. There are few parties, and they always get busted by the police. "
College Freshman,1,I've lost about 25 pounds because the thought of having campus food is so off-putting.
College Senior,1,no greek life.  thank god
College Freshman,1,Unless you are in Dillingham or the Park School no one cares about you here.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is terrible, the lots are too small and the lot for Freshman is on the other side of the world"
College Junior,1,"The weather in Ithaca is atrocious.  It's beautiful in the summertime, however that weather only carries over for a matter of weeks during the school year.  It is more or less like an East Coast Seattle, and it definitely can affect one's attitude during the year, especially winter.  "
College Sophomore,1,It's so poor. They the rate of international and minority students is very very low. Why? I really don't know.
College Sophomore,1,only 2 decent bars to go to downtown and one terrible one.
College Junior,1,"Ithaca claims that they are a diverse campus and in their pamphlets it looks like it. Once you're there, it's mostly middle class white kids. There is some diversity but not enough to really be as remarkable as the school claims. There is a handful of international students who are all pretty interesting so that's nice but more would be better."
College Sophomore,1,"You won't see the Sun from November to April, Ithaca's winter season. The skies are always depressingly gray, and it's absolutely, miserably freezing, especially when you come back for the Spring semester. In the winter, there's fresh snow on the ground nearly every morning, but classes never get cancelled for the weather, so don't count on it! It rains quite a lot, all year round. All this is the norm, yet the weather manages to be very unpredictable! Be warned. If you enjoy blue skies and feeling your limbs, this is not the school for you.

However, Ithaca is absolutely beautiful in the summer, including May and the beginning of September."
College Sophomore,1,"No one pays any attention to them, and we're not very good. The only game that people really go to is Cortica, the traditional football game between CUNY Cortland and Ithaca College. It's extremely popular, and people start pre-gaming the morning of, it's crazy."
College Senior,1,"Campus Network – Ithaca College has a TERRIBLE campus network.  The internet is very slow and the IT department does not respond quickly to problems.  I was in a computer class when the network crashed, which made it so that nobody could finish their assignments.  It is a hassle to have to work with the school's computers and internet service."
College Freshman,1,"There are very few areas with printers and the wi-fi here SUCKS. they are trying to fix it, but so far it's gotten worse"
College Freshman,1,"I find it extremely gloomy! From November to March the sun hardly ever comes out. March 5 was the first time in the Spring semester that I saw blue skies. This is partly due to the lake effect. During the winter, it snows practically every day or every other day. Rain is quite frequent. The temperatures get bone-cold. However, it is beautiful here in the summer and early fall, especially with our view of Cayuga lake."
College Freshman,1,"Sometimes the students here at Ithaca college can be hard to make friends with. I am currently a freshman here and ever since I started back in september, Everyone is friends with each other, but not with me. There are at times when I get stared at during my lunch periods and there are times when even my own roommate doesn't talk to me. the ONLY times we talk are when we retrurn from vacations or breaks."

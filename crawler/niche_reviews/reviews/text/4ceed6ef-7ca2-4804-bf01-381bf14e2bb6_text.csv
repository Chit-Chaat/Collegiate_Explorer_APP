Sophomore,5,"CCU is a place to garner worldly education and also apply morality to whatever career you purse. Whether at the top or the bottom of the  company you will treat others in a way that reflects respect and value. Some may be pushed away by ""Christian"" in the name but it's just people from different walks of life trying to be better and do better. My attendance here has given me tools to succeed and be grateful in my success."
Sophomore,5,The professors have worked diligently in their field and often elaborate while delivering the curriculum. It's never boring and you will be challenged.

Senior,5,"I took classes on line on & off since 2007 since my active duty military job took precedence.  I love the Biblical aspect of this college, the faith based education, and knowing the safety of being able to put my beliefs out there.  I love the professors who have educated me as well as helped me through difficult classes.  My daughter is soon to be in college and I have made her aware of the online aspect of school but she really needs to be in seat.  I think this school deserves high five and 5 star rating for all that they do."
Senior,5,"I was not on campus. I do know anytime I have called for technical difficulty or even financial issues, they have helped me in every way."
Senior,5,I like the knowledgeable professors that they have as well as the fact that I can freely express my faith and not be judged by it.
Senior,5,"The instructors are knowledgeable, they care about their students. They are very involved with the assignments to make sure that the students understand what they are doing. They are also available to answer question as quickly as possible."
Senior,5,Colorado Christian University has an amazing online school. All of the professors have been very helpful and the classes are very easy to get through.
Senior,5,I love doing classes online. I’m one of those students that do better online than in person. I don’t do good with a large amount of people in the classroom.
Freshman,5,"I love the online experience, class at my time and on the days I can. I absolutely love the way the professors handle the classroom, if we ever need anything from them they are just around the corner so to speak. I never had a hard time with anything really, they walk you through and always make sure you are ok with what is going on before they let you take over. bless each and everyone at colorado Christian university for being an awesome university I love how God and his word are incorporated in each lesson and I have learned so much from them."
Freshman,5,"I am taking online classes and so far I love the school, everything about it is perfect! God surely lead me to the right place"
Sophomore,5,"Professors were always reachable and returned my emails fast. Despite the fact that all my courses were online, I was able to learn through videos and great professors."
Sophomore,5,I love the ease it has allowed me to do everything online. I have also become closer to God and my faith.
Junior,5,"Their online learned with the Faith based component help to foster a great environment for learning. 

They use blackboard, but hold their teachers to a standard when it comes to interacting with students. I haven't had a teacher yet who I didn't feel helped me learn to the best of my ability."

Senior,5,I have had one of the greatest experiences at Colorado Christian University. I have had classes here that has taught me how to be a leader as well as I have learned a different and something new information about ministry and the Bible that I hadn't even thought of before. CCU has some of the best professionals that are really concerned about your education and your future endeavors.
Senior,5,All I have to say about CCU is that they have the best online classes. They have easy access to all your school material.
Freshman,5,"CCU has excellent instructors and provides high quality education. As a Christian university, it is very Christ focused and God fearing. The university's online system is superb."
Freshman,5,Colorado Christian University's online system is efficient and structured well. It is reasonable for adult learners and the instructors are helpful and professional.
Sophomore,5,I love the community! My freshman year I was crazy nervous about going to college and I thought that I was going to have a hard time making friends. But I discovered that I had a set of instant friends through my RA and the stairwell that I lived in. And the professors are friendly and strive to reach out to their students and make sure they are doing okay in life/their classes.
Graduate Student,5,CCU Online Master Program has begun without a hitch. Enrollment was a breeze with guidance all along the way. This is a well organized program and so far I'm loving it!
Graduate Student,5,My online experience has been wonderful. My professor is responsive and provides great feedback. I'm really enjoying my experience.
Niche User,5,They were all very friendly. They also responded to my questions promptly. I would like it to be easier to contact the sports coaches.
Niche User,5,"Colorado Christian University is well-developed and helpful with any aspect of discovering your God-given potential. All of their counselors are great to assist you with any questions or finding the classes that are just right for each person. They offer extensive information about their college, their beliefs, and their basis for Christian education and how that is useful in the world today. CCU honors and welcomes all backgrounds of people with or without religious beliefs in hopes that their journey with CCU can inform them of the walk with Christ, which may persuade them to change their outlook and choose Christ as their savior. I truly enjoyed the INT-211 and INT-212A classes. I was able to explore more of the depths of God's love for all mankind and expand my knowledge of the Bible through interaction. CCU presents a fine education with strong and academically talented professors that go above and beyond themselves to see that each and every student feels welcomed and supported."
Niche User,5,I have taken three classes since the beginning of my journey in November 2019. I have had a great experience with CCU.EDU. I am a 52 year old college student looking to further develop my world view and deepen my Christian world view. I am grateful for the opportunity allowed for me to strengthen my thoughts and learn new subjects.
Senior,5,Everything is available and the first class they have you take explains a lot of the resources available to you. Instructions are clear and easy to use. Blackboard is a great platform.
Sophomore,5,They did a great job taking a semesters worth of information to make it 5 weeks and still learn a lot.
Sophomore,5,The Professors are great because they help you see things in a new way for the better and to make a change.
Junior,5,"Colorado Christian University has made it easy to continue my education. From the start, everyone has been friendly, knowledgeable, and has answered all of my questions."
Junior,5,"Classes have been easy to follow, and the instructors are helpful as I navigate a new way to continue my education. I appreciate the information that they have given us what the college has to offer to enhance our learning."
Freshman,5,"I am apart of the College of Adult and Graduate Studies (CAGS) with CCU. It is the perfect way to get the most out of one's schooling,  while juggling being a parent. CCU is very flexible and the teachers and staff care. I am so happy to have Jesus in my life."
Freshman,5,"Colorado Christian University (CCU) is an excellent school for anyone to attend. Through one's studies a Biblical world view is implemented. I have never learned so much in life, as I have during my short time with CCU. The best part is I can do it all from home. The teachers and staff care for me as if I am one of their own."
Freshman,5,"Colorado Christian University is amazing! I love how engaged the teachers are with their students! I love Debra Gaulrupp she is the admissions advisor and she is fantastic! She went well above her job and even walked me through how to get my computer set-up properly! Also, Caleb Stewart the student advisor! He has helped me a few times from computer trouble to finance issues everything! Everyone at CCU is exceptional and they truly care about each person individually! Also, the fact that my entire college experience is Bible based you don't find that! I am an online student, but I interact with everyone so much I feel as if I'm on campus! I would and will recommend CCU to everyone I meet! Thank you CCU for making me feel like a super star and preparing me for the future!!!!"

Senior,5,"I like the flexibility of the classes, all of my classes are online and I take one class every five weeks. I am currently in the CAGS program (College of Adult and Graduate Studies) and have been the past three years. The professors respond to your email questions usually within 24 hours. I have been able to take all of my classes online and should be able to take the remainder of my classes online ensuring that I receive my diploma without ever having to step foot on the physical campus.
If I have an issue with my computer or their system, which they are currently using blackboard, I can contact their IT department and the issue is usually resolved in 24-48 hours.
I have an advisor that helps me set up my classes every semester, that way I do not ake any unnecessary classes, all my classes go toward my major, are required classes or are electives that are still required and needed to graduate."
Niche User,5,"As a parent we have been thrilled with the environment and academic experience of our freshman.  Finally a Christian school with a Christian world-view.  If you want a conservative, rigorous, and quality education for your child CCU is the place to go."
Freshman,5,"I will be attending the school in the fall, but my experience with the application and enrollment process has been great. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. I am a psych major and received and email from the head of the psych department welcoming the students to the program. I already know my RA and roommates for the coming year. They have helped the process fell less overwhelming and like I will be going into it with friends, rather than jumping in not knowing anyone."
Freshman,5,I am going to be a freshman next year at CCU. My mom went there for nursing school and loved it! Everyone has been super nice and supportive during the application process. I am super excited to see where God leads me next year and for all the memories I am going to make at CCU!
Freshman,5,"I love being a part of a school that holds the same values that I do. CCU is an encouraging school to continue your education at. Though I take all of my courses online, I find that the professors and advisors are extremely helpful for any of my needs. I am able to achieve my goals surrounded by positivity and uplifting staff."
Niche User,5,"My visit to Colorado Christian University was such a great experience.  All the people there are so kind, and the school's academic statistics are extremely impressive.  The campus is gorgeous, and the school offers endless opportunities for all students.  CCU has high expectations which inspire the students to achieve great things.  CCU balances faith with academics and values community greatly."
Niche User,5,"CCU gives lots of information and is ready to help incoming and prospective students. They are willing and ready to work with you. They are easy to reach and have a nice clean, close campus that feels like home.  Everyone is so nice and checks in with you often. They have a great work-study program and scholarship opportunities."
Junior,5,"Colorado Christian University is phenomenal school. The community here is quite amazing and loving. However, what is most notable is its rigor in academics, small class sizes and devoted professors and administration.

Highlighting one of its strong suits, is the professors and administration. Due to CCU's small size of 1400 students on campus, professors are able to get to know their students well and vice versa. Therefore, it is not an odd sight to see a professor having lunch with students in the cafeteria for professional or personal advice.

Secondly, it is the administration. We have a deeply caring administration that works effortlessly to make CCU the best place for students to grow and learn both academically in order to be competent for their career down the road, but also personally through faith and community.

""Christ-centered higher education transforming students to impact the world with grace and truth."""
Freshman,5,everyone is super friendly. wide assortment of glasses to choice from. easy to navigate thru everything
Freshman,5,"I like that it's Christian based, we take some of work from personal experiences and how we can learn from them"
Freshman,5,"They are so helpful, and the adult program really works well for working adults. They work with you to find the right program for you!"
Freshman,5,CCU creates a great Christian environment for students with dedicated and incredibly intelligent professors. The only downside I see (coming from a large-scale public school education) is the lack of racial diversity. Would LOVE to see that in the next couple of years.
Junior,5,"Everyone has been fantastic. Helpful, responsive, engaged. It has been awesome so far. The course set up is perfect for an adult who has a life outside of school. The professors have been clear in thier expectations, helpful in finding resources, and understanding of how difficult it is to get back in the swing of school after being out of school for so long. They have an entire class just on understanding blackboard, how to properly use APA formatting and citations and how to use the tools provided for online students. I would highly recommend Colorado Christian University to any adult seeking to go back to school and further their education.  My student advisor gets back to me promptly and always answers all my questions and has been great about working out my classes and course scheduale. They also go to great lengths to make sure you understand your options for testing out of classes, use prior learning credits, and life experience to get credits towards your degree."
Sophomore,5,Going to Colorado Christian University was one of the best decisions of my life! I've grown as an adult and I've grown closer to Christ while being surrounded by fellow believers. I am challenged to think deeper about my faith and be able to share what I believe. The professors are amazing and they really do care about their students! College is going by so fast and being at a college like CCU makes me want it to last forever.
Junior,5,My overall experience has been excellent. I am a prod student of Colorado Christian University. I attend the Grand Junction Colorado campus so I am not familiar with the main campus or any of its activities. I love how involved the professors are and their willingness to always provide good feedback. I have managed to maintain a GPA of 3.92 and I am confident that it is because of the wonderful support from the staff.
Freshman,5,"Colorado Christian is an amazing college to continue your education and to grow with the Heavenly Father, they will protect and take care of you. They want all their students to be involved and included. They will check up on you and do there very best to accommodate you! They make it easy to apply for scholarships, applications, classes ect. Something I truly love about Colorado Christian is they pray safety, confidence, focus , good grades , good relationships, over all there students and their students pray for the class at the beining of each class, Colorado Christian is United. Dorm life is beyond awesome , they want every single student to be comfortable and ready to have a great academic year so they have all students in apartment like dorms to get the best rest and best community for there students."
Freshman,5,I loved that the professor's and staff members were there to answer any questions I had and were always friendly
Freshman,5,"From the moment I applied to now waiting to start classes has been absolutely amazing.  Definitely recommend this school, especially if you are wanting a faith-based education."
Sophomore,5,"The amount of personal care that has been given to me throughout my time thus far at CCU has been amazing. They care about your experience and in turn, it makes my experience that much better."
Sophomore,4,Colorado Christian University has been wonderful at helping me get started in the process of going back to college. The only thing I could say needed improvement was the ease in finding the cost per credit hour on their website when originally researching the university.
Sophomore,4,"My online classes will begin soon, however the experience and preparation thus far has been phenomenal. I get step by step information to prepare for my online experience."
Senior,4,"Academically, Colorado Christian University offers rigorous courses to prepare students for further education and career paths along.  With small class sizes, students are able to get concentrated help and assistance from professors and faculty."
Freshman,4,I have not started my online classes yet. The enrollment process has been awesome. It has been a quick and easy process thus far. The enrollment counselor has been extremely helpful. I am looking forward to starting and meeting professors.
Freshman,4,"I am a new student at Colorado Christian University. Everything is going well so far. I love the fact that this college not only helps you work towards your goal, they also teach bible lessons."
Sophomore,4,"I had to complete my second semester of freshman year online due to the Covid-19 outbreak. I thought that my professors adapted well and they understood that we were all a little out of our element so they made sure to see if we were doing alright. While I thought that the classes went well, I personally don't prefer doing online classes."
Senior,4,"So far, I love the set up and transparency of Blackboard and the online classroom. I am looking forward to diving in deeper and taking advantage of all the resources they offer."
Alum,4,"I liked attending a Christian university and having weekly chapels. I didn't like that some professors (economics specifically) pushed their views and said they wouldn't teach other views, but most professors were not like that."
Senior,4,"I like the online structure. Five week blocks can be a bit compressed, but it does allow you to finish your degree quicker."
Junior,4,Overall a really great school to attend. The students are wonderful and the staff is very helpful and supportive.
Graduate Student,4,I appreciated the acceptance that the school gave even with differences of opinion.  The online classes enabled me to study while I worked full time and being with three children.
Freshman,4,"I've only been here for a few months, but I love CCU so much already. The teachers are phenomenal and the community is unbelievable. It often doesn't even feel like a college so much as it feels like a home. My only problem is with their facilities. It's a small school with a small campus, so there isn't a lot of parking. Other than that however, CCU is an amazing school."
Freshman,4,I am enrolled in Colorado Christian University through their adult undergraduate studies online. This program makes it extremely helpful for me and those like me who have a full time job. I am unable to take courses in a classroom setting. Colorado Christian University makes it super convenient for those with a busy schedule.
Niche User,4,"It is a very exciting, clear and foundational university. CCU is bold about their core beliefs, and I very much appreciate that. The only change I would make is the application and registration process. I wish it were simple, rather than having to visit several different websites (Self-Service, Bushfire, ect.)."
Niche User,4,The professors are amazing and really down to earth. Every student is very welcoming and inclusive. The housing is exceptional and the school grounds are very clean. The only slight issue someone may have with it is how small of a campus it is.
Sophomore,4,I haven't officially started classes yet but I love the support of the staff already. The process has been very quick and easy.
Sophomore,4,"I love CCU. It has cultivated my relationship with Jesus as well as fellow Jesus-lovers. The professors (specifically for the sciences) are absolutely brilliant and are incredible professors. The size of the college doesn't limit us as students which is really a blessing. I really feel like I am receiving the best college experience. The only thing I would change is the relationship with the athletes. For the most part, athletes are fairly well accommodated, but there are certain things that the school can work on such as schedules and athlete-professor relationships."
Senior,4,"Could use improvement in the organization department, otherwise solid Christian based education! I found plenty of surprises after being accepted into my program. It was difficult to navigate the technological side of things, such as the platform they use for online schooling called BlackBoard. Somewhat unprofessional communication between instructors and adult students. Delayed and incomplete information also proved to be an issue. Overall, acceptable, though I may have chosen a different school if I had known about the issues ahead of time."
Freshman,4,This will be my first year attending. I am very nervous to start. I cannot wait. I am very anxious but they do work with full time employees and have flexible schedules.
Freshman,4,The courses are laid out for and the professors are always there to help you. They are constantly in communication with the class. The class is designed so the average person learning will have no problems.
Niche User,4,"I'm an older student, doing the online program for an  associate degree. They have done everything they can to make you feel welcome and apart of the team."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked about CCU is that there is a good diversity of opportunities for students to participate in, a wide array of resources for students such as counseling and employment management services, and quite a few clubs and ministry opportunities for students.

What I do not like about CCU is that it can feel closed off, not very diverse, but there is not very many things that I think significantly detract from my experience here!"
Sophomore,4,"I'm very new to this school, but have heard great things about it from the people who have gone here.  I am looking forward to a very successful relationship with CCU."
Freshman,4,I am loving the online aspect of CCU and how they want to meet each student where they are at and to fulfill they God given talents.
Graduate Student,4,Great instructors! Administrative office is super friendly but not always the most efficient. Need to be a little patient they always come through with the answer for you.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is growing over the next few years and adding new buildings soon. It's undergraduate population is expanding rapidly as well, though it will maintain its small school status for many years. CCU is not racially diverse, but offers many different backgrounds within Christianity. The academics are becoming more rigorous as the school develops and sit strives to be a better university. CCU will work with you to accept AP scores or dual credit, and will help you graduate early if you come in with credits."
Freshman,4,I am just starting. I have spoken with an admissions Counselor. They have been so nice getting me started. I am excited to pursue my online classes with this College.
Freshman,4,I'm just now starting out at Colorado Christian University and I love this school. Your professors challenge you help you stay really focused.
Graduate Student,4,This college has a way of challenging your faith and thinking like I have not experienced.  It is a community of people listening with you and engaging in dialect that will help mold you.
Freshman,4,Colorado Christian University is ranked in the top 2% in the nation for academics and offers an outstanding community and allows students to connect with their professors and other students.
Sophomore,4,It is a very close knit school with a very caring community. I play volleyball here and I really like my teammates and my coaches. The professors here are really encouraging to the students and want them to succeed not only in there class but also in life.
Junior,4,I like that I am allow to either do my classes on campus or online and still be able to work and support my family.
Sophomore,4,"Colorado Christian University is a place I call home. I have felt comfortable, welcomed, and accepted here since the day I previewed. I love the community here and the general aura of love and acceptance. Colorado Christian University has a total of three places on campus to get snacks, meals, and drinks. The housing is great because it is a full apartment with bathrooms that you only have to share with 2-3 other people. My only complaint is the price of tuition, housing, and meal plans. But one has to remember that while the prices do seem a little outrageous, that it was their decision to go here. Colorado Christian University is overall an excellent school with great academics, faculty, dining and housing options, and student life activities."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the Christian education I got but it was too far away from home for me, and also a little bit too small for my liking."
Niche User,4,CCU is an amazing university if you are looking for a small Christ- Centered Community. Highly Recommend
Graduate Student,4,The Student Coordination staff has been very helpful with getting me admitted to the school and helping with financial aid.
Freshman,4,"I had dreamed of going to Colorado Christian University since I was fourteen years old. After competing on campus with my high school debate league and meeting some of the professors and students, I was immediately drawn to the program. After some more research on my own and eventually great feedback from friends who began to attend the school, I was sold! Now, weeks into my freshman year, I am so overjoyed to be here and loving every part of this school! I would recommend this school to anyone who has a strong desire to be in an environment that builds and strengthens their faith, while also providing first rate education!"
Junior,4,CCU is a great Christian school that is constantly growing and developing. The music school staff is phenomenal.
Junior,4,My experience at CCU was primarily positive. I am an online student and access to class material and class discussions is fairly easy. Most professors are active in group discussions and provide constructive feedback on assignments. My one concern is the length of courses. Courses are five weeks which means a lot of material is covered during those five weeks. I would like to see courses extended to 8 weeks which would allow more time to absorb the material.
Freshman,4,"I am returning to school after a 24 year hiatus. The enrollment process was so quick it left many questions and caused quite a bit of anxiety. However, with my first class Int-211, those questions were all answered and I found myself very excited to be back at school."
Freshman,4,"I've been going to CCU for almost a year.  I love that the school is faith based.  I'm currently studying nursing and I learn the nursing basics, but also in with my lessons are, how the Christian faith ties in to whatever it is we're working on that week (ie., nutrition, anatomy, english).  It's very interesting.  That being said, I feel that it's kinda high priced - but the experience may be worth the extra money.  I'm gonna give it some more time before making that decision."
Freshman,4,Colorado Christian University is a great school for academicsale. Their professors are of the top notch quality. On campus you do not feel just like a number. Your professorsite care about you and the student body does also. There is always something to do. If it is events on campus like sporting events or going on an an outdoor adventure by going hiking or skiing. If you are looking for something to do locally there is the Belmar mall and there is ice skating bowling and fine cuisine everywhere.
Graduate Student,4,I loved the feedback from the professor in a timely manner. Taking online course was very easy to navigate.
College Senior,4,I am not really a big sports person
College Junior,4,"I am a online student, but all my professors have been so helpful with responding to questions and providing encouragement."
College Junior,4,"Being a Christian this school is awesome for me, it encourages me through my education and my relationship with God. It is so encouraging to know that you have someone who may have experience something you are going through. It is always  uplifting to know your are growing and learning about a career and how to live that career choice and bring glory to your faith."
College Senior,4,"The professors are really awesome. They are tough on their students but that is only because they know that they are capable of achieving greatness. 

The classes are small and include a lot of great material. Gen-Eds are a little tougher to sit through and sometimes seem more difficult than the classes for your major, but they do prepare you for the future. 

There is a decent variety of classes."
College Senior,4,Little to no crime on campus. There are security gaurds and police that are on campus 24/7. I actually feel very safe on campus even walking alone at 3 am.
College Senior,4,"Freshman year is the only year where there is a ""sorority"" or ""fraternity"". They are not called those though, but rather Stairwells or Floors depending on your housing situation."
College Senior,4,"The professors are incredible. They are tough, but it it only because they believe that you are capable of completing the work to excellence. 

The course work, while easy, is also challenging. The 4 day week helps out very much and allows enough time for homework and studying.

The small campus community is actually decent. You do not feel engulfed by the amount of people around but you also do not feel like there are only 2 other people on campus with you. It is a solid amount and you can find your place easily. 

Campus living is alright. The food is not awful and there are several options to choose from. Housing is okay. I lived on campus for 3 years and felt that I could not bring issues to the residence staff without being blamed. So that was a bummer. The actual dorms were decent. Apartment style is really cool because you can have your own kitchen."
College Senior,4,"I attend online, not sure."
College Senior,4,The athletics in my school ate top notch.
College Senior,4,It has been experience so far.
College Junior,4,The admissions people are very nice and helpful. The teachers respond quickly to questions.
College Senior,4,"Colorado Christian University is a great school, the professors are fair minded to all whether they are a believer or not. but I was a bit disturbed by a previous question here on this survey, the choices given to choose from were meant to make Christians seem like the theatrical stereotypical bible thumping empty headed twits. this gives me pause to associate with NICHE"
College Junior,4,"there are a few great options and a wide variety at that, but I am not as aware of them because I'm not much of a sports person"
College Senior,4,I realize there is a difference between the campus in Grand Junction Colorado that I attend and the main one.
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of options to choose from for courses.  The curriculum is really good.  The workload is reasonable, with lots of online resources.  I have had a lot of other schools contact me, but I always tell them I am very happy with my school."
College Junior,4,"I'm only a sophomore, and my field is one where there are few jobs available without an advanced degree,  so it's difficult for me to say for sure,  but from what I've seen there are great support services,  and the professors are always willing to help students be writing recommendactions and networking."
College Junior,4,"I don't live on campus,  but from what I've seen,  CCU has some for the best dorms out there,  especially in the new Yetter building."
College Freshman,2,"In my opinion, the best parties are the swing-dancing events on campus. Some people may enjoy the school dances more, though."
College Freshman,2,"While it may be a Christian school, there's always a feeling of someone watching over your shoulder."
College Junior,2,I will not go back....Period....
College Junior,2,This is a tough area to live.
College Senior,2,"I attend online; therefore, I am unaware of the athletic department."
College Student,2,"There are mostly White people with the occasional African American, and Hispanic, and very few of other races."
College Freshman,2,I get kicked off the wifi a lot and when I am on its really sporadic sometimes its fast and sometime its slow.
College Junior,2,The internet speed and connection needs a little work. 
College Senior,2,"""Aid"" is a loose term.  There are of almost no assistance.  I had to call every day for nearly a week to get someone to answer the phone...at which point I had the pleasure of hearing that they there was nothing they could do to help me and I needed to wait for more information."
College Senior,2,"While I love my major, I have to say that, academically, I'm disappointed.  The teachers are incredibly subjective.  The workload isn't terrible, but the curriculum is a disaster. I have As and Bs but feel as if I've learned nothing. "
College Junior,2,"It is okay. I have received some financial aid, but the counselors are not very knowledgeable and they and the supervisor treat you as a number not a student. 
"
College Sophomore,2,We really have no nightlife at school unless its basketball season.
College Sophomore,2,I don't feel like Athletics are really invested into. It seem like the athletes have a lot of undiscovered talent and are not playing to their fullest potential and some teams lack true teamwork.
College Freshman,2,"There are a few different races at CCU, but most of the people here are white. But it is a smaller school meaning there will be growth in diversity."
College Freshman,2,There are not many people from other countries. Everyone is basically the same religion because it is a Christian school and there are not many people who add to the ethnic diversity.
College Junior,2,Hit and Miss – The food is a step up from high school and really is a hit and miss. We have variety but not much. I try to avoid it when I can.
College Student,2,"On Campus Required – any underclassman is required to live on campus. following that there are not a lot of housing options near by anyways, and so most upperclassman tend to live on campus as well!"
College Senior,2,"There is always parking for everyone, but sometimes you have to park on the street, or in lots not close to your apartment. With the size of CCU's campus though, it's not a big deal."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus, especially if you live there, can be very difficult at night. If you drive in at 11 p.m. or later you're basically screwed for parking. It's first come first serve. They could definitely expand it. There is no permit cost but if you don't have a permit then you'll most likely get fined $20 for every time you park in the parking lot. I'd say you should have a car, it's Colorado. You're going to want to get out and up in the mountains."
College Freshman,2,It is difficult to find parking on campus due to having very limited space and the school is growing.
Junior,1,"I had a super negative experience with this institution, mainly with the students and people I was surrounded with. There was a lot of negative and judgemental energy from people, and it was hard to make friends because everyone seemed close minded and fake about their lives. The rules were very very strict in order to attend and it seemed like no one wanted to see people living outside of their bubble of what they believed."
Sophomore,1,"Colorado Christian University was an extreme let down.  I had hoped a 'Christian' University would take care of their students, but the only true concern is money.  
The 5-week classes seemed like a great idea, however, they proved to be extremely difficult to complete. Cramming an entire semester of information into such a tight time frame makes it incredibly hard to finish all the reading, class assignments, papers, and discussions - not to mention truly learning or retaining any of the information necessary to better your journey through whatever field you are working toward.  
When I contacted my advisor about my struggles, she said she was 'sorry' to hear about them, and sent me on my way with a good luck and a 'God Bless.'  This school was an utter disappointment."
College Freshman,1,"Basically, there's not really a party scene. People just hang out."
College Freshman,1,I have had a heck of a time trying to get a hold of someone and get things straightened out. The communication between departments here sucks- no one is informed. I was given mismatched answers and it took me well into my first semester to even begin getting things straightened out.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life available on campus. We have stairwells in place of them.
College Junior,1,"Umm I go to CCU. We don't really have a party scene.. I'm totally ok with that! The non-alcoholic, non-drug parties that students throw are tons of fun though!"
College Junior,1,Not worth the money or investment
College Sophomore,1,"I do not know how it is at Lakewood but the Tech Center lab was always locked up when I went to evening classes there.  The only times I used it was when I took a computer class and to sign up for classes with my Student Adviser, because I could not access the WIFI there with my lap top.  I do not know if it is different now or not."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not think there is any.  On the campus everything is close together, but driving there is only convenient option.  The bus stops are not very close, so in bad weather it is a trial.  It would be nice for handicapped persons especially to offer shuttles around the campus and bus stops."
College Sophomore,1,There is really only one parking lot that I have found close to the library.  The lot over by the gym is usually full.  I do not go there very often as classes are online.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's really expensive to live in Denver and the suburbs. If you're a student, chances are you're going to need a roommate or three just to afford somewhere to live."
College Student,1,"Nothing to do in the evening, just quiet hours at 10 or 12"
College Sophomore,1,theres no greek life at school.
College Freshman,1,Everyone's white. There are like 6 black people. But there are a lot of gingers!
College Senior,1,"The faculty grades subjectively.  There's never genuine feedback.  I've literally received ""I don't like this"" on an intro paragraph...but there was no further explanation.   Registering has been a disaster, my adviser forgot to sign me up for classes since I couldn't sign myself up.  There was a financial hold on my account for 3 weeks despite the fact that the school owed ME money.  It kept me from registering.  I have yet to go through a semester with this place that hasn't included some level of disaster.  While I have a great GPA...I deeply regret choosing CCU. "
College Senior,1,"The admin is terrible, over-priced classes and my entire experience was utterly disorganized.  I genuinely feel like the school does not care about its students. "
College Junior,1,"CCU has a computer lab at the adult learning center in Loveland, CO.  The computers are kept in decent condition, however, they are super slow.  It can take up to fifteen minutes to log onto a computer, access the internet, pull up email and print a document I have emailed to myself to print at the school where there is an available printer for students.  I appreciate the service the school provides, but it is not really sufficient in comparison to the cost of classes and such."
College Senior,1,There are none for graduate students and only one for new undergrads
College Student,1,Being an online student there were not really any scholarship options available to me through the school.
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the guys here are to shy, awkward or stuck-up to talk to me."

Senior,5,I think that I love the diversity at Loyola. I think that the student body as well as the faculty are all very friendly and open to new ideas.
Senior,5,Loyola does a great job at offering students with a effective online experience. Professors are very accessible and kind.
Graduate Student,5,"They have transitioned well to the online world and provide all the tools needed to succeed, even if you are remote."
Graduate Student,5,"Great school, with amazing professors and a real vision for how to apply social impact to business acumen to build a new generation of leaders"
Freshman,5,"LUC has great academic opportunities  and school culture. There is a diverse range of people there, as well, so it's really a great place to get to know people you might've not talked to before."
Freshman,5,"Because of COVID-19, the majority of classes for the fall 2020 semester are online. From what I've seen, they took time to prepare and plan these classes."
Alum,5,I didn't take any classes online but they are making me answer this question so this is what I said.
Alum,5,"The classes were wonderful, the staff was great, the people were warm and welcoming, and I found some of my greatest friends there."
Junior,5,Professors did as best as they could in a tough situation. Was only online for about a month so it was not terrible.
Junior,5,"First off, the school is great I love everything about it. But, I'm mostly writing this because I remember reading through some of these reviews as a senior in high school wondering if I made the right choice. This was primarily due to the ""Party Scene"" reviews that Loyola typically receives on various websites. Most places you look (and some students) say that Loyola is a very boring school but I am here to tell you that that's not quite accurate. First things first, this school is in Chicago, one of the biggest party cities in the country. There are countless bars and clubs that you can go to with your friends on the weekends. And on campus (from a guy's point of view), the biggest piece of advice I can give is to join a fraternity. People (and students not in greek life) assume that Loyola does not have parties because there are no fraternity houses near campus and Chicago isn't exactly a place to wander around and find parties. But they're there, you just need to be in the know."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Loyola. Whether it is the small class sizes, the caring professors, or Sister Jean, I really found a connection being among a smaller more tight knit community. I loved being exposed to the many different sides of the city of Chicago as well. I really reconnected with my Catholic identity here as it was a more accepting church environment and we had our own retreat campus. There were millions of ways to get involved. I miss the community that really cared about social justice and the environment."
Junior,5,Adapting to the online scene wasn't as bad as I expected. The professors provided a very detailed syllabus for the rest of the semester and were there at any moment if someone needed help. It's obviously not the same experience as in-class however Loyola was pretty close to perfecting the online learning experience.
Junior,5,"My overall experience at Loyola thus far has been amazing. Life on campus is perfectly balanced where you are able to work at a pace that you want to work at not a pace you are forced to work. Overall, Loyola is a great school that incorporates the loveable city of Chicago along with the campus right outside of the city. You get the best of both worlds."
Sophomore,5,Loyola is a great place to learn and there is always something happening on campus. It is easy to make new friends because of the smaller campus environment. One of the best features is being able to go to chicago anytime and exploring the city.
Sophomore,5,"Loyola University Chicago has amazing people. Everyone cares for one another, whether we know each other or not. At the end of the day, we are all trying to succeed. We are all there for each other because we are in this together."
Niche User,5,"It seems really cleanly and very modern. Along with that, there seems to be very nice facilities for me to practice basketball."
Alum,5,"I love the beautiful campus, and all of my professors I came in to contact with. They were all very helpful, and treated students as equals. The campus felt like a family with a lot of school spirit and countless numbers of clubs. So, it will be very hard for someone to not be able to find something they are interested and passionate about."
Sophomore,5,"Great city private college, feels very safe and very friendly. Has a lot of on campus resources to succeed in the courses."
Freshman,5,"I am going into my first year of college next year, and Loyola is so great because the admissions committee are always sending information to prospective students and the counselors and professors are readily able to answer any questions potential students have, which I greatly appreciate! I am excited to attend next year!"
Alum,5,"My experience at Loyola was a rollercoaster, but one that I am happy I went on. I achieved more knowledge and growth than I ever could have anticipated. My professors served as my mentors and I could not have achieved what I did without their encouragement. My advisor was amazing in helping me graduate on time when I did not think I would. I am truly blessed I had the opportunity to attend."
Junior,5,Loyola University does great when it comes to communicating with me on my application progress and the following steps after being accepted.
Freshman,5,I am going to be an incoming freshmen at Loyola. The community is amazing and very welcoming. They provide a lot of support with the whole college application process.
Junior,5,"I love Loyola Chicago, it's just the right size. Not too big, not too small. Close to the city and right on the lake. I'm a forensic science major and love my classes."
Niche User,5,"When I first stepped onto the campus, I knew I already liked what I saw. It's a very open campus, with beautiful buildings and fews of the city and Lake Michigan. I really enjoyed the sense of community, and how welcoming the people on campus were."
Freshman,5,"Loyola University in Chicago is a very rigourous, helpful and activity filled school. This is my opinion based on the many times I have gone to visit. As an incoming freshman, I know for a fact that Loyola University will bring me many wonderful experiences for my college journey."
Freshman,5,"Loyola not only offers numerous amount of courses and pathways to different careers, they have amazing clubs and activities going on in the campus almost everyday. The diversity of the university is amazing. It shows unity is strength. Loyola has such an amazing and jolly environment and students love studying here. They have amazing advisors that will help you out willingly. They will look out for you!"
Junior,5,"I recently have transferred to Loyola and I must say it has been the best experience thus far. The program really works with my needs and schedule! It makes being a single working mom, trying to finish school easy to do so! The support and assistance received by the teachers and faculty are phenomenal, I really feel that they care about my success! I can’t wait to graduate from this great school!"
Niche User,5,I like the campus and the overall environment of the campus.  Loyola also has people that help with informing about the university while deciding if you want to attend that university . When deciding if i wanted to go there  students have called me told me about what they do. I have also gone to one of there basketball games which was resounding  the experience.
Sophomore,5,Going to college undecided is quite scary since many people have a sense of what their career path looks like. Loyola has a huge variety of majors and minors which really helped me choose the major that I did.
Sophomore,5,Loyola has given me so much more than I could have ever expected. The professors and resources Loyola has for it's students is amazing and it drives my motivation to be higher and succeed more in school. I have met some of my best friends for life all while being in the coolest city ever!
Niche User,5,"The University is very beautiful and is located in a perfect scene. The education you receive is just phenomenal, highly recommended."
Sophomore,5,I love the programs I'm in and being in the city. If I could ask for any improvements it'd be better housing policies and more access for undergrads to get involved with research.
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. The variety of majors and minors they have available is truly amazing for students that come in undecided.
Graduate Student,5,"Loyola's community is wide, diverse, growing, and beautiful. I have felt only warm welcomes and and helping hands as I have pursued my studies and career in education. I love this school. I am so grateful for the tools it has provided me to act through social justice as an educator in Chicago."
Sophomore,5,The professors are very understanding and are always willing to help in office hours. The campus is beautiful.
Senior,5,"Loyola costs an arm and a leg because it's a private institution and it's located in Chicago. That's the only bad thing that I have to say about the institution. They have perfected their systems. Financial aid department is easy to deal with, my academic adviser is involved and available, and the courses are set up for working people."
Freshman,5,Loyola has amazing professors that really take their time to understand a students needs and struggles. I found some of my greatest passions from going here.
Junior,5,Loyola offers a unique family experience paired with an exceptional academic staff!! Their campus works wonders when you need to find inspiration or relieve some stress.
Freshman,5,I love being here. I have learned so much about myself and am so thankful to be a rambler! I am an Anth major and Classical Civilizations major with a concentration in art and archaeology and this is the best school in the area for me!
Niche User,5,My sister loves the school and I am very familiar with it. The campus is beautiful no matter the weather and is located in a neat spot. Students at Loyola get many benefits around Chicago that no other school gets.
Niche User,5,"I love the campus. It has beautiful buildings and a gorgeous view of the lake. Also, the fact that there's a regular campus and a downtown campus adds to the urban college aspect of it. Additionally, the university has the perfect program for me."
Sophomore,5,"Loyola University in Chicago is an amazing experience educationally and culturally. Diversity plays a key role in the culturally dynamic foundation of Loyola. Students from all over the world fly to Chicago in order to attend Loyola. This ensures learning and growing through different cultures, practices and beliefs. Making friends at Loyola is easy because everyone is friendly. This community is very welcoming and with smaller class sizes, the intimacy leads to introductions among peers.  With classes that capture the essence of passion in learning, the professors and students learn from each other. LUC has many clubs and groups anyone can join, along with a great Basketball team. Student life at LUC reflects who we are as a community; tight knit and welcoming. The food on campus tastes great and is very accessible as there restaurants all over campus. The campus is beautifully highlighted by Lake Michigan and makes walking to classes scenic and peaceful."
Freshman,5,"Loyola is very open and is amazing for people to find themselves in the world.  They offer many clubs and activities to participate in that allow others to learn about other cultures and discovering themselves! Academics are rigorous because it is heavy on pre-med students.  If you're willing to put the time in, Loyola is worth while."
Niche User,5,"I went on a visit to Loyola this past month and it was spectacular! The student guide was able to give a great tour of the campus and we were able to speak with people in Admissions that were able to answer all my questions regarding dorm life, classes I would be taking, and possible opportunities outside of college and past graduation. Going during class hours helped me see and witness what the students on campus are like and how they go on with their day, whether it be staying on the main campus, studying or taking a shuttle to the Water Tower campus in downtown Chicago. I hope to see myself there soon!"
Niche User,5,"I have not yet attended this university, but I would very much like to. I have been doing extensive research on this campus and have enjoyed everything that I have found."
Sophomore,5,"I like the locations of the main campus and the downtown campus. The main campus was an ideal size to run between classes and the downtown campus was beautiful. I also really liked the community I found. Loyola puts mental health first and as a psychology major and a person who cares about invisible disabilities, I really appreciated that. One thing that Loyola could improve on is their lack of aid for the physically disabled. I have seen many legally blind students who use guide sticks on campus, but they do not have a path of tactile paving to help guide them through campus. I also wish that Loyola collaborated with businesses, such as Dunkin' Donuts, to have official locations on campus so students would not have to venture out into unsafe areas of Chicago."
Niche User,5,I will start the accelerated nursing program at Loyola. I have been to the campus before and I have loved the campus.
Senior,5,I really enjoyed my time there. I think they really care about helping students succeed. I wish I could have seen more of a renewed interest in their previous commitments to diversity and sustainability.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Loyola. Going in, I was unsure and fairly neutral about my college decision. My choice was made out of logic rather than excitement. But now, after having gone here for a year, I am so thankful I chose Loyola. I’m in the social work program and it’s great. I love my classes, this campus, these people, and all the opportunities Loyola gives me."
Graduate Student,5,I am grateful the University offers an Ed.D. degree in School Psychology that is a two year program. Most doctorate degrees in School Psychology are four or five years in length. This University accepts a large number of credits from your masters degree program!
Junior,5,The campus and people at Loyola are phenomenal. It has great programs and professors for all different types of majors. They are hands on with students and always want them to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I liked the atmosphere the school has created, people are very helpful and kind. The talk about diversity is big and the acceptance of people is colossal."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my current experience as Loyola. The sports atmosphere is great especially around volleyball and basketball season. The location is perfectly surrounded by places to eat and a short distance from the booming city of chicago. Many many memories have been made going out with my friends. The academic life is equally great with a system that allows for great ease of academic success and many down to earth professors that truly love the subject they teach.
Freshman,5,Great school so far. I would like to see more diversity though. It is also extremely expensive yet somewhat worth it. The professors are very strict but provide the proper training for your success.
Graduate Student,5,"Loyola is one of my favorite alma maters.  I earned my first master's there.  Great faculty, great staff, good opportunities for graduate assistantships that pay your tuition.  Tuition is very high though, but the level of care you get as a student is fantastic.  I'll always treasure my time at Loyola University Chicago."
Sophomore,5,"I love Loyola! Loyola has given me so many opportunities to grow and prosper. My classes are challenging but not too hard. I feel comfortable in and out of the classroom. I'm able to balance my homework and activities very well. One thing I wish to see change is the safety of the campus. If there is an alert that students should know about, we should get a text about it and not an email hours later."
Junior,5,"Loyola is a wonderful place to attend college. Although it’s a smaller school, the opportunities it will bring you are in no way small! Endless connections through alumni working in the Chicago area, plentiful internship opportunities, and more! Proud Rambler here!"
Freshman,5,Very diverse institution and does an excellent job of including and celebrating different cultures. Very strong academics with rigorous courses preparing you for your career within your major.
Freshman,5,I love Loyola and the amazing atmosphere that is present and expressed by the community. The campus is beautiful.
Niche User,5,I loved seeing the community of students at the university as well as all of the opportunities available for students to grow and branch out. Their academics are also very well structured and highly prioritized. Education is very valuable to Loyola.
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience has been great. Everyone is brilliant, however administration is often unorganized and stressful."
Alum,4,"Campus environment, brand new facilities and lake side natural amenity is absolutely excellent. Besides we can train good academic disciplines.. While lately there are much more female students than males because of beautiful environment..But the tuition is too high and cafeteria is expensive. Even the experienced faculty people somewhat lacked the knowledge about particular situation to the international students..and i  was sometimes in trouble (they are not interested in it..) Overall atmosphere is classy and good, but - I thought social justice movements, radical activism among students are a little bit weak.."
Junior,4,It was pretty good online. My professors were able to work out any problems the students have had or may encounter (wifi issues).
Junior,4,"I think this school is great. It is in Chicago, so be prepared fo that. The food is not too good here. We have a limited amount of options."
Senior,4,"The atmosphere on campus is great and the scenery is beautiful. I would definitely like to see more diversity in classroom, specifically racially."
Sophomore,4,"Loyola University Chicago is a beautiful campus with great education opportunities. However, it is a private school so it can be pretty expensive. I'm also not fond of how they increased the tuition during a global pandemic. Also there's not a lot of minority representation on campus, the school is predominantly white."
Alum,4,"Although I didn't take any online classes, Loyola was very prepared with organized learning management systems."
Junior,4,Professors have been pretty understanding about changes in timezones or conflicts. Classes have still maintained their difficulty and office hours have been available.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy my experience here! There are lots of research opportunities for students, especially freshmen. I think there are a lot of ways to find help if you are struggling with classes or having difficulties adjusting. There are also some great clubs and events."
Junior,4,"Comprising eleven colleges and schools, Loyola offers over 80 undergraduate and 140 graduate/professional programs and enrolls approximately 17,000 students. Loyola has six campuses across the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as a campus in Rome and guest programs in Beijing and Ho Chi Minh City. The flagship Lake Shore Campus is on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods of Chicago, eight miles north of the Loop."
Sophomore,4,"When classes were transferred online, all of my professors were always willing to help out the students. It was a difficult time for everyone but having supportive professors really made the difference."
Sophomore,4,"Loyola university Chicago has an extremely friendly community, great morals, kind staff and facility. Also, the campus is beautiful! The only downside is that Is pretty expensive, but they help as much as they can to balance out the costs."
Sophomore,4,"Even though classes were online for the last few weeks of the semester, the professors tried to make the best of it. They continued to lecture as if we were there in person. The professors also made time for office hours in case we had any questions."
Junior,4,Loyola Chicago quickly starts to feel like a second home with staff that truly want to support you and your classroom and career goals.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed attending Loyola University Chicago. It's perfect for someone who is interested in being near a large city, who appreciates small to medium class sizes, and who values the importance of integrating social justice into education. The faculty are very invested in your education and it is very common for students to build strong connections with their professors. There is also a multitude of things to be involved in ranging from student organizations, research, EMS, religious experiences, retreats, and more."
Alum,4,"I took the last two months of my senior year online. Thankfully, all of my professors were very accommodating and understanding of any hardships."
Niche User,4,"It is okay. A lot of people do not want to learn while at home, but it is a good environment as the professors care."
Alum,4,It is a great school with a beautiful campus. Everyone there is very welcoming and supportive. The class sizes are small which make it easy for you to get to know your peers and professors better. The location is great! It is in Rogers Park which is 20 min from downtown and super close to public transit.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school so much! The sense of community is there but with it being a medium-size school is it sometimes hard to find your ""people"" but that's the case at every university. During my time at Loyola, I have had wonderful professors that truly care about their student's academics and well-being. Although I've had one difficult professor I would say that my overall Loyola does it's best hiring faculty that truly cares for its students. Also, living on campus has been wonderful as the dorms are clean, well made, and are newer. I would say that I wish Loyola did not allow for triples as that experience was excruciating and terrible in my personal experience. The food also provided at the school is miserable to eat as there have been minor occurrences but these are small things that could easily be fixed by creating strict rules. Overall, I love Loyola and all that it has to offer, from being located in the wonderful city of Chicago to having a very strong community!"
Freshman,4,"Having been a student for only one year, I had a positive experience with teachers both semesters. My teachers were friendly and wanted me to succeed. They were happy to answer questions and the classes were mostly well-organized."
Graduate Student,4,I only took online courses during COVID-19. My professors accomodated quickly and were understanding. Loyola provided quite a lot of guidance when transitioning to online.
Graduate Student,4,I loved Loyola. The interdisciplinary honors program inundated me with so much knowledge and the research opportunities changed the trajectory of my college career.
Freshman,4,"Being a first-year student at Loyola can be difficult, but after immersing myself in the Loyola culture, I found that I had made the right choice in college. Get involved and make Loyola home!"
Junior,4,"The first thing is Loyola has an amazing campus right on Lake Michigan, as well as a downtown campus right in gold coast, off Michigan Ave. The teachers are top-notch for the most part with some questionable ones. I love the diversity of students, as well as the programs,  events, clubs, etc offered at Loyola. It's a smaller university so there's more teacher and student interactions. The dorms are also decent. The only thing that troubles me is the cost of attendance which In feel is both value, but at some times overpriced."
Freshman,4,"Loyola has definitely challenged me academically, some of the classes are truly insightful depending on the professor; however, some professors just cannot connect with their students. You will have good, bad, and in between classes. They have many resources for their students and the campus in beyond beautiful."
Sophomore,4,Loyola is great for networking no matter what major you are. There are tons of resources and programs to help you get your foot in the door. I would only change the prices for tuition and room and board because it is expensive.
Sophomore,4,"Loyola University of Chicago has a Lakeshore and Water Tower Campus. As an English major, I spend most of my time at Lakeshore, and it is quite beautiful, Chicago weather notwithstanding. The professors have been supportive, and there are opportunities for academic involvement outside of classes- Loyola has a lot of clubs, and I am a member of Minorities in Philosophy. My complaints lie with the food, the cost of housing, and accessibility of housing for juniors and seniors. Since Loyola does have a core, it does require those credits, so they can be contentious with academic plans. Although I am majoring with honors and two minors, so the resources for planning are quote helpful. However, Loyola could be more up front about the helpful services it does have, albeit they do exist, and college is a fairly personalized experience."
Freshman,4,Loyola has been very different compared to the other schools I visited. They have a strong focus on academics and they strive to make sure you get something out of your Jesuit education.
Freshman,4,"The city atmosphere and opportunities are phenomenal. There are required classes that prepare you to be a better all-around applicant than the competition. The Residence Life staff is always very accommodating, but residence life in general can be a struggle."
Freshman,4,"I am still fairly new to Loyola as this is my first year on campus, however I can say my experience thus far has been going well. I enjoy the atmosphere of the campus and the sense of community I have while attending here. I have been immersing myself in the student life and getting involved, but still putting time aside to make academics my priority. Loyola does a great job with inclusivity and trying to ensure each student is adjusting and handling the transition into college well."
Freshman,4,"Besides there not being so much of a diverse group of folks there, I would say most people are friendly or nice and the professors are really good too."
Freshman,4,There are is an abundance of resources and it is not very difficult to get involved and become a part of campus. It is also accessible to the city through the Red Line and CTA which encourages students to explore the city. Some things that need to be improved is the quality of food in some dining halls and the condition of certain resident halls.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Loyola University Chicago. I think the institution provides great academics, has a lot to offer in extracurriculars, and keeps you busy by being near downtown Chicago. I would highly recommend anyone interested in medicine or nursing to especially apply because they offer great programs in those fields."
Sophomore,4,I love the teachers here. The only thing is that the diversity is less than lackluster. The lack of minority faces at this university is jarring
Senior,4,"Pros: campus, location, academics and opportunities 
Cons: pretty much everything else 
If you are looking to go to a good school, with interesting people and a like minded community I would recommend you attend this establishment."
Freshman,4,Loyola is a wonderful university with a beautiful campus filled with a lot of great resources! I admire the extra steps administrators take to ensure that incoming students transition well. The academic level taught at Loyola challenges its students without discouraging them. I would highly recommend future students to attend this amazing university.
Niche User,4,"Very welcoming, the buildings are nicely situated, the food is amazing, everyone is friendly. The lakeside view ist astonishing, the whole college is well-kept, safe, and secure."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the campus and the location of Loyola. The dorms could be a lot better and the dining halls leave much to be desired.
Freshman,4,Loyola is a very good school but I won’t say excellent because it’s lacking in some areas. In my first year at Loyola I got to meet really friendly staff like from the receptions to literally anywhere you get nice smiles that can actually make your day. Loyola also has a good academic calendar. The only problem I have is the food provided in the dining’s . I’m an international student and I’m not used to the native food here and the only thing I get to eat is junk or cereal cause that is the only type of food in the dining I can manage. As a result I have to spend money ordering food when I’ve paid for a meal plan thereby doing nothing but wasting money.
Freshman,4,"it’s a good school. party wise if you want to party you’re gonna have to search but they are there, that being said you NEED a fake to have fun"
Sophomore,4,The school is overall great. I have only really bad teacher but every other professor has been great. The housing is not terrible but the meal plan is not worth amount we pay and you have two use it your first two years.
Junior,4,"I love the university. Everyone is friendly and they actually listen to your needs. Not only that but they care about their students. They are not as leniant, however, they are very understanding and I could not appreciate that more."
Freshman,4,They make you feel right at home and guide you through the process and steps necessary for new students.
Sophomore,4,"Great school with genuinely nice people! General cost of living can be a bit overpriced and there are too many core requirements, but good quality education."
Sophomore,4,Really a chance to grow the place is amazing. The professors are very understanding. They want us to grow as people.
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus!  It wasn't too big or too small.  The lady that was giving us a tour was so nice and helpful and she showed us everything!  I loved the student center.  I was perfect for when you are studying and you need a break, you can just look up and the lake is right there!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Loyola. They are so inclusive of all students, and the education is very good. The University is not only preparing me for my future career, but to be a well-rounded individual. The main issue I have is that the cost of tuition is already high, and keeps going up. There are some administrative issues that should be addressed."
Sophomore,4,"I love Loyola Chicago! I'm a sophomore and I have had such a great time so far. Not every dorm building is the nicest but there are some that are either currently being renovated or being constructed. The food is also not bad, it's not gourmet but it's good for dining hall food. The area is one of the safest neighborhoods in Chicago but it's still crucial to be aware of surrounding since it's still an urban setting. All in all, it's a great place to live!"
Niche User,4,"Loyola University Chicago is an amazing and diverse university. It is known for biology, nursing, and psychology. There is no application fee. There is always a lot going on at Loyola because it's very diverse in sports, activities and other extracurriculars. Loyola is a school for motivated and for serious about doing well in school people."
Freshman,4,The staff and professors are there to help you. They want you to succeed and they take the extra steps to make sure you do by having office hours and allowing you to ask questions when needed.
Sophomore,4,"Loyola is a beautiful campus, but transportation outside of campus is not the best. I would like to see loyola have a football team, but their basketball team is amazing!"
Niche User,4,I liked that they are very helpful thru out my journey I would change nothing I haven’t really started going there but in my process the administrators are doing everything they can to make sure things go smoothly for me
Junior,4,I believe that the professors and faculty members at Loyola University Chicago prepare students for a successful future in opening doors to a possibility of career options.
Sophomore,4,"I adore the Institute of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University Chicago.  My experience in this program has been filled with incredible professors and mentors, many efforts to improve sustainability beyond the classroom, and the feeling that you are working towards an incredibly important goal."
Freshman,4,"The University itself is just wonderful but the more effort you put into being social and putting yourself out there, the better your experience. This will be true wherever you go. This goes for any sort of social gathering, whether you’re just walking around on campus or are involved in some sort of club or student activity. In terms of facilities, halls, academic buildings, etc., it cant get any better. The facilities in the university are well maintained and not only that but students and faculty also do their best to keep it that way when they themselves are present in said facilities. Academic curriculum is wonderful. You have a variety if paths that you could pursue in order to find your passion and the academic advisors do a wonderful job supporting you and making sure you are as satisfied with your courses as you can be."
Junior,4,"I am starting this Fall (2019) and am attending their ABSN program. The program, staff, and campus seem to be wonderful. The tuition is very high and assistance with finding financial assistance is limited. The majority of students are being funded through family and staff has actively spoken about their want for students to not take out loans. This has created a confusing outlook for my feelings towards the school due to the helpless feeling I have in regards to being able to afford tuition."
Sophomore,4,"Loyola has been a great learning environment. The smaller size allows me to work closely with other peers and collaborate and learn off of each other. Though the upper leadership of the university has trouble supporting their diversity initiatives, despite the fact that their diversity department is very strong and supportive of students of color."
Junior,4,"Loyola University Chicago is a very diverse, and catholic based campus. Aside from its beautiful views, it is more than just a regular campus. One builds experiences and a family away from home.  Classmates become good friends, and professors become trusted adults. Very glad I get to experience my university years at Loyola University Chicago."
Freshman,4,"Loyola Chicago is an amazing place to be, not only for education, but for the experiences. Campus is stunning, right on Lake Michigan; students are supportive of one another and create lasting communities. The institution puts heavy emphasis on social justice and is a welcoming environment for students of all ethnicities, religions, and walks of life. Learning environments are supportive and tutors are always available. The school really strives to ensure that students know where they’re going and how to get there in the next four years.  I am glad to call this place my home and I know for a fact that many others feel the exact same way."
Alum,4,Beautiful campus and safe environment. Most teachers once you got further into your major were great. My councilor did not help me in the slightest and I had to figure out my entire senior year with her telling me I might as well just take another year.
Niche User,2,It’s just recorded lectures with powerpoints. You shouldn’t charge students so much for that type of thing.
Freshman,2,"Not worth the price of tuition and I experienced false advertisement by the school. I had a horrible experience with class registration. My emails weren’t answered and I wasn’t able to get the classes I wanted. During my tour, I was told that one of the dining halls was dedicated entirely to dietary restrictions, which was false. Loyola claims to be very vegan/vegetarian friendly. The online menus show vegan options that the dining halls didn’t actually have. I would go to bed hungry too often due to a lack of food I could eat. Loyola administration failed to inform the student body about cases of sexual assult that occurred on campus. We were informed by the presence of a news van in front of the dorms and a local news station. Only after the news aired did admin decide to send out an email. Once I decided to transfer, I emailed my advisor about it twice with no response. At a private school of this size and the price of tuition, my experience was unacceptable."
Freshman,2,"Online learning was a bit difficult.  The transition was a hard one for many students and professors. Although there was an attempt made at continuing the same level of learning as before covid - 19, it simply did not meet my expectations. The professors were inflexible. It seemed that there were no ways to really find help. There were many issues with professors, yet it was difficult to contact someone and find a resolution."
Junior,2,"Due to the pandemic the circumstances around online learning are understandable. However, online classes are not the same learning experience. Loyola will not decrease tuition which is absurd. I am homeschooling myself yet paying on-campus rates. And to cancel the 2020 graduation ceremony is very hurtful. This is the light at the end of the tunnel for years of hard work, a willingness to thrive, and to be addressed for this accomplishment in front of family and peers taken away feels like somewhat of a slap in the face. I could have pursued an online degree from the start if I wanted my college experience to be just that."
Freshman,2,"DONT COME IF YOURE AN ARTS MAJOR. The registration process is especially stupid when youre an art major and there are only 2 15-person major classes a semester. If you dont get in one of those, theyll tell you that's too bad, youre off track to graduate and SOL. Aside from the awful registration and staff, the food is absolutely horrid. The campus is nice but theres not much to do immediately around it. The CORE academics were probably my favorite aspect of my time here. Theyre very informative and interesting, and thats the only compliment I can give this school besides the campus being nice. The diversity is alright for minorities as long as youre just looking around campus and not the actual statistics. Its also extremely expensive, so if your fam made just over the threshold to be ineligible for financial aid, good luck. My time here has been miserable and was not how I wanted to spend my first year."
Freshman,2,"I came from a selective enrollment high school in the city of Chicago. Loyola has very little diversity and an awful sexual assault problem on campus. The administration doesn't report any of the crimes that happen ON CAMPUS until months later when students begin to catch wind of what's going on.

Academics are easy if you're in the humanities. If you're in pre-med, all of their core intro classes will FILL UP because people fail them the first time around, so they physically can't fill their classes anymore without it being a fire hazard. This leads to students being unable to take a class that is REQUIRED FOR THEIR MAJOR until later in the semester.

Overall, it's just not worth the ridiculously high tuition price. The financial aid office couldn't care less about their low-income students. Any inquiries on more financial aid are met with a robotic response telling you to go find some more external scholarships."
Senior,2,"I've been disappointed as Loyola has not lived up to my expectations. Teachers are decent, but it greatly depends on your major. Many business school teachers lack experience and it is so important to research your teacher before enrolling since an unclear professor can greatly hinder your grade. My biggest issue with Loyola is the rampant crime in Roger's Park and Loyola's Campus Safety not warning students. Just a few weeks ago, a man was wielding a butcher knife on Arthur (2 blocks from campus, a street almost all off-campus students live on) and as police chased the man around, campus safety sent out no email. This is constant as we find out about shootings/robberies from the news, rather than from Campus Safety. If campus safety does send out an email (about once every other month), its hours after they were notified of the robbery directly on campus. Loyola is too obsessed with their image as a ""safe school"" where no issues happen nearby instead of caring for student's safety."
Freshman,2,"Loyola was a terrible experience for me, I couldn’t last through my first year. The student life is very dry and the school in general is incredibly isolating. Academics are rigorous, as is to be expected, but that combined with a flat student life makes for a very sad experience."
Freshman,2,"Overall, Loyola Chicago is average and not worth the money. Registering for classes is very difficult, the counselors aren't helpful and its nearly impossible to get into any of the classes you want."
Sophomore,2,"The school prides itself on its name and as an academic institution. The truth is sad. The school is a shell of its former self as Jo Anne Rooney sees fit to raise tuition endlessly so nobody can afford it, all the while funnelling lots of cash into the athletics program. Do not expect to get any financial aid help unless you are a student-athlete, as they lied to my face about how ""Loyola doesn't give free rides"" when all of their athletes have free rides. Teachers are mostly underpaid adjuncts or associates who couldn't care about their classes and are severely overworked. Good like finding a single good one. The uber-expensive dorms you are forced to stay in overflow with sewage when the pipes burst because the dorms aren't equipped to the number of people being forced to live in them. Awful experience. I'm extremely disappointed with my experiance here and recommend everyone thinking of applying to Loyola go somewhere else."
Alum,2,"Overpriced. Department head wasn't great - just made a film once and so was deemed a great filmmaker. Dorms are old, hot, stuffy, and small."
Sophomore,2,"Barely any diversity whatsoever, just mainly rich white people. People are stuck up and rude. Advisors do no good, i’m better off looking on the internet for advice. The price is outrageous for the quality of education. You can barely ever get any classes you want. Really hard to make friends unless you live on campus, and people are not friendly here. Some professors are great, but others are straight up terrible. Also, the campus police don’t know how to do their job and discriminate against POC. (There are incidents you can look into and the school did not care to do a thing about it) I don’t party because I don’t get invited to them, so I can’t comment on that. The only really great thing is the beautiful campus."
Freshman,2,"The campus is beautiful. Located right beside the lake, Loyola offers a beautiful scenery whilst traveling from class to class. In addition, there is a downtown campus in the center of the city of Chicago. 
The university does need more diversity if they want to attract international students. I am an international student myself and I struggled to acclimate with the lack of diversity."
Freshman,2,"I have been at Loyola for almost two months and I have never felt more isolated. It is extremely hard to make friends, and the price to attend here is ridiculous. Tuition being on average around $30,000 after scholarships is unbelievable. Loyola may be a good name and may offer many resources, but, in my opinion, it is not worth the money."
Freshman,2,"So far, I've had a decent experience at Loyola University Chicago. Although the university is widely known to greatly prepare their pre-med students, I genuiney feel as if the professors could do a much better job in regards to teaching the rigorous material. It's a very expensive university, so I would've expected a little more especially since we'd like to think that we're ""paying"" for the best education we could receive."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a transfer, and like other transfers, I live in the Sovereign which is an off-campus apt. building. It is very isolated."
College Sophomore,2,"No greek housing, I don't really mind because i am not a fan of greek life. i am not interested in it"
College Sophomore,2,"This school doesn't have a ton of parties, but it is proximally located to other schools with more parties."
College Sophomore,2,Major's very competitive and not enough reach out
College Junior,2,"Although our men`s volleyball team are back to back champions, game turnout is never up to expectations. As for the other D1 varsity sports teams, no one cares to go watch games. My high school career revolved around sports, so to see that most people don`t care is quite saddening."
College Freshman,2,There is not really a lot of popular sororities and fraternities on campus. The ones that you are most likely interested in are from different chapters and you would have to travel from Loyola to another campus just to participate in those events.
College Junior,2,"Campus police are present, but a lot of things happen very close to campus or on campus late at night. I feel safe on campus during the day but I would be very scared going out alone at night."
College Freshman,2,Very well suported and done.
College Sophomore,2,"Directly on campus is generally safe. However, the surrounding areas are very dangerous. A student was shot and killed in 2014, and just last week a student was less than a mile from campus when she was hit with a stray bullet from a drive by. I personally have not experienced any crime, but it's definitely not a smart idea to wander around at night, in a group or not."
College Freshman,2,terrible . once waited for campus safety for a half hour for a girl who had a seizure in the middle of class
College Freshman,2,transferring out due to expectations not met
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is only decent if you're an upperclassman or you live in one of the newer dorms (De Nobli or San Fran). I lived in Mertz this year and although the room wasn't horrible (I had a view of the Lake) the elevators are! They were last inspected in 2002 which tells you a lot about where Loyola's priorities don't stand. Definitely not worth the $9,000 we spend to live in those junky pieces of crap!!"
College Freshman,2,They're very accepting of diversity but dont actually have any.
College Freshman,2,There is too much crime in the immediate vicinity of campus and not enough focus on how to remedy it.
College Sophomore,2,There's no school spirit at Loyola. Our volleyball team is number one in the country but no one attends games or cares about any sports on campus. Our student section does not do a good job of recruiting people to attend games and no one is interested.
College Freshman,2,Parties aren't very good. People generally stay away from Greek Life because it is a waste of time.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much school spirit during class week. There is no football or hockey teams. There is a lot of hype about men's basketball and volleyball but those are in the winter and spring.
College Junior,2,"Greeks don't do much for a majority of people on campus. They're also easy to spot, as they're almost all the same ethnic group, they wear the same thing, and they walk in big groups around campus. They throw parties, but for me personally, I have no interest in them. If I really wanted to go somewhere to have a good time, I'd just go to a club or concert with my friends and girlfriend. They're bigger, better, and much more sanitary. Also, some Greeks are just weird; a fraternity chapter is banned for the next 2 years because of a Facebook page involving a sex doll. If you haven't heard about it, Google it. Greek life at Loyola is a joke, and there's no real leadership or philanthropic value that's worth the sticker price to be a member (in my opinion)."
College Sophomore,2,The administration makes decisions that affects the students' lives without listening to the voice of the student body or student government. Recently that have condensed the final schedule randomly from a 1.5 week schedule to a 1 week schedule. There are many people that have conflicting exams or just an overwhelming amount exams on the same day due to this new schedule. They also do not usually listen to the student body when we bring up an initiative that we would like to take.
College Freshman,2,I am disappointed at the quality of the student body. It is hard to find motivated people. Some people treat academics heavily but they are like a fraction of the student body.
College Freshman,2,Network isn't strong. The employers look at Northwestern and U of Chicago more.
College Sophomore,2,There is no variety in the food and between halls. Everything tastes the same and everything is unhealthy. Meal plans are expensive and required.
College Freshman,2,Expect sky-high Chicago rent rates. It's cheaper to live on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Administration is VERY strict on things like drug use, drinking, and even quiet hours. Expect to be very careful in the residence halls or have fun off-campus."
College Freshman,2,It's almost nonexistent! Parties are extremely hard to find (you have to be in the right groups) and often end up busted by midnight.
College Freshman,2,"On campus the party scene is nonexistent, however, students do choose to party in their dorms on occasion. If a student is into partying then they will likely be doing so off campus."
College Junior,2,"Often got sick , or ate and then 2 hours later was hungry again."
College Junior,2,For what I am paying it is rough but at least we get a kitchen.
College Sophomore,2,There are terrible college dorm parties and the only good parties are off campus and very far away or at bars.
College Freshman,2,Not really a party scene.
College Junior,2,"There are not many options through Loyola for scholarships.  I have applied to many, but never heard/received anything."
College Freshman,2,I believe that I deserved more.
College Sophomore,2,Loyola does not really have any parties.
College Sophomore,2,I am not even sure if we have a greek life on campus
College Sophomore,2,The school does not really help in the transition to a off campus housing type living.
College Freshman,2,Honestly Greek Life is not a big deal on campus at all.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The policies regarding visitations in dorms are unacceptable. For an institution that boasts such esteem of students, no trust is instilled in them. Virtually powerless to make decisions."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very little involvement from the study body as a whole leaves few interesting perks to joining Greek Life. The lack of housing also eliminates a sense of community and bonding that traditional Greek Housing provides.
College Senior,2,"The wellness center is not considered a reliable health care center, nor is sexual assault something Loyola has taken visible steps to address and combat. It is an issue that Loyola needs to step and be openly committed to."
College Sophomore,2,"unsafe in the city, but campus tries to help"
College Sophomore,2,"good food, bad value and conveinence"
College Sophomore,2,no one cares about sports
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus housing is not worth it, the school provides many dorms for students to live in."
College Junior,2,They always ask me for the same thing every year.
College Junior,2,"Loyola does not allow for ANY type of self-expression on campus. There is no where to post events, have insightful dialogues, protest etc...This includes no where to place posters."
Freshman,1,"If you're thinking about attending Loyola University Chicago, take this opportunity to never consider Loyola again and look for better options. Based on my experiences as a freshman this past 2020/2021 schoolyear, Loyola is a joke of a university. Early in 2020 Loyola enticed students to pay their exorbitant tuition fees and enroll with the promise of an on-campus semester, yet ended up retracting the statement and moved fully online TWO WEEKS BEFORE MOVE-IN. Many students had already bought leases or flew to Chicago to begin the mandatory 2-week quarantine. Communication is abysmal. The quality of online education for the same price as normal tuition is laughable. Loyola has lost all of my trust and respect, which are qualities that I think are important for a university with a $60k+ price tag. I will hopefully be transferring, and I encourage any potential future students to save yourself the hassle by crossing Loyola off your college application list. Run and never look back."
Freshman,1,"100% of classes were online, despite many previous promises from Loyola for an on-campus hybrid semester. Most of my professors tried their hardest to accommodate online learning, but it was impossible to achieve the same quality of education as in-person learning, especially considering the tuition price is the exact same. A few professors were not very professional in an online setting, wearing raggedy t-shirts and allowing excessive background noise to distract in Zoom lectures; overall just taking advantage of being at home by acting in a way that would not be acceptable at all in a real classroom, despite their paycheck (which is paid for by us students) remaining the same. But at the same time, many other professors were engaging and did the best they could in the circumstances."
Niche User,1,"The student health services are deplorable. This school is financially predatory and hits you with huge bills they didn’t tell you about. The professors are pretentious and unhelpful. Oh, and if you’re a member of the LGBT community, expect to be silenced. The deans literally told me “you’re not a good fit for this school.”"
Alum,1,"The student life is very good but in terms of getting my classes and getting help from professors when I need it, many of my professors weren't friendly."
Junior,1,Although most professors became flexible to the circumstances there was a great gap on knowing how to use the technology effectively. I am hopeful fall classes will be on campus so that I do not have to go through the experience of online classes again.
Freshman,1,"Appearance wise Loyola seems like an amazing university. However, they are stealing your money. The hassle of registering for classes is the worst experience I've had. Both first and second semester I did not get ANY of the classes I needed to take in order to go to my major. The advisors are also not helpful whatsoever! They screw you over and do not look out for your future well being, they just want your money. They also spread lies while selling their school. During orientation and the tour I went on they talked about how many easy commodities they had. The commodities they speak of either don't exist or are anything but easy and convenient. The food is trash, the price is ridiculously expensive, and the university overall is not worth your money!!"
Alum,1,"it was impersonal, and disturbing. Not a good environment, and the teachers not good. I think they don't pay their teachers well enough to really get good ones. The other employees are also underpaid, and their is a lot of waste. So much money with not much value given in return. Avoid."
Graduate Student,1,"If you are looking to apply to Computer Science major in Loyola, then I believe you should look for other places. The Computer Science here is a joke, they will give you easy A's for most classes, while it will not prepare you for the harshness in the job market. Especially Professor Peter Dordal and Professor Yacobellis, while they both have great degrees, I believe they are not suited as a professor and should be audited thoroughly. Even though I got a perfect GPA, overall Loyola University Chicago has not prepared me to enter the real market. If you enroll here, you will need a lot of self study to better prepare you."
Freshman,1,"In short, this is the absolute worst school I have ever attended. When I submitted my deposit after touring last year, I thought this would be the best experience of my life. But, as it turns out, my time there would be horrible. Loyola University Chicago, while somewhat prestigious, is an actual nightmare. Don't bother trying to find the right dorm for you, because they will stuff you into a closet designed for two with three people. This school does NOT care about your success. They only care about reaping you of your hard-earned money and turning you out in 4 years. Not to mention the food, which is usually undercooked and cold. Now, I am usually not the person to write a review on anything, but I thought I should at least try to warn some people. If you were like me, graduating a 4.0+ with other offers in high school, stay away from this place. I have since transferred and my life is 100% better than it was while being at Loyola."
College Freshman,1,"very uptight,boring, and challenging yet beneficial."
College Sophomore,1,"HAHAHAHA, Loyola athletics? The administration tries to make it important, but most students just don't care for it that much"
College Freshman,1,Parties are not really a thing unless you live off-campus or are willing to pay $10-$20 to enjoy a 5hr party. Really not worth it if you ask me.
College Freshman,1,"You better find some friends that have an off-campus apartment if you want to go to a kickback. If you know the black students, then there are Kappa parties that you have to pay for & they're on the Southside of Chicago-- not worth the investment if you ask me. I come from a very diverse place and I'm also partially caribbean so I like to hear Reggae, Calypso, & Soca, but the students here either play trap & twerking music all day long or some really soothing music. It's a party NOT a sleepover."
College Freshman,1,"I never wanted to be a greek, but if I did I would've went to an HBCU (Historically Black College) to be part of the Divine Nine sororities. Loyola has your basic sororities and little to no frats. The girls look like ""Susie homemakers"" and they don't even have separate housing for them. I don't think they're getting the real sorority feel. Also there aren't any Divine Nines on campus, so black people seeking to be Deltas and AKAs or Kappa Gamma Rhos this is not the place for you."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no diversity and everything is run by greek life. If you are not part of the greek system, you have to go through a lot of red tape to get leadership positions in non-greek co-curricular clubs."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I understand that we are a Jesuit campus and hold ourselves to higher standards, but the administration is quick to pass negative judgment among those who enjoy having a drink on the weekend or playing their music over 50 decibels. The student handbook is black and white, so if you're caught breaking a residence hall rule you can expect the maximum sanction-able punishment."
College Freshman,1,"Well I went into Psychology and I had a professor who decided that it was impossible that in her class of 130 students there might be some disabled students who take offense to her glossing over the institutional abuse of disabled people but spent an entire day talking about how spanking induces learned helplessness in children. I'm not opposed to the latter, but she including incorrect information about specific disorders in the lectures and in class and when confronted she said she knew the information was incorrect and she included it because she still wanted the class to know it. 

There was no disclaimer that this incorrect information was wrong, it was just there. She essentially told me that she doesn't care."
College Freshman,1,"I don't know of any parties, people go off campus"
College Sophomore,1,My experience with financial aid has been the worse. It is hard for me to keep up with payments.
Recent Alumnus,1,The cost of living is absolutely outrageous. Having to share one small bedroom with two other roommates for the price that I charged is unacceptable! The guest policies enforced in some dorms are discriminatory and harsh.
College Sophomore,1,When asking for off campus housing it is very difficult for them to accept the fact that you won't be giving them that amount of money and they make the whole process more difficult than it should be.
College Junior,1,not helpful on campus- it's frustrating
College Freshman,1,NOTHING TO DO UNLESS YOU ARE IN GREEK LIFE
College Freshman,1,The nightlife on campus is really bad! My group of friends always goes off campus for something to do on the weekends.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office is an absolute headache! I am in the middle of my spring semester and they are stilling figuring out my financial aid package due to the fact they keep taking money away that they guaranteed me. This is something that really needs to be handled!
College Freshman,1,I haven't had a great experience here. The academics are focused mainly on the sciences and everything else gets second pick. My courses have felt like sophomore year high school classes at most.
College Freshman,1,"The weather here is terrible. It is so cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The spring and fall weather can be anywhere from 10 degrees to 80 degrees. Not to mention, any type of precipitation is always unpredictable."
College Freshman,1,It is the worst in the winter because of the lake so nearby.
College Freshman,1,It is mostly girls and mostly rich people
College Freshman,1,No one cares about sports! no one attends any events. its sad. 
College Freshman,1,"The theatre program here is really not that great. It's very small. If you are looking for an overall education in theatre, this would be a good place for you. However, if you know what concentration in theatre you want, don't come here. Loyola does have some internships that is can offer it students in the theatre program. The English program, on the other hand, is a complete joke and there are very limited internships."
College Freshman,1,"I have not found the academics here to be challenging at all. In fact the professors do not seem to challenge us at all. We are receiving basic level information that will allow us to get by in the future, but it does not inspire major discussion or lead to any great realization. The core here is terrible and far too involved. The English program here in an absolute joke."
College Freshman,1,"The weather is terrible.It's so cold most of the school year; it's actually really depressing. If you like the sun and warm weather, i don't suggest going to LUC"
College Freshman,1,"Drug scene is pretty generic. Many people smoke and drink. Pot is pretty big here. But again, there are a ton of people who are straight-edge and chose not to drink/smoke. No one will peer pressure you into doing anything you don't want to. It's very hard to find alcohol on campus. Loyola's policies concerning drugs and alcohol are super strict. It's simply just not worth it doing it on campus or within the dorms. It's very unreasonable and the school is looking to make money off your mistakes. Be very very careful."
College Freshman,1,"Seems like a lot of people smoke weed and drink. Because parties get busted, a lot of people just drink in the dorms which creates a lot of peer pressure."
College Freshman,1,"Only nightlife exists if you're 21+ or have a fake id.  Other than that expect absolutely nothing out of this school.  ""House"" parties are terrible and usually consist of a few people sitting around."
College Freshman,1,"I believe that Loyola is extremely strict but only to keep us safe. For example the rule involving two days prior to having guests over they must be checked in and have a filled out form signed. I think that it's rather annoying when say for example a friend surprised you and they have no where to stay. The rules, however, are pretty straight forward. If you drink and get caught you get in trouble. They don't vary much from other schools."
College Freshman,1,"Terrible. I applied to Loyola late, around April, so I missed the deadline for consideration for merit scholarships. After doing some research, I found I would have qualified automatically for the top award. I talked to a financial aid advisor before committing to Loyola and she told me I could be awarded this scholarship my second semester or second year at Loyola. This was one of the contributing reasons I came to Loyola. However, after coming here I have been informed I will never be able to receive any money from the financial aid office, and now I may have to transfer because I cannot afford the tuition, which they are even increasing for next year. Terrible experience."
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife at Loyola is almost nonexistent. If you know any upperclassmen you are sometimes able to participate in ""Sessions"" the students have in their apartments, but never parties. Students often go off campus to party at other Chicago Universities such as UIC, but that doesn't always work out either unless you have connections. 
Bottom line- unless you have a fake ID or have connections, you probably won't be doing much. People aren't very social in the residence halls either and keep to themselves."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is way too strict on drug and alcohol abuse. It is as if they are trying to make money off of students mistakes. Don't try anything in the dorms, and be wary of how you act on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Loyola has only gotten into Greek life in the past two years.  It is very simple to get into Fraternities and Sororities so everyone gets in, basically.  However, Greek life at Loyola is completely different than what one would expect.  Loyola does not have any Greek houses and do not throw parties.  I really like this aspect about the Loyola Greek life because they are truly in it to help others out.  They focus more on raising money or volunteering for the less fortunate which is rare for a college Greek town to focus on."
College Junior,1,"The Greek life is lacking at Loyola.  It is not a huge part of Loyola's culture, but if you're interested in it, they're available.  Their parties usually get busted though."
College Sophomore,1,"Loyola is very strict! Freshmen overnight guest policies are outrageous, so plan way in advance when you want a friend to come up and visit. There is ZERO tolerance for underage drinking, Fake IDs, drug usage, torrenting, breaking quiet hours, or failing to comply with authority (you are not allowed to Claim the 5th or you will be fined - speaking from experience). RAs love to write students up for small infractions; then you have to deal with the student Conduct Office. They have a very old-school punishment mentality and it's not uncommon for a student caught with alcohol to face 45 hours of community service and fines over $100. They recently revised the handbook to increase fines even more! Students either learn very quickly how NOT to get caught, or get in serious trouble fast. Campus police love to issue tickets to student and force hospitalizations. Rule of thumb: Chicago police will always protect you and look into your best interest, Campus police will not! "
College Freshman,1,"Loyola doesn't have a popin party scene. Students try to get things organized and throw down in a close by apartment, but campus police are quick to spot and seize such activity. one of the only Bars close to campus (Hamilton's) CPs are posted outside and try to catch students using fake IDs and partying in the apartments above the bar. If u come to Loyola, don't expect to have a vibrant party life."
College Student,1,"I hate parking here its hard, complicated annoying. They need to build like a huge garage or something!"
College Freshman,1,Isn't a Big Deal – There aren't any houses for them and they really aren't where parties are held.
College Freshman,1,"Some of the RAs on campus are very strict especially when it comes to underage drinking and noise. The punishments are also severe both both if an RA catches you and reports you for underage drinking. It usually involves lots of community service and a fine. Aside from those two, you can be fined for many things when living in the dorms such as vandalized bulletin boards, broken furniture, and messy lounges."
College Senior,1,"Not really sure why so many reviews on here give Loyola an ""A"" for diversity. Statistically speaking, Loyola is not very diverse. The majority of students here are middle-class, white, females who walk around in North Face jackets and Ugg Boots. The largest minority  groups I've noticed on campus are Muslims and Asians. If you actually venture away from campus, you will walk into one of the most diverse communities in the nation. It's just that not many students do."
College Senior,1,"Expensive but Cheap – When I transferred to Loyola, I was told I had to live in student housing. So I moved into Holy Cross (mostly sophomores) as a junior. Everything in my ""apartment"" was broken. I was so glad when I moved just two blocks South. My apartment is bigger, nicer, and unbelievably cheaper."
College Sophomore,1,If you want a school big on sports and school pride...don't come here. There is no football team which is a massive blow even though I hate football personally...it is necessary for a university to have
College Freshman,1,"Dining Halls – The dining hall food is pretty bad. Most of the dishes optional are tasteless carbs, or flat out gross looking. The only thing I eat from the dining hall would be lots of sandwiches, soup, and cereal. Breakfast, however, is the only decent meal when there is a good array of choices. There are two main dining halls on campus, with a separate dining place that has the best food on campus, but takes actual money and not your meal plan. Everything at the market is highly overpriced, and flex dollars go quick from the lack of good food with the use of your meal plan."
College Freshman,1,Residence Life – Loyola has a policy of guest check ins which can be good for security purposes but at the same time seriously inconvenient for the student as you are required to be with a guest at all times and be with them at the time of check in and check out.
College Freshman,1,"Awful Dining Options – The is no variety in food choices at Loyola. More often than not my lunch is a grilled cheese or the chicken that is sometimes clearly from the night before. As far as fruit, apples and bananas are the only ones available. As far as vegetables, there is a disappointing salad bar and peas at dinner from time to time. Cereal is stale most of the time. There is no juice, just cranberry juice cocktail. Worse than normal college dining halls."
College Senior,1,"Rogers Park isn't an excellent area, there is a lot of crime around. The Loyola campus is safe, well-lit, lots of those ""phone booths"" to signal for an emergency but outside of the campus gates it's not the best. I never use my cellphone on the sidewalk because there are a lot of smartphone robberies. There was recently an incident where a girl was pulled into the alley by two offenders who were luckily spooked by a passerby. People are frequently confronted by muggers at night and although they usually rob the victim and leave, there have been a few assaults."
College Sophomore,1,"Not the Cheapest – One can definitely find housing off-campus, however be prepared to pay a pretty penny. Because of this, I decided to become a commuter student, traveling an hour and twenty minutes minimum via train. Driving was eliminated as an option because parking is expensive around campus. The train is the most viable option for those who refuse to pay a ridiculous amount on rent and parking."
College Sophomore,1,Mostly white girls.  More boys of all shades are needed.  There are many options for those of religions other than catholocism.  It's not pressed on you at all.
College Freshman,1,They are redoing their right now there definately is nothing affordable or even healthy
College Freshman,1,"Student Life. The total cost for living here is a little expsensive. I think , the no application fee's and waviers was more than fair because housing is little to much, especailly for the student who wants to start in spring."
College Junior,1,"The Greek system is crushed by the school. Most of the kids are quite strange and out of the 4 frats and 4 sororities, 1 frat is banned and all of the others are on permanent probation. Chicago statute prohibits housing so its just a string of apartments."
College Freshman,1,"Not Worth It – Parking is really expensive unless you live really close by and want to commute, then it's worth it. Most people, though, don't commute. It's not worth it to bring your car if you're not less than half an hour away. You get a U-Pass to ride the CTA for free or you walk. It's too expensive and scary to drive in Chicago."
